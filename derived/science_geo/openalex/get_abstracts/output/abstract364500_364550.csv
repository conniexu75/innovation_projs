https://openalex.org/W2083932518,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapeutic option for intractable neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease and major depression. Because of the heterogeneity of brain tissues where electrodes are placed, it has been challenging to elucidate the relevant target cell types or underlying mechanisms of DBS. We used optogenetics and solid-state optics to systematically drive or inhibit an array of distinct circuit elements in freely moving parkinsonian rodents and found that therapeutic effects within the subthalamic nucleus can be accounted for by direct selective stimulation of afferent axons projecting to this region. In addition to providing insight into DBS mechanisms, these results demonstrate an optical approach for dissection of disease circuitry and define the technological toolbox needed for systematic deconstruction of disease circuits by selectively controlling individual components."

This link is in part forged by the protein deacetylase SIRT1, which regulates the clock's molecular circuitry. SIRT1 uses as a cofactor the cellular metabolite NAD + , which is synthesized through a salvage pathway that includes the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) (see the Perspective by Wijnen ). Ramsey et al. (p. 651 ; published online 19 March) and Nakahata et al. (p. 654 , published online 12 March) now show that NAMPT and NAD + levels oscillate during the daily 24-hour cycle and that this oscillation is regulated by the circadian clock. Furthermore, the oscillations in NAD + modulate the activity of SIRT1 feeding back into the circadian clock."

We have developed a copper-catalyzed arylation reaction that, in contrast, selectively substitutes phenyl electrophiles at the aromatic carbon-hydrogen sites meta to an amido substituent. This previously elusive class of transformation is applicable to a broad range of aromatic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1976256007,"Ammunition for the TB Wars Tuberculosis is a major human disease of global importance resulting from infection with the air-borne pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which is becoming increasingly resistant to all available drugs. An antituberculosis benzothiazinone compound kills mycobacterium in infected cells and in mice. Makarov et al. (p. 801 ) have identified a sulfur atom and nitro residues important for benzothiazinone's activity and used genetic methods and biochemical analysis to identify its target in blocking arabinogalactan biosynthesis during cell-wall synthesis. The compound affects the same pathway as ethambutol, and thus a benzothiazinone drug has the potential to become an important part of treatment of drug-resistant disease and, possibly, replace the less effective ethambutol in the primary treatment of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014677332,"Improved electrically powered artificial muscles are needed for generating force, moving objects, and accomplishing work. Carbon nanotube aerogel sheets are the sole component of new artificial muscles that provide giant elongations and elongation rates of 220% and (3.7 x 10(4))% per second, respectively, at operating temperatures from 80 to 1900 kelvin. These solid-state-fabricated sheets are enthalpic rubbers having gaslike density and specific strength in one direction higher than those of steel plate. Actuation decreases nanotube aerogel density and can be permanently frozen for such device applications as transparent electrodes. Poisson's ratios reach 15, a factor of 30 higher than for conventional rubbers. These giant Poisson's ratios explain the observed opposite sign of width and length actuation and result in rare properties: negative linear compressibility and stretch densification."
https://openalex.org/W2155913555,"The flow of energy through the solar atmosphere and the heating of the Sun's outer regions are still not understood. Here, we report the detection of oscillatory phenomena associated with a large bright-point group that is 430,000 square kilometers in area and located near the solar disk center. Wavelet analysis reveals full-width half-maximum oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700 seconds originating above the bright point and significance levels exceeding 99%. These oscillations, 2.6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with chromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23 kilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and transversal displacements rules out the presence of magneto-acoustic wave modes. The oscillations are a signature of Alfvén waves produced by a torsional twist of ±22 degrees. A phase shift of 180 degrees across the diameter of the bright point suggests that these torsional Alfvén oscillations are induced globally throughout the entire brightening. The energy flux associated with this wave mode is sufficient to heat the solar corona."
https://openalex.org/W2163065611,"The interface between antibody and antigen is often depicted as a lock and key, suggesting that an antibody surface can accommodate only one antigen. Here, we describe an antibody with an antigen binding site that binds two distinct proteins with high affinity. We isolated a variant of Herceptin, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that binds the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), on the basis of its ability to simultaneously interact with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Crystallographic and mutagenesis studies revealed that distinct amino acids of this antibody, called bH1, engage HER2 and VEGF energetically, but there is extensive overlap between the antibody surface areas contacting the two antigens. An affinity-improved version of bH1 inhibits both HER2- and VEGF-mediated cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in mouse models. Such “two-in-one” antibodies challenge the monoclonal antibody paradigm of one binding site, one antigen. They could also provide new opportunities for antibody-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1975914042,"Dopamine replacement therapy is useful for treating motor symptoms in the early phase of Parkinson's disease, but it is less effective in the long term. Electrical deep-brain stimulation is a valuable complement to pharmacological treatment but involves a highly invasive surgical procedure. We found that epidural electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns in the spinal cord restores locomotion in both acute pharmacologically induced dopamine-depleted mice and in chronic 6-hydroxydopamine–lesioned rats. The functional recovery was paralleled by a disruption of aberrant low-frequency synchronous corticostriatal oscillations, leading to the emergence of neuronal activity patterns that resemble the state normally preceding spontaneous initiation of locomotion. We propose that dorsal column stimulation might become an efficient and less invasive alternative for treatment of Parkinson's disease in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1983924380,"The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression. The development of clinically useful inhibitors, however, is complicated by the role of the gamma-secretase complex in regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and other essential proteins. Different gamma-secretase complexes containing different Presenilin or Aph1 protein subunits are present in various tissues. Here we show that these complexes have heterogeneous biochemical and physiological properties. Specific inactivation of the Aph1B gamma-secretase in a mouse Alzheimer's disease model led to improvements of Alzheimer's disease-relevant phenotypic features without any Notch-related side effects. The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2050298923,"The body-centered cubic A15-structured cesium fulleride Cs 3 C 60 is not superconducting at ambient pressure and is free from disorder, unlike the well-studied face-centered cubic A 3 C 60 alkali metal fulleride superconductors. We found that in Cs 3 C 60 , where the molecular valences are precisely assigned, the superconducting state at 38 kelvin emerges directly from a localized electron antiferromagnetic insulating state with the application of pressure. This transition maintains the threefold degeneracy of the active orbitals in both competing electronic states; it is thus a purely electronic transition to a superconducting state, with a dependence of the transition temperature on pressure-induced changes of anion packing density that is not explicable by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory."
https://openalex.org/W2011437516,"Rheb G-protein plays critical roles in the TSC/Rheb/mTOR signaling pathway by activating mTORC1. The activation of mTORC1 by Rheb can be faithfully reproduced in vitro by using mTORC1 immunoprecipitated by the use of anti-raptor antibody from mammalian cells starved for nutrients. The low in vitro kinase activity against 4E-BP1 of this mTORC1 preparation is dramatically increased by the addition of recombinant Rheb. On the other hand, the addition of Rheb does not activate mTORC2 immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells by the use of anti-rictor antibody. The activation of mTORC1 is specific to Rheb, because other G-proteins such as KRas, RalA/B, and Cdc42 did not activate mTORC1. Both Rheb1 and Rheb2 activate mTORC1. In addition, the activation is dependent on the presence of bound GTP. We also find that the effector domain of Rheb is required for the mTORC1 activation. FKBP38, a recently proposed mediator of Rheb action, appears not to be involved in the Rheb-dependent activation of mTORC1 in vitro, because the preparation of mTORC1 that is devoid of FKBP38 is still activated by Rheb. The addition of Rheb results in a significant increase of binding of the substrate protein 4E-BP1 to mTORC1. PRAS40, a TOR signaling (TOS) motif-containing protein that competes with the binding of 4EBP1 to mTORC1, inhibits Rheb-induced activation of mTORC1. A preparation of mTORC1 that is devoid of raptor is not activated by Rheb. Rheb does not induce autophosphorylation of mTOR. These results suggest that Rheb induces alteration in the binding of 4E-BP1 with mTORC1 to regulate mTORC1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2058381061,"FoxO1 represents a central regulator of metabolism in several cell types. Although FoxO1 is abundant in adipocytes, its biological functions in these cells remain largely unknown. We show here that the promotor region of the rate-limiting lipolytic enzyme, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), has two FoxO1-binding sites, and co-transfection with wild type and unphosphorylated FoxO1 mutant activates the expression of luciferase driven by the ATGL promotor. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin controls nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1 and regulates its interaction with endogenous ATGL promotors. Knockdown of FoxO1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreases the expression of ATGL and attenuates basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. Infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with FoxO1-encoding lentivirus increases ATGL expression and renders it sensitive to regulation by insulin. Thus, FoxO1 may play an important role in the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes by controlling the expression of ATGL. FoxO1 represents a central regulator of metabolism in several cell types.

Thus, FoxO1 may play an important role in the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes by controlling the expression of ATGL. One of the key physiological functions of insulin in the mammalian organism is to inhibit lipolysis and to promote accumulation and storage of triglycerides in fat tissue. Control of lipolysis plays an important role in energy partitioning and balance and maintains the size of fat depots in the body. In patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, insulin cannot suppress high levels of free fatty acids (FFA) 2The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acids; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; CEBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Ins, insulin. in the bloodstream (1Fraze E.

As a result, FFA are accumulated in the form of lipids in non-adipose peripheral tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle, aggravating insulin resistance and causing multiple hazardous metabolic effects (2Stumvoll M.

In addition, excess of FFA may lead to overproduction of VLDL in the liver and predispose the organism to cardiovascular disease. The complete hydrolysis of triglycerides to glycerol and FFA is performed jointly by tri-, di-, and monoacylglyceride lipases (4Zechner R. Kienesberger P.C. Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Lass A. J.

The major diacylglyceride lipase in adipocytes is hormone-sensitive lipase, or HSL (5Duncan R.E. Ahmadian M. Jaworski K. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Sul H.S. Annu. Rev.

Ahmadian M. Jaworski K. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Sul H.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 79-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In parallel, insulin may suppress lipolysis in a cAMP-independent fashion by stimulating protein phosphatase 1 and by promoting re-esterification of fatty acids (reviewed in Ref. 5Duncan R.E. Ahmadian M. Jaworski K. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Sul H.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 79-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that insulin decreases the expression of ATGL at the level of transcription (18Kralisch S. Klein J. Lossner U. Bluher M. Paschke R. Stumvoll M. Fasshauer M. Mol. Cell.

Although it has been recently shown that transcription of ATGL is regulated by PPARγ (20Kim J.Y. Tillison K. Lee J.H. Rearick D.A. Smas C.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Here, we decided to explore the role of the insulin-responsive transcription factor, FoxO1, in the regulation of ATGL expression and lipolysis. FoxO1 represents a central regulator of metabolism in several cell types and tissues (22Accili D. Arden K.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 23Gross D.N. van den Heuvel A.P. Birnbaum M.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2320-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Its activity is negatively regulated by insulin and growth factors via Akt-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (24Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Although FoxO1 is abundant in adipocytes, its biological functions in these cells remain largely unknown. We are showing here that insulin controls the expression of the rate-limiting lipolytic enzyme, ATGL, via FoxO1. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against ATGL and aP2 were kind gifts of Dr. A. Greenberg (Tufts University) and Dr. S. Farmer (Boston University School of Medicine). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin was described previously (25Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-FoxO1, anti-4E-BP, anti-PPARγ, and CEBPα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-V5 tag antibody and monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against RNA polymerase II was from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured, differentiated, and maintained as described previously (25Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MEFs were infected with pLenti-m1-V5-FoxO1 according to the Invitrogen protocol. Selection of cells was performed with blasticidin (10 μg/ml) for 7–10 days, and pooled clones were used for further experiments. Cell Fractionation—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of 500 ng of total RNA was performed using random decamers (RETROscript kit; Ambion, Austin, TX), and ATGL mRNA was determined by quantitative PCR with the help of the MX4000 multiplex qPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Reactions were performed in triplicate in the total volume of 25 μl containing 2.5 μl of 1:10 diluted cDNA, 1× SYBR green master mix (Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR master mix; Stratagene), and gene-specific primers (for ATGL, 5′-AACACCAGCATCCAGTTCAA-3′ and 5′-GGTTCAGTAGGCCATTCCTC-3′; for 36B4, 5′-TCATCCAGCAGGTGTTTGACA-3′ and 5′-GGCACCGAGGCAACAGTT-3′). ATGL expression was normalized by 36B4 expression by the ΔΔCt method. Deoxyribonuclease-treated samples and no-template controls were analyzed in parallel experiments to confirm specificity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP studies were carried out in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using the EZ-chIP kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, proteins were cross-linked to DNA with 18.5% formaldehyde, lysed, and sonicated seven times for 15 s. FoxO1 proteins were then immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted and treated with proteinase K. Purified DNA was subjected to PCR using the following primers: 5′-ATCTTTAAAAGGCAATTAAGCTG-3′ and 5′-TAAGTCCAGGTCTTAGAAATGT-3′ to amplify the region between –1004 and –1225 nucleotides of the ATGL promotor. Purified DNA was also analyzed by quantitative PCR using SYBR green reaction (Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR master mix; Stratagene) with the following primers: 5′-AGGTTTCTAGTTTAGGATTGAAG-3′ and 5′-ACCTGAGCAGTAGTTATATACAT-3′ (–1041 to –1158 nucleotides of the ATGL promotor). For all PCR reactions, 10% input was analyzed along with immunoprecipitated samples. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, ∼80% confluent 293T cells and ∼50% confluent MEFs were transfected in triplicates with 500 ng of luciferase and 100 ng of eGFP cDNA in a 6-well plate format. After 48 h, cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined in whole cell lysates using the Promega luciferase assay kit and expressed as relative light units. The expression of eGFP was measured fluorometrically. Firefly luciferase was normalized by eGFP fluorescence to correct for transfection efficiency. Knockdown of FoxO1 with siRNA—siRNA against the sequences 5′-GAAGACACCTTTACAAGTG-3′ (si 1) and 5′-TGTAATGATGGGCCCTAAT-3′ (si 2) for mouse FoxO1 (26Kim M.S. Pak Y.K. Jang P.G. Namkoong C. Choi Y.S.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and scrambled sequences were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Transfection of siRNAs was performed with the help of the DeliverX Plus delivery kit (Panomics) for 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Immunofluorescence—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 6) were lifted up by incubation with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C, reseeded onto Nunc Lab-Tek II 4-well chamber slides, and used for staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with PBS with 5% donkey serum and 5% bovine serum albumin, and stained with primary anti-FoxO1 antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Each incubation with antibody lasted for 60 min at room temperature and was followed by six quick washes with PBS. VECTASHIELD with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for mounting cells on slides that were then examined by fluorescence microscopy using Olympus IX70. Pictures were taken with the help of the Image-Pro 4.5 program. Lipolysis Assay—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in DMEM with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or in the absence of 10 μm isoproterenol. Glycerol content in the media was measured colorimetrically at 540 nm using the triglyceride (glycerol phosphate oxidase) reagent set (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI) against a set of glycerol standards. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer, and the protein concentration was determined and used to normalize glycerol release. All the experiments were carried out in triplicates. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 for 2 h. The blots were probed overnight with specific primary antibodies at 4 °C and 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) at room temperature and detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Kodak image station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co.). Statistics—Student's paired two-tailed t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. Incubation of 3T3-L1 cells with insulin for 16 h decreases the rate of basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in these cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). On the contrary, removal of serum from the incubation media for the same period of time increases lipolysis (supplemental Fig. 1B). The effect of isoproterenol on lipolysis in adipocytes that have been serum-starved for 16 h is undetectable (not shown). In accord with these results, we have found that insulin administration decreases the expression of the rate-limiting lipolytic enzyme, ATGL, at the level of both mRNA (supplemental Fig. 1C) and protein (supplemental Fig. 1D), whereas serum starvation has the opposite effect (supplemental Fig. 1, E and F) (see also Refs. 18Kralisch S.

Metab. 2006; 291: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin completely reverses insulin action on ATGL expression and lipolysis (supplemental Fig. 1, A and D), we have suggested that ATGL could be a target of FoxO1, which represents the most abundant FoxO isoform in adipocytes (27Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and is regulated by insulin via the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway (28Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11198-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ∼3-kb 5′-promotor region of mouse ATGL using Genomatix software demonstrates the presence of at least two FoxO1-binding sites (supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, the expression of FoxO1 in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes reaches the maximum on day 3 of differentiation (Fig. 1A) (see also Ref. 27Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) simultaneously with the induction of ATGL (Fig. 1A). To determine whether or not FoxO1 can regulate the expression of ATGL mRNA, we co-transfected 293T cells with the luciferase reporter construct containing the ATGL promoter (20Kim J.Y. Tillison K. Lee J.H. Rearick D.A. Smas C.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) together with FoxO1 cDNA. As is shown in Fig. 1B, wild-type FoxO1 significantly increases the expression of luciferase (ca. 6-fold), and constitutively active unphosphorylated FoxO1 mutant (AAA) demonstrates even higher activity (ca. 10-fold). This effect has been further confirmed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (not shown). Insulin regulates functional activity of FoxO1 in several cell types by controlling its nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution (28Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11198-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is yet unknown, however, whether or not this mechanism is active in adipose cells. Using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1C) and subcellular fractionation (Fig. 1D), we have found that serum withdrawal leads to accumulation of endogenous FoxO1 in the nucleus, whereas insulin administration causes cytoplasmic retention of FoxO1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In parallel, we have determined, with the help of the ChIP assay, that serum withdrawal increases, whereas insulin administration decreases association of endogenous FoxO1 with endogenous ATGL promotors (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, the effect of insulin on the expression of ATGL (supplemental Fig. 1) (18Kralisch S. Klein J. Lossner U. Bluher M. Paschke R. Stumvoll M. Fasshauer M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 240: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Kershaw E.E. Hamm J.K. Verhagen L.A. Peroni O. Katic M. Flier J.S.

Metab. 2006; 291: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of FoxO1 functions. To confirm the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of ATGL expression, we have partially knocked down FoxO1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the help of two different siRNAs. As is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, a dose-dependent decrease of FoxO1 expression by siRNAs causes a corresponding decrease in the expression of ATGL. Note that knockdown of FoxO1 also decreases the expression of 4E-BP (Fig. 2C). Because 4E-BP is a known target of FoxO1 (29Puig O. Marr M.T. Ruhf M.L. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2006-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 30Southgate R.J. Neill B. Prelovsek O. El-Osta A. Kamei Y. Miura S. Ezaki O. McLoughlin T.J. Zhang W. Unterman T.G. Febbraio M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21176-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we use this effect as a positive control for siRNA action. Interfering with FoxO1 functions in preadipocytes has been shown to affect adipocyte differentiation (27Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FoxO1 in differentiated cells does not change the expression of PPARγ, CEBPα, and other markers of differentiation (Fig. 2C). Thus, although PPARγ is known to regulate the expression of ATGL (20Kim J.Y. Tillison K. Lee J.H. Rearick D.A. Smas C.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Kershaw E.E. Schupp M. Guan H.P. Gardner N.P. Lazar M.A. Flier J.S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: 1736-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the effect of FoxO1 knockdown apparently takes place in a PPARγ-independent fashion. As expected, FoxO1-mediated decrease in the expression of ATGL attenuates the rate of lipolysis in adipocytes (Fig. 2D). Note that this effect does not involve other lipolytic components, such as HSL, perilipin, and aP2, levels of which do not markedly change upon knockdown of FoxO1 (Fig. 2C). We conclude, therefore, that FoxO1 controls lipolysis in adipocytes by regulating the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme, ATGL. To determine how essential the FoxO1-mediated pathway is for the insulin regulation of ATGL expression, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts where the expression of FoxO1 is low and, in fact, virtually undetectable (Fig. 3A). Unlike the situation in adipocytes, neither insulin nor serum withdrawal regulates ATGL expression in these cells (Fig. 3A). Stable overexpression of FoxO1 with the help of the lentiviral vector increased ATGL expression in MEFs (Fig. 3B). Moreover, in FoxO1-expressing MEFs, we observed a clear inhibitory effect of insulin on ATGL expression, whereas withdrawal of serum increased the expression of ATGL (Fig. 3B). Thus, FoxO1 is largely responsible for the effect of insulin on ATGL expression. Experiments in vivo (9Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) and in vitro (19Kershaw E.E. Hamm J.K. Verhagen L.A. Peroni O. Katic M. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the rate of lipolysis in adipocytes and other cells depends on the levels of ATGL expression. As insulin inhibits the expression of ATGL at the level of transcription (19Kershaw E.E. Hamm J.K. Verhagen L.A. Peroni O. Katic M. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 20Kim J.Y. Tillison K. Lee J.H. Rearick D.A. Smas C.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), this phenomenon may help to explain the inhibitory action of insulin on lipolysis as well as its opposing effect on lipid storage. However, the mechanism of insulin action on transcription of ATGL has not been understood. We show here that the expression of ATGL is directly regulated by FoxO1 and that insulin inhibits the expression of ATGL in adipocytes by restraining the nuclear localization of FoxO1. As up-regulation of ATGL results in the depletion of lipid stores (31Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), 3P. Chakrabarti and K. V. Kandror, unpublished results. we believe that our results are consistent with the earlier report by Nakae et al. (27Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), who have demonstrated that FoxO1 inhibits fat accumulation in differentiating adipocytes. The regulatory connection between FoxO and lipolysis is conserved in evolution. Thus, in Caenorhabditis elegans, the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 increases the expression of triglyceride lipase K04A8.5 (32Wang M.C. O'Rourke E.J. Ruvkun G. Science. 2008; 322: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and, in Drosophila, dFOXO directly up-regulates lipase 4 (33Vihervaara T. Puig O. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, activation of K04A8.5 expression in fat storage tissues significantly contributes to the increase in the life span of C. elegans produced by reduced signaling of the insulin receptor/daf-2 (32Wang M.C. O'Rourke E.J. Ruvkun G. Science. 2008; 322: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Given that genetic ablation of the insulin receptor selectively in fat tissue increases the life span of mice (34Bluher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), a possible connection between ATGL expression and longevity in mammals emerges as a promising direction of research. The role that FoxO1 plays in adipocytes is consistent with the postulated role of FoxO1 in adaptation to fasting in mammals (reviewed in Ref. 23Gross D.N. van den Heuvel A.P. Birnbaum M.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2320-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In particular, FoxO1 switches muscle metabolism from utilization of carbohydrates to oxidation of lipids (reviewed in Ref. 23Gross D.N. van den Heuvel A.P. Birnbaum M.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2320-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Clearly, the stimulation of lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle requires activation of lipolysis in adipose tissue, the major source of triglyceride reserves, to produce sufficient amounts of fatty acids for combustion. Fat-derived fatty acids are not only metabolized in skeletal muscle but also are used for biosynthesis of triglycerides and VLDL in the liver. In this tissue, FoxO1 increases VLDL production (hence, delivery of triglycerides to skeletal muscle for oxidation) by up-regulating the expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (35Kamagate A. Qu S. Perdomo G. Su D. Kim D.H. Slusher S. Meseck M. Dong H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 2347-2364PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, FoxO1 increases lipolysis in fat tissue, stimulates VLDL production in the liver, and boosts lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle; in other words, FoxO1 may be considered as an important regulator of lipid homeostasis and partitioning of triglycerides between different tissues of the mammalian organism. Finally, it appears that the effects of insulin on gluconeogenesis in the liver and lipolysis in adipocytes are regulated via the same signaling pathway: insulin receptor → insulin receptor substrate → PI3 kinase → Akt → FoxO1. This notion may bring together the “glucocentric” and the “lipocentric” theories of the development of diabetes (36McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar) as the same defect in the insulin signaling pathway may cause abnormalities in both glucose and lipid homeostasis and simultaneously lead to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.

https://openalex.org/W2052084644,"Bone is remodeled constantly throughout life by bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. To maintain bone volume and quality, differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts is tightly regulated through communication between and within these two cell lineages. Previously we reported that cell-cell interaction mediated by ephrinB2 ligand on osteoclasts and EphB4 receptor on osteoblasts generates bidirectional anti-osteoclastogenic and pro-osteoblastogenic signals into respective cells and presumably facilitates transition from bone resorption to bone formation. Here we show that bidirectional ephrinA2-EphA2 signaling regulates bone remodeling at the initiation phase. EphrinA2 expression was rapidly induced by receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand in osteoclast precursors; this was dependent on the transcription factor c-Fos but independent of the c-Fos target gene product NFATc1. Receptor EphA2 was expressed in osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts. Overexpression experiments revealed that both ephrinA2 and EphA2 in osteoclast precursors enhanced differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts and that phospholipase Cgamma2 may mediate ephrinA2 reverse signaling. Moreover, ephrinA2 on osteoclasts was cleaved by metalloproteinases, and ephrinA2 released in the culture medium enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Interestingly, differentiation of osteoblasts lacking EphA2 was enhanced along with alkaline phosphatase, Runx2, and Osterix expression, indicating that EphA2 on osteoblasts generates anti-osteoblastogenic signals presumably by up-regulating RhoA activity. Therefore, ephrinA2-EphA2 interaction facilitates the initiation phase of bone remodeling by enhancing osteoclast differentiation and suppressing osteoblast differentiation."

The HCV viral genome (∼9.6 kb) codes for a unique polyprotein of ∼3000 amino acids (recently reviewed in Refs. 2Appel N. Schaller T. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol.

Following processing via viral and cellular proteases, this polyprotein gives rise to at least 10 viral proteins, divided into structural (core, E1, and E2 envelope glycoproteins) and nonstructural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B). Nonstructural proteins are involved in polyprotein processing and viral replication. The set composed of NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B constitutes the minimal protein component required for viral replication (5Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Cyclophilins are cellular proteins that have been identified first as CsA-binding proteins (6Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). As FK506-binding proteins (FKBP) and parvulins, cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIase) that catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of the peptide linkage preceding a proline (6Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 7Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Several subtypes of cyclophilins are present in mammalian cells (8Barik S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2889-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). They share a high sequence homology and a well conserved three-dimensional structure but display significant differences in their primary cellular localization and in abundance (9Bergsma D.J. Eder C. Gross M. Kersten H. Sylvester D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D. Livi G.P. McLaughlin M.M. Kasyan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23204-23214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CypA, the most abundant of the cyclophilins, is primarily cytoplasmic, whereas CypB is directed to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen or the secretory pathway. CypD, on the other hand, is the mitochondrial cyclophilin. Cyclophilins are involved in numerous physiological processes such as protein folding, immune response, and apoptosis and also in the replication cycle of viruses including vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (for review see Ref. 10Watashi K. Shimotohno K. Drug Target Insights. 2007; 1: 9-18Google Scholar). For HIV, CypA has been shown to interact with the capsid domain of the HIV Gag precursor polyprotein (11Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). CypA thereby competes with capsid domain/TRIM5 interaction, resulting in a loss of the antiviral protective effect of the cellular restriction factor TRIM5α (12Luban J. J.

Moreover, it has been shown that CypA catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of Gly221-Pro222 in the capsid domain and that it has functional consequences for HIV replication efficiency (14Bosco D.A.

CypB may be a key regulator in HCV replication by modulating the affinity of NS5B for RNA. This regulation is abolished in the presence of cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of cyclophilins (6Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W.

Its cytoplasmic sequence can be divided into three domains: D1 (residues 27–213), D2 (residues 250–342), and D3 (residues 356–447), all connected by low complexity sequences (32Tellinghuisen T.L.

D1, a zinc-binding domain, adopts a dimeric claw-shaped structure, which is proposed to interact with RNA (33Huang L. Hwang J. Sharma S.D. Hargittai M.R. Chen Y. Arnold J.J. Raney K.D. Cameron C.E.

NS5A-D2 is essential for HCV replication, whereas NS5A-D3 is a key determinant for virus infectious particle assembly (27Appel N. Zayas M. Miller S. Krijnse-Locker J. Schaller T. Friebe P. Kallis S.

NS5A-D2 and -D3, for which sequence conservation among HCV genotypes is significantly lower than for D1, have been proposed to be natively unfolded domains (28Penin F. Dubuisson J. Rey F.A.

Molecular and structural characterization of NS5A-D2 from HCV genotype 1a has confirmed the disordered nature of this domain (36Liang Y. Kang C.B. Yoon H.S. Mol. Cells. 2006; 22: 13-20PubMed Google Scholar, 37Liang Y. Ye H. Kang C.B. Yoon H.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11550-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As it is still not clear which cyclophilins are cofactors for HCV replication, and as mutations in HCV NS5A protein have been associated with CsA resistance, we decided to examine the interaction between both CypA and CypB and domain 2 of the HCV NS5A protein. We first characterized, at the molecular level, NS5A-D2 from the HCV JFH1 infectious strain (genotype 2a) and showed by NMR spectroscopy that this natively unfolded domain indeed interacts with both cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B. Our NMR chemical shift mapping experiments indicated that the interaction occurs at the level of the cyclophilin active site, whereas it lacks a precise localization on NS5A-D2. A peptide derived from the only well conserved amino acid motif in NS5A-D2 did interact with cyclophilin A but only with a 10-fold lower affinity than the full domain. We concluded from this that the many proline residues form multiple anchoring points, especially when they adopt the cis conformation. NMR exchange spectroscopy further demonstrated that NS5A-D2 is a substrate for the PPIase activities of both CypA and CypB. Both the NS5A/cyclophilin interaction and the PPIase activity of the cyclophilins on NS5A-D2 were abolished by CsA, underscoring the specificity of the interaction. Sequence Analysis—Sequence analyses were performed using tools available at the Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines (IBCP) network protein sequence analysis (NPSA) website (38Combet C.

Negre D. Scarabel M. Ramseier T.M. Vartak N.B. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14885-14891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant domain 2 of HCV NS5A (NS5A-D2; residues 248–341) has extra M- and -LQHHHHHH extensions at the N and C termini, respectively. The pT7–7-NS5A-D2 plasmid was introduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Merck-Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for nonlabeled protein or in a M9-based semi-rich medium (M9 medium supplemented with [15N]NH4Cl (1 g/liter), d-[13C6]glucose (2 g/liter) (for 13C labeling only), Isogro 13C,15N powder growth medium (1 g/liter, 10%; Sigma-Aldrich). At an A600 of ∼0.7, the protein production was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3.5 h post-induction. NS5A-D2 was first purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (HisTrap column, 1 ml, GE Healthcare Europe). Selected fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and then submitted to a second purification step by ion exchange chromatography (ResourceQ, 1 ml column, GE Healthcare Europe). Following SDS-PAGE analysis, NS5A-D2-containing fractions were selected and pooled. The protein was concentrated up to 340 μm with a Vivaspin 15 concentrator (cutoff, 5 kDa) (Satorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France) while simultaneously exchanging the buffer against 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 6.4, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT (or 1 mm Tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine), 0.02% NaN3. After filtration (0.2 μm), NS5A-D2 aliquots were stored at -80 °C with a few Chelex 100 beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan dichrographe (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) calibrated with (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Measurements were carried out at room temperature in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette with protein concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 μm. Spectra were recorded in the 185–260 nm wavelength range at 0.5-nm increments and a 2-s integration time. Spectra were processed, base-line-corrected, and smoothed using Chirascan software. Spectral units were expressed as the molar ellipticity per residue using protein concentrations determined by measuring the UV light absorbance of tyrosine and tryptophan at 280 nm. The α-helix content was estimated using the method of Chen et al. (42Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—A synthetic peptide (named PepD2) corresponding to residues 304–323 of NS5A (304GFPRALPAWARPDYNPPLVE323) was obtained from Neosystems (Strasbourg, France). The purity of the peptide was verified by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry as greater than 95%. Expression and Purification of Nonlabeled and 15N,13C-Labeled Cyclophilin B—Production and purification of recombinant human cyclophilin B in E. coli were done as described previously (43Hanoulle X. Melchior A. Sibille N. Parent B. Denys A. Wieruszeski J.M. Horvath D. Allain F. Lippens G. Landrieu I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34148-34158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pET15b-CypB plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain, recombinant bacteria were grown in LB medium (or in M9 medium supplemented with [15N]NH4Cl and [13C]glucose for labeled samples), and production was induced with 0.4 mm IPTG. Cyclophilin B was purified by ion exchange (SP Sepharose Fast Flow) and then by gel filtration (Superose 12 Prep Grade) chromatography. The purified and concentrated Cyclophilin B was stored at -80 °C. Expression and Purification of Nonlabeled and 15N,13C-Labeled Cyclophilin A—Sequence coding for human CypA was amplified from the plasmid pKK233–2-CypA, kindly provided by Prof. Allain (UMR8576, CNRS-University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France), using the forward primer 3′-cttcatatggtcaaccccaccgtg-5′ and the reverse primer 5′-caaggatccttattcgagttgtcc-3′ and was then inserted in the pET15b plasmid (Merck-Novagen) between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The pET15b-CypA plasmid, coding for a recombinant CypA with an N-terminal His tag, was introduced in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with [15N]NH4Cl or [15N]NH4Cl and [13C]glucose. When the culture reach an A600 =∼0.8, protein production was induced with 0.4 mm IPTG; cells were harvested 3 h after induction at 37 °C. Recombinant CypA was purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (HiTrap Chelating HP, GE Healthcare Europe). Finally, the protein was dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.3, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, concentrated, filtered (0.2 μm), and then stored at 4 °C. NMR Data Collection and Assignments—Spectra were acquired on either a Bruker Avance 600 MHz equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe head or a Bruker Avance 800 MHz with a standard triple resonance probe (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The proton chemical shifts were referenced using the methyl signal of TMSP (sodium 3-trimethylsill-[2,2′,3,3′-d4]propionate) at 0 ppm. Spectra were processed with the Bruker TopSpin software package 1.3 and analyzed using the product plane approach developed in our laboratory (44Verdegem D. Dijkstra K. Hanoulle X. Lippens G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 42: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Assignments of NS5A-D2 backbone resonances were achieved using two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC and three-dimensional 1H,15N,13C HNCO, HNCACO, HNCACB, HNCOCACB, and HNCANNH spectra (45Grzesiek S. Bax A. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Tjandra N. Wingfield P.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1248-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) acquired at 600 MHz on a 340 μm 15N, 13C-labeled NS5A-D2 sample at 298 K (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) accession number 16165). Assignments of the CypB spectrum were taken from our previous study (43Hanoulle X. Melchior A. Sibille N. Parent B. Denys A. Wieruszeski J.M. Horvath D. Allain F. Lippens G. Landrieu I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34148-34158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Assignments of CypA resonances were taken from the literature (46Ottiger M. Zerbe O. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and confirmed with a HNCACB spectrum acquired at 600 MHz on a 340 μm [15N,13C]CypA sample in 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2PO4 pH 6.3, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT at 25 °C. Interaction between NS5A-D2 and Cyclophilins—To study the interaction between NS5A-D2 and CypA or CypB, differentially labeled proteins (15N for NS5A-D2 and 15N,13C for CypA or CypB) were mixed at different molar ratios. The (1H,15N) plane of the HNCO spectrum thereby selects only for the 15N,13C-labeled protein component, whereas the HNCO spectrum with modified phases to select for the non-13C-labeled 15N nuclei (which we will further call the HN(noCO) spectrum (47Golovanov A.P. Blankley R.T. Avis J.M. Bermel W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6528-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) was used for selection of the only-15N-labeled protein. The combined chemical shift perturbations following NS5A-D2 addition were calculated as shown in Equation 1, whereby δΔ(1HN) and δΔ(15N) are the chemical shift perturbations in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. δΔ=|δΔ(1HN)|+0.2⋅|δΔ(15N)|(Eq. 1) Cyclophilin PPIase Activity toward NS5A-D2—PPIase activity of CypA and CypB on NS5A-D2 were assessed using EXSY spectra, whereby the exchange was monitored on the proton resonance (in homonuclear 1H,1H spectra (48Kaplan J.L. Fraenkel G. NMR of Chemically Exchanging Systems. Academic Press, New York1980Google Scholar)) or on the 15N nucleus (in heteronuclear 1H,15N z-exchange spectra (49Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar)). The ratio between the cis and trans populations for a given residue (pc and pt, respectively) was measured on the basis of a 1H,15N HSQC spectrum in the absence of any cyclophilin assuming that an exchange peak for this residue was observed. 1H, 1H EXSY spectra were acquired as 1H,1H planes from a three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC with different mixing times (50, 100, 200, and 400 ms) on a sample of 320 μm [15N,13C]NS5A-D2 and 40 μm [15N]CypB or -CypA in 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.4, 30 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm DTT. 15N z-exchange spectra were recorded on an 800-MHz spectrometer with 0.88, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400-ms mixing times. PPIase activities were analyzed on a sample of 220 μm [15N]NS5A-D2 and 23 μm CypB or CypA in 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 6.3, 30 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm DTT. Exchange rates were derived from a simplified version of the analytical form given in Ref. 38Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar by taking into account only the maximal intensity of the trans-cis exchange peak (Itc) and the trans diagonal peak (Itt). This procedure minimized any problems with exchange broadening of the cis diagonal peak due to the interaction with the Cyp and with significant proton overlap hindering the reliable integration of the weak off-diagonal peaks. The exchange rate (kexch), as a function of mixing time (MT), was determined by using a least-squares fitting procedure between the experimental data and the theoretical Equation 2 adapted from Ref. 15Bosco D.A. Kern D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6110-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. ltcltt=−pc+pc×e(kexch×MT)pc+pt×e(kexch×MT)(Eq. 2) To confirm that the exchange peaks were due to the PPIase activity of cyclophilins, CsA was added into the sample, and a 1H, 15N z-exchange spectra was recorded with a 100-ms mixing time. PyMOL software was used for the molecular graphics (DeLano Scientific). Sequence Analysis—We performed sequence analysis and structure predictions to assess the degree of conservation of the NS5A-D2 domains across the different strains and to identify potential essential amino acids (aa) and motifs. The aa repertoire deduced from the analysis of 21 HCV isolates of genotype 2a revealed that aa are strictly conserved in 70% of the sequence positions (denoted by asterisks in Fig. 1A). The apparent variability is limited at most positions because the observed residues exhibit similar physicochemical properties, as indicated both by the similarity pattern (Fig. 1A, colons and dots) as well as the hydropathic pattern, where the letters o, i, and n denote hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and neutral residues, respectively (see legend to Fig. 1A for details). The degree of conservation among different genotypes was investigated by ClustalW alignment of 27 reference sequences representative for the major HCV genotypes and subtypes (see legend to Fig. 1A). The aa repertoire derived from this alignment revealed an apparent high level of variability, except for some well conserved positions that are likely essential for the structure and/or function of NS5A-D2. However, despite this apparent variability, conservation of the hydropathic character at most positions indicates that the overall structure of NS5A-D2 is conserved among the different HCV genotypes. There are, however, some short variable stretches of sequences (underlined in Fig. 1A, bottom), which appear to be genotype-specific. Typically, a main sequence difference between genotypes is the four-aa deletion observed in genotype 2, including JFH1 (indicated by hyphens in Fig. 1A). Molecular Characterization of HCV NS5A-D2 (JFH1)— NS5A-D2 is efficiently produced in a soluble form when recombinantly overexpressed in E. coli and could be purified to almost homogeneity (see supplemental Fig. 1). Despite an excellent agreement between expected (11,639 Da) and experimental mass as determined by mass spectroscopy, NS5A-D2 has an apparent molecular weight of ∼18 kDa by SDS-PAGE. This discrepancy is probably due to the primary aa sequence of NS5A-D2, which includes many acidic residues and prolines (50Huang L. Sineva E.V. Hargittai M.R. Sharma S.D. Suthar M. Raney K.D. Cameron C.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 51Kieliszewski M.J. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In gel filtration chromatography, the protein elutes at a volume corresponding to a ∼30-kDa globular protein, (Fig. 1B). Such a large apparent molecular weight in a gel filtration assay is commonly associated with natively unfolded proteins devoid of globular domain (52Tompa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). The structure of NS5A-D2 was further characterized by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). In aqueous buffer, NS5A-D2 gave a complex spectrum with a large negative band around 198 nm and a shoulder in the 220–240 nm range, indicating a mixture of random coil structure with the presence of some poorly defined structures. To probe the potential conformational preference of NS5A-D2, we used TFE, which is known to stabilize the folding of peptidic sequences, especially those exhibiting an intrinsic propensity to adopt an α-helical structure (53Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The addition of 50"

Hurdia possesses a general body architecture similar to those of Anomalocaris and Laggania, including the presence of exceptionally well-preserved gills, but differs from those anomalocaridids by possessing a prominent anterior carapace structure.

https://openalex.org/W2122229546,"Palmitoylation, a post-translational modification of cysteine residues with the lipid palmitate, has recently emerged as an important mechanism for regulating protein trafficking and function. With the identification of 23 DHHC mammalian palmitoyl acyl transferases (PATs), a key question was the nature of substrate-enzyme specificity for these PATs. Using the acyl-biotin exchange palmitoylation assay, we compared the substrate specificity of four neuronal PATs, namely DHHC-3, DHHC-8, HIP14L (DHHC-13), and HIP14 (DHHC-17). Exogenous expression of enzymes and substrates in COS cells reveals that HIP14L and HIP14 modulate huntingtin palmitoylation, DHHC-8 modulates paralemmin-1 palmitoylation, and DHHC-3 shows the least substrate specificity. These in vitro data were validated by lentiviral siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous HIP14 and DHHC-3 in cultured rat cortical neurons. PATs require the presence of palmitoylated cysteines in order to interact with their substrates. To understand the elements that influence enzyme/substrate specificity further, we fused the HIP14 ankryin repeat domain to the N terminus of DHHC-3, which is not a PAT for huntingtin. This modification enabled DHHC-3 to behave similarly to HIP14 by modulating palmitoylation and trafficking of huntingtin. Taken together, this study indicates that individual PATs have specific substrate preference, determined by regulatory domains outside the DHHC domain of the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2069254037,"We report here molecular mechanisms underlying a bacteria-archaeon symbiosis. We found that a fermentative bacterium used its flagellum for interaction with a specific methanogenic archaeon. The archaeon perceived a bacterial flagellum protein and activated its metabolism (methanogenesis). Transcriptome analyses showed that a substantial number of genes in the archaeon, including those involved in the methanogenesis pathway, were up-regulated after the contact with the flagellum protein. These findings suggest that the bacterium communicates with the archaeon by using its flagellum."
https://openalex.org/W2052021051,"We investigated the ways S100B, S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, and S100A6 bind to the different oligomeric forms of the tumor suppressor p53 in vitro, using analytical ultracentrifugation and multiangle light scattering. It is established that members of the S100 protein family bind to the tetramerization domain (residues 325-355) of p53 when it is uncovered in the monomer, and so binding can disrupt the tetramer. We found a stoichiometry of one dimer of S100 bound to a monomer of p53. We discovered that some S100 proteins could also bind to the tetramer. S100B bound the tetramer and also disrupted the dimer by binding monomeric p53. S100A2 bound monomeric p53 as well as tetrameric, whereas S100A1 only bound monomeric p53. S100A6 bound more tightly to tetrameric than to monomeric p53. We also identified an additional binding site for S100 proteins in the transactivation domain (1-57) of p53. Based on our results and published observations in vivo, we propose a model for the binding of S100 proteins to p53 that can explain both activation and inhibition of p53-mediated transcription.

Robertson L. Parry E.W. Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar) and different kinds of melanomas and carcinomas (8Salama I. Malone P.S. Mihaimeed F. Jones J.L.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of action of the S100 proteins is not fully understood.The tumor suppressor p53 is a crucial factor in the development of cancer. It acts as the central inducer of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (10Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 11Vousden K.H.

We previously demonstrated that S100 proteins generally bind to the tetramerization domain (residues 325-355) of p53, whereas only a subset can bind its negative regulatory domain (residues 367-393) (16Fernandez-Fernandez M.R.

S100B, S100A2, S100A4, and S100A6 have been reported to influence p53-mediated transcription, but the effect remains controversial because some studies show a stimulating effect, whereas others claim that S100 proteins inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 (17Mueller A.

We previously showed that oligomerization of p53 weakens the binding to S100B and S100A4, and it was deduced that S100 proteins inhibit the oligomerization of p53, which causes the inhibitory effect on p53-mediated transcription (16Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Rutherford T.J. Fersht A.R. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).In this study, we analyzed the binding of five different S100 proteins to full-length p53 and also different oligomeric states of C-terminal fragments of p53 that consisted of the tetramerization (residues 325-355) and C-terminal domains (residues 360-393), some with mutations in the tetramerization domain that altered the oligomerization state. We used analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), 2The abbreviations used are: SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; MALS, multiangle light scattering; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; QMFL, superstable full-length p53 variant; M¯w, weight average molar mass; M¯n, number average molar mass. 2The abbreviations used are: SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; MALS, multiangle light scattering; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; QMFL, superstable full-length p53 variant; M¯w, weight average molar mass; M¯n, number average molar mass. multiangle light scattering (MALS), and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) in vitro. We show that S100 family members differ in their ability to bind to the different oligomeric forms of p53. In addition, we found that some of the S100 proteins can bind p53 as a tetramer and identified the transactivation domain of p53 as another target site for S100 proteins. The in vitro data thus provide an explanation why S100 proteins have been found to activate as well as inhibit p53-mediated transcription.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids, Protein Expression, and Purification—Plasmids used for the expression of S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6, and S100B and p53-(293-393) were as described (16Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Rutherford T.J. Fersht A.R. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). pRSET plasmids of oligomerization-deficient mutants of p53-(293-393), respectively, p53-(293-393)-L344A and p53-(293-393)-L344P, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The superstable full-length p53-variant (p53-QMFL) (23Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21934-21941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Rajagopalan S. Jaulent A.M. Wells M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5983-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The p53-QMFL with an additional tetracysteine motif Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys at the C terminus (p53-QMFL-FlAsH) was purified similarly and specifically labeled with FlAsH-EDT2 (Invitrogen), which becomes fluorescent upon binding to the tetracysteine motif.Analytical Size-exclusion Chromatography—Analytical gel filtrations were performed using a GE Healthcare Superdex™ 75 analytical gel filtration column with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min or a Superose™ 6 10/300GL column with a flow of 0.4 ml/min. The proteins were buffer-exchanged in physiological ionic strength buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 99.2 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and 100 μl of protein sample at different concentrations were injected. For experiments with full-length p53, the proteins were changed into a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. To analyze the resulting peaks, we collected the eluted protein with a fraction collector, and the fractions were concentrated with a centrifugational filter and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, the SEC was coupled to a DAWN HELEOS™ MALS instrument (Wyatt Technology) and an Optilab™ rEX (Wyatt Technology). The on-line measurement of the intensity of the Rayleigh scattering as a function of the angle as well as the differential refractive index of the eluting peak in SEC can be used to determine the weight average molar mass (M¯w) of eluted oligomers and protein complexes (27Trathnigg B. Prog. Polym. Sci. 1995; 20: 615-650Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), using the ASTRA™ (Wyatt Technologies) software. The number average molar mass (M¯n) was also determined to estimate the monodispersity of the peaks. All analyzed peak areas were monodisperse (M¯w/M¯n < 1.01).Fluorescence-monitored Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The AUC experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge with an Aviv fluorescence detection system (28MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (FDS, Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) in SedVel60K-FDS fluorescence velocity cells (Spin Analytical, Inc., Durham, NH). Proteins were buffer-exchanged in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The concentration of p53 was 250 nm with varying amounts of S100 protein. The samples were equilibrated in the cell for 3 h at 10 °C before centrifugation. The AUC runs were performed as described (26Rajagopalan S. Jaulent A.M. Wells M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5983-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Data were further analyzed using the SedFit software (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar) to determine the sedimentation coefficient and to estimate the molecular mass of the protein complex.Fluorescence Anisotropy—The peptide p53-(1-57) with a C-terminal Lys-methoxycoumarin as label was a gift from Dr. D. Teufel. Fluorescence anisotropy studies were performed at 20 °C with a Cary Eclipse Varian fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a Hamilton Microlab M dispenser. Reactions were carried out in physiological ionic strength buffer. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured with excitation at 328 nm and emission at 393 nm. 250 μl of S100 protein were titrated into 1 ml of 0.5 μm peptide. The titration data were corrected for the S100 protein dilution effect and analyzed with Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software). The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated with a quadratic fitting equation for a single site binding model, when necessary with the addition of a term accounting for linear drift (30Teufel D.P. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated three times.RESULTSOligomerization of p53-(293-393) Variants—The state of oligomerization of a protein will depend on the ratio of its concentration to its dissociation constants. To study the binding to different oligomeric forms of the p53 C terminus, we expressed and purified: p53-(293-393) recombinant protein, which should be tetrameric under the experimental conditions; a mutant of weakened interface that should tend to be dimeric, p53-(293-393)-L344A (31Lomax M.E. Barnes D.M. Hupp T.R. Picksley S.M. Camplejohn R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); and an even more weakened one that should tend to be monomeric, p53-(293-393)-L344P (32Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of proteins was monitored by analytical SEC combined with MALS detection. The p53 variants have a large fraction of intrinsically disordered structure (33Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and do not elute like globular proteins in a SEC; hence the relative molecular weight and the oligomerization cannot be studied appropriately using globular protein standards. MALS is a powerful tool to characterize the M¯w of compounds showing anomalous elution profiles in SEC (34Kim C. Morel M.H. Beuve J.S. Guilbert S. Collet A. Bonfils F. J. Chromatogr. A. 2008; 1213: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The three individual p53-(293-393) variants eluted with different retention times (tr) in SEC in separate runs. The calculated M¯w of ∼12, ∼24, and ∼46 kDa for the peaks in the elution profiles corresponded well to p53-(293-393) in different oligomeric states (Fig. 1 and Table 1).TABLE 1Size-exclusion chromatography of S100 proteins together with different p53(293-393) variantsS100M̄waS.E. of four measurements at different concentrations.+p53−p53WTL344AL344PkDa−S10045.8 ± 0.424.2 ± 0.111.8 ± 0.3S100A121.2 ± 1.049.3 ± 2.824.4 ± 1.828.7 ± 0.7S100A222.8 ± 0.445.2 ± 2.223.0 ± 1.729.7 ± 0.6S100A424.8 ± 0.145.7 ± 2.723.7 ± 1.124.5 ± 0.8bSmall shift in retention time but no shift in M̄w.S100A620.5 ± 0.845.7 ± 0.924.1 ± 0.614.9 ± 0.7bSmall shift in retention time but no shift in M̄w.S100B21.8 ± 0.278.7 ± 7.533.5 ± 3.132.1 ± 0.2a S.E. of four measurements at different concentrations.b Small shift in retention time but no shift in M̄w. Open table in a new tab S100 Proteins Form a Complex with the Monomeric Fragment of p53—S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6, and S100B were expressed and purified. All S100 proteins eluted as dimers (Table 1) under the experimental conditions at μm concentrations in SEC-MALS experiments and eluted with a tr between 17.5 and 18.5 min (data not shown).S100 proteins were injected together with the p53-(293-393)-L344P variant in SEC-MALS experiments. S100B, S100A2, and S100A1 (∼20 kDa) interacted with the monomeric p53-(293-393)-L344P variant (∼12 kDa), resulting in a peak (tr ∼16 min) with a M¯w of ∼30 kDa, which fits to a complex of one dimer of S100 binding to one monomer of p53 (Table 1). No tight complex formation was observed between the monomeric p53 variant and S100A4 and S100A6. Despite a small shift in tr of the S100 peaks, the M¯w of 24.5 and 14.9 kDa did not correspond to a stable complex between S100A4 or S100A6 and the p53 monomer (Table 1) but instead had only a weak interaction.The stoichiometry of the complex of one dimer of S100 protein binding one monomeric p53-(293-393)-L344P was also observed at different concentrations of S100 (Fig. 2). Even with an excess of S100 protein, the M¯w of the resulting complex was ∼30 kDa. No peak corresponding to a complex of a dimer of S100 binding to two monomers with a M¯w of ∼44 kDa could be detected. Further, there was no complex present corresponding to two dimers of S100 binding to a monomer of p53 (∼54 kDa).FIGURE 2SEC-MALS of S100B and p53-(293-393)-L344P at different concentrations. The samples contained 140 μm p53-(293-393)-L344P and 35 (blue), 70 (red), 280 (green), and 560 μm (purple) S100B. At all concentrations, one dimer of S100B (∼21 kDa) bound to one p53 monomer (∼12 kDa).

The calculated M¯w of ∼33 kDa of the eluted peak corresponded to a complex of one dimer of S100B (∼21 kDa) binding a monomer of p53 (∼12 kDa) (Fig. 3A). Consequently, the dimer of p53-(293-393)-L344A was disrupted upon binding to S100B. In contrast, S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, and S100A6 did not bind to the dimer of p53 (Table 1). In SEC-MALS elution profiles, the eluted peak with the highest M¯w of ∼24 kDa was the unbound p53 dimer.FIGURE 3SEC-MALS of S100B and p53-(293-393) oligomers. A, 250 μm dimer p53-(293-393)-L344A (blue) and the complex of 200 μm p53 variant and 100 μm S100B (red) differed in tr and M¯w determined by MALS.

The tr of the peak for p53-(293-393) shifted upon the addition of S100B. The M¯w of ∼80 kDa of the elution peak would correspond best to two dimers of S100 (∼21 kDa) in a complex with a tetramer of p53 (∼46 kDa). Under the same conditions, S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, and S100A6 did not form a complex with tetrameric p53-(293-393). The M¯w of the dominating peak was ∼46 kDa, corresponding to unbound tetrameric p53-(293-393) (Table 1). In addition, no shift in tr for the eluted peaks was observed (data not shown). For all S100 proteins, we did not detect additional peaks in the elution profiles, indicating a disruption of the p53 tetramer upon binding, not even after long incubation times of 48 h (data not shown).S100 Proteins Form a Complex with the Tetramer of Full-length p53—The binding of S100 proteins to p53 was also studied by fluorescence analytical ultracentrifugation with a thermodynamically stabilized full-length p53-QMFL labeled with a FlAsH tag (26Rajagopalan S. Jaulent A.M. Wells M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5983-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The concentration of p53 in the experiments was 250 nm. Further, an excess of S100 protein was added to study the formation of complexes as well as a possible influence on p53 tetramerization (Fig. 4). The AUC of p53-QMFL-FlAsH gave two peaks, corresponding to a tetramer of p53 and lower oligomers. The calculated M¯w of ∼178 kDa for the p53-QMFL-FlAsH corresponded well with its theoretical M¯w of ∼176 kDa. Upon the addition of S100 protein, an increase in the sedimentation coefficient (measured at the top of the peak) could be observed for the tetramer as well as for the lower oligomers of p53-QMFL-FlAsH. The increase in sedimentation coefficient indicated a bigger size of the molecule, corresponding to a complex formed between the labeled p53 and S100 protein. The addition of excess S100B resulted in a calculated M¯w of ∼268 kDa for the complex using the same frictional coefficient as a fitting parameter as for p53-QMFL-FlAsH alone. The estimated mass would correspond to four dimers of S100B binding to a tetramer of p53. When the concentration of S100 was reduced from 10 to 1 μm, a smaller shift in sedimentation coefficient and increase in M¯w to ∼199 kDa was detected, implying that the complex between S100B and the tetramer of p53 was weak. Further, no relative increase in the fluorescence signal for the lower oligomers when compared with the tetramer of QMFL-FlAsH could be detected. A change in the signal distribution would indicate a disruption of the p53-QMFL-FlAsH tetramer. Similar results were obtained for S100A2 and S100A6. In contrast, only a minor increase in the sedimentation coefficient and M¯w was detected for S100A1 and S100A4, implying a weaker interaction with p53-QMFL-FlAsH (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Analytical AUC of p53 QMFL-FlAsH with S100 proteins. 250 nm of p53-QMFL-FlAsH and different amounts of S100 were run at 45,000 rpm. The sedimentation profile was fitted to a double Gaussian equation, and the Mr was calculated with SedFit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To check the results, we performed analytical SEC with a Superose™ 6 column and injected p53-QMFL together with S100 proteins. The formation of a complex was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted peak. Upon the addition of S100B, S100A2, and S100A6, we saw a slight shift in the elution volume for the p53-QMFL peak (Fig. 5A). SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted peaks revealed a co-elution of S100 proteins with p53-QMFL (Fig. 5B). The band corresponding to S100 proteins was faint when compared with the band for p53, which supports the idea that the complex between the p53 tetramer and S100 proteins was weak. No additional peaks corresponding to a complex of S100 proteins and lower oligomers of p53-QMFL could be observed. In contrast, no co-elution of S100A1 and S100A4 with p53-QMFL could be detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5SEC-PAGE of p53-QMFL and S100.

In particular, for S100A6, we could not detect binding to the C terminus of p53-(293-393) by SEC-MALS but found a relatively tight interaction with full-length p53 by AUC and SEC-PAGE. We assumed, therefore, that there might be an additional binding site for S100 proteins within p53, and so we analyzed the binding to p53 core domain (residues 102-292) and to the transactivation domain p53-(1-57). We performed heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments that could detect even weak binding events using 15N-labeled p53 core domain with S100B and S100A6, but no binding was observed (data not shown). In fluorescence anisotropy experiments with a labeled peptide of the transactivation domain p53-(1-57), we observed binding to S100 proteins with dissociation constants in the low μm to nm range (Table 3 and Fig. 6). S100A2 and S100A6 were the tightest binders with a Kd < 400 nm, whereas S100A1 and S100B bound ∼5-fold more weakly.TABLE 2Summary of S100 proteins binding to p53Proteinp53 full lengthp53-(293-393)TetramerDimerMonomerS100A1−−−+S100A2+−−+S100A4−−−WeakS100A6+−−WeakS100B++++ Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Fluorescence anisotropy of S100 proteins and p53(1-57)ProteinKdμmS100A11.91 ± 0.01S100A20.34 ± 0.05S100A40.76 ± 0.19S100A60.39 ± 0.10S100B1.99 ± 0.44 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6Binding of S100 proteins to the transactivation domain of p53.

We discovered that a subset of S100 proteins can additionally bind tetrameric p53, and we noted that S100 proteins had different binding properties toward different oligomeric forms (Table 2). We also found a novel binding site common for all S100 proteins in the transactivation domain of p53-(1-57).S100B and S100A2 bind tightly to the C-terminal domains of p53, residues 367-393, (16Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Rutherford T.J. Fersht A.R. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that these proteins were able to form a tight complex with a monomeric mutant of p53-(293-393), which was stable enough to be detected by SEC. No stable complex was observed with S100A4 and S100A6. This absence might have been a manifestation of their known weaker binding to p53 (16Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Rutherford T.J. Fersht A.R. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) so that their complexes might not have been stable enough to remain intact during analytical gel filtration.S100B was able to disrupt the dimeric mutant p53-(293-393)-L344A that has a weakened interface and bound p53 as a monomer. This confirmed that S100B is able to influence the oligomerization equilibrium of p53 as proposed previously (20Fernandez-Fernandez M.R. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2162005182,"Talin is a large flexible rod-shaped protein that activates the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules and couples them to cytoskeletal actin. It exists in both globular and extended conformations, and an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal F3 FERM subdomain and the C-terminal part of the talin rod contributes to an autoinhibited form of the molecule. Here, we report the solution structure of the primary F3 binding domain within the C-terminal region of the talin rod and use intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects to determine the structure of the complex. The rod domain (residues 1655–1822) is an amphipathic five-helix bundle; Tyr-377 of F3 docks into a hydrophobic pocket at one end of the bundle, whereas a basic loop in F3 (residues 316–326) interacts with a cluster of acidic residues in the middle of helix 4. Mutation of Glu-1770 abolishes binding. The rod domain competes with β3-integrin tails for binding to F3, and the structure of the complex suggests that the rod is also likely to sterically inhibit binding of the FERM domain to the membrane.

The cytoskeletal protein talin has emerged as a key player, both in regulating the affinity of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules for ligand (1Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and in coupling integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (2Critchley D.R. Gingras A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1345-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, depletion of talin results in defects in integrin activation (3Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1632-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) show that talin is essential for a variety of integrin-mediated events that are crucial for normal embryonic development. In vertebrates, there are two talin genes, and mice carrying a talin1 null allele fail to complete gastrulation (7Monkley S.J. Zhou X.H. Kinston S.J. Giblett S.M. Hemmings L. Priddle H. Brown J.E.

Tissue-specific inactivation of talin1 results in an inability to activate integrins in platelets (8Nieswandt B. Moser M. Pleines I. Varga-Szabo D. Monkley S. Critchley D. Fassler R. J. Exp.

In contrast, mice homozygous for a talin2 gene trap allele have no phenotype, although the allele may be hypomorphic (12Chen N.T. Lo S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies have provided substantial insights into the molecular basis of talin action. Talin is composed of an N-terminal globular head (∼50 kDa) linked to an extended flexible rod (∼220 kDa). The talin head contains a FERM 2The abbreviations used are: FERM, four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin; HADDOCK, high ambiguity driven biomolecular docking; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; PIPKI, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1.2The abbreviations used are: FERM, four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin; HADDOCK, high ambiguity driven biomolecular docking; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; PIPKI, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1. domain (made up of F1, F2, and F3 subdomains) preceded by a domain referred to here as F0 (2Critchley D.R. Gingras A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1345-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Studies by Wegener et al. (30Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H.

Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) have shown how the F3 FERM subdomain, which has a phosphotyrosine binding domain fold, interacts with both the canonical NPXY motif and the membrane-proximal helical region of the cytoplasmic tails of integrin β-subunits (13Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The latter interaction apparently activates the integrin by disrupting the salt bridge between the integrin α- and β-subunit tails that normally keeps integrins locked in a low affinity state. The observation that the F0 region is also important in integrin activation (14Bouaouina M. Lad Y. Calderwood D.A. J. Biol.

It is well established that some members of the FERM domain family of proteins are regulated by a head-tail interaction (26Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar); gel filtration, sedimentation velocity, and electron microscopy studies all show that talin is globular in low salt buffers, although it is more elongated (∼60 nm in length) in high salt (27Molony L. McCaslin D. Abernethy J. Paschal B. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7790-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the talin rod liberated from full-length talin by calpain-II cleavage is elongated in both buffers, indicating that the head is required for talin to adopt a more compact state. Direct evidence for an interaction between the talin head and rod has recently emerged from NMR studies by Goksoy et al. (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), who demonstrated binding of 15N-labeled talin F3 to a talin rod fragment spanning residues 1654–2344, an interaction that was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (Kd = 0.57 μm) (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Chemical shift data also showed that this segment of the talin rod partially masked the binding site in F3 for the membraneproximal helix of the β3-integrin tail (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), directly implicating the talin head-rod interaction in regulating the integrin binding activity of talin. Goksoy et al. (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) subdivided the F3 binding site in this rod fragment into two sites with higher affinity (Kd ∼3.6 μm; residues 1654–1848) and lower affinity (Kd ∼78 μm; residues 1984–2344). Here, we define the rod domain boundaries and determine the NMR structure of residues 1655–1822, a five-helix bundle. We further show that this domain binds F3 predominantly via surface-exposed residues on helix 4, with an affinity similar to the high affinity site reported by Goksoy et al. (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We also report the structure of the complex between F3 and the rod domain and show that the latter masks the known binding site in F3 for the β3-integrin tail and is expected to inhibit the association of the talin FERM domain with the membrane. Peptide Preparation—The preparation of U-15N-labeled β3-integrin tail was performed as described previously (29Oxley C.L. Anthis N.J. Lowe E.D. Vakonakis I. Campbell I.D. Wegener K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5420-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant Talin Polypeptides—The cDNAs encoding murine talin1 residues 309–400 (F3) and 1655–1822 were synthesized by PCR using a mouse talin1 cDNA as template and cloned into the expression vector pet-151TOPO (Invitrogen). Talin polypeptides were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 STAR (DE3) cultured either in LB for unlabeled protein or in M9 minimal medium for preparation of isotopically labeled samples for NMR. Recombinant His-tagged talin polypeptides were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography following standard procedures. The His tag was removed by cleavage with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen), and the proteins were further purified by anion-exchange (Domain E) or cation-exchange (F3). U-15N-labeled F3 (309–405) and F3 point mutants were made as described previously (30Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using their respective extinction coefficient at 280 nm. Protein concentrations were based on absorption coefficients calculated from the aromatic content according to ProtParam as follows: talin 1655–1822, 3105 m-1cm-1; talin F3, 16,960 m-1cm-1; PIPKIγ peptide, 8480 m-1cm-1; integrin peptide, 8480 m-1cm-1. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments for the resonance assignment and structure determination of talin 1655–1822 were carried out with 1 mm protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) 2H2O. NMR spectra of all the proteins were obtained at 298 K using Bruker AVANCE DRX 600 or AVANCE DRX 800 spectrometers both equipped with CryoProbes. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid, and 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using recommended gyromagnetic ratios (31Wishart D.S.

Spectra were processed with TopSpin (Bruker Corp.) and analyzed using Analysis (32Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D.

Three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and HN(CO)CACB experiments were used for the sequential assignment of the backbone NH, N, CO, Cα, and Cβ resonances. Side chain assignments were obtained using three-dimensional HBHA(CO)NH, HBHANH, H(C)CH-TOCSY, and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments. Aromatic side chain assignments were obtained using 13C-resolved three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC. The resonance assignments of 1655–1822 have been deposited in the BioMagResBank with the accession number 15457. Experiments to examine the competition between talin 1655–1822 and the β3-integrin tail were performed on a spectrometer equipped with a 500-MHz Oxford Instruments superconducting magnet and GE-Omega computer. Samples were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% 2H2O, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Data were processed using NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar), and spectra were visualized using SPARKY. Spectra were referenced as described above (31Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J.

Structure Calculations—Distance restraints were obtained from the following experiments: three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (800 MHz, 100 ms), 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (800 MHz, 100 ms), and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (800 MHz, 80 ms) on aromatics. All NOESY peaks were picked semiautomatically in Analysis with noise and artifact peaks removed manually. Cross-peak intensities were used to evaluate target distances. Dihedral restraints (Φ/Ψ) were obtained from the TALOS data base (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Hydrogen-bond restraints within secondary structure elements identified from initial rounds of structure calculation were incorporated based on the temperature dependence of NMR chemical shifts (35Baxter N.J. Hosszu L.L. Waltho J.P. Williamson M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1625-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using a series of 1H,15N HSQC spectra collected from 15 to 35 °C. Initial models were generated with CYANA using the CANDID (36Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) method for NOESY cross-peak assignment and calibration. These models were used as initial structures in structure calculations by Aria (37Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The acceptance tolerances in the standard protocol of Aria 1.2 were modified to set violation tolerances to 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.5, and 0.1 Å for iterations 2–8, respectively, with iteration 1 containing the initial models. Any cross-peaks rejected by Aria were checked manually, and those found to be reliable were added to the calculation. 200 structures were calculated at each iteration, the 20 lowest energy structures retained and 10 used for final restraint analysis. The 30 lowest energy structures from iteration 8 were further refined in the presence of explicit water molecules. Molecular models were generated using PyMOL (38DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). The structural statistics for each domain are presented in Table 1.

Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by fitting the changes in secondary shift with concentration to the following equationΔ(H,N)=Δ(H,N)0[P]+[L]+Kd−([P]+[L]+Kd−4[P][L])2[P](Eq. 2) where Δ(H,N) is the weighted secondary shift, Δ(H,N)0 is the shift at saturation, and [P] and [L] are the protein and ligand concentrations, respectively. Data from peaks with the largest shift changes were fitted to this equation using Analysis. Competition experiments were conducted by acquiring 1H,15N HSQC spectra of 50 μm β3-tail in the presence of 0.25 mm talin F3 domain, 1 mm talin 1655–1822, or both. Weighted combined 1H and 15N amide shifts (Δ(H,N)) were calculated as above. Molecular Docking Calculations—Docking of talin 1655–1822 to F3 was performed with the software HADDOCK2 (40Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar, 41de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The starting structures were model 1 of the F3 complex with the β3/PIPKIγ-chimeric peptide (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 2H7D) (30Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and the lowest energy NMR structure of talin 1655–1822. Mutagenesis data, chemical shift mapping, and surface accessibility data were used to define the active residues according to HADDOCK definitions. The well defined filtered NOEs between Tyr-377 in F3 and Leu-1680 and Val-1683 of talin 1655–1822 were also used in the calculation. In all, 1000 initial complex structures were generated by rigid body energy minimization, and the best 200 by total energy were selected for torsion angle dynamics and subsequent Cartesian dynamics in an explicit water solvent. Default scaling for energy terms is as described previously (40Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Mapping the Domain Boundaries of the High Affinity F3 Binding Site in the Talin Rod—A fragment of the talin rod, spanning residues 1654–2344, has been shown to contain two non-overlapping binding sites for the talin F3 FERM subdomain (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular basis of the interaction, we first determined the domain boundaries of the relevant section of the talin rod, which is made up of a total of 62 α-helices (Fig. 1A) arranged into ∼13 compact bundles or domains. We have previously established that the most C-terminal bundle (residues 2300–2482), which contains an actin binding site (20Gingras A.R. Bate N. Goult B.T. Hazelwood L. Canestrelli I. Grossmann J.G. Liu H. Putz N.S. Roberts G.C. Volkmann N. Hanein D. Barsukov I.L. Critchley D.R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), is preceded by two five-helix domains (residues 1974–2140 and 2137–2294) that together make up the integrin binding site referred to as IBS2 (21Gingras A.R. Ziegler W.H. Bobkov A.A. Joyce M.G. Fasci D. Himmel M. Rothemund S. Ritter A. Grossmann J.G. Patel B. Bate N. Goult B.T. Emsley J. Barsukov I.L. Roberts G.C. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Critchley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8866-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Working toward the N terminus, the next domain, which contains a vinculin binding site (VBS3), was thought to be a four-helix bundle (residues 1843–1973) (19Gingras A.R. Vogel K.P. Steinhoff H.J. Ziegler W.H. Patel B. Emsley J. Critchley D.R. Roberts G.C. Barsukov I.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1805-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but we have recently found that it is more stable as a five-helix bundle (residues 1815–1973). 4B. T. Goult, A. R. Gingras, N. Bate, G. C. K. Roberts, I. L. Barsukov, and D. R. Critchley, unpublished work. This domain overlaps, by one helix, the F3 binding fragment identified by Goksoy et al. (28Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (residues 1654–1848). To establish whether the preceding domain is also a five-helix bundle, we expressed residues 1655–1822, a region that is highly conserved in both talin1 and talin2 and across species (Fig. 1B). The protein was soluble, and its melting temperature, as determined by CD, was 65 °C, providing evidence for a stable fold. Moreover, the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum showed good dispersion indicative of a well folded domain and with peak line widths consistent with a monomeric state. Structure of Talin Residues 1655–1822—The solution structure of talin 1655–1822 was calculated from 5502 distance, and 257 dihedral angle restraints were determined using 13C,15N-labeled protein. The structure consists of five antiparallel amphipathic α-helices forming a bundle stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1, C and D). The loops between helices 1 and 2 and helices 4 and 5 are relatively long (9–10 residues), whereas those between helices 2 and 3 and 3 and 4 are shorter (4–5 residues). Two of the helices contain proline residues (Pro-1715 in helix 2 and Pro-1740 in helix 3) that introduce kinks in the helices; interestingly, these prolines are conserved among talin sequences (Fig. 1B). The topology of the bundle is similar to that seen in talin 482–655 (17Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the two bundles in talin 1974–2293, which make up IBS2 (21Gingras A.R. Ziegler W.H. Bobkov A.A. Joyce M.G.

The core is almost exclusively hydrophobic with a conserved phenylalanine (Phe-1738) surrounded by the hydrophobic side chains of Leu, Ile, and Val residues. The only non-hydrophobic residue in the core is a conserved threonine, Thr-1765. Unlike other talin bundles (17Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), there is no aromatic residue capping the end of the bundle. An interesting feature of the domain is that there is a hydrophobic patch on helices 2 and 3, including Leu-1698 and Leu-1743, that is masked by the long loop between helices 1 and 2, which contains several hydrophobic residues (including Ile-1693 and Leu-1687) that dock into this patch. It remains to be established whether this hydrophobic patch is a site for domain-domain interaction in the intact rod (17Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B.

Dimer dissociation is the first step in SOD1 aggregation, and studies suggest nearly every amino acid residue in SOD1 is dynamically connected to the dimer interface. Post-translational modifications of SOD1 residues might be expected to have similar effects to mutations, but few modifications have been identified. Here we show, using SOD1 isolated from human erythrocytes, that human SOD1 is phosphorylated at threonine 2 and glutathionylated at cysteine 111. A second SOD1 phosphorylation was observed and mapped to either Thr-58 or Ser-59. Cysteine 111 glutathionylation promotes SOD1 monomer formation, a necessary initiating step in SOD1 aggregation, by causing a 2-fold increase in the Kd. This change in the dimer stability is expected to result in a 67% increase in monomer concentration, 315 nm rather than 212 nm at physiological SOD1 concentrations. Because protein glutathionylation is associated with redox regulation, our finding that glutathionylation promotes SOD1 monomer formation supports a model in which increased oxidative stress promotes SOD1 aggregation.

Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) 4The abbreviations used are: FALS, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; SOD1, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase; μ-ESI-FT-ICR-MS, microcapillary electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; ECD, electron-capture dissociation; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; LC, liquid chromatography. 4The abbreviations used are: FALS, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; SOD1, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase; μ-ESI-FT-ICR-MS, microcapillary electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; ECD, electron-capture dissociation; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; LC, liquid chromatography. is the hereditary form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal disease characterized by progressive motor neuron loss (1Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). A subset of FALS is caused by mutations in the gene encoding homodimeric Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which forms intraneuronal aggregates (2Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Although SOD1 aggregation is involved in SOD1-mediated FALS, it is generally believed that the functional properties of the enzyme are not related to the toxic gain of function imparted by mutations in SOD1 (3Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). However, the discovery of roles for SOD1 in the regulation of the cellular phosphorylation balance (4Juarez J.C. Manuia M. Burnett M.E. Betancourt O. Boivin B. Shaw D.E. Tonks N.K. Mazar A.P. Donate F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar) provides additional avenues for connecting the cellular role of SOD1 to FALS. The classical studies of SOD1 were generally performed using bovine erythrocyte SOD1 or recombinant human SOD1. Although recombinant methods are widely used to produce SOD1 mutants, a disadvantage of studying recombinant SOD1 is the absence of potentially important post-translational modifications present in human tissues. The initial SOD1 crystal structure was solved using bovine erythrocyte SOD1 (6Richardson J. Thomas K.A. Rubin B.H. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and no structure of human erythrocyte SOD1 is available. Here we report results using human erythrocyte SOD1 rather than the recombinant enzyme and find that the native enzyme features a consistent pattern of post-translational modifications. Using a combination of “bottom-up” and “top-down” mass spectrometry (MS) approaches, we show that SOD1 isolated from human erythrocytes is post-translationally phosphorylated and glutathionylated. These modifications occur near the SOD1 dimer interface. Because monomer formation is thought to be the first intermediate leading to SOD1 aggregation (7Khare S.D. Caplow M. Dokholyan N.V. Proc.

Isolation of hSOD1 from Erythrocytes—Expired human erythrocytes were obtained from the University of North Carolin-Chapel Hill Hospital blood bank. Human erythrocytes were preserved using one of several anticoagulants: AS-1, AS-3, or AS-5 (stored as long as 42 days before expiration). Bovine erythrocytes preserved with 0.38% sodium citrate were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR. SOD1 was isolated from human erythrocytes using a modification of the protocol originally used by McCord and Fridovich (9McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following acetone precipitation of SOD1, we dialyzed SOD1 against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and performed hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion exchange chromatography using an AKTA-FPLC to remove trace impurities. For hydrophobic interaction chromatography, dry (NH4)2SO4 was added to bring the final concentration to 55%. The protein was loaded onto a HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient from 2 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8. Fractions containing SOD1 were combined and dialyzed against salt-free 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and anion exchange chromatography was performed using a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8. The fractions containing SOD1 were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and concentrated. Isolation of hSOD1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae—Human wild type SOD1 was expressed using plasmid yEP351-hwtSOD1 in the EG118 SOD1-knock out yeast strain (both kindly provided by J. S. Valentine). Growth was carried out at 30 °C for 72 h in YPD media. We uses a modified isolation protocol adapted from Goscin and Fridovich (10Goscin S.A. Fridovich I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 289: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) where we replaced all steps, after stirring the lysate at room temperature, with high speed centrifugation and dialysis of the supernatant against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, to remove the chloroform and ethanol. Trace impurities were removed by MonoQ and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described above. Remetallation of hSOD1 from yeast was performed by successive dialysis at 4 °C against: (a) 50 mm acetate, pH 3.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA; (b) 50 mm acetate, pH 3.5, 150 mm NaCl; (c) 50 mm acetate, pH 3.5, 150 mm NaCl + CuSO4 (5-fold molar excess compared with [SOD1]); (d) 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl + ZnCl2 (5-fold molar excess compared with [SOD1]); and (e) 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl. Upon concentration with a YM-10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), a blue-green coloration was observed, indicating incorporation of copper into the enzyme. Microcapillary (μ) ESI-FT-ICR-MS Analysis (Top-down Approach)—MS spectra are acquired using a hybrid Qe-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR)-Mass Spectrometer, equipped with a 12.0-tesla actively shielded magnet (Apex Qe-FTICR-MS, 12.0 T AS, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), and an Apollo II microelectrospray source. The voltages on the μESI sprayer, interface plate, heated capillary exit, deflector, ion funnel, and skimmer were set at 4.3 kV, 3.9 kV, 300 V, 250 V, 175 V, and 80 V, respectively. The temperature of the μESI source was maintained at 180 °C. Desolvation was carried out using a nebulization gas flow (2.0 bar) and a countercurrent drying gas flow (4.0 liters/s). The electron capture dissociation (ECD) hollow dispenser cathode was heated to increase the temperature inside the ICR cell above 180 °C without application of ECD bias, eliminating non-covalent adducts. SOD1 sample solutions were directly infused using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and a 250-μl syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV), and electrosprayed at an infusion flow rate of 90 μl/h. Before transfer, ion packets are accumulated inside the collision cell for a duration of 0.2 s. 50 MS scans per spectrum were acquired in the ICR cell with a resolution of 580,000 at m/z 400. MS/MS Fragmentation for Sequencing Full-length Proteins—FT-MS/MS spectra were obtained from collision-induced dissociation (CID) performed with in-source collision-activated dissociation followed by collision cell-activated dissociation, or from ECD. In CID experiments, argon was used as the collision gas (PAr ≈ 1.6 × 10-6 torr). Precursor ions were isolated with Q1 (Mass Selective Quadrupole) and subjected to collision cell-activated dissociation using an isolation window width of 5 Da. 50 MS/MS scans were acquired in the ICR cell with a resolution of 580,000 at m/z 400. In ECD experiments, precursor ions were isolated with Q1 and subjected to ICR cell. Isolation window width was 10 Da. Low energy electrons were generated by a heated hollow dispenser cathode with a bias voltage of -1.5 V. ECD lens voltage was set at 15.0 V. The electrons produced by the hollow cathode were pulsed into the ICR cell with a pulse length of 0.0050 s, causing fragmentation of the ions that were already trapped in the ICR cell. To maximize the ion population before irradiation, the cell was filled with 5 iterations of ion accumulation from the external collision cell of the isolated precursor as suggested (11Borchers C.H. Thapar R. Petrotchenko E.V. Torres M.P. Speir J.P. Easterling M. Dominski Z. Marzluff W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3094-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In both CID and ECD experiments, 50 MS/MS scans per spectrum were acquired in the ICR cell with a resolution of 580,000 at m/z 400. Tempo LC MALDI Fractionation and MALDI-TOF-TOF Analysis (Bottom-up Approach)—SOD1 protein samples were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37 °C in an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:40 by mass. After desalting with ZipTipC18 (Millipore), 0.5 μl of the tryptic digests were directly spotted on a 384-well stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target plate for pre-scan using a MALDI time-of-flight/time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) tandem mass spectrometer (ABI 4800 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In an analytical run the peptide digests were further separated using a reverse phase liquid chromatography (LC) system (Tempo LC MALDI, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 10 μl of tryptic peptides were injected and directly loaded on a C18 capillary column (Monolithic silica RP C18 endcapped, 100 μm inner diameter, 15 cm length, Chromolith ® CapRod ®, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with a loading buffer (H2O/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, 98/2/0.1, v/v/v), and separated using a gradient from 100% A (H2O/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, 98/2/0.1, v/v/v) to 40% B (H2O/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, 2/98/0.1, v/v/v) over 70 min, and 40-80% B in 10 min, at a flow rate of 1.0 μl/min. The column eluates are mixed with a matrix solution of ∼7.0 mg/ml re-crystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in H2O/acetonitrile, 30/70 (v/v), and 5 mm ammonium citrate, deposited on a 2000-well stainless steel MALDI target plate at a frequency of 0.15 Hz, and analyzed by ABI 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF (200 Hz Nd:YAG laser, OptiBeam™). Each spot was analyzed in MS mode in the mass range of 800-4000 Da, by accumulating ion signals over 1200 laser shots. Up to 15 ions with a signal-to-noise ratio less than 30 were selected for MS/MS analysis, which was performed with a +1.0 kV collision energy and 1.0 × 10-6 torr collision gas (air) pressure. Acquisition of an MS/MS spectrum was interrupted when 2000 laser shots (40 sub-spectra from 50 laser shots each) were accumulated. Mass calibration was applied by spotting the standard peptide mixture at six places around the target plate (12Pflieger D. Junger M.A. Muller M. Rinner O. Lee H. Gehrig P.M. Gstaiger M. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 326-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Acquired MS and MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot 2.2 (Matrix Science, London, UK) embedded in GPS 3.5 (Applied Biosystems). Phosphatase Treatment of SOD1—To prepare dephosphorylated. SOD1 we use agarose-linked alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The beads were washed using 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, buffer and added to a solution of SOD1 at a 1:200 (v/v) ratio. The reaction was performed overnight at 37 °C. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE) and a 200-μl injection loop. The void volume of the column was ∼8 ml and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used at 4 °C. For measurement of the dimer dissociation constant, Kd, samples of SOD1 at pH 7.8 were diluted to 1.25 nm to facilitate dimer dissociation using the column running buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 μg/liter bovine serum albumin to prevent SOD1 adherence to the column and the glass collection tubes). Samples are incubated at 37 °C for up to 5 h to ensure proper equilibration. 250-μl fractions were collected throughout the chromatography experiment for use in immunoblotting. Fractions were acetone precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of cold acetone to the sample and a 1-h incubation at -20 °C. The samples are pelleted for 30 min at 20,000 rpm. The precipitated SOD1 was resuspended in protein solvent containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, blots were probed with a sheep anti-SOD1 primary antibody (Calbiochem number 574597) and a rabbit anti-sheep alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific number 31360). The blots are incubated in ECF reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using a GE Healthcare STORM 840 Phosphor-Imager. Quantification of band intensities is performed using the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Kd Determination Using SOD1 Activity—We tested for a reduction in the rate of 6-hydroxydopamine autoxidation as previously described (13Heikkila R.E. Cabbat F. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The assay was sufficiently sensitive to allow measurement of SOD1 concentrations as low as 100 pm. The activity of glutathionylated and non-glutathionylated 2.5 nm SOD1 was measured before and after a 3-h equilibration at 37 °C. Activity assays performed after 3 and 5 h incubation at 37 °C show no additional loss in activity, indicating that the monomer-dimer equilibrium was reached at 3 h. The percent dimer dissociation at equilibrium was determined using the following equation, %Dimer dissociation=%activityloss=1−(vC−vEvC−vI)(Eq. 1) where vc is the initial rate of the control reaction, vE is the initial rate of the reaction containing equilibrated SOD1, and vI is the initial rate of the reaction measured immediately upon dilution of SOD1 from a concentrated stock solution. Assuming a physiological SOD1 concentration of 40 μm (14Kurobe N. Suzuki F. Okajima K. Kato K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we calculated the monomer concentration based on the Kd. For a Kd of 2.25 nm, we expect the monomer concentration to be 212 nm. For a Kd of 5 nm, we expect a monomer concentration of 315 nm, a 67% increase. SOD1 Is Modified in Human Erythrocytes—Using a 12-tesla FT-ICR-MS with ultrahigh mass accuracy and resolution, full-length wild-type SOD1 from human erythrocytes was found to have a monoisotopic mass of 15837.8902 Da (Fig. 1A), corresponding to the theoretical mass of 15837.8812 Da for N-terminal acetylated wild-type human SOD1. In addition to the acetylated form, two strong peaks with masses of 15935.8702 and 16033.8462 Da corresponding to the respective addition of one (+98 Da) or two (+196 Da) hydrated phosphate groups were observed, as well as a third peak corresponding to the modification of SOD1 by glutathione (+305 Da). The protein was treated with alkaline phosphatase, which resulted in the loss of the +98 and +196 Da peaks (Fig. 1c), suggesting both sites are related to phosphorylation. To differentiate between the non-covalent association of H3PO4 or H2SO4 and a hydrated phosphate ester, both expected to result in the addition of ∼98 Da, we heated the ICR cell to above 180 °C. Heating results in the conversion of +98 and +196 Da peaks to +80 and +178 Da, respectively, but has no effect on the +305-Da shift (Fig. 1B). The CID/ECD spectra of the +80-Da peak (supplemental Fig. S1), which imply phosphorylation at threonine 2 (Thr-2) (Fig. 2B), are similar to those of the +98-Da peak (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that the +98-Da peak belongs to single phosphorylation plus one water molecule. Similarly, the CID/ECD spectra of the +178-Da peak indicates that it possibly arises from double phosphorylation plus one water molecule (supplemental Fig. S4). A +160-Da peak corresponding to double phosphorylation was only observed in SOD1 extracted from freshly drawn human erythrocytes (supplemental Fig. S9). However, the signal intensities of the +160, +178, and +196 Da peaks were insufficient for FT-ECD fragmentation experiments in mapping the second modification site. We found that human erythrocyte SOD1 is phosphorylated at Thr-2 (Fig. 2B, supplemental Figs. S1 and S2), but due to difficulty in sequencing doubly phosphorylated SOD1, even after the enrichment of phosphorylated protein, we can only report that a second phosphorylation is possibly located at either Thr-58 or Ser-59 (supplemental Fig. S4). Residues 58 and 59 are located in the zinc loop in SOD1, which both chelates the zinc atom at the active site and accounts for several dimer interface contacts. The site of glutathionylation in human SOD1 was determined by analyzing tryptic digestions of human erythrocyte SOD1 with Tempo LC-MALDI fractionation and MALDI-TOF-TOF. The acquired MS and MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot 2.2 embedded in GPS 3.5. In 13 unique SOD1 peptides, we found mass shifts of +305 Da from C-terminal ions y5 to y20 relative to the MS/MS spectra of the unmodified peptides (supplemental Fig. S3), which indicates that cysteine 111 (Cys-111) is susceptible to glutathionylation. Peptides containing cysteines 6, 57, and 146 were found not to be glutathionylated (supplemental Fig. S5). Human erythrocyte SOD1 was separated into multiple charge populations by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1D). Each population shows distinct modification patterns in its mass spectrum (Fig. 1E). The SOD1 that elutes at the highest ionic strength, population 3 (Fig. 1, D and E), has a dominant peak at m/z = 16142.9600 Da, corresponding to the acetylated protein derivatized with glutathione. The extent of phosphorylation varies in SOD1 populations 1 and 2 that elute at low and medium salt concentrations (Fig. 1, D and E). A pool of SOD1 that is simultaneously phosphorylated and glutathionylated was also observed (Fig. 1E). Distribution of Modifications in Individual Erythrocyte Samples—The modifications described above were observed in SOD1 isolated from erythrocytes pooled from multiple donors and as such, any modifications could have arisen due primarily to contributions from a single donor. To investigate the consistency of glutathionylation and phosphorylation levels between individuals, we next compared SOD1 from individual samples of human erythrocytes. Of six individual samples, five contained both phosphorylation and glutathionylation (Table 1). One sample lacked glutathione but was significantly phosphorylated. Assuming independent probabilities of phosphorylation and glutathionylation of SOD1, we expect the probability of observing both modifications to be the product of the individual frequencies. In erythrocyte samples 1-3, the calculated frequency of combined phosphorylation and glutathionylation is significantly smaller than the measured frequency, suggesting that phosphorylation and glutathionylation are co-dependent in the case of SOD1. However, the observed frequency of combined modification in samples 4 and 5 is only marginally higher than the expected frequency and is within the experimental error. This behavior may arise from differences in phosphatase activity among individuals, or other variables not controlled for in this study.TABLE 1Comparison of modifications in independent erythrocyte samplesSample No.Unmodified SOD1Phosphorylated SOD1Glutathionylated SOD1Both151.1 ± 11%8.5 ± 1.8% fP = 0.30 ± 0.0518.8 ± 3.9% fG = 0.41 ± 0.0621.7 ± 4.6% Expected = 12 ± 4%236.9 ± 2.9%6.6 ± 1.3% fP = 0.29 ± 0.0134.0 ± 3.6% fG = 0.57 ± 0.0522.6 ± 0.3% Expected = 16.5 ± 1.6%341.1 ± 5.0%14.4 ± 4.4% fP = 0.33 ± 0.0525.8 ± 1.5% fG = 0.45 ± 0.0218.7 ± 1.6% Expected = 14.7 ± 2.3%453.6 ± 0.7%22.5 ± 4% fP = 0.35 ± 0.0417.1 ± 3.6% fG = 0.29 ± 0.0412.2 ± 1.0% Expected = 10.2 ± 1.8%545.2 ± 3.0%14.6 ± 0.5% fP = 0.27 ± 0.0131.5 ± 3.1% fG = 0.44 ± 0.0312.0 ± 0.3% Expected = 11.6 ± 0.9%654.4 ± 11.4%45.6 ± 9.6%NoneNone Open table in a new tab Modifications in Freshly Drawn Human Erythrocytes—The phosphorylation and glutathionylation of human erythrocyte SOD1 does not occur as a result of long-term blood storage. We isolated SOD1 from human erythrocytes immediately following their collection from two donors. The results are summarized in Table 2. Mass spectra from each donor (ages 37 and 73 years) included major peaks related to both SOD1 phosphorylation and glutathionylation. In addition, we observed peaks related to oxidized SOD1. These peaks were shifted +16 and +32 Da from the unmodified mass of SOD1 (supplemental Fig. S9). Because there are no +16 or +32 Da shifted peaks relative to either phosphorylated or glutathionylated SOD1, we postulate that Cys-111 is the site of the oxidation, as has been observed in vitro (15Fujiwara N.

Alternatively, histidine residues in SOD1 might be oxidized because SOD1 lacks methionine and the oxidation of histidine residues in SOD1 has been observed previously (16Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note the abundance of oxidized SOD1 species in sample B compared with sample A given that the more highly oxidized sample was drawn from a 73-year-old donor, whereas sample A was drawn from a 37-year-old donor. However, a comparison based on only two samples is insufficient to support a hypothesis that the difference is related to age.TABLE 2Comparison of modifications in freshly drawn single erythrocyte samplesSample I.D.Unmodified SOD1Phosphorylated SOD1Glutathionylated SOD1BothA: age 3738.6 ± 5.8%13.3 ± 2.0% fP = 0.23 ± 0.0338 ± 5.7% fG = 0.48 ± 0.0610.1 ± 1.5% Expected = 11.3 ± 2.0%B: age 7337.4 ± 5.6%8.4 ± 1.3% fP = 0.22 ± 0.0240.8 ± 6.1% fG = 0.54 ± 0.0613.4 ± 2.0% Expected = 11.% ± 1.7% Open table in a new tab Species/System Effects on Modifications—Because S. cerevisiae contain a copper chaperone for SOD1, it is widely used for expressing recombinant human SOD1, but do phosphorylation and glutathionylation of human SOD1 occur in yeast or other systems used to isolate SOD1? To answer this question, we purified and analyzed recombinant SOD1 from yeast, as well as endogenous SOD1 from both yeast and bovine erythrocytes. Mass spectra of human SOD1 isolated from S. cerevisiae indicate an exact match with the acetylated, unmodified SOD1 found in human erythrocytes (supplemental Fig. S8). We separated a sample of yeast-expressed human SOD1 into subpopulations of high and low negative net charge and found similar mass shifts in the deconvoluted mass spectra indicating SOD1 glutathionylation but not phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S8). The mass spectrum of SOD1 isolated from bovine erythrocytes using the identical protocol used for human erythrocytes indicates bovine SOD is neither phosphorylated nor glutathionylated, nor is endogenous yeast SOD1 (supplemental Figs. S6 and S7, respectively), an expected result given that neither species has a cysteine at position 111 in SOD1. Cysteine 6 is conserved between bovine and human SOD1 but we find no glutathionylation of this residue in either species. We hypothesize that SOD1 phosphorylation was not previously observed due to the common use of bovine erythrocyte SOD1 or recombinant human SOD1. Effect of Modifications on SOD1 Dimer Dissociation—Thr-2 appears to be at a sufficient distance so as not to participate directly in the SOD1 dimer interface. However, phosphorylation can change both the structure and dynamics of proteins (17Baker J.M. Hudson R.P. Kanelis V. Choy W.Y. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and thus, the distance from the interface and the active site does not preclude Thr-2 phosphorylation from altering the stability or activity of SOD1. Cys-111 residues in each SOD1 monomer are directly apposed in a cleft at the dimer interface. We postulated that the addition of the glutathione tripeptide to Cys-111 will result in a measurable decrease in SOD1 dimer stability. Because of the proximity of both Thr-2 phosphorylation and Cys-111 glutathionylation to the dimer interface and evidence that dimer stability is important for preventing SOD1 aggregation (18Ray S.S.

Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3639-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we measured the effect of glutathionylation and phosphorylation on the in vitro stability of dimeric SOD1. Using size exclusion chromatography, we compared SOD1 species separated by anion exchange as described above (peaks 1 and 3 in Fig. 1E). Altered dimer stability of SOD1 in peak 3 relative to peak 1 is expected to be the result of Cys-111 glutathionylation because substoichiometric amounts of phosphorylation are present in both SOD1 species. Due to the unusually high stability of the SOD1 dimer (the dissociation constant of human SOD1 isolated from yeast is less than 10 nm (20Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Schirf V. Demeler B. Valentine J.S. Hansen J.C. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54558-54566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)), it was necessary to perform the experiment at low concentrations. To observe dissociation into monomers, we performed size exclusion chromatography using 1.25 nm SOD1. We compared SOD1 with and without glutathionylation and found that glutathionylation has a marked destabilizing effect on the SOD1 dimer. Progressive SOD1 dimer dissociation was observed upon incubation at 37 °C for up to 5 h. We observed a 3-fold increase in monomer formation in glutathionylated SOD1 relative to SOD1 unmodified by glutathione (Fig. 3). Kd Determination Using an Assay for SOD1 Activity—Monomeric SOD1 was postulated to have reduced activity based on findings that mutations forcing monomeric SOD1 show an 80% activity loss (21Ferraroni M.

How these different signaling pathways converge on Maf1 is not known. Previous work in yeast indicates that protein kinase A (PKA) regulates RNA polymerase (pol) III transcription, in part, by phosphorylating multiple sites in Maf1. Here we present additional evidence for this view and show that a parallel nutrient and stress-sensing pathway involving Sch9, an homologous kinase to metazoan S6 kinase, targets Maf1 at a subset of PKA sites. Using ATP analog-sensitive alleles of PKA and Sch9, we find that these two kinases account for the bulk of the phosphorylation on consensus PKA sites in Maf1. Deletion of Sch9 reduces RNA pol III transcription in a Maf1-dependent manner, yet the cells remain susceptible to further repression by rapamycin and other treatments. Because the rapamycin-sensitive kinase activity of the TORC1 complex is necessary for Sch9 function in vivo and in vitro, our results show that transcriptional regulation of RNA pol III and the coordinate control of ribosomal protein genes can be achieved by Sch9-dependent and -independent branches of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway.

In addition, human Maf1 is known to directly repress RNA pol II transcription of certain protein coding genes such as the TATA box-binding protein, TBP, and to indirectly repress transcription by RNA pol I (3Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Repression by Maf1 occurs in response to a wide variety of nutritional and stress conditions, but the nature of the signaling pathways mediating these responses and how they converge on Maf1 is largely unknown (5Willis I.M. Moir R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Maf1 is phosphorylated on consensus PKA sites under optimal growth conditions and is rapidly dephosphorylated under starvation or stress conditions that repress transcription (5Willis I.M.

Nuclear import of Maf1 is directed by two redundant nuclear localization sequences (NtNLS and CtNLS) that are differentially sensitive to PKA site phosphorylation. Specifically, the NtNLS is inhibited by phosphorylation as acidic substitutions at the PKA sites, which are normally fully functional, can prevent nuclear import and repression when the CtNLS is disabled (6Moir R.D.

The localization of Maf1 in the cytoplasm serves to fine-tune its regulation but is not essential for preventing repression at inappropriate times. The accumulation of Maf1 in the nucleus, either by mutation of the protein or by deletion of the exportin of the protein, Msn5, does not cause repression in the absence of additional changes triggered by cellular signaling pathways (6Moir R.D.

In this study, we show that PKA and another member of the AGC kinase family, Sch9, which is a direct downstream target of TOR (12Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O.

Regulation of Maf1 Involves Phosphorylation on Multiple Consensus PKA Sites—Saccharomyces cerevisiae Maf1 contains three pairs of clustered PKA consensus sites (serines 90, 101, 177, 178, 209, and 210). Phosphorylation of these sites negatively regulates the function of the NtNLS, one of two redundant NLSs in Maf1 (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the importance of specific PKA sites in repression by Maf1 is unknown. To address this question, we first examined the phosphorylation of double, quadruple, and sextuple serine to alanine substitution mutants of the PKA consensus sites. Cell lysates prepared from log phase cultures of the various mutants were subjected to high resolution SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As seen previously (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N.

For each double mutant, we observed a decrease in the relative amount of the slow migrating form when compared with wild type. The changes were modest in the S209A,S210A mutant, pronounced in the S90A,S101A mutant, and complete in the S177A,S178A mutant, where only the fast migrating form was seen (Fig. 1A). In the S90A,S101A,S209A,S210A quadruple mutant, a further reduction in the amount of the slow migrating form of Maf1 was observed when compared with the parental double mutants. These data are consistent with the results of several mass spectrometry studies, which have detected phosphorylation of Maf1 at all six consensus PKA sites (15Chi A. Huttenhower C. Geer L.Y.

To examine PKA site phosphorylation in Maf1 directly, the various mutants were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with a phospho-PKA substrate-specific antibody (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Comparable amounts of Maf1 were detected in all samples (Fig. 1B, lower panel), and quantitative analysis of the blots showed that the total level of Maf1 phosphorylation (normalized for Maf1-Myc loading) was reduced to ∼77% (S90A,S101A), ∼65% (S177A,S178A), and ∼20% (S209A,S210A) of wild type in the double mutants. All quadruple mutants had less than 5% of the phosphorylation of wild-type Maf1, and no phosphorylation was detected in the 6SA mutant (simultaneous mutation of all six PKA phosphorylation sites to alanine). Notably, the S177A,S178A mutant, which retains around two-thirds of the total phosphate content on PKA sites shows only the fast migrating band in high resolving gels, whereas the S209A,S210A mutant with only one-fifth of the phosphate content of wild-type Maf1 has equivalent amounts of the slow and fast migrating species. Clearly, the migration of Maf1 in high resolving gels is especially sensitive to phosphorylation at Ser-177 and/or Ser-178. Perhaps more importantly, differences in the migration of Maf1 in high resolving gels may not always be correlated with the total level of phosphorylation. Simultaneous mutation of all six PKA phosphorylation sites to glutamic acid (6SE) has no effect on repression by Maf1 (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, in the context of a mutation that cripples the CtNLS, the 6SE mutation renders Maf1 inactive for rapamycin-mediated repression (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We used this assay to evaluate whether double or quadruple mutations to glutamic acid at different pairs of PKA phosphorylation sites compromise the function of Maf1. When compared with the parental ΔCtNLS mutant, which is partially defective in repression (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the only double mutant that showed a significant decrease in Maf1 function was S209E,S210E (Fig. 1C). A comparable defect was caused by the S90E,S101E,S177E,S178E mutant. The other quadruple mutants were impaired to an extent that was not statistically different from the sextuple mutant (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that each pair of consensus PKA sites contributes, albeit modestly, to the regulation of Maf1 function. Phosphorylation of Maf1 by PKA in Yeast—Hyperactivation of PKA (by deletion of the Bcy1 regulatory subunit or an activating RAS2Val-19 mutation) promotes the phosphorylation of Maf1 and blocks repression of RNA pol III transcription under multiple conditions (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the Tpk1 isoform of PKA can phosphorylate recombinant Maf1 in vitro (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, carbon source-switching experiments show that although hyperactivation of PKA blocks repression of RNA pol III transcription upon transfer from fermentable glucose to non-fermentable glycerol, it does not prevent Maf1 dephosphorylation (18Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggested that PKA targets proteins other than Maf1 in the regulation of RNA pol III transcription and raised questions about the glycerol-induced dephosphorylation of Maf1 in the hyperactive PKA strain. Accordingly, we felt that additional evidence was needed to strengthen the proposal that Maf1 is phosphorylated by PKA in vivo. As a first approach, we tested the effect of overexpressing different PKA catalytic subunits. Cells containing GST, GST-Tpk1, or GST-Tpk2 under the control of a GAL1 promoter were grown to log phase in raffinose-containing medium, and galactose was added to induce expression of the GST construct. Western blotting of Maf1 on high resolving gels showed that the protein is present predominantly in the fast migrating form prior to and after induction of the GST control (Fig. 2A). In contrast, induction of GST-Tpk1 or GST-Tpk2 led to a significant increase in the relative amount of the slow migrating form. These results are consistent with the idea that Tpk1 and Tpk2 can phosphorylate Maf1 in yeast cells. We next tested whether deletion of all three PKA catalytic subunits (tpk1,2,3Δ) affected the level of Maf1 phosphorylation in log phase cells grown on glucose. Because the tpk1,2,3Δ mutation is lethal in an otherwise wild-type background, these experiments were conducted in a strain that was also deleted for the stress-response transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 to maintain strain viability (11Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). High resolving gel analysis showed Maf1 to be predominantly hyperphosphorylated in both the msn2,4Δ and the msn2,4Δ tpk1,2,3Δ strains but showed, as expected, only the fast migrating form of Maf1 after rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2B). However, when assayed by Maf1 immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, a modest but reproducible reduction in Maf1 phosphorylation was observed (to 70 ± 17% of wild type, n = 3, Fig. 2C). Along with other experiments described below, these data support our earlier conclusion that Maf1 is phosphorylated by PKA in yeast (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, we reasoned that the modest change in the level of PKA site phosphorylation of Maf1 in the tpk1,2,3Δ strain might be due to the compensatory effect of another kinase. Sch9 Phosphorylates Maf1 on Consensus PKA Sites—In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that Sch9 and PKA act in parallel pathways and regulate similar sets of functions (11Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For example, nutrient-sensitive signaling by TORC1 kinase involves direct phosphorylation of Sch9 (12Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and together with RAS/PKA signaling in response to the carbon source, determines the transcription of ribosome biosynthetic genes (11Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Because RNA pol III transcription is coordinately regulated with the transcription of rDNA and RP genes (1Upadhya R. Lee J. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we considered that Sch9 might be a Maf1 kinase. To examine this possibility, extracts of log phase cells from wild-type and sch9Δ strains were analyzed on a high resolving gel. Notably, the sch9Δ extract contained only the fast migrating hypophosphorylated form of Maf1 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, in several independent experiments, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting showed that deletion of SCH9 reduced the level of phosphorylation at consensus PKA sites by ∼30 ± 13% (n = 3). These data indicate that Sch9 and PKA have overlapping target sites in Maf1. Next, we purified GST fusion proteins of wild-type Sch9 and a kinase-dead mutant form of the enzyme and performed in vitro kinase assays using purified recombinant S. cerevisiae Maf1 as a substrate. The wild-type enzyme exhibited autophosphorylation as reported previously (12Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and readily phosphorylated recombinant Maf1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, a slightly larger amount of kinase-dead Sch9 showed no detectable autophosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of Maf1 was dramatically reduced (<5% of the wild-type activity, normalized for Maf1 loading, Fig. 3C). Residual phosphorylation of Maf1 in this case presumably reflects the presence of contaminating kinase(s) in the preparation. Taken together, these data show that Sch9 is a Maf1 kinase. Finally, we tested the extent to which the preceding effects of Sch9 and PKA were due to separate, convergent actions of the kinases on Maf1 as opposed to potential cross-pathway effects by utilizing ATP analog-sensitive mutants of both enzymes. This strategy is broadly applicable to study protein kinase function and involves a single residue substitution in the conserved ATP-binding pocket of a kinase to confer chemical sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors (19Gregan J. Zhang C. Rumpf C. Cipak L. Li Z. Uluocak P. Nasmyth K. Shokat K.M. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The strains used in our experiments either contain tpk1, tpk2, and tpk3 analog-sensitive mutations (designated pka) or an analog-sensitive sch9 mutation or combine all of these mutations (designated pka sch9). Previous work with these strains has demonstrated the cooperative role of Sch9 and PKA in regulating autophagy (13Yorimitsu T. Zaman S. Broach J.R. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4180-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A time course of treatment of the pka sch9 strain with the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 indicated that the phosphorylation of Maf1 on consensus PKA sites was largely eliminated after 30 min (Fig. 3D). This effect was specific to the pka sch9 strain because the wild-type, pka, and sch9 strains showed no effect on Maf1 phosphorylation after a 1-h treatment (Fig. 3E). This suggests that PKA and Sch9 independently target consensus PKA sites in Maf1. Deletion of Sch9 Causes a Maf1-dependent Reduction of RNA pol III Transcription—The functional overlap between the PKA and Sch9 pathways (11Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) together with the phosphorylation of Maf1 by these kinases and the effects of deregulating or deleting PKA on RNA pol III transcription (6Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggested that perturbing SCH9 would likely impact tRNA synthesis. Indeed, deletion of SCH9 reduced pre-tRNALeu synthesis to 24 ± 6% (n = 7) of the wild-type level under otherwise optimal growth conditions (Fig. 4, A and C). Importantly, this reduction in transcription is dependent on Maf1. Moreover, the reduced transcription in the sch9Δ strain is further diminished by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 4, A and C) and by all other repressing conditions that we have tested (including entry into stationary phase and treatments with tunicamycin, chlorpromazine, and methyl methane sulfonate). 4J. Lee, R. D. Moir, and I. M. Willis, unpublished results. This result has important implications for TORC1 regulation of RNA pol III transcription. Rapamycin treatment inhibits TORC1 and TORC1-regulated Sch9 kinase activity (12Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Therefore, if TORC1 acts exclusively through Sch9 to promote transcription by RNA pol III, then rapamycin should have an equivalent inhibitory effect in wild-type and sch9Δ strains. This is not the case (Fig. 4, A and C). The substantial further reduction of transcription in the rapamycin-treated sch9Δ strain indicates that TORC1 can also regulate RNA pol III transcription through an Sch9-independent pathway. Comparable results are seen for TORC1 regulation of RP gene transcription (Fig. 4, B and D) where a role for Sch9 has been known from numerous other studies (11Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The reduced transcription of RP genes in sch9Δ cells is further inhibited by rapamycin. These effects on RP genes parallel other recent findings (20Smets B. De Snijder P. Engelen K. Joossens E. Ghillebert R. Thevissen K. Marchal K. Winderickx J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2008; 8: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and together support the conclusion that TOR regulation of ribosome and tRNA synthesis involves a bifurcation of the pathway downstream of TORC1 into minimally two branches, only one of which includes Sch9. Maf1 phosphorylation at consensus PKA sites can alter its distribution between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and provides one level of control over its function. However, as noted earlier, the localization of Maf1 in the cytoplasm is not an essential feature of its regulation because phospho-regulation of Maf1 can be accomplished when the protein is restricted to the nucleus by deletion of its exportin, Msn5 (10Towpik J. Graczyk D. Gajda A. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17168-17174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, the role of both PKA and Sch9 in regulating Maf1 and its interactions with RNA pol III is compatible with the localization of Maf1 in either the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Tpk1 is localized to both compartments, whereas Tpk2 is primarily nuclear and is known to associate with the promoters of RP genes (21Pokholok D.K. Zeitlinger J. Hannett N.M. Reynolds D.B. Young R.A. Science. 2006; 313: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Sch9 is predominantly localized to the vacuole membrane (12Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). A pool of TORC1 is also found at this location (22De Virgilio C. Loewith R. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6392-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, a fraction of the cellular TORC1 and Sch9 is also present in the nucleus. TORC1 is physically associated with rDNA (23Li H. Tsang C.K. Watkins M. Bertram P.G. Zheng X.F. Nature. 2006; 442: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) in a rapamycin- and nutrient-sensitive manner, and Sch9 is known to associate with genes in response to osmotic stress (24Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3098-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, both functional and localization data are consistent with the ability of PKA and Sch9 to phosphorylate Maf1 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Conclusion—In the regulation of RNA pol III transcription, integration of the TOR and PKA pathways involves the phosphorylation of overlapping sites in Maf1 by Sch9 and PKA. These data, together with other studies (5Willis I.M. Moir R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A.

Additional TORC1 regulation of RNA pol III transcription is achieved via an Sch9-independent pathway. We thank Jim Broach for the analog-sensitive strains."

Like all flaviviruses, DENV possesses an ∼11-kb, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is translated as one long polyprotein and cleaved into 10 viral proteins: three structural (capsid, pre-membrane/membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins (2.Lindenbach B.D.

NLSs confer interaction with members of the importin (Imp) superfamily of transporters (either an Imp-α/β heterodimer or Imp-β or a homolog thereof), which mediate the translocation of a cargo into the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the cargo-NLS-Imp complex is dissociated through binding of Ran-GTP to Imp-β, releasing the cargo into the nucleoplasm. Analogously, proteins containing nuclear export sequences (NESs) interact with Imp-β homologs termed exportins, which, when complexed with Ran-GTP, mediate translocation out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm (14.Fried H.

The C-terminal NLS (amino acids 369–405) or “aNLS” is recognized by Imp-α/β with high affinity and is able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus in either microinjected or mechanically perforated rat hepatoma cells (29.Forwood J.K. Brooks A. Briggs L.J. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal NLS (amino acids 320–368) or “bNLS” is able to bind either Imp-β or NS3 directly in a competitive fashion (30.Brooks A.J. Johansson M. John A.V. Xu Y. Jans D.A.

We demonstrated recently that when NS5 nuclear import is impaired by mutation of the viral genome, the virus is no longer viable, indicating that NS5 nuclear import is essential for virus replication (11.Pryor M.J. Rawlinson S.M. Butcher R.E. Barton C.L. Waterhouse T.A. Vasudevan S.G. Bardin P.G. Wright P.J. Jans D.A. Davidson A.D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is attributable, at least in part, to the role of nuclear NS5 in inhibiting induction of the antiviral chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) during DENV infection; reduced NS5 nuclear accumulation correlates with increased virus production (11.Pryor M.J. Rawlinson S.M. Butcher R.E. Barton C.L. Waterhouse T.A. Vasudevan S.G. Bardin P.G. Wright P.J. Jans D.A. Davidson A.D.

At least one of the roles of nuclear NS5 is thus to reduce the magnitude of the antiviral response in terms of IL-8 induction. The undisputed role of NS5 is in replication in the cytoplasm. Here, we shed light for the first time on how despite its efficient nuclear localization ability, NS5 is able to fulfill this role. We report the ability of NS5 to be exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent fashion in both transfected and DENV-2-infected cells and identify the NES responsible. Importantly, we show that inhibition of CRM1 during DENV-2 infection results in increased nuclear NS5, reduced IL-8 induction, and increased virus production, underlining the importance of NS5 nuclear export to DENV infection. Our results thus establish for the first time the ability of NS5 to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and its importance to modulation of the host antiviral response and virus replication. Vero, 293, and HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. C6/36 mosquito (Aedes albopictus) cells used for infection were cultured in basal Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. DENV-2 New Guinea C strain-infected Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Where indicated, 5 ng/ml LMB (provided by M. Yoshida) was added to the culture medium at 0 h post-infection. At specific time points post-infection, the culture medium was collected for virus titration, and coverslips were seeded with Vero cells fixed for indirect immunofluorescence (see below). Virus titers, calculated as plaque-forming units/ml, were determined in plaque assays using C6/36 cells (33.Gualano R.C. Pryor M.J. Cauchi M.R. Wright P.J. Davidson A.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). DNA transfection of Vero cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, 2.8 ng/ml LMB was added to the culture medium 15–19 h post-transfection, and live cell imaging was performed (see below) at 20–24 h post-transfection. Constructs expressing full-length and truncated NS5 forms fused in-frame with GFP at the N terminus (see Fig. 1) were generated using GatewayTM cloning technology (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, NS5 PCR fragments from the DENV-2 Townsville strain (TSV01) were generated using primers designed to include attB1 or attB2 sites to allow integration into the Gateway system. These truncations were inserted into the pDONR207 vector by the BP-Reaction (Invitrogen) and subsequently into the mammalian GFP fusion protein construct pEPI-GFP (34.Ghildyal R. Ho A. Wagstaff K.M.

Hydrophobic regions (HR1–HR3) (Fig. 1) were selected as putative NES regions based on their similarity to known NESs (35.la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Leucine/isoleucine/valine residues within these regions were mutated to alanine to generate mHR1–mHR3, whereby primers containing the appropriate mutations were designed and used in overlap extension PCR as described previously (36.Ho S.N.

https://openalex.org/W2146969450,"Tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia is a well-established phenomenon, often limiting its usefulness in the long-term treatment of pain. The mechanisms underlying tolerance are not well understood. We previously suggested a possible role for spinal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the development of tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia. In the present study, we demonstrate that CGRP is involved in morphine tolerance by differentially regulating the ERK-dependent up-regulation of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in astrocytes and p38-dependent up-regulation of IL-6 in microglia in the rat spinal cord. A 7-d treatment with morphine induced tolerance to the antinociceptive effect and increased phosphorylated ERK localized in astrocytes and phosphorylated p38 enriched in microglia, both effects being inhibited by blocking CGRP receptors. Interestingly, the inhibition of the ERK pathway suppressed the development of tolerance and morphine-induced up-regulation of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and mPGES-1. Blockade of p38 activity also inhibited the development of tolerance and morphine-induced IL-6 up-regulation. Taken together, these data suggest that chronic morphine induces the synthesis of CGRP, which in turn acts on CGRP receptors located on astrocytes and microglia to stimulate ERK and p38, respectively, leading to increased synthesis and release of proinflammatory mediators resulting in tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia."

In Gouldian finches ( Erythrura gouldiae ), females paired with genetically incompatible males of alternative color morphs overproduce sons, presumably to reduce investment in inviable daughters. We also observed a reduced overall investment in clutch size, egg size, and care to offspring resulting from incompatible matings. Within-female experimental pairings demonstrate that female birds have the ability to adaptively adjust the sex of their eggs and allocate resources on the basis of partner quality. Female Gouldian finches thus make cumulative strategic allocation decisions to minimize the costs of poor-quality pairings when faced with a genetically incompatible partner."

The NMR structures of a mutant of E. coli RelE toxin, RelER81A/R83A, with reduced toxicity and its complex with an inhibitory peptide from RelB antitoxin, RelBC (Lys47-Leu79), have been determined. In the free RelER81A/R83A structure, helix α4 at the C terminus adopts a closed conformation contacting with the β-sheet core and adjacent loops. In the RelER81A/R83A-RelBC complex, helix α3* of RelBC displaces α4 of RelER81A/R83A from the binding site on the β-sheet core. This helix replacement results in neutralization of a conserved positively charged cluster of RelE by acidic residues from α3* of RelB. The released helix α4 becomes unfolded, adopting an open conformation with increased mobility. The displacement of α4 disrupts the geometry of critical residues, including Arg81 and Tyr87, in a putative active site of RelE toxin.

Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Overexpression of certain toxins induces cellular dormancy, also called a quasi-dormant state, which enables cell survival for prolonged times during environmental stresses (4Suzuki M. Zhang J.

Recently, TA systems have been linked to medically important phenomena such as biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance (6Lewis K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2008; 322: 107-131PubMed Google Scholar). To date, TA toxins are known to perturb one or more vital processes, such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein translation, by targeting DNA gyrase (7Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Condon C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and/or ribosomes (5Liu M. Zhang Y. Inouye M.

Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A subgroup of toxins, including MazF, RelE, and YoeB, is named as mRNA interferase (11Yanaguchi Y. Inouye M. Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 85: 467-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), because they perturb the stability of mRNA by sequence-specific cleavage. Among these toxins, MazF is well established as an ACA sequence-specific endoribonuclease, which cleaves free single-stranded mRNA in the absence of ribosome (12Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In contrast, RelE cannot cleave free mRNA transcripts. It cleaves translating mRNA associated with the ribosome at the ribosomal A-site (10Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In this manner, RelE is a ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase, and preferential cleavage occurs at the second position of stop codons (UAG, UAA, and UGA) and some sense codons (CAG and UCG), with the UAG (amber) stop codon and the CAG (glutamine) codon being cleaved most efficiently (13Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). YoeB was initially recognized as a purine-specific endoribonuclease with preference to AG-rich regions, albeit with low efficiency (14Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, it was recently found that YoeB binds to the 50 S subunit in 70 S ribosomes and leads to efficient mRNA cleavage at the ribosomal A-site (15Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, both RelE and YoeB toxins trigger mRNA cleavage in a ribosome-dependent mode, which is distinct from the ribosome-independent mechanism of MazF. Even though the functionality of Escherichia coli RelE has been extensively characterized, the structural mechanism is still elusive. Here we determined the NMR structures of a low toxicity mutant of RelE, RelER81A/R83A, and its complex with the C-terminal region of RelB, RelBC (Lys47-Leu79). Comparison of the free and RelBC-bound RelER81A/R83A reveals a large conformational change at the putative active site of the RelE toxin. The present structural studies indicate a direct inhibition mechanism for the RelE-RelB addiction module. Protein Sample Preparation—Recombinant expression and purification were carried out as described previously for RelBC (Lys47-Leu79) and wild-type RelE (16Li G.Y. Zhang Y. Inouye M. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). RelER81A/R83A mutant was obtained using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Unlabeled or isotope-enriched (e.g. 15N or 15N,13C) protein was purified from crude lysate using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography. For NMR spectroscopy, all samples were prepared in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, or in 99% D2O. Protein Synthesis Inhibition Assay on a Prokaryotic Cell-free System—Prokaryotic cell-free protein synthesis was carried out with an E. coli T7 S30 extract system (Promega). The reaction mixture consisted of 10 μl of S30 premix, 7.5 μl of S30 extract, and 2.5 μl of an amino acid mixture (1 mm each of all amino acids except methionine), 1 μl of [35S]methionine, and different amounts of RelE in a final volume of 29 μl. The different amounts of RelE and RelBC were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C before the assay started by adding 1 μl of pET-11a-MazG plasmid-DNA (0.16 μg/μl). The reaction was performed for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and proteins were then precipitated with acetone and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Preparation of E. coli 70 S Ribosomes—70 S ribosomes were prepared from E. coli MRE 600 as described previously (17Aoki H. Ke L. Poppe S.M. Poel T.J. Weaver E.A. Gadwood R.C. Thomas R.C.

Bacterial cells (2 g) were suspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cells were lysed by French press. After incubation with RNase-free DNase (30 min at 0 °C), cell debris was removed by centrifugation two times at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C with a Beckman 50Ti rotor. The supernatant (three-fourth volume from the top) was then layered over an equal volume of 1.1 m sucrose in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.5 m NH4Cl) and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C with a Beckman 50Ti rotor. After washing with buffer A, the ribosome pellets were resuspended in buffer A and applied to a linear 5-40% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared in buffer A and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C with a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Gradients were fractionated, and the 70 S ribosome fractions were pooled and pelleted at 45,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C with a Beckman 50Ti rotor. The 70 S ribosome pellets were resuspended in buffer A before they were stored at -80 °C. Toeprinting Assays—Toeprinting was carried out as described previously (18Moll I. Blasi U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. The mixture for primer-template annealing containing mRNA and 32P-end-labeled DNA primer was incubated at 70 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. The ribosome-binding mixture contained 2 μl of 10× buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 100 mm MgCl2, 600 mm NH4Cl, and 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), different amounts of RelE, 0.375 mm dNTP, 0.05 μm 70 S ribosomal subunits, 1 μm tRNAfMet, and 2 μl of the annealing mixture in a final volume of 20 μl. The final mRNA concentration was 0.035 μm. This ribosome-binding mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then reverse transcriptase (2 units) was added. The cDNA synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 12 μl of the sequencing loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol EF). The sample was incubated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The ompA mRNA was synthesized in vitro from a DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter and a part of the opening reading frame using T7 RNA polymerase. The DNA fragment for ompA (248 bp), which had the initiation codon at the center, was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers and chromosome DNA as the template. The 5′-end primers for ompA contained the T7 promoter sequence. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded on Inova 500 MHz (Varian) and Avance 600 and 800 MHz (Bruker) spectrometers. All data were collected at 23.5 °C. Backbone and side chain resonance assignments for both free and bound states of RelBC and RelER81A/R83A were accomplished with the standard triple resonance experiments described previously (19Kanelis V. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (i.e. HNCACB, CBCACONH, CCCTOCSYNH, HCCTOCSYNH, and HNCO with samples in 90% H2O; HCCHCOSY and HCCHTOCSY with samples in 99% D2O). Both 15N- and 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC spectra were acquired on 15N,13C-RelER81A/R83A, 15N,13C-RelER81A/R83A-RelBC and 15N,13C-RelBC-RelER81A/R83A samples for the final structural calculations. The intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) were distinguished from the intramolecular NOEs by 13C/15N-filtered (F1) 13C-edited (F2) nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC spectra (20Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Compound chemical shift changes of both RelER81A/R83A and RelBC upon their interactions were calculated from the chemical shift of HN, N, CA, and CB nuclei with the weighted formula as described previously (21Mal T.K.

Chemical shift data have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank with accession codes 16065, 16066, and 16067 for the RelER81A/R83A-RelBC complex, free RelER81A/R83A, and free RelBC, respectively. Structure Calculation and Refinement—The three-dimensional structures of free RelER81A/R83A and the RelER81A/R83A-RelBC complex were calculated using CYANA (25Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) with standard protocols. NOE-based distance constraints were obtained from a combination of manual and CYANA-based automated NOE assignment procedures (26Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle (φ/ψ) constraints were estimated from chemical shifts using TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond constraints were generated based on the locations of predicted secondary structure for the protected NH groups in H2O/D2O solvent exchange experiments. The final structures were refined using CNS with water as the explicit solvent (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2KC8 and 2KC9 for the RelER81A/R83A-RelBC complex and free RelER81A/R83A, respectively. RelBC Abolishes the Residual Catalytic Activity of RelER81A/R83A—Overexpression of wild-type RelE alone in E. coli markedly hindered cell growth because of its cytotoxicity. RelB antitoxin neutralizes RelE toxicity by forming a nontoxic complex. Therefore, RelE can be coexpressed with RelB and isolated from the RelB-RelE complex through a denaturation and refolding procedure (16Li G.Y. Zhang Y. Inouye M. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, the refolded RelE protein is unstable in solution at elevated concentrations (i.e. 0.1-0.2 mm). The resonance assignments of refolded wild-type RelE were hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio and poor magnetization transfer in three-dimensional NMR experiments. We overcame this obstacle by using a low toxicity mutant, RelER81A/R83A (Fig. 1A), which allowed us to purify enough protein under native conditions for structural studies. Comparison of the mRNA interferase activity of wild-type RelE with RelER81A/R83A indicates that the mutation significantly reduces but does not abolish its activity in both cell-free protein synthesis (Fig. 1B) and toeprinting assays (Fig. 1C). The residual activity of RelER81A/R83A is completely abolished by the addition of the C-terminal domain of RelB antitoxin, RelBC (residues Lys47 to Leu79) (Fig. 1, A-C). These observations suggest that RelER81A/R83A represents a structural model of wild type in an active conformation, whereas the complex of RelER81A/R83A and RelBC represents a model of an inactive conformation. The structural properties of RelER81A/R83A mutant and wild-type RelE were compared using NMR spectroscopy. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the mutant in both free and RelBC-bound states show high similarity to those of the wild type, indicating the structural integrity and the ability for RelB binding were not significantly affected by the mutagenesis (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). The affinities of RelBC binding to wild-type RelE and RelER81A/R83A mutant were then measured using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence method, by the virtue of only one tryptophan residue (Trp15) existing in RelE toxin. The dissociation constant (KD) of wild type is 154 ± 15 nm and that of RelER81A/R83A is 200 ± 24 nm, indicating that the mutational effect on the affinity is marginal (supplemental Fig. S2). RelER81A/R83A and RelBC Interaction Characterized by NMR Spectroscopy—A substantial improvement in line width and magnetization transfer was observed for spectra recorded on RelER81A/R83A compared with the refolded wild-type RelE (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Titration of 15N,13C-labeled RelER81A/R83A with unlabeled RelBC showed significant chemical shift perturbation in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2, A and C). A pair of NH resonances corresponding to each residue in both free and RelBC-bound states was observed during the titration, indicative of a slow exchange regime on the NMR time scale. The slow exchange spectral change is consistent with a high affinity in the range of 10-7 m. A 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N,13C-labeled RelBC alone displays poor dispersion of NH resonance (7.9-8.5 ppm), indicating that this C-terminal region of RelB is largely unstructured in its free state (Fig. 2B). Titration of labeled RelBC with unlabeled RelER81A/R83A shows dramatic chemical shift changes in a similar slow exchange regime (Fig. 2, B and D). The well dispersed spectrum of RelBC in the bound state suggests that RelER81A/R83A binding induces the folding of RelBC. Resonance assignments of RelER81A/R83A and RelBC in both free and bound states were accomplished using a standard set of triple resonance procedures (19Kanelis V. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The chemical shift index analysis (30Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) of RelBC peptide in both free and bound states revealed a disordered-to-ordered conformation change upon the complex formation (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). On the other hand, the chemical shift index analysis of RelER81A/R83A revealed an unfolding of a C-terminal helix (α4) coupled with RelBC binding (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). The three-dimensional structures of RelER81A/R83A alone and in complex with RelBC were determined by using a combination of manual and automated NOE assignment procedures (supplemental Table 1). Structures of RelER81A/R83A—The ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures of RelER81A/R83A shows a well defined α/β sandwich fold with approximate dimensions of 36 × 30 × 30 Å (Fig. 3A). The overall topology is βαααβββα, in which four strands form a β-sheet core surrounded by four α-helices (Fig. 3B). Three consecutive anti-parallel β-strands (β2-β4) pack into a classic meander motif (31Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. Structure (Lond.). 1993; 1: 105-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), providing a scaffold for folding of the protein. The N-terminal strand (β1) and the helix hairpin, formed by two long helices (α1 and α2), are tightly associated to one side of the β-meander core through numerous hydrophobic contacts. In particular, the hydrophobic residues (Val22, Leu26, Leu30, Val31, Val33, and Leu34) from the amphipathic α2 form extensive contacts with one side of the twisted β-sheet, which is composed entirely of hydrophobic residues (Leu5 and Phe7 from β1; Ile53 and Leu55 from β2; Tyr60, Leu62, Tyr64, and Val66 from β3; and, Val73, Val75, and Val78 from β4). A long linking region that connects α2 and β2 wraps around the same side of the β-sheet, providing additional stabilizing interactions to the main hydrophobic core. A short 3-10 helix (α3) is situated in the middle of the long loop region. In contrast, the other side of the central β-sheet is more exposed to solvent. The C terminus of RelER81A/R83A forms a helix (α4), which associates with the protruded surface of the central β-meander motif. This interaction is supported by α3-β2 loop and β1-α1 junction regions through both hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts (Fig. 3, A and B and Fig. 4A), burying a total surface area of ∼1100 Å2. A positively charged and highly conserved cluster (including Arg45, Lys52, Lys54, Arg56, Arg61, Lys80, Arg81, and Arg83) is located adjacent to the interface of the β-sheet and helix α4 (Fig. 4D).

Residues from both main domains of RelE and the C-terminal α4 helix form an active site for the toxicity of RelE. Hence the closed conformation of α4 is in a catalytically competent position (details under “Discussion”).FIGURE 4The interface and electrostatic properties of RelER81A/R83A and RelBC.

Two prolines (Pro69 and Pro71) mediate the formation of a turn between helix α3* and strand β2*, bending the polypeptide chain by ∼90°. This perpendicular orientation of α3* and β2* provides a concave surface that interacts with a convex interface on RelE. The α3* contacts with the surface of the central β-meander motif, termed interface site I, and the β2* contacts with the surface formed by β1-α1-α2 elements of RelE, termed interface site II. At site I, helix α3* of RelBC displaces α4 of RelER81A/R83A, through hydrophobic interactions with β3 (Val63), β4 (Ile76), and loop α3-β2 (Leu44 and Met47) (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the orientation of α3* along the β-sheet surface is tilted by 36° compared with α4. An acidic patch (Asp53*, Glu54*, Asp55*, and Glu57*) at the N terminus of helix α3* of RelBC (Fig. 4, B and F) directly neutralizes the positively charged cluster at the putative RNA-binding site of RelER81A/R83A (Arg45, Lys52, Lys54, and Arg61) (Fig. 4E). At site II, the β2* of RelBC forms an inter-molecular anti-parallel β-sheet with adjacent β1 of RelER81A/R83A. The remaining C-terminal residues of RelBC form a rigid turn conformation and anchor to the surface of the α1-α2 hairpin (Fig. 4C). Hydrophobic side chains of Val74*, Leu76*, and Leu79* from RelBC interact with a hydrophobic patch of RelER81A/R83A formed by residues from β1 (Leu5 and Phe7), α1 (Leu12 and Trp15), and α2 (Leu30 and Val31). The unique chemical shifts of δ1 (0.09 ppm) and δ2(-0.61 ppm) protons of Leu79* are consistent with the determined structure, in which methyl groups of Leu79* point to the center of the hydrophobic pocket and pack against the indole ring of Trp15. Solvent-exposed basic residues (Arg16, Arg23, Lys27, and Lys28) surround the hydrophobic patch, forming another positively charged surface (Fig. 4H), which is neutralized by Asp77* and Glu78* and the C-terminal carboxylate group of Leu79* (Fig. 4I). Overall, both hydrophobic and electrostatic forces stabilize the complex formation of RelER81A/R83A and RelBC. In total, RelBC peptide buries a large solvent-accessible surface area of about 2700 Å2, which encompasses both site I and site II. RelB Perturbs the Integrity of the Active Site of RelE by Inducing Conformational Changes—Comparison of RelBC-bound RelER81A/R83A to the unbound structure reveals a pronounced conformational change of α4 and adjacent loops (loop α3-β2 and β4-α4). The α4 swings out from the surface of the central β-sheet as it is displaced by the amphipathic helix α3* from RelBC in the complex (Figs. 3 and 4). The large chemical shift perturbation in the C-terminal tail region of RelER81A/R83A by RelBC is because of a conformational change rather than direct interaction (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). The released α4 becomes unfolded, as evidenced by the chemical shift index analysis results (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). To further probe the structure and dynamic nature of the RelE toxin, we examined the internal motion of RelER81A/R83A by measuring 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE (hetNOE) relaxation data (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). With the exception of the N- and C-terminal residues, the hetNOE values for the main domain of RelER81A/R83A in both free and RelBC-bound states are relatively uniform. The relatively high magnitude of the NOE values (>0.8) for residues within the structured core domain (residues 4-79) is characteristic of a well folded globular structure. By contrast, the C-terminal tail region (residues 80-95) displays lower hetNOE values (0.5-0.7) in the RelBC-free state than that seen for the core domain. These data indicate that the C-terminal helix α4 possesses an increased internal mobility despite the fact that the tail is found as part of the folded structure in the RelBC-free state of RelER81A/R83A. The transverse relaxation rate (R2) values of residues in this tail region as well as in the adjacent loops are significantly higher than the average value of the whole protein in the free state (supplemental Fig. S5C). It is likely that this region undergoes a conformational exchange between the associated (closed) state found in the NMR-driven structure and an isolated (open) state that could not be seen in the structure. Upon binding of RelBC, RelER81A/R83A displays large changes in both the hetNOE and R2 values, especially around the C-terminal helix α4 region. A dramatic reduction in hetNOE and R2 values within the α4 region is observed, indicating an increase in the mobility of this region (supplemental Fig. S5, B and D). This observation is fully consistent with the release of this helix from the core structure upon RelBC binding. Concomitant to this structure and dynamic change associated with α4, the dynamic property of the loop α3-β2 region is also significantly altered by RelBC binding; residues Leu44, Gly46, and Asp49 become more dynamic in the bound state than in the free state (supplemental Fig. S5). This region is in close proximity to the C-terminal helix α4 in the free state and the α3* in the bound state, and is presumably affected by the conformational change associated with the toxin-antitoxin interaction. Among the toxin-antitoxin systems, RelE family toxins have the widest phylogenetic distribution in the prokaryotic genomes (8Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), being found in diverse bacterial and archaeal lineages (33Gerdes K. Moller-Jensen J. Bugge Jensen R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The E. coli RelE is one of the best characterized TA toxins in terms of both in vivo and in vitro functional studies (13Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M.

Here, we report the finding that targeting of CNG channels to the rod outer segment required their interaction with ankyrin-G. Ankyrin-G localized exclusively to rod outer segments, coimmunoprecipitated with the CNG channel, and bound to the C-terminal domain of the channel β1 subunit. Ankyrin-G depletion in neonatal mouse retinas markedly reduced CNG channel expression. Transgenic expression of CNG channel β-subunit mutants in Xenopus rods showed that ankyrin-G binding was necessary and sufficient for targeting of the β1 subunit to outer segments. Thus, ankyrin-G is required for transport of CNG channels to the plasma membrane of rod outer segments."
https://openalex.org/W2094702925,"The mechanism of the four-electron reduction of dioxygen by a multicopper oxidase, CueO, was studied based on reactions of single and double mutants with Cys(500), a type I copper ligand, and the noncoordinating Asp(112) and Glu(506), which form hydrogen bonds with the trinuclear copper center directly and indirectly via a water molecule. The reaction of C500S containing a vacant type I copper center produced intermediate I in an EPR-silent peroxide-bound form. The formation of intermediate I from C500S/D112N was restricted due to a reduction in the affinity of the trinuclear copper center for dioxygen. The state of intermediate I was realized to be the resting form of C500S/E506Q and C500S of the truncated mutant Deltaalpha5-7CueO, in which the 50 amino acids covering the substrate-binding site were removed. Reactions of the recombinant CueO and E506Q afforded intermediate II, a fully oxidized form different from the resting one, with a very broad EPR signal, g < 2, detectable only at cryogenic temperatures and unsaturated with high power microwaves. The lifetime of intermediate II was prolonged by the mutation at Glu(506) involved in the donation of protons. The structure of intermediates I and II and the mechanism of the four-electron reduction of dioxygen driven by Asp(112) and Glu(506) are discussed."

Interestingly, to date the exact origin of these stem cells remains to be determined, making intestinal metamorphosis a unique model to study development of adult organ-specific stem cells. Here, to determine their origin, we made use of transgenic Xenopus tadpoles expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) for recombinant organ cultures. The larval epithelium separated from the wild-type (Wt) or GFP transgenic (Tg) intestine before metamorphic climax was recombined with homologous and heterologous nonepithelial tissues and was cultivated in the presence of thyroid hormone, the causative agent of metamorphosis. In all kinds of recombinant intestine, adult progenitor cells expressing markers for intestinal stem cells such as sonic hedgehog became detectable and then differentiated into the adult epithelium expressing intestinal fatty acid binding-protein, a marker for absorptive cells. Notably, whenever the epithelium was derived from Tg intestine, both the adult progenitor/stem cells and their differentiated cells expressed GFP, whereas neither of them expressed GFP in the Wt-derived epithelium. Our results provide direct evidence that stem cells that generate the adult intestinal epithelium originate from the larval epithelium, through thyroid hormone-induced dedifferentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2010264483,"Excessive receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) signaling causes enhanced osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Thus, down-regulation of RANKL expression or its downstream signals may be a therapeutic approach to the treatment of pathological bone loss. In this study, we investigated the effects of Trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue, on osteoclastogenesis and RANKL signaling. Trolox potently inhibited interleukin-1-induced osteoclast formation in bone marrow cell-osteoblast coculture by abrogating RANKL induction in osteoblasts. This RANKL reduction was attributed to the reduced production of prostaglandin E(2) via a down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 activity. We also found that Trolox inhibited osteoclast formation from bone marrow macrophages induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus RANKL in a reversible manner. Trolox was effective only when present during the early stage of culture, which implies that it targets early osteoclast precursors. Pretreatment with Trolox did not affect RANKL-induced early signaling pathways, including MAPKs, NF-kappaB, and Akt. We found that Trolox down-regulated the induction by RANKL of c-Fos protein by suppressing its translation. Ectopic overexpression of c-Fos rescued the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by Trolox in bone marrow macrophages. Trolox also suppressed interleukin-1-induced osteoclast formation and bone loss in mouse calvarial bone. Taken together, our findings indicate that Trolox prevents osteoclast formation and bone loss by inhibiting both RANKL induction in osteoblasts and c-Fos expression in osteoclast precursors."

Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 581-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with one molecule of Pch tetradentately coordinated to Fe3+ and the second molecule bound bidentately to complete the octahedral geometry (19Tseng C.F. Burger A. Mislin G.L.A. Schalk I.J. Yu S.S.-F. Chan S.I. Abdallah M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pch has poor water solubility, and its Fe3+ affinity was determined in ethanol as 2 × 105m (10Cox C.D. Rinehart Jr., K.L. Moore M.L. Cook Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4256-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This is low compared with other siderophores, and it is possible that in aqueous solution at physiological pH the affinity for iron is higher. Once loaded with Fe3+, Pch is recognized at the cell surface of P. aeruginosa and transported into the periplasm by a specific outer membrane transporter, FptA. The structure of this protein (20Cobessi D. Celia H. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is typical of this class of transporters; a transmembrane 22-β-stranded barrel occluded by an N-terminal domain containing a mixed four-stranded β-sheet. The Pch binding pocket is principally composed of hydrophobic and aromatic residues, consistent with the hydrophobicity of this siderophore. In the x-ray FptA structure, a Fe-Pch complex was found in the binding site of FptA, where Pch provided a tetradentate coordination of iron. Ethylene glycol, originating from the purification procedure, provided the remaining bidentate coordination (20Cobessi D. Celia H. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The presence of such a complex in the x-ray FptA structure showed that one molecule of Pch is sufficient for a ferric Pch complex to be recognized by the transporter. The second chelator providing the remaining bidentate coordination does not interact with the transporter and can, therefore, be a different molecule, e.g. the siderophore cepabactin, which was found in such a ternary complex (21Klumpp C. Burger A. Mislin G.L. Abdallah M.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Mislin G.L.A. Hoegy F. Cobessi D. Poole K. Rognan D. Schalk I.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 produces the siderophore enantio-pyochelin (EPch, see Fig. 1), the optical antipode of Pch (23Youard Z.A. Mislin G.L. Majcherczyk P.A. Schalk I.J. Reimmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35546-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EPch was found to promote growth under iron-limiting conditions in P. fluorescens and to act as an inducer of its own biosynthetic genes (23Youard Z.A. Mislin G.L. Majcherczyk P.A. Schalk I.J. Reimmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35546-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thus resembling Pch, which is both a siderophore and a signaling molecule in P. aeruginosa (14Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Cox C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 581-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, EPch did not promote growth in P. aeruginosa and neither did Pch in P. fluorescens (23Youard Z.A. Mislin G.L. Majcherczyk P.A. Schalk I.J. Reimmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35546-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that both the EPch- and Pch-mediated iron uptake machineries are highly stereospecific in the two species. Fe-EPch is transported in P. fluorescens CHA0 by a homolog of the P. fluorescens Pf-5 transporter PFL_3498, which we have named FetA (23Youard Z.A. Mislin G.L. Majcherczyk P.A. Schalk I.J. Reimmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35546-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison between FptA of P. aeruginosa and FetA of P. fluorescens showed that the two receptors are not closely related and that the amino acids interacting with Pch in the crystallized FptA receptor (20Cobessi D. Celia H. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) are not conserved in FetA. We, thus, wondered whether FptA and FetA would be able to interact with the siderophore of the other species. Using 55Fe, we show here that both receptors, FptA and FetA, are highly stereoselective and do not bind and transport the ferrisiderophore of the other species. We also show by growth promotion experiments that the preference of P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens for Pch and EPch, respectively, can be inverted by swapping the siderophore uptake systems between the two species. From our docking experiments on the FptA structure and from binding assays, we conclude that the stereospecificity of the FptA-Pch interaction relies to a large extent on the stereochemical configuration at the chiral centers C2″ and C4″, whereas the conformation at C4′ is less important. Chemicals—Pch, neopyochelin (NeoPch), and EPch were synthesized and purified according to previously published protocols (23Youard Z.A. Mislin G.L. Majcherczyk P.A. Schalk I.J. Reimmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35546-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 249-256Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Carbenicillin disodium salt was provided from Euromedex. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was purchased from Sigma. 55FeCl3 was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences with a specific activity of 93.76 Ci/g. This radioactive 55Fe solution was diluted with nonradioactive iron to 9.4 Ci/g. Siderophore-55Fe complexes (55Fe-Pch, 55Fe-NeoPch, or 55Fe-EPch) were prepared at concentrations of 10 μm55Fe with a siderophore:iron (mol:mol) ratio of 20:1. The solutions were prepared using a 10 mm solution of siderophores (in methanol). To 20 μl of these solutions were added 40 μl of a solution of 55FeCl3 (250 μm, 9.4 Ci/g in HCl, 0.5 n), obtained by dilution of the stock solution. The mixtures were incubated 15 min at room temperature before the addition of 940 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Media and Growth Conditions—Bacteria were routinely grown on nutrient agar and in nutrient yeast broth or LB (25Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Res. 1972; 19: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) at 37 °C (P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) or 30°C (P. fluorescens). When P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa cells were used for binding and iron uptake assays, growth occurred in succinate medium (composition was 6.0 g/liter K2HPO4, 3.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 1.0 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 4.0 g/liter sodium succinate, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NaOH (27Demange P. Wendenbaum S. Linget C. Mertz C. Cung M.T. Dell A. Abdallah M.A. Biol. Metals. 1990; 3: 155-170Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) at 30 °C. Siderophore-mediated growth promotion experiments were performed in minimal medium M9 (25Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with 0.5% glycerol as a carbon source. Iron limitation was achieved in this medium by adding the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl at 500 μm. Where necessary, antibiotics were added to growth media at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml tetracycline for E. coli and 100 μg/ml tetracycline for Pseudomonas. To counterselect E. coli donor cells in gene replacement experiments, chloramphenicol was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Mutant enrichment was performed with tetracycline at 20 μg/ml and carbenicillin (for P. aeruginosa) at 2 mg/ml or cycloserine (for P. fluorescens) at 50 mg/ml, respectively. Strains and Plasmids—All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Gene replacement mutants were generated with suicide plasmids as described previously (28Laville J. Blumer C. Von Schroetter C. Gaia V. Defago G. Keel C. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schnider U. Keel C. Blumer C. Troxler J. Defago G. Haas D. J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3606-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the suicide plasmids were mobilized from E. coli to P. aeruginosa or P. fluorescens using the helper plasmid pME497 and chromosomally integrated, with selection for tetracycline resistance. Excision of the vector via a second crossing-over was obtained by enrichment for tetracycline-sensitive cells using carbenicillin (for P. aeruginosa) or cycloserine (for P. fluorescens). The suicide plasmid pME7531 used to generate a 1025-bp deletion in the fetA gene (=PFL_3498 in P. fluorescens Pf-5) was constructed as follows. Two PCR fragments of 0.6 kilobase carrying the 3′ and 5′ ends of fetA, respectively, were generated from chromosomal DNA of P. fluorescens CHA0 using the primers rez-1 (ACGTGAATTCATGGGTAGCCGCGTTGCGC) together with rez-2 (ACGTGGATCCGATCTGGTTGACCACGCCC) and using rez-3 (ACGTGGATCCGCAATCGGAAGTGGGGGTC) together with rez-4 (ACGTAAGCTTACCAGCGATAGCGCAGGCT). Fragment 1, cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI, was ligated to BamHI- and HindIII-trimmed fragment 2 and cloned into the suicide vector pME3087 between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. Plasmid pME7531 was then introduced into P. fluorescens CHA400 and CHA1085 to generate the corresponding mutants CHA1080 and CHA1169, respectively.TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsNameRelevant characteristicsReference or sourceP. fluorescens strainsCHA0Wild type53Voisard C.

Bachelard A. Reimmann C. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All gene replacement mutants were checked by PCR. To swap the Pch and EPch transport genes between the two Pseudomonas species, the genes were cloned under the control of the lac promoter in pME6000 as follows. The P. aeruginosa Pch transport genes fptABCX were excised from pME7036 on a 5.9-kilobase HindIII-XbaI fragment and ligated to HindIII-XbaI-cleaved pME6000 to give pME9629. To generate plasmid pME9630, the CHA0 homologs of PFL_3498 to PFL_3503, which encode FetA and a putative ABC transporter, were PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of CHA0 using primers XL1-ftp (ACGTGGATCCTGCTCGAGCCTGCTCCATCC) and XL1-rtp (ACGTAAGCTTTCGTTCGCCCGAAGGTTACC). The resulting 7.5-kilobase fragment was trimmed with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into pME6000, cleaved with the same enzymes. DNA Manipulation and Sequencing—Small- and large-scale preparations of plasmid DNA were made with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and Jetstar kit (Genomed GmbH), respectively. DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels with the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA) or the MinElute and QIAquick Gel Extraction kits from Qiagen. DNA manipulations were performed according to standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. fluorescens was carried out by electroporation (32Farinha M.A. Kropinski A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 58: 221-225PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and an ABI-PRISM 373 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems) or was carried out commercially. The DNA sequence of the P. fluorescens CHA0 fetA gene was deposited at GenBank™ under accession number FJ641192. Data base searches were conducted at NCBI using BLAST algorithms. Ligand Binding Assays Using 55Fe—The in vivo dissociation constants (Kd) of 55Fe-Pch, 55Fe-NeoPch, and 55Fe-EPch complexes to FptA and FetA were determined according to the following procedure (33Hoegy F. Celia H. Mislin G.L. Vincent M. Gallay J. Schalk I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20222-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PAD07 and CHA1085 cells were washed twice with an equal volume of fresh medium and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer at an A600 of 0.3 and 1.5, respectively. Cells were then first incubated for 15 min in the presence of 200 μm CCCP to avoid iron uptake and afterward for 1 h at 0 °C ina final volume of 500 μl with 0.1–200 nm55Fe-Pch, 55Fe-NeoPch, or 55Fe-EPch, prepared as described above under “Chemicals.” The mixtures were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatants containing the unbound siderophore-55Fe were removed. The tubes containing the cell pellets were counted for radioactivity in scintillation mixture. To evaluate a nonspecific binding of 55Fe-Pch, 55Fe-NeoPch, or 55Fe-EPch, binding experiments were repeated in parallel for each concentration of siderophore with the same strains grown in LB medium. In this iron-rich medium, neither FptA nor FetA receptors were expressed. Kd values were determined using the Scatchard representation. Iron Uptake—Iron uptake assays were carried out as previously reported for the FptA/Pch system (22Mislin G.L.A. Hoegy F. Cobessi D. Poole K. Rognan D. Schalk I.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After an overnight culture (20 h), bacteria were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at A600 of 1 for P. aeruginosa or at A600 of 5 for P. fluorescens and incubated at 37 °C. Transport assays were started by adding 100 nm55Fe-Pch, 55Fe-NeoPch, or 55Fe-EPch prepared as described above under “Chemicals.” To separate siderophore-55Fe transported into P. aeruginosa cells from unbound siderophore-55Fe, aliquots (100 μl) of the suspensions were removed at different times and filtered, and the retained radioactivity was counted in scintillation mixture. For P. fluorescens, aliquots (300 μl) of the cell suspensions were removed, mixed with 600 μl of cold Tris buffer, and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 3 min). The supernatants containing the unbound siderophore were removed, and the tubes containing the cell pellets were counted for radioactivity in scintillation mixture. This difference in the protocols used for P. aeruginosa cells and P. fluorescens cells is due to different levels of FptA and FetA expression, which led us to use much higher cell concentrations for experiments with P. fluorescens. As controls, the experiments were repeated with cells incubated at 0 °C in the presence of 200 μm CCCP and in the absence of cells. Docking—Standard settings of the docking program GOLD Version4.0 (34Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar) were used to dock Fe-PchI and Fe-EPchI. Ligand three-dimensional structures (mol2 format) were obtained from two-dimensional sketches using Marvin Sketch (ChemAxon Ltd) and further converted into three-dimensional coordinates using Corina (Molecular Networks GmbH). The iron-bound EPchI molecule assumed a tetravalent coordination of the iron atom, as seen in the FptA-bound structure of FptA (20Cobessi D. Celia H. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The FptA binding cavity was defined as any atom within a 6.5 Å radius sphere centered on the center of mass of PchI in the ptA-PchI x-ray structure (20Cobessi D. Celia H. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Docking poses were further analyzed by docking score (Goldscore), and the percentage of ligand surface was buried upon binding. Binding of Pch Diastereoisomers to FptA and FetA—The specificity of iron uptake in Gram-negative bacteria is regulated at the cell surface by siderophore outer membrane transporters. These proteins are highly specific for one or a few siderophores. To investigate the binding specificities of FptA and FetA, we carried out binding assays using 55Fe-loaded Pch diastereoisomers. To avoid competition with endogenous siderophores, we used the P. aeruginosa Pch- and Pvd-deficient strain PAD07 and the P. fluorescens EPch- and Pvd-deficient strain CHA1085. To measure only the binding of the siderophore-55Fe to the outer membrane transporter without any uptake into the bacteria, the binding assays were carried out in the presence of the protonophore CCCP. In the presence of this compound, the siderophore outer membrane transporter is still able to bind its ferrisiderophore, but the TonB machinery and, therefore iron uptake, is inhibited. The Pch stereoisomers used for these experiments were synthesized and purified as reported previously (23Youard Z.A. Mislin G.L. Majcherczyk P.A. Schalk I.J. Reimmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35546-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 249-256Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The purification procedure used did not separate the diastereoisomer couples. However, in the presence of a metal ion (Fe3+ and Zn2+), PchII isomerizes into PchI (35Barnard T.J. Watson M.E. McIntosh M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Rinehart K.L. Staley A.L. Wilson S.R. Ankenbauer R.G. Cox C.D. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2786-2791Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by epimerization of the C2″ carbon atom (Fig. 1). The thioamine function included in the thiazolidine ring can undergo ring opening and closure (37Schlegel K. Taraz K. Budzikiewicz H. Biometals. 2004; 17: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The configuration of the C2″ carbon atom, located between the thiazolidine nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms, is therefore highly labile, especially in the presence of a Lewis acid like a metal ion. Thus, the metal ion may drive its ligand isomerization to optimize the chelation properties through a template effect. For Pch diastereoisomers, where the hydrogen atoms H2″ and H4″ are in cis, the carboxylate, the thiazoline nitrogen, the thiazolidine nitrogen, and the phenol oxygen have a suitable geometry to form a tetradentate ligand of the metal. On the contrary, for the diastereoisomers where the hydrogen atoms H2″ and H4″ are in trans, the carboxylate is too distant from the metal to coordinate; these isomers are bare chelators. Similar metal-induced epimerization of C2″ may also occur in the other diastereoisomer pairs (Fig. 1). Therefore, the mixtures used were: PchI/II, which is PchI and PchII in the absence of iron and mainly PchI in the presence of iron; NeoPchI/II, which is NeoPchI and NeoPchII in the absence of iron and mainly NeoPchI when loaded with iron; EPchI/II, which is EPchI and EPchII in the absence of iron and mainly EPchI in the presence of iron. We measured binding of Pch, NeoPch, and EPch to the outer membrane receptors of P. aeruginosa (FptA) and P. fluorescens (FetA). For 55Fe-Pch, a Kd of 2.5 nm ± 1.1 was determined for FptA, whereas no binding was observed to the P. fluorescens receptor (Table 2). Likewise, 55Fe-NeoPch bound FptA, although with a 10-fold lower affinity (29 nm ± 11) than 55Fe-Pch, and no binding occurred to FetA (Table 2). Binding of 55Fe-NeoPch to FptA was reported previously by our group (2"

The B subunit of the V1 catalytic headgroup interacted with the H subunit N-terminal domain (H-NT), and the C-terminal domain (H-CT) interacted with V1 subunits B, E (peripheral stalk), and D (central stalk), and the cytosolic N-terminal domain of V0 subunit Vph1p. V1-ATPase complexes from yeast expressing H-NT are partially inhibited, exhibiting 26% the MgATPase activity of complexes with no H subunit. The H-CT domain does not copurify with V1 when expressed in yeast, but the bacterially expressed and purified H-CT domain inhibits MgATPase activity in V1 lacking H almost as well as the full-length H subunit. Binding of full-length H subunit to V1 was more stable than binding of either H-NT or H-CT, suggesting that both domains contribute to binding and inhibition. Intact H and H-CT can bind to the expressed N-terminal domain of Vph1p, but this fragment of Vph1p does not bind to V1 complexes containing subunit H. We propose that upon disassembly, the H subunit undergoes a conformational change that inhibits V1-ATPase activity and precludes V0 interactions. Disassembly of the yeast V-ATPase into cytosolic V1 and membrane V0 sectors inactivates MgATPase activity of the V1-ATPase. This inactivation requires the V1 H subunit (Parra, K. J., Keenan, K.

We propose that upon disassembly, the H subunit undergoes a conformational change that inhibits V1-ATPase activity and precludes V0 interactions. V-ATPases are ubiquitous proton pumps responsible for compartment acidification in all eukaryotic cells (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 2Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These pumps couple hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton transport into the lysosome/vacuole, endosomes, Golgi apparatus, clathrin-coated vesicles, and synaptic vesicles. Through their role in organelle acidification, V-ATPases are linked to cellular functions as diverse as protein sorting and targeting, zymogen activation, cytosolic pH homeostasis, and resistance to multiple types of stress (3Li S.C. Kane P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 650-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). They are also recruited to the plasma membrane of certain cells, where they catalyze proton export (4Breton S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F1-F10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are evolutionarily related to ATP synthases of bacteria and mitochondria and consist of two multisubunit complexes, V1 and V0, which contain the sites for ATP hydrolysis and proton transport, respectively. Like the ATP synthase (F-ATPase), V-ATPases utilize a rotational catalytic mechanism. ATP binding and hydrolysis in the three catalytic subunits of the V1 sector generate sequential conformational changes that drive rotation of a central stalk (6Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H.

Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The central stalk subunits are connected to a ring of proteolipid subunits in the V0 sector that bind protons to be transported. The actual transport is believed to occur at the interface of the proteolipids and V0 subunit a. Rotational catalysis will be productive in proton transport only if V0 subunit a is held stationary, whereas the proteolipid ring rotates (8Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This “stator function” resides in a single peripheral stalk in F-ATPases (9Walker J.E. Dickson V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Dickson V.K. Silvester J.A. Fearnley I.M. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E.

The peripheral stator stalks link V0 subunit a to the catalytic headgroup and ensures that there is rotation of the central stalk complex relative to the V0 a subunit and catalytic headgroup. Eukaryotic V-ATPases are highly conserved in both their overall structure and the sequences of individual subunits. Although homologs of most subunits of eukaryotic V-ATPases are present in archaebacterial V-ATPases (also known as A-ATPases), the C and H subunits are unique to eukaryotes. Both subunits have been localized at the interface of the V1 and V0 sectors, suggesting that they are positioned to play a critical role in structural and functional interaction between the two sectors (14Venzke D. Domgall I. Kocher T. Fethiere J. Fischer S. Bottcher B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The yeast C and H subunits are the only eukaryotic V-ATPase subunits for which x-ray crystal structures are available (17Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The structure of the C subunit revealed an elongated “dumbbell-shaped” molecule, with foot, head, and neck domains (18Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The structure of the H subunit indicated two domains. The N-terminal 348 amino acids fold into a series of HEAT repeats and are connected by a 4-amino acid linker to a C-terminal domain containing amino acids 352–478 (17Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These two domains have partially separable functions in the context of the assembled V-ATPase (19Liu M. Tarsio M. Charsky C.M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36978-36985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Complexes containing only the N-terminal domain of the H subunit (H-NT) 2The abbreviations used are: H-NT, N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–348) of the yeast H subunit; H-CT, C-terminal domain (amino acids 352–478) of the yeast H subunit; V1(-H), V1 complexes lacking subunit H isolated from a vma13Δ mutant yeast strain; V1(-H)/H-NT, V1 complexes containing H-NT isolated from a vma13Δ strain expressing H-NT from a plasmid; Vph1-NT, N-terminal domain of Vph1p (amino acids 1–406); MBP, maltose-binding protein; SC, synthetic complete medium (fully supplemented minimal medium); NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. 2The abbreviations used are: H-NT, N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–348) of the yeast H subunit; H-CT, C-terminal domain (amino acids 352–478) of the yeast H subunit; V1(-H), V1 complexes lacking subunit H isolated from a vma13Δ mutant yeast strain; V1(-H)/H-NT, V1 complexes containing H-NT isolated from a vma13Δ strain expressing H-NT from a plasmid; Vph1-NT, N-terminal domain of Vph1p (amino acids 1–406); MBP, maltose-binding protein; SC, synthetic complete medium (fully supplemented minimal medium); NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. supported some ATP hydrolysis but little or no proton pumping in isolated vacuolar vesicles (19Liu M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 29099-29108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (H-CT) assembled with the rest of the V-ATPase in the absence of intact subunit H, but supported neither ATPase nor proton pumping activity (19Liu M. Tarsio M. Charsky C.M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36978-36985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, co-expression of the H-NT and H-CT domains results in assembly of both sectors with the V-ATPase and allows increased ATP-driven proton pumping in isolated vacuolar vesicles. These results suggest that the H-NT and H-CT domains play distinct and complementary roles even when the two domains are not covalently attached. In addition to their role as dedicated proton pumps, eukaryotic V-ATPases are also distinguished from F-ATPases and archaeal V-ATPases in their regulation. Eukaryotic V-ATPases are regulated in part by reversible disassembly of the V1 complex from the V0 complex (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 21Beyenbach K.W. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 22Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In yeast, disassembly of previously assembled complexes occurs in response to glucose deprivation, and reassembly is rapidly induced by glucose readdition to glucose-deprived cells. Disassembly down-regulates pump activity, and both the disassembled sectors are inactivated. Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis in free V1 sectors is particularly critical, because release of an active ATPase into the cytosol could deplete cytosolic ATP stores. This inhibition is dependent in part on the H subunit. V1 complexes isolated from vma13Δ mutants, which lack the H subunit gene (V1(-H) complexes) have MgATPase activity. Consistent with a physiological role for H subunit inhibition of V1, heterozygous diploids containing elevated levels of free V1 complexes without subunit H have severe growth defects (23Rizzo J.M. Tarsio M. Martinez-Munoz G.A. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8521-8532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). V1 complexes containing subunit H have no MgATPase activity, but retain some CaATPase activity, suggesting a role for nucleotides in inhibition (24Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Graf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Consistent with such a role, both the CaATPase activity of native V1 and the MgATPase activity of V1(-H) complexes are lost within a few minutes of nucleotide addition (24Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A number of points of interaction between the H subunit and the V1 and V0 complexes have been identified through two-hybrid assays, binding of expressed proteins, and cross-linking experiments. These experiments have indicated that the H subunit binds to V1 subunits E and G of the V-ATPase peripheral stalks (26Fethiere J. Venzke D. Madden D.R. Bottcher B.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4512-4519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have found that cysteines introduced into the C-terminal domain of subunit H can be cross-linked to subunit F in isolated V1 sectors via a 10-Å cross-linking reagent. In this work, we examine both the subunit-subunit interactions and functional roles of the H-NT and H-CT domains in inhibition of V1-ATPase activity. When expressed in yeast cells lacking subunit H, H-NT can be isolated with cytosolic V1 complexes, but H-CT cannot. We find that both of these domains contribute to inhibition of ATPase activity, but that stable binding to V1 and full inhibition of activity requires both domains. We also find that the H-CT can bind to the cytosolic N-terminal domain of V0 subunit Vph1p (Vph1-NT) in isolation, but does not support tight binding of Vph1-NT to isolated V1 complexes. Materials and Media—N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads, and FLAG peptide were all purchased from Sigma. The amylose resin, anti-MBP monocolonal antibody, and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. Anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech, and TaKaRa LA-Taq was purchased from Fisher. pGEM-T Easy TA cloning kit was purchased from Promega. Escherichia coli and yeast media were from Fisher. E. coli cells were grown in LB broth supplemented with 2 g/liter glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Strains and Plasmids—Congenic vma13Δ and vma10Δ mutants in the BY4741 background (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) were purchased from Research Genetics/OpenBiosystems. The BY4742 vma10Δ::natR strain (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 vma10Δ::natR) was constructed as described (23Rizzo J.M. Tarsio M. Martinez-Munoz G.A. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8521-8532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These haploid cells were mated, and the resulting diploids were sporulated and tetrads dissected to obtain the vma13Δ::kanR vma10ΔnatR double mutant haploid. Construction of N-terminal FLAG-tagged VMA10 in pRS315 and N-terminal Myc-tagged NT and CT fragments of VMA13 in pRS316 were described previously (19Liu M. Tarsio M. Charsky C.M. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These plasmids were introduced into the vma13Δvma10Δ double mutant strain using an overnight lithium acetate protocol (31Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on fully supplemented minimal medium (SC) lacking leucine and/or uracil to select for the presence of one or both plasmids. Bacterial expression plasmids were constructed by introducing full-length VMA13, a C-terminal fragment of VMA13, or an N-terminal fragment of VPH1 into a modified version of plasmid pMAL c2E (New England Biolabs). (This plasmid, named pMALpAse, has an engineered PreScission protease (New England Biolabs) site downstream of the malE gene at position 2641–2664 and was a generous gift from Gino Cingolani, SUNY Upstate Medical University.) The full-length VMA13 gene and the fragment encoding the H-CT domain were PCR-amplified from wild-type genomic DNA using primers VMA13-BamATG and VMA13-stop Hind (supplemental Table 1) for the full-length gene and VMA13CT-Bam352 and VMA13-stop Hind for the CT fragment. Coding sequence for the N-terminal 406 amino acids of VPH1 was PCR amplified with primers VPH1-BamATG and VPH1–406 Sal. For all the constructs, the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy TA cloning vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pieces were then excised and cloned downstream of the malE gene in the pMALpAse vector cleaved with the appropriate enzymes. All PCR-generated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Upstate Medical University sequencing core. For insertion into a two-hybrid plasmid, VMA13-NT was isolated by PCR amplification of the H-NT open reading frame from a yeast shuttle plasmid containing H-NT (19Liu M. Tarsio M. Charsky C.M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36978-36985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using primers VMA13/5′2Hyb and VMA13/3′2H. The VMA13-CT was amplified with primers VMA13/CT 5′2H and VMA13/3′2H from a wild-type VMA13 template. Both PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector as described above, then excised and cloned into two-hybrid vector pAS2-1 (32Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The VMA13-NT fragment was cloned into BamHI and SalI restriction sites, and the VMA13-CT fragment was cloned into BamHI and PstI sites. Other V-ATPase subunits were cloned into the pACT2 vector (32Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by similar methods (33Smardon A.M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26185-26194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). VMA7 (encoding subunit F) was PCR amplified with primers VMA7/5′2Hyb and VMA7-C4, VMA8 (encoding subunit D) was amplified with primers VMA8/5′2Hyb and VMA8-C4, and the N-terminal domain of VPH1 was amplified with VPH1 5′2H and VPH13′2H. All primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Two-hybrid Assays—Pairs of pACT and pAS-1 plasmids were introduced into yeast strain PJ69-4A (MATa trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) by cotransformation, and transformants were selected on supplemented minimal medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (SC-trp,-leu). Transformants were then grown in liquid medium, serially diluted, and spotted onto: 1) SC-trp,-leu plates (control); 2) SC-trp,-leu,-his plates containing 2.5 mm aminotriazole (to select for expression of the HIS3 gene as a marker of two-hybrid interaction); 3) SC-trp,-leu,-adenine (to select for expression of the ADE2 gene as a marker of two-hybrid interaction); and 4) SC-trp,-leu,-his,-ade (to select for expression of both markers). All of the interactions shown in Fig. 1 were observed on plates 2–4. Expression and Affinity Purification of MBP- and FLAG-tagged Proteins and Complexes—For bacterial expression of MBP-tagged subunit H and the H-CT fragment, the expression constructs described above were transformed into E. coli (BL21 pLysE) and plated on LB + chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) + ampicillin (100 μg/ml). MBP-tagged Vph1-NT was transformed into E. coli (BL21) and transformants were selected on LB + ampicillin. Transformed cells were inoculated into LB liquid medium with 125 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 30 °C. 10 ml of the culture was added to 1 liter of LB containing ampicillin, supplemented with 2 g of glucose. The culture was allowed to grow at 37 °C until it reached A600 of 0.6–0.8, at which point isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 300 μm. Cells expressing H and H-CT were then induced for 2 h at 37 °C, whereas the cells expressing Vph1-NT were induced at 30 °C for 6 h. After induction, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in TBSE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA), and frozen at –20 °C until use. For Vph1-NT purification, the final suspension was adjusted to 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For purification, frozen cell pellets were thawed, and the suspension was sonicated 3 times for 25 s on ice. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g in a J-20 Beckman rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed over 1 ml of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) once at the rate of 0.5 ml/min or less. The amylose resin was washed with at least 20 column volumes of cold TBSE and then eluted with 5 fractions of 1 ml of TBSE with 100 mm maltose. 5 ml of eluant was concentrated in a Viva Spin 30-kDa cut off centrifugal filter device (Sartorius) to 300 μl or less. The concentrated sample was then further purified on a SEC250 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with TBSE. Fractions of the predicted molecular mass of monomeric Vph1-NT were collected, pooled, and the protein concentration was determined from absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient obtained from ProtParam Program (ExPASy). If the experiment required Vph1-NT to be detached from MBP, then 20 μl of Prescission protease at 3 mg/ml was added and left overnight at 4 °C after the concentration step, but before injection into the fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column. MBP-tagged H and H-CT were purified similarly except that no β-mercaptoethanol was added to the initial suspension, and the MBP-tagged protein was combined with 1 ml of amylose beads per 50 ml of crude cell extract. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h with gentle rocking, then the beads were washed three times with 20 ml of TBSE followed by elution in TBSE containing 100 mm maltose. There was no further purification of the eluted proteins; they were used directly, either with or without protease cleavage. V1 complexes were affinity purified from yeast cells via FLAG-tagged G subunit as described (13Ohira M. Smardon A.M. Charsky C.M. Liu J. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22752-22760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were not incubated with zymolyase before lysis in the microfluidizer. After ammonium sulfate precipitation and desalting, the cytosolic fraction was centrifuged in a TLA-100 ultracentrifuge for 15 min at 52,000 × g before application of the supernatant to the anti-FLAG M2 affinity column. V1 complexes were eluted with FLAG peptide and used directly in most experiments. An additional gel filtration step using a Sephadex G-250 column on a Bio-Rad BioLogic Duo-Flow fast protein liquid chromatography system was added after affinity purification in a few experiments, as indicated in the figure legends. To test binding of H-CT to V1 pre-bound to anti-FLAG beads (Fig. 4C), V1 complexes were mixed with anti-FLAG beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C (∼125 μg of V1 was mixed with 100 μl of beads to give a final volume of 220 μl in TBSE). Purified MBP-H-CT was then added to the mixture (∼9 μg from an 0.1 mg/ml solution). This mixture was incubated for 2–3 additional hours at 4 °C, then the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, rapidly washed twice to remove unbound MBP-H-CT, and the bound material was eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For experiments with MgATP, 2 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2 were added with the MBP-H-CT. Enzyme and Binding Assays—ATP hydrolysis activity was measured by a coupled enzyme assay at 37 °C as described (35Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). V1(-H) complexes were incubated with expressed MBP-H or MBP-H-CT for 1 h in the indicated ratios before addition to the ATPase assay mixture. V1 containing H-NT (V1(-H)/H-NT) was incubated and assayed in the same manner. NEM-sensitive ATPase activity (V1-ATPase activity) was determined by incubating V1 samples for 20 min on ice with 50 μm NEM prior to assay (19Liu M. Tarsio M. Charsky C.M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36978-36985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged proteins was used to assess binding of the bacterially expressed proteins to the purified V1(-H) or V1(-H)/H-NT. 100 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose beads suspended in TBSE were added to a mixture of one part V1 and five parts expressed protein (MBP-H, MBP-H-CT, or the cleaved proteins) to give a final volume of 300 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 3 h. The resin was washed three times with TBSE to remove nonspecific binding. 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide was used to elute V1 and its binding partners from the beads and eluted protein were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Trichloroacetic acid pellets were solubilized with cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with anti-MBP (1:100,000) and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies. A colorimetric assay was used for detection after incubation with an anti-mouse secondary antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase. For immunoprecipitation of Vph1-NT, 250 μl of cultured supernatant containing monoclonal antibody 10D7 (36Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to a 200-μl mixture of Vph1pNT and a partner protein that had been allowed to stand for ∼3 h on ice. The mixture of the proteins and the antibody was shaken overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 100 μl of a 50% (v/v) Protein A-Sepharose suspension (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 12 mm sodium phosphate, containing 0.2% gelatin) was added to the mixture and incubated on ice for 2 h with occasional shaking. Protein A-Sepharose was gently pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with the same buffer. The samples were eluted by directly adding cracking buffer to the pellets. Interactions of the N- and C-terminal Domains of Subunit H with V1 and V0 Subunits—The crystal structure of yeast subunit H indicated that it was comprised of two domains, one consisting of the N-terminal 348 amino acids of the protein (H-NT) and the second consisting of amino acids 352–478 (H-CT) (17Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To address the interactions of the two domains with V1 and V0, we introduced each H subunit domain into a two-hybrid vector, and tested its interaction with several V1 subunits and the cytosolic N-terminal domain of V0 subunit a. In this version of the two-hybrid assay, all combinations should grow on supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, because these two nutritional markers are encoded on the two-hybrid plasmids. As we have seen previously, some combinations of plasmids partially inhibit growth even under the permissive (+His) conditions, possibly reflecting dominant negative interactions as a result of subunit overexpression (13Ohira M.

Two-hybrid interactions are identified by their ability to support growth on medium that also lacks histidine, which requires reconstitution of a transcription factor capable of inducing the HIS3 gene through interaction of the partners (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, H-NT displayed an interaction only with the V1 B subunit. H-CT interacted with a number of subunits, including the V1 B, D, and E subunits, and the V0 a-NT domain. Interactions with subunit B of the catalytic headgroup"
https://openalex.org/W2023517685,"To identify pathways controlling prostate cancer metastasis we performed differential display analysis of the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 and its highly metastatic derivative PC-3M. This revealed that a 78-kDa interferon-inducible GTPase, MxA, was expressed in PC-3 but not in PC-3M cells. The gene encoding MxA, MX1, is located in the region of chromosome 21 deleted as a consequence of fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG, which has been associated with aggressive, invasive prostate cancer. Stable exogenous MxA expression inhibited in vitro motility and invasiveness of PC-3M cells. In vivo exogenous MxA expression decreased the number of hepatic metastases following intrasplenic injection. Exogenous MxA also reduced motility and invasiveness of highly metastatic LOX melanoma cells. A mutation in MxA that inactivated its GTPase reversed inhibition of motility and invasion in both tumor cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that MxA associated with tubulin, but the GTPase-inactivating mutation blocked this association. Because MxA is a highly inducible gene, an MxA-targeted drug discovery screen was initiated by placing the MxA promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter. Examination of the NCI diversity set of small molecules revealed three hits that activated the promoter. In PC-3M cells, these drugs induced MxA protein and inhibited motility. These data demonstrate that MxA inhibits tumor cell motility and invasion, and that MxA expression can be induced by small molecules, potentially offering a new approach to the prevention and treatment of metastasis.

These data demonstrate that MxA inhibits tumor cell motility and invasion, and that MxA expression can be induced by small molecules, potentially offering a new approach to the prevention and treatment of metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanisms regulating metastasis offers the potential of designing specifically targeted drugs aimed at preventing neoplastic spread. Better understanding of the genetic basis of metastasis could aid in the choice of treatment and timing of treatment modalities as well as identify molecular targets for therapy. The clonally related pair of human prostate cancer lines, PC-3 and its more metastatic derivative, PC-3M that was derived from a liver metastasis in a nude mouse bearing a splenic explant of PC-3 (1Kozlowski J.M. Fidler I.J. Campbell D. Xu Z.L. Kaighn M.E. Hart I.R. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3522-3529PubMed Google Scholar), allowed us to explore the molecular genetic mechanisms of metastasis. To this end, we used differential display-reverse transcription-PCR (DD-RT-PCR) 4The abbreviations used are: DD-RT-PCR, differential display reverse transcription-PCR; IFN, interferon; WT, wild-type; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; CID, central interactive domain.4The abbreviations used are: DD-RT-PCR, differential display reverse transcription-PCR; IFN, interferon; WT, wild-type; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; CID, central interactive domain. (2Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar) to identify mRNAs with expression differences in these two lines. This study demonstrated differential expression of a DD-RT-PCR band (DD-2) that was found in the PC-3 parental cell line and not in PC-3M cells (Fig. 1B). DNA sequencing of DD-2 identified it as a portion of MxA, one of a small family of “Mx” genes (MX1 and MX2 in human and Mx1 in mouse) that encode large self-assembling dynamin-like proteins that bind and hydrolyze GTP (3Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MxA transcription is inducible by types I, II, and III interferons (IFNs α/β (3Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), γ (4Nagano K. Masters J.R. Akpan A. Yang A. Corless S. Wood C. Hastie C. Zvelebil M. Cramer R. Naaby-Hansen S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and λ (5Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A. Shen M. Shah N.K. Langer J.A. Sheikh F. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar)), and MxA protein has been shown to be an effector of type I IFN-mediated inhibition of certain RNA viruses, including the myxoviruses. Although IFNs, both type I and II, have been used in the treatment of several forms of cancer, including melanoma, follicular lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Kaposi's sarcoma, and renal cell carcinoma, the mechanisms of anticancer activity have not been fully delineated. Both direct antiproliferative effects on tumor and indirect immunomodulatory effects on the host have been reported (see Ref. 6Jonasch E. Haluska F.G. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 34-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar for review). IFNs are known to inhibit cell motility (7Brouty-Boye D. Zetter B.R. Science. 1980; 208: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and Mx proteins have significant homology to dynamin, a large GTPase involved in the scission of nascent vesicles from parent membranes. However, heretofore, MxA has been chiefly studied for its anti-viral properties (8Haller O. Kochs G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and it has not been associated with cell motility or metastasis. To gain a better understanding of the role of IFN and MxA in cancer biology, and to explore MxA as a new target for anti-metastatic therapy we undertook an investigation of the role of MxA in two metastatic human cancer cell lines. Cell Lines—The human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). PC-3M (1Kozlowski J.M. Fidler I.J. Campbell D. Xu Z.L. Kaighn M.E. Hart I.R. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3522-3529PubMed Google Scholar), a highly metastatic subline derived from a hepatic metastasis of PC-3, was a kind gift of Dr. James Kozlowski (Dept. of Urology, Northwestern University Medical School). Both cell lines and their derivatives were grown as described previously (9Lee S.J. Ha M.J. Lee J. Nguyen P. Choi Y.H. Pirnia F. Kang W.K. Wang X.F. Kim S.J. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10618-10623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). LOX is a highly metastatic human melanoma cell line (10Fodstad O. Aamdal S. McMenamin M. Nesland J.M. Pihl A. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) obtained from Dr. Dan Sackett, National Institutes of Health. Plasmids and Transfections—PC-3M cells were initially transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with an MxA-expressing or a β-galactosidase-expressing control vector constructed from pHβ Apr-1, in which MxA and β-galactosidase were under the control of the human α-actin promoter (11Horisberger M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: S67-S71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and stable transfectants were selected in G-418. In subsequent experiments PC-3M and LOX cells were transfected with expression vectors based on pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI) that used the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter and added a FLAG tag to the vector control and wild-type (WT) MxA, and stable transfectants were selected using G-418. We used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to mutate threonine 103 to alanine in the FLAG-tagged MxA-expression vector to inactivate MxA self-association and GTPase activity (12Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies and Reagents—The monoclonal anti-MxA antibody was described previously (13Horisberger M.A. Hochkeppel H.K. J. Interferon Res. 1987; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-MxA (14Yamada T. Horisberger M.A. Kawaguchi N. Moroo I. Toyoda T. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 181: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-α-tubulin (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation. Sheep anti-human IFN-α immunoglobulin (catalogue no. GO26-501-568) and control sheep immunoglobulin (catalogue no. GO27501-568) were provided by the NIAID Reference Reagent Repository, operated by Braton Biotech, Inc., Rockville, MD. Purified IFN-α was obtained from Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland). Differential Display—1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from PC-3 and PC-3M prostate carcinoma cells was used to generate cDNAs using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and anchored and arbitrary primers (Operon Biotech, Alameda, CA). The differentially expressed bands between the two templates, which ranged from 170 to 500 bp in size, were nick-translated and used to probe RNA blots that contained poly(A)+ RNA from PC-3 and PC-3M cell lines. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared by standard methods (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from cell pellets of PC-3 and PC-3M. Equal amounts (10 μg) were electrophoretically separated on a denaturing gel (1% agarose, 20 mm 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 18% formaldehyde, pH 7.0) and blotted onto a nylon membrane (HyBond-N, Amersham Biosciences). The blot was sequentially hybridized with 32P-labeled, nick-translated DD-2 fragment and MxA cDNA from human embryonic lung (16Horisberger M.A. McMaster G.K. Zeller H. Wathelet M.G. Dellis J. Content J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also hybridized this and other Northern blots with a 13-kb PstI fragment of rat glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (17Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Motility and Invasion Assays—FALCON cell culture inserts with an 8-μm pore-size polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and BIOCOAT Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used for motility assays and invasion assays, respectively. For both assays, inserts were placed into the wells of a 24-well plate. Each well contained 0.5 ml of complete medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% antimycotic-antibiotic solution and 500 μg/ml G-418). Control and MxA-transfected cells were trypsinized, suspended at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in complete medium, and 350 μl of the cell suspension was added to each insert. The plate of inserts was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells from the upper surface of the membrane were removed by scrubbing with a cotton-tipped swab. Cells that had migrated/invaded through the insert and adhered to the bottom of the membrane were Wright stained using the CAMCO Quik Stain kit (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), visualized using a Leica DM IRB microscope, and counted. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence immunocytochemistry was performed as described (18Choi Y.H. Lee S.J. Nguyen P. Jang J.S. Lee J. Wu M.L. Takano E. Maki M. Henkart P.A. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28479-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For cytoskeletal preparations, the cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA, pH 6.9) for 2 min and fixed with 37% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (19Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as indicated, and nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, and images were captured using an Optronics (East Muskegee, OK) charge-coupled device camera. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (20Bang Y.J. Pirnia F. Fang W.G. Kang W.K. Sartor O. Whitesell L. Ha M.J. Tsokos M. Sheahan M.D. Nguyen P. Niklinski W.T. Myers C.E. Trepel J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5330-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was immobilized on protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. GST Pulldown Assay—GST-MxA was constructed by standard PCR cloning techniques to fuse the GSX vector (Promega) and the MxA coding region (16Horisberger M.A. McMaster G.K. Zeller H. Wathelet M.G. Dellis J. Content J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed in and purified from BL21 cells. For each pulldown experiment, 2 μg of purified tubulin (Invitrogen) were incubated with GST alone or with increasing amounts of GST-MxA protein and immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)) for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing six times with NETN buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Animals—Female 4- to 6-week-old beige-SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed under pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule, fed autoclaved standard chow and water ad libitum. Animal care and use was in accordance with guidelines of the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal Procedures—Surgical sites were prepared by shaving the skin and then cleansing using Betadine scrub solution (E-Z Prep, BD Biosciences) and 70% sterile alcohol. Anesthesia was induced using ketamine (0.45 mg/mouse, Ketaset, Fort Dodge Laboratories Inc., Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (0.45 mg/mouse, Sigma) administered intraperitoneally. Anesthesia was then maintained using methoxyflurane (Mallinckrodt Veterinary Inc., Mundelein, IL) inhalation. In vitro-passaged tumor cell lines were harvested and prepared for injection as described previously (21Khanna C. Prehn J. Yeung C. Caylor J. Tsokos M. Helman L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were brought to a final concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml for injection in phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and kept at 4 °C. Cells were counted and their viability assessed manually after Trypan blue staining. Experiments were only continued if cell viability was >90%. Two million cells were administered using a 27-gauge needle for intrasplenic injections (hepatic metastasis assay). Splenic exposure was achieved through a high left paracostal approach to the abdomen. Each experimental group consisted of 15 beige-SCID mice. After tumor cell injection, mice were monitored at least three times weekly for evidence of tumor/metastasis-associated morbidity. The primary end point was the number of hepatic metastases detectable by visual examination 24 days after intrasplenic injection. Complete post mortem examinations were performed on all animals. Tissues obtained at necropsy were fixed in 10% formalin at room temperature. Routine histological analysis of metastases was undertaken at the conclusion of all experiments. The statistical significance of the difference in the number of experimental hepatic metastases between the mice injected with PC-3M-pCIneo cells and mice injected with PC-3M-MxA-wild-type cells was assessed by the non-parametric Welch's corrected unpaired t test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0c. High-throughput Small Molecule Screen—To search for drugs that might induce MxA expression, the Diversity Set of 1990 pharmacophores distilled from ∼140,000 compounds by the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutics Program was screened in an assay for MxA promoter activation, using a luciferase-based assay (Promega). The MxA promoter described in Ronni et al. (22Ronni T. Matikainen S. Lehtonen A. Palvimo J. Dellis J. Van Eylen F. Goetschy J.F. Horisberger M. Content J. Julkunen I. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter in the pGL3 plasmid (Promega). The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Interferon-α was used as a positive control. The three small molecules that induced an increase in activity of >2.2-fold were also screened for their effect on MxA protein expression and on PC-3M motility, as described above. Constitutive Expression of MxA in PC-3 Cells—DD-RT-PCR analysis revealed eight fragments of cDNA with possible differences in expression between PC-3 and its more metastatic derivative, PC-3M. Northern blot analysis indicated that only one of these, a 200-bp band, termed DD-2, was differentially expressed, as a strong 3.0-kb mRNA band in PC-3 but not in PC-3M (Fig. 1B). We used the DD-2 probe to screen a cDNA library generated from PC-3 mRNA, and we obtained a 2.0-kb cDNA clone that contained ∼70% of the expected 3.0-kb sequence (including 95% of the coding region) of MxA (16Horisberger M.A. McMaster G.K. Zeller H. Wathelet M.G. Dellis J. Content J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously (23Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), MxA homo-oligomerizes into ring-like and helical structures. MxA protein contains an N-terminal tripartite GTP binding motif and three regions involved in MxA self-assembly: an N-terminal self-assembly domain, a central interactive domain (CID), and an assembly domain in the C terminus that interacts with the CID and the N-terminal self-assembly domain. The assembly domain region is rich in α-helices and contains a leucine zipper motif (Fig. 1A). There were two conservative sequence differences between MxA in PC-3 and the GenBank™ sequence. The first difference, I378V, resulted in a conservative amino acid change, while the second, at alanine 541 (GCA to GCG), was silent. There was no sequence alteration in the tripartite GTPase domain or the self-assembly domains. The difference observed may be the result of human sequence polymorphisms (24Tazi-Ahnini R. di Giovine F.S. McDonagh A.J. Messenger A.G. Amadou C. Cox A. Duff G.W. Cork M.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 639-645PubMed Google Scholar). MxA expression has only been reported following viral infection or treatment with IFNs (3Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nagano K. Masters J.R. Akpan A. Yang A. Corless S. Wood C. Hastie C. Zvelebil M. Cramer R. Naaby-Hansen S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A. Shen M. Shah N.K. Langer J.A. Sheikh F. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). However, Northern blots probed with our MxA clone (data not shown) and with the original cDNA (16Horisberger M.A. McMaster G.K. Zeller H. Wathelet M.G. Dellis J. Content J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) displayed the same pattern of expression that was generated by our DD-2 probe (Fig. 1B): abundant expression in PC-3 but no detectible mRNA in PC-3M. Equal loading was confirmed by hybridizing the blots with a probe for glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. Western blot analysis with anti-MxA antibody (13Horisberger M.A. Hochkeppel H.K. J. Interferon Res. 1987; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) corroborated the Northern blot expression data, demonstrating the presence of a 78-kDa MxA protein in PC-3 but not in PC-3M lysates (Fig. 1C). The same blot was probed with anti-tubulin antibody to show equal loading for both samples. The difference between the cell lines could have been related to a high endogenous production of type-I IFN in PC-3 cells. There was, however, no difference in the amount of IFN-α present in the two cell lines, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). Maintenance of Genomic Integrity at the MxA Locus—The constitutive expression of MxA in PC-3 cells, but not in PC-3M cells, could be explained by a genomic deletion or rearrangement at the MX1 locus. To explore this possibility, genomic DNA from PC-3 and PC-3M cells was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and PstI, electrophoresed on an agarose gel and subjected to Southern blot analysis with MxA cDNA (supplemental Fig. S1). PC-3 and PC-3M showed identical patterns of hybridization, which indicated that the difference in expression of MxA in PC-3 cells and PC-3M cells was not the result of a major genomic deletion or rearrangement. Induction of MxA Expression by Interferon—To determine whether IFN-α can induce MxA expression in PC-3 and PC-3M cells, cells were treated with recombinant IFN-α and subjected to immunocytochemical analysis using anti-MxA antibody and DAPI nuclear counterstaining (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with the Western blot result, this assay detected MxA protein only in untreated PC-3 and not in untreated PC-3M cells (compare upper left panels in Fig. 2, A and B). After exposure to IFN-α, the level of MxA protein increased substantially in PC-3, whereas MxA protein became detectable for the first time in PC-3M cells (compare lower left panels in Fig. 2, A and B). Western blotting (not shown) confirmed the IFN-induced increase in MxA protein expression in both cell lines. This evidence demonstrated that PC-3M cells were able to respond to IFN, consistent with the Southern blot result (supplemental Fig. S1) indicating that the MxA gene was intact in PC-3M cells. This experiment also showed that the IFN signaling pathway was still active in PC-3M cells, ruling out the possibility that lack of MxA expression in PC-3M cells was due to an inability to respond to IFN stimulation. Effect of MxA on Motility of PC-3M Cells—The constitutive expression of MxA in PC-3 cells and absence of expression in PC-3M cells suggested the possibility that MxA might suppress some aspect of metastatic behavior. Furthermore, it had been reported that type I IFN can reduce cell motility (7Brouty-Boye D. Zetter B.R. Science. 1980; 208: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), one component of metastasis. To test whether PC-3 and PC-3M differed in motility, we subjected both lines to an assay that measured the ability of cells to migrate through pores in a PET membrane. Fig. 2C shows that untreated (control) PC-3M cells were considerably more motile than PC-3, and IFN-α reduced PC-3M motility to a level comparable to that of untreated PC-3. Consistent with the result seen in Fig. 2A, PC-3 cells were also responsive to IFN, which reduced their motility still further. To test directly whether MxA played a role in regulating motility, we transfected PC-3M cells with MxA- and β-galactosidase control-expressing vectors, and stable cell lines, including PC-3M-MxA#1 and PC-3M-MxA#2, constitutively expressing full-length human MxA protein, and the control, PC-3M-β-gal, were selected. The level of MxA expression in the three transfectants was determined by Western blot (Fig. 2D, inset). MxA protein was not detected in PC-3M β-gal, whereas the other two lines expressed exogenous MxA, with a higher level of expression in MxA #1 than in MxA #2. The level of MxA in MxA clone #1 was comparable to the endogenous level of MxA in PC-3, and the level of MxA in clone #2 was lower than the level in PC-3 (supplemental Fig. S2). MxA expression inhibited motility in both MxA clone #1 and #2 (Fig. 2D), and the level of inhibition correlated with the level of MxA expression. PC-3M MxA clone #1 (PC-3M-MxA) was used in all subsequent studies. Time-lapse Microscopy—Time-lapse video microscopy visually demonstrated the reduction of motility induced by MxA expression in PC-3M cells (supplemental Fig. S3). PC-3M-MxA cells showed markedly reduced levels of movement across the field, compared with control PC-3M cells that express the unrelated protein, β-galactosidase. Although translational motility of the PC-3M-MxA cells was markedly inhibited, the majority of the cells demonstrated membrane ruffling and several mitoses were apparent. However, in contrast to PC-3M-β-gal cells, in PC-3M-MxA cells there was an absence of translational motility of daughter cells following cytokinesis. MxA Expression Has No Effect on Proliferation—To confirm the impression gained in the time-lapse study that expression of MxA did not impede cell division, and to investigate the role of GTPase activity in the ability of MxA to inhibit motility, another set of stable transfectants of PC-3M was made using the pCI vector that includes the CMV promoter, a neo selectable marker and a FLAG tag for immunodetection. In addition to the FLAG-tagged wild-type MxA, a FLAG-tagged MxA with a threonine to alanine mutation at residue 103 between the first and second GTP-binding consensus motif that ablates both GTPase and antiviral activity (12Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into PC-3M cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, all three transfectants proliferated at the same rate, strongly suggesting that the effect of MxA on motility was unrelated to an effect on cell proliferation. T103A Mutation Reverses Effects of MxA on Motility and Invasion—To confirm and extend our motility studies, we repeated them with the PC-3M MxA-FLAG transfectants. In addition, to determine if the effect of MxA was limited to PC-3M cells, stable transfectants expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type MxA and FLAG-tagged T103A-mutant MxA were created in the highly metastatic human melanoma cell line LOX (10Fodstad O. Aamdal S. McMenamin M. Nesland J.M. Pihl A. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which, like PC-3M, does not express endogenous MxA (data not shown). The studies were also extended to test the effect of MxA on invasion, using a Transwell invasion assay in which the cells are required to cross a Matrigel layer as well as migrate through pores in the PET filter. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2, FLAG-tagged MxA inhibited PC-3M motility (Fig. 3B). Expression of FLAG-tagged MxA also inhibited PC-3M invasion (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the expression of exogenous MxA decreased LOX cell motility and invasiveness (Fig. 3, D and E). However, in both PC-3M and LOX cell lines, the T103A mutation in the GTPase/self-assembly region reversed the ability of MxA to suppress in vitro motility and invasiveness of these highly metastatic tumor cells. Wild-type MxA but Not Mutant MxA Associates with Tubulin—It has been reported that MxA can transiently bind the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin (3Horisberger M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because elements of the cytoskeleton are instrumental in cell motility, we investigated whether MxA associated with the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton in PC-3 and LOX cells, using immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical studies of cytoskeletal preparations. Fig. 4A demonstrates that endogenous MxA co-immunoprecipitated with tubulin, but not with actin, in PC-3 cells. In a cell-free GST pulldown experiment, GST-MxA associated with purified tubulin in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with direct binding of MxA and tubulin (Fig. 4B). The association of wild-type MxA with tubulin was also examined in the stably transfected LOX cell line. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-α-tubulin antibody, anti-MxA antibody, or protein A/G-coated Sepharose beads alone, followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4C). MxA was detected in association with tubulin in LOX-FLAG-MxA-WT (panel 2, lane 2) while protein A/G alone (lane 1) did not bind MxA-containing complexes. No binding activity was detected in LOX-pCIneo control cells (panel 1), supporting the specificity of the co-"
https://openalex.org/W2062653291,"The chemistry underlying superoxide toxicity is not fully understood. A potential mechanism for superoxide-mediated injury involves addition to tyrosyl radicals, to give peptide or protein hydroperoxides. The rate constant for the reaction of tyrosyl radicals with superoxide is higher than for dimerization, but the efficiency of superoxide addition to peptides depends on the position of the Tyr residue. We have examined the requirements for superoxide addition and structurally characterized the products for a range of tyrosyl peptides exposed to a peroxidase/O2⋅− system. These included enkephalins as examples of the numerous proteins and physiological peptides with N-terminal tyrosines. The importance of amino groups in promoting hydroperoxide formation and effect of methionine residues on the reaction were investigated. When tyrosine was N-terminal, the major products were hydroperoxides that had undergone cyclization through conjugate addition of the terminal amine. With non-N-terminal tyrosine, electron transfer from O2⋅− to the peptide radical prevailed. Peptides containing methionine revealed a novel and efficient intramolecular oxygen transfer mechanism from an initial tyrosine hydroperoxide to give a dioxygenated derivative with one oxygen on the tyrosine and the other forming methionine sulfoxide. Exogenous amines promoted hydroperoxide formation on tyrosyl peptides lacking a terminal amine, without forming an adduct. These findings, plus the high hydroperoxide yields with N-terminal tyrosine, can be explained by a mechanism in which hydrogen bonding of O2⋅− to the amine increases is oxidizing potential and alters its reactivity. If this amine effect occurred more generally, it could increase the biological reactivity of O2⋅− and have major implications. The chemistry underlying superoxide toxicity is not fully understood.

Free radical-mediated oxidative damage occurs in numerous diseases and is thought to contribute to the aging process. The primary radical generated by the reduction of oxygen is superoxide (O2⋅−), a relatively benign radical that nevertheless must be removed by superoxide dismutases (SODs) 2The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; YM, tyrosinemethionine; YM-S=O, tyrosine-methionine sulfoxide; MY, methionine-tyrosine; YG, tyrosine-glycine; GY, glycine-tyrosine; YGGFM, Met-Enk, methionine-enkephalin; YGGFL, Leu-Enk, leucine-enkephalin; YPFF, Endo2, endomorphin 2; GYGGFM, Gly-Met-Enk, glycine-methionine-enkephalin; Boc-YGGFM, tert-butoxycarbonyl-methionine-enkephalin; RFYVVM, thrombospondin-1 (1016–1021); YSFKDMGLGR, human C5a anaphylatoxin (Tyr65, Phe67)-C5a (65–74); MEVDPIGHLY, MAGE-3 antigen (167–176); HPA, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; HOHICA, 3a-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,3,3a,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-indol-2-carboxylic acid; HACHD, 4-alanyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexadienone; XO, xanthine oxidase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization. for an organism to survive in an aerobic environment (1Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). A number of potentially damaging reactions of O2⋅− have been identified (1Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 2Winterbourn C.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 3Liochev S.I. Fridovich I.

One of these, which has received relatively little attention, is the addition of O2⋅− to other radicals to form hydroperoxides (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This reaction has been shown to occur readily with tyrosine and Tyr-containing dipeptides, resulting in the formation of tyrosine hydroperoxides (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hydroperoxides are potentially damaging reactive oxygen species. Formation on proteins can result in detrimental structural and functional changes (8Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Protein hydroperoxides are also oxidants that can injure other biomolecules. Tyrosyl radicals are generated in many physiological situations and proteins are major targets for reactive oxidants (9Dean R.T. Fu S.L. Stocker R. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). In proteins exposed to free radicals, regardless of the initial site of attack, the resultant radical commonly localizes to Tyr (10Bobrowski K. Wierzchowski K.L. Holcman J. Ciurak M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1990; 57: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Garrison W.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 381-398Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 12Prutz W.A. Siebert F. Butler J. Land E.J.

Biophys. 2008; 10.1016/j.abb.2008.11.018Google Scholar). Tyrosyl radicals are also produced from tyrosyl peptides through the action of peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase, and are generated during the catalytic cycle of enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase and cyclooxygenase (14Stubbe J.A. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Tyrosyl radicals undergo a variety of subsequent reactions. They readily dimerize to form dityrosine, which has been well documented as a product of oxidative injury (15Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Another oxidative biomarker, nitrotyrosine, is also formed via tyrosyl radicals (4Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 17Souza J.M. Peluffo G. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, one of their most favored reactions is with O2⋅− (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.

The reaction has a rate constant several times higher than that for dimerization (7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1993; : 1583-1588Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Mozziconacci O. Mirkowski J. Rusconi F. Pernot P. Bobrowski K. Houee-Levin C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is favored over dityrosine formation in situations where both tyrosyl and O2⋅− radicals are generated (7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1993; : 1583-1588Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Mozziconacci O. Mirkowski J. Rusconi F. Pernot P. Bobrowski K. Houee-Levin C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reaction of O2⋅− with phenoxyl radicals results in either repair of the parent phenol (reaction 2, Fig. 1b) or addition to form a hydroperoxide (reaction 3). With tyrosine, most of the O2⋅− reacts by addition (7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1993; : 1583-1588Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Mozziconacci O. Mirkowski J. Rusconi F. Pernot P. Bobrowski K. Houee-Levin C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structure of tyrosine hydroperoxide has not been determined directly but inferred from NMR studies of the corresponding monoxide derivative formed by slow decomposition (7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1993; : 1583-1588Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These were shown to be bicyclic compounds formed by conjugate addition of the amino group to the phenol ring (HOHICA, designated I and named in full in Fig. 1b, proposed to arise from reactions 5 and 6). Hydroperoxide formation has been observed with peptides but only when tyrosine is N-terminal or the reaction is promoted by amino compounds (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The amine effect has implications for hydroperoxide formation on proteins, but the mechanism is not understood. It has also been postulated that the repair mechanism involves singlet oxygen release from an intermediate (reaction 4) rather than electron transfer (reaction 2) (18d'Allesandro N. Bianchi G. Fang X. Jin F. Schuchmann H.-P. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 2000; : 1862-1867Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but this has not been studied experimentally. The objectives of this investigation were to determine the structures of the hydroperoxide and any other superoxide addition products, and to understand the mechanism of formation, using a range of synthetic and physiological tyrosyl peptides. These include the opioids Leu- and Met-Enkephalin (Leu-Enk, YGGFL; and Met-Enk, YGGFM, respectively) and Endomorphin 2 (Endo2, YPFF). The opioids have a free N-terminal Tyr that is essential for activity and are potential physiological targets for inactivation by O2⋅− addition. We also investigated whether the presence of a Met residue (as in Met-Enk) influences Tyr-hydroperoxide formation on the peptide and whether O2⋅− addition results in the formation of methionine sulfoxide. If so, this could be a physiological mechanism for production of methionine sulfoxide, which is one of the most prevalent products of oxidative stress (21Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 22Moskovitz J. Flescher E. Berlett B.S. Azare J. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14071-14075Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Peptides were exposed to a xanthine oxidase (XO) system to generate O2⋅− and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plus horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the reaction of H2O2 with the peptide to give the tyrosyl radical (Fig. 1a). Products were analyzed using a general hydroperoxide assay (Fe2+/xylenol orange or FOX assay) and by liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS). We have obtained structural information on the hydroperoxides, identified a mechanism of rapid intramolecular oxidation of Met residues via a hydroperoxide intermediate, and provide an explanation for why amino groups facilitate the addition of O2⋅− to the tyrosyl radical. Reagents—Water was purified by running through a Milli-Q system (Millipore) so that its resistivity was greater than 18 mΩ-cm. All reagents and enzymes were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. HOCl solutions were prepared from commercial bleach (Janola) and were standardized spectrophotometrically (using ϵ292 nm = 350 m–1 cm–1). The peptides: YGGFM, Boc-YGGFM, GYGGFM, MEVDPIGHLY, RFYVVM, and YSFKDMGLGR were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf) and Tyr-Met (YM) and Met-Tyr (MY) were custom synthesized by Genscript (NJ). All peptides were >98% pure. Deuterium oxide (99.9%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Anthracene-9,10-diyldiethyl sulfate (EAS) was a generous gift of Prof. Paolo Di Mascio. The Tyr-para-hydroperoxide derivative of Gly-Tyr-Gly (Gly-Tyr-Gly-OOH) was a generous gift of Prof. Michael Davies. It was generated by the reaction of Gly-Tyr-Gly with singlet oxygen, where singlet oxygen was generated in situ by irradiation in the presence of Rose-Bengal (23Wright A. Bubb W.A. Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The concentration of Gly-Tyr-Gly-OOH was 500 μm (as measured by the FOX assay) in the presence of 2.5 mm Gly-Tyr-Gly. YM-sulfoxide (YM-S=O) was prepared by oxidation of YM by 1 m equivalent HOCl. No other components were detected by LC/MS indicating ∼100% conversion. The concentrations of stock solutions of H2O2 were determined iodometrically. Concentrations in solutions prepared from the stock were confirmed spectrophotometrically (ϵ(H2O2)240 nm = 43.6 m–1 cm–1). Stock solutions of XO were prepared by dilution of an ammonium sulfate suspension with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and spinning through a G-25 Sephadex column to remove the ammonium sulfate. The activity of XO was measured by the cytochrome c assay and by quantifying H2O2 formation using the FOX assay. Enzyme and acetaldehyde stock solutions were prepared fresh daily and stored on ice. Peroxidase-mediated Oxidation of Tyrosine-containing Peptides in the Presence of Superoxide—Reaction mixtures consisted of acetaldehyde (1 mm unless stated otherwise), XO (typically 0.001 unit/ml), HRP (typically 140 nm), and 0.2 mm peptide in 50 mm phosphate buffer plus 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (except for the FOX assay experiments). This amount of XO with 1 mm acetaldehyde corresponds to an initial rate of 2.8 μm/min O2⋅− and total production of 36 μm H2O2 over a 30-min reaction period. Reactions were started by addition of XO. They were carried out at 20–25 °C, typically for 30 min for LC/MS, 10 min for FOX and dimer analyses, and stopped by adding 20 μg/ml catalase to remove residual H2O2. When necessary the enzymes were removed from the reaction mixtures by ultracentrifugation using 10–30-kDa cutoff microconcentrators (Amicon Microcon). Samples were protected from light to avoid photochemical reactions. Dimer Quantification—Dimers were measured fluorimetrically (excitation 325 nm, emission 400 nm) with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrofluorimeter as described in Ref. 5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. Results are expressed as relative fluorescence and are related to concentrations using calibration curves obtained by generating the dimer from the relevant peptide in at least 20-fold excess and known concentrations of H2O2 in the presence of HRP. Dimer concentrations were corroborated by measuring A315 at pH 8.0 using ϵ = 5,080 m–1 cm–1. Hydroperoxide Quantification—Hydroperoxides were analyzed using a modified FOX method (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) standardized against H2O2, under similar conditions as for dimer quantification. Liquid Chromatography (LC)-Electrospray Ionization (ESI)-Mass Spectrometry (MS)—LC-ESI-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed with a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) coupled to a Surveyor HPLC system and PDA detector. Positive ion mode was used for all peptides and negative ion mode for p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA) and EAS derivatives. Data were analyzed using Finnigan Xcalibur, Thermo Finnigan Qual Browser 1.3, and High Chem Mass Frontier 3.0 programs. Fragmentation patterns were analyzed using Bioworks Browser 3.1 and peptide fragment ions were assigned and discussed based on the Roepstorff-Fohlman nomenclature. Further details on chromatography conditions and detection are given under supplementary Methods. Acid Hydrolysis—Peptides were lyophilized and vapor phase hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl containing 1% (w/v) phenol, plus 50 μl of mercaptoacetic acid when products were analyzed for the recovery of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (25Gieseg S.P. Simpson J.A. Charlton T.S. Duncan M.W. Dean R.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4780-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After hydrolysis, the residual HCl was evaporated and the samples were redis-solved in water and analyzed by LC-MS. Quantification of Met-Enk and Leu-Enk Products—Yields of Leu-Enk hydroperoxide and Met-Enk and Gly-Met-Enk dioxides were quantified by calibrating the LC/MS peak integral for each species. Each compound was generated using the XO/HRP system and purified by LC with the same setup as for MS analysis. For Met-Enk and Gly-Met-Enk, the product peak was collected, concentrated, and a sample reinjected to check for purity. When necessary the purification step was repeated until no contaminants were detectable. The concentrations of the enkephalin dioxides in the purified solutions were established on the basis of Phe content. An aliquot of each solution was hydrolyzed and the amount of Phe determined by LC/MS using selective ion monitoring. A standard curve was created with authentic Phe, which was identified from its retention time and fragmentation pattern. Controls using internal standards of authentic Phe showed nearly 100% recovery under the applied conditions. Acid hydrolysis was >90% efficient based on Phe recovery from the parent enkephalin hydrolyzed under the same conditions. This gave the Phe content and hence the dioxide concentration in the pure sample. A known amount of pure dioxide was injected into the LC/MS to calibrate its peak integral and this calibration was used to quantify dioxide formation under experimental conditions. The instrument response was corrected by use of check standard of Leu-Enk before each set of runs. For Leu-Enk, the hydroperoxide was not stable enough to use the same procedure. Instead, the entire Leu-Enk-OOH peak from each of two chromatographic runs was collected and the combined sample was hydrolyzed and analyzed for Phe content as above. The Phe content in half the hydrolysate was related to the mean peak integral for the original samples, using the same time interval for collection and integration. This calibration was then used to quantify the hydroperoxide peak from experimental samples that were separated at the same time as the calibration sample. It has been observed (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Winterbourn C.C. Pichorner H. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Pichorner H. Metodiewa D. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that radicals generated on Tyr and tyrosyl dipeptides react with O2⋅− to form hydroperoxides (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Winterbourn C.C. Pichorner H. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1995; 323: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This occurs in competition with dimerization of the radicals, and with Tyr and the XO/HRP system as in Fig. 1a, more hydroperoxide than dityrosine was formed (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We extended these observations to the enkephalins and related peptides, and found that they were all oxidized by HRP and H2O2. Yields of dimer formation in the XO/HRP/acetaldehyde systems were 3–4-fold higher when SOD was present, indicating that in the absence of SOD, the peptide radicals reacted with O2⋅− in preference to dimerization (Fig. 2a). Using the FOX assay (24Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) to detect hydroperoxides, a positive response was obtained with Tyr-Gly (YG) but not Gly-Tyr (GY) (Fig. 2b), in agreement with previous observations (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that hydroperoxide formation requires an N-terminal Tyr. Substantial O2⋅−-dependent hydroperoxide formation was observed with Leu-Enk and Endo2, but despite having an N-terminal Tyr, Met-Enk gave no detectable hydroperoxide by FOX analysis (Fig. 2b). It should be noted that the FOX assay was calibrated with H2O2 as no hydroperoxide standards are available, and this results in underestimation of hydroperoxide yields. The version of the assay used here gives a 6-fold lower response to tyrosine hydroperoxide than H2O2 (5Winterbourn C.C. Parsons-Mair H.N. Gebicki S. Gebicki J.M. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Assuming that tyrosyl peptides behave similarly, the data in Fig. 2 indicate that the enkephalins gave more hydroperoxide than dimer. For Leu-Enk, this was confirmed by direct analysis (see below). Tyr-Gly and Peptides with N-terminal Tyr Residues—To establish the structures of the peptide hydroperoxides directly, the products of the reactions of Leu-Enk, YG, and Endo2 were analyzed by LC/MS. Each gave, in addition to the dimer, a major product with molecular mass corresponding to the native peptide + 32 (potentially the hydroperoxide) and a product at a mass of the native peptide + 16 (monoxide) (Fig. 3). In some cases two peaks of equivalent mass and fragmentation pattern were evident, presumably representing o- and p-isomers. Formation of both species was strongly inhibited by SOD. Based on peak integrals and assuming the two species had similar MS characteristics, more dioxides than monoxides were present. The monoxides are assumed to have arisen from hydrolysis of the hydroperoxides during the reaction and sample processing (as in Ref. 7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1993; : 1583-1588Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar and shown below in Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Intermolecular reaction of Leu-Enk hydroperoxide (Leu-Enk-OOH) with (a) Met and (b) Met-Enk. Decay of Leu-Enk-OOH (10 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer) was measured in the presence and absence of 200 μm methionine by LC/MS, or 200 μm Met-Enk by the FOX assay. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (50 μm) was present for a but not b. Leu-Enk-OOH was generated using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 30 min incubation, 20 μg/ml catalase was added and the enzymes were removed by centrifugation using an Amicon 10-kDa cutoff filter. The reaction of Leu-Enk-OOH with Met-Enk was also monitored by LC/MS, where a similar second-order rate constant was obtained (k = 0.18 m–1 s–1). Loss of the hydroperoxide was accompanied by increases in the Leu-Enk monoxide and Met-Enk sulfoxide peaks at similar rates. The rate of the reaction was also investigated at lower Met-Enk concentrations. The obtained pseudo-first ordered rate constants together with the fits of the pseudo-first order kinetic traces to a single exponential curve indicate that the overall reaction is indeed second-order (first-order for both [Leu-Enk-OOH] and [Met-Enk]).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The yield of Leu-Enk hydroperoxide was measured under the conditions of Fig. 3a with the peak integral calibrated on the basis of the Phe content of the purified product (see “Experimental Procedures”). For three independent experiments, 10.7 μm (S.D. 0.5) hydroperoxide and 4.5 μm dimer (S.D. 0.4) were formed. These accounted for the majority of the total Leu-Enk loss. This result shows that the hydroperoxide was the major product in our systems. MS/MS fragment ions were assigned for the dioxide and monoxide products. As shown for YG, the parent peptide gave the expected a1 fragment for Tyr (Fig. 4a). The monoxide (Fig. 4b) gave a1 and b1 fragment ions with the extra oxygen attached to the Tyr residue, and the dioxide (Fig. 4c) gave an a1 fragment containing both oxygens. Where there was loss of H2O from the monoxide, H2O2 was lost from the dioxide, implying that the two differ by an -OH or -OOH at the same site. Similar features were evident in the fragmentation patterns of the dioxide and monoxide products for Leu-Enk and Endo2 (not shown) and fits obtained using the Bioworks Browser (as for Met-Enk in Fig. S5) were consistent with the extra oxygens in these peptides being attached to the Tyr. YG monoxide had a very similar fragmentation pattern to the monoxide formed by exposing free Tyr to the XO/HRP system (HOHICA in Fig. S1a). Both showed the same a1 fragment with an extra oxygen and the m/z 134 peak (representing loss of water from the a1 fragment and thus a lack of aromaticity, see later). The m/z 134 peak, plus the absence of the peak representing ammonia loss (presumably reflecting lack of a free amino group), are key features that discriminate these structures from other theoretical alternatives with the same mass (II and III in Fig. 1c: data in Fig. S1, b and c). As HOHICA (I in Fig. 1b) has been characterized as a bicyclic compound (7Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1993; : 1583-1588Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we conclude that YG dioxide has a hydroperoxide on the Tyr ring that has undergone the same conjugate addition (Fig. 1b, reaction 5). Gly-Tyr—Although GY gave no detectable hydroperoxide in Fig. 2b, low yields of dioxide and monoxide derivatives were detected by LC/MS (Fig. 3c). The fragmentation patterns (Fig. S2) show a hydroperoxide group, or corresponding -OH, located on the Tyr, and also suggest (as discussed below for peptides containing Met) that the Tyr ring is modified by conjugate addition of the amide nitrogen. The situation was different for peptides containing Met. We investigated dipeptides MY, YM, as well as Met-Enk and Gly-Met-Enk. These peptides produced dimers when exposed to the XO/HRP system, and dimerization was enhanced when O2⋅− was removed with SOD (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). LC/MS analysis (Fig. 5, a–d, and Table 1) showed that a dioxygenated M + 32 + H+ species was produced from all the peptides. Formation of the dioxygenated species required O2⋅− as it was suppressed by SOD. However, none of the peptides gave a positive response in the FOX assay (Table 1 and Fig. 2b), implying that the two-oxygen addition products were not hydroperoxides.TABLE 1Methionyl peptides examined for dioxide formationAmino acid sequenceMolecular massRTaRT retention time.

The mechanism of LFA-1 activation involves both affinity and avidity regulation, but the role of each in T cell activation remains unclear. We have identified antibodies that recognize and block different affinity states of the mouse LFA-1 I-domain. Monoclonal antibody 2D7 preferentially binds to the low affinity conformation, and this specific binding is abolished when LFA-1 is locked in the high affinity conformation. In contrast, M17/4 can bind both the locked high and low affinity forms of LFA-1. Although both 2D7 and M17/4 are blocking antibodies, 2D7 is significantly less potent than M17/4 in blocking LFA-1-mediated adhesion; thus, blocking high affinity LFA-1 is critical for preventing LFA-1-mediated adhesion. Using these reagents, we investigated whether LFA-1 affinity regulation affects T cell activation. We found that blocking high affinity LFA-1 prevents interleukin-2 production and T cell proliferation, demonstrated by TCR cross-linking and antigen-specific stimulation. Furthermore, there is a differential requirement of high affinity LFA-1 in the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although CD4+ T cell activation depends on both high and low affinity LFA-1, only high affinity LFA-1 provides co-stimulation for CD8+ T cell activation.

LFA-1 is constitutively expressed on the surface of leukocytes in an inactive state. Activation of LFA-1 is mediated by inside-out signals from the cytoplasm (1Springer T.A.

Subsequently, activated LFA-1 binds to the ligands and transduces outside-in signals back into the cytoplasm that result in cell adhesion and activation (12Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr.

The activation of LFA-1 is a critical event in the formation of the immunological synapse, which is important for T cell activation (2Dustin M.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 987: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Huppa J.B. Davis M.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 15Dustin M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The active state of LFA-1 is regulated by chemokines and the T cell receptor (TCR) through Rap1 signaling (16Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). LFA-1 ligation lowers the activation threshold and affects polarization in CD4+ T cells (17Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J. Herzenberg L.A. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P.

Moreover, productive LFA-1 engagement facilitates efficient activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and initiates a distinct signal essential for the effector function (18Huppa J.B. Gleimer M. Sumen C.

The mechanism of LFA-1 activation involves both affinity (conformational changes within the molecule) and avidity (receptor clustering) regulation (21Hynes R.O.

The I-domain of the LFA-1 αL subunit is the primary ligand-binding site and has been proposed to change conformation, leading to an increased affinity for ligands (24Shimaoka M. Takagi J.

Grynszpan F. Proteins. 2002; 48: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The structural basis of the conformational changes in the I-domain of LFA-1 has been extensively characterized (27Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated that the conformation of the LFA-1 I-domain changes from the low affinity to the high affinity state upon activation. By introducing disulfide bonds into the I-domain, LFA-1 can be locked in either the closed or open conformation, which represents the “low affinity” or “high affinity” state, respectively (28Lu C.

Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 22: 6009-6014Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified antibodies that are sensitive to the affinity changes in the I-domain of human LFA-1 and showed that the activation-dependent epitopes are exposed upon activation (30Ma Q. Shimaoka M. Lu C. Jing H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 10638-10641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This study supports the presence of the high affinity conformation upon LFA-1 activation in cell lines. It has been demonstrated recently that therapeutic antagonists, such as statins, inhibit LFA-1 activation and immune responses by locking LFA-1 in the low affinity state (31Weitz-Schmidt G.

Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high affinity LFA-1 has been shown to be important for mediating the adhesion of human T cells (35Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 36Shamri R. Grabovsky V. Gauguet J.M. Feigelson S. Manevich E. Kolanus W. Robinson M.K. Staunton D.E. von Andrian U.H. Alon R. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity regulation is a critical step in LFA-1 activation. LFA-1 is a molecule of great importance in the immune system, and its activation state influences the outcome of T cell activation. Our previous data using the activating LFA-1 I-domain-specific antibody MEM83 indicate that avidity and affinity of the integrin can be coupled during activation (37Carreño R. Li D. Sen M. Nira I. Yamakawa T. Ma Q. Legge G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10642-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, whether affinity or avidity regulation of LFA-1 contributes to T cell activation remains controversial (23Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 38Hynes R.O. Science. 2003; 300: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Kim M. Carman C.V. Yang W. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Despite the recent progress suggesting that conformational changes represent a key step in the activation of LFA-1, there are considerable gaps to be filled. When LFA-1 is activated, the subsequent outside-in signaling contributes to T cell activation via immunological synapse and LFA-1-dependent signaling. It is critical to determine whether high affinity LFA-1 participates in the outside-in signaling and affects the cellular activation of T cells. Nevertheless, the rapid and dynamic process of LFA-1 activation has hampered further understanding of the role of high affinity LFA-1 in primary T cell activation. The affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 increases up to 10,000-fold within seconds and involves multiple reversible steps (23Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, the activation of LFA-1 regulates both adhesion and activation of T cells, two separate yet closely associated cellular functions. When LFA-1 is constitutively expressed in the active state in mice, immune responses are broadly impaired rather than hyperactivated, suggesting the complexity of affinity regulation (40Semmrich M. Smith A. Feterowski C. Beer S. Engelhardt B. Busch D.H. Bartsch B. Laschinger M. Hogg N. Pfeffer K. Holzmann B. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which high affinity LFA-1 regulates stepwise activation of T cells in the whole animal system. In the present study, we identified antibodies recognizing and blocking different affinity states of mouse LFA-1. These reagents allowed us to determine the role of affinity regulation in T cell activation. We found that blocking high affinity LFA-1 inhibited IL-2 production and proliferation in T cells. Furthermore, there is a differential requirement of high affinity LFA-1 in antigen-specific activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The activation of CD4+ T cells depends on both high and low affinity LFA-1. For CD8+ T cell activation, only high affinity LFA-1 provides co-stimulation. Thus, affinity regulation of LFA-1 is critical for the activation and proliferation of naive T cells. Retrovirus Infection—Wild type, high affinity, or low affinity mouse αL was constructed in retrovirus expression vector pMSCVneo (BD Biosciences). Retroviral supernatants were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells. Transduction of primary mouse lymphocytes was performed as previously described (41Johnston S.C. Dustin M.L. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1181-1187PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, splenocytes were harvested from CD11a-deficient mice and cultured at 2 × 106 cell/ml in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb (catalog number 145-2C11; BD Biosciences) at 1 μg/ml for 3 days. On day two, the cells were spin-infected with retroviral supernatant in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml Polybrene for 90 min at 2,500 rpm at 37 °C. After infection, the retroviral supernatant was replaced. On day three, the cells were collected and used to assay the expression of αL by flow cytometry. Homotypic Aggregation Assay—Murine EL-4 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. The reactions were performed in flat bottom 96-well plates at 37 °C for 2 h. Then aggregation was determined using light microscopy. The degree of aggregation of EL-4 was scored as follows: 0, no cells were clustered; 1, less than 10% of cells were aggregated; 2, clustering of less than 50% of cells; 3, nearly 100% of cells were in small, loose aggregates; 4, nearly 100% of cells were in large clusters (42Wooten D.K. Teague T.K. McIntyre B.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Static Adhesion Assay—Binding of primary mouse lymphocytes to ICAM-1 was examined as described briefly, and purified mouse recombinant ICAM-1/FC (R&D Systems) was coated on flat-bottom 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C. Mouse lymphocytes were pretreated with mAb 2D7 or M17/4 or isotype control in the presence or absence of Mn2+ for 30 min at room temperature and loaded into ICAM-1-coated wells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well. The bound cells were counted under a microscope in representative fields. Mixed Lymphocyte Culture—CFSE stock (Molecular Probes) was added to the responder cells at a concentration of 0.5 μm. The experiment was performed in 48-well microtiter plates (Costar). CFSE-labeled C57BL/6 responder cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a volume of 500 μl/well and cocultured at a ratio of 2:1 with 3400-centigray irradiated C57BL/6 or Balb/C stimulator cells. The plates were then placed in a humidified incubator. OT-I and OT-II T Cell Activation—Both OT-I and OT-II mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The Ova (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR) and SIINFEKL peptides were ordered with 90% purity (SynPep). Each peptide preparation was tested for optimal biological activity before being used for experiments. TCR transgenic CD4+ (OT-II) or CD8+ (OT-I) T cells from lymph nodes of 6–8-week-old mice were positively sorted using CD4- or CD8-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Splenic APCs from C57BL/6 mice were prepared by complement-mediated lysis of Thy1+ T cells. OT-II or OT-I T cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with Ova (1, 5, and 20 μg/ml) or SIINFEKL peptide (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 μg/ml), respectively, in the presence of irradiated splenic APCs (1 × 106/ml) in 96-well plates. Culture supernatants were collected after 24 h to determine IL-2 expression. Proliferation was assayed on day 3 by adding [3H]thymidine to the culture for the last 8 h. mAbs 2D7 and M17/4 Bind to Different Affinity States of LFA-1 I-domain—mAb M17/4 has been used successfully to inhibit LFA-1-mediated immune responses in various animal disease models (6Harning R.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether the potency of M17/4 is due to its ability to block high affinity LFA-1. According to our previous study, disulfide bonds were used to lock the I-domain of human LFA-1 in the low affinity (closed) or high affinity (open) conformation (29Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 22: 6009-6014Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Ma Q. Shimaoka M. Lu C. Jing H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 10638-10641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because the sequence homology of human and mouse LFA-1 I-domains is 72.8%, we predicted that creating disulfide bonds at the equivalent sites in the mouse sequence would similarly produce either a locked low affinity or high affinity LFA-1 I-domain (supplemental Fig. 1A). We introduced cysteine mutations in mouse αL to form a disulfide bond and generate the locked closed (L289C/K294C) or open (K287C/K294C) I-domain. The subsequent models of the resulting mouse low affinity and high affinity I-domain structures are illustrated in supplemental Fig. 1B. The mutants and wild-type αL were cloned into a retrovirus vector and transduced into lymphocytes from the αL-deficient mouse. The expression level of LFA-1 was measured by both anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, two rat anti-mouse αL mAbs, M17/4 and 2D7, were used to examine the expression of mouse LFA-1. We found M17/4 can bind to wild type, high affinity, and low affinity αL. Although 2D7 bound to both wild type and low affinity αL, it did not bind to the high affinity conformation. The difference was not attributed to the lack of LFA-1 expression, because both anti-CD18 antibody and green fluorescent protein were used to confirm the protein expression level in the cells transduced with the high affinity αL. In addition, green fluorescent protein was used to confirm the protein expression level in the cells transduced with the high affinity αL (data not shown). We further investigated whether the absence of 2D7 binding is due to the conformational changes within the high affinity I-domain. Disulfide bond reduction in the locked high affinity human LFA-1 was shown to result in the conversion to the low affinity conformation (28Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 27: 2393-2398Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Ma Q. Shimaoka M. Lu C. Jing H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 10638-10641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After treating the cells with dithiothreitol, the binding of 2D7 to LFA-1 was restored to a level similar to that of wild type and low affinity LFA-1 (Fig. 1). Therefore, 2D7 preferentially binds to the low affinity conformation, and this specific binding is abolished when LFA-1 is locked in the high affinity conformation. In contrast, M17/4 can bind both the locked high and low affinity forms of LFA-1. Next, we mapped the epitopes of 2D7 and M17/4. Since neither 2D7 nor M17/4 cross-reacts with human αL, we used the previously described human-mouse chimeric αL mutants to map the epitopes (43Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The 11 αL chimeras containing segments of the mouse αL swapped into human αL or vice versa were cotransfected with mouse β2 into 293T cells (supplemental Table 1). 2D7 binds to residues 118–153, which are located at the N terminus of the I-domain. M17/4 binds to residues 249–303, which are at the C terminus of the I-domain. Thus, both 2D7 and M17/4 recognize the I-domain, but they bind to different regions. We compared the binding affinity of 2D7 and M17/4 to the inactive form of LFA-1 on resting T cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the binding curves are similar for 2D7 and M17/4, and the saturating binding dose is ∼1 μg/ml. Blocking High Affinity LFA-1 Prevents Lymphocyte Adhesion—The function of I-domain mAbs is complicated by the fact that they can either inhibit or activate the binding of LFA-1 to its ligand ICAM-1 through various mechanisms (37Carreño R. Li D. Sen M. Nira I. Yamakawa T. Ma Q. Legge G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10642-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 44Lu C. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We further examined the effect of 2D7 and M17/4 on LFA-1-mediated adhesion with aggregation assay and static adhesion assay. The purpose is to address whether blocking high affinity LFA-1 prevents LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion. In the EL-4 aggregation assay, cells were stimulated with PMA at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml in flat-bottom 96-well plates at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of either 2D7, M17/4, or isotype control. As shown in Fig. 3A, both 2D7 and M17/4 blocked homotypic aggregation of cells stimulated by PMA, but 2D7 was less efficient compared with M17/4 at equivalent concentrations. Similar results were obtained with primary mouse lymphocyte aggregation (data not shown). We then tested whether these mAbs can block the binding of primary mouse lymphocytes to ICAM-1 in the static adhesion assay. Primary mouse lymphocytes were preincubated with 2D7, M17/4, or isotype control and then loaded into 96-well flat bottom plates coated with purified mouse ICAM-1 in the presence of Mn2+. As shown in Fig. 3B, both 2D7 and M17/4 inhibited lymphocyte adhesion to ICAM-1 at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. M17/4 almost completely inhibited the adhesion, whereas 2D7 only partially blocked the adhesion with about 70% cells remaining bound to ICAM-1. Although both 2D7 and M17/4 are blocking antibodies, 2D7 is significantly less potent than M17/4 in blocking LFA-1-mediated adhesion. To confirm that high affinity LFA-1 is important for lymphocyte adhesion, we first purified αL-deficient lymphocytes transduced with either wild type, high affinity, or low affinity αL (from Fig. 1) by using a cell sorter to collect the retrovirus-transfected cells with equivalent green fluorescent protein expression level. As shown in Fig. 3C, lymphocytes expressing either wild type (WT) or low affinity (LA) LFA-1 were incapable of adhering to the coated ICAM-1 in the absence of Mn2+, whereas 38% cells with high affinity (HA) LFA-1 remained bound in the static adhesion assay. Thus, the high affinity form of αL is critical for LFA-1-mediated adhesion. High Affinity LFA-1 Facilitates IL-2 Production and Proliferation in T Cells—We identified mAbs M17/4 and 2D7, which recognize and block different affinity states of mouse LFA-1. M17/4 binds to the I-domain in both high and low affinity conformations, whereas 2D7 is an activation-sensitive mAb that preferentially binds to the low affinity LFA-1 but not to the high affinity conformation. Utilizing these reagents, we investigated whether affinity regulation of LFA-1 participates in and affects cellular activation of naive T cells. First, we examined the effects of 2D7 and M17/4 on IL-2 production in activated mouse T cells. Primary mouse T cells were activated by plate-coated anti-CD3 antibody. Secreted IL-2 in the supernatant was measured 24 h after activation. As shown in Fig. 4A, M17/4 inhibited IL-2 production at 0.1 μg/ml and almost completely blocked IL-2 production at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, whereas 2D7 only partially reduced IL-2 production to ∼60% of the control at the concentration of 1 μg/ml. Thus, blocking high affinity LFA-1 inhibits IL-2 production. It has been demonstrated that T lymphocyte proliferation is impaired in LFA-1 knock-out mice (3Ding Z.M. Babensee J.E. Simon S.I. Lu H. Perrard J.L. Bullard D.C. Dai X.Y. Bromley S.K. Dustin M.L. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. Ballantyne C.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5029-5038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether high affinity LFA-1 contributes to T cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 4B, both 2D7 and M17/4 can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation with coated anti-CD3 antibody, although the potency of 2D7 was significantly less than that of M17/4. We further examined the affinity regulation of LFA-1 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation upon alloactivation in mixed lymphocyte reactions. CFSE-labeled responder cells were plated with irradiated stimulator cells for 72 h, and cell proliferation was measured by CFSE intensity with FACS. As shown in Fig. 4C, M17/4 can inhibit the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas 2D7 showed only minimal inhibitory effect compared with control. In addition, locking LFA-1 in the low affinity state by treating the cells with lovastatin reduced T cell proliferation, similar to that observed with M17/4 (data not shown). Thus, high affinity LFA-1 is required for T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions. It has been shown that LFA-1 signaling contributes to T cell activation through the Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway in CD4+ T cells (17Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J. Herzenberg L.A. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether high affinity LFA-1 plays a role in Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Mouse T lymphocytes were activated, and phosphorylated Erk1/2 was measured by intracellular staining. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3A, 2.28% of CD4+ T cells were positive for phospho-p44/42 after 15 min of stimulation. In comparison, only 1.34% of cells were positive for the phospho-p44/42 in the presence of 2D7, whereas M17/4 reduced the frequency to 0.85%. In contrast to CD4+ T cells, the signaling in the CD8 compartment was robust, with 34.9% cells positive for phospho-p44/42. 2D7 had minimal effect on the Erk1/2 signaling. However, M17/4 reduced the percentage of phosphorylated cells to 18.1%, a 50% reduction compared with isotype control (34.9%). Thus, high affinity LFA-1 contributes to Erk1/2 signal pathway in T cell activation. Inhibition of Antigen-specific T Cell Activation with 2D7 and M17/4—LFA-1 co-stimulates lymphocyte activation by participating in the formation of the immunological synapse (2Dustin M.L. Ann. N. Y.

Plasminogen can be activated to plasmin by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasma kallikrein (PKal). The dominant plasminogen activator for mammary involution is PKal, a serine protease that participates in the contact activation system of blood coagulation. We observed that the prekallikrein gene (Klkb1) is expressed highly in the mammary gland during stromal remodeling periods including puberty and postlactational involution. We used a variant of ecotin (ecotin-PKal), a macromolecular inhibitor of serine proteases engineered to be highly specific for active PKal, to demonstrate that inhibition of PKal with ecotin-PKal delays alveolar apoptosis, adipocyte replenishment, and stromal remodeling in the involuting mammary gland, producing a phenotype resembling that resulting from plasminogen deficiency. Using biotinylated ecotin-PKal, we localized active PKal to connective tissue-type mast cells in the mammary gland.

The ultimate effector in this cascade, plasminogen as its active form, plasmin, is mediated by an intricate cascade of plasminogen activators and protease inhibitors. Plasminogen-deficient mice exhibit significant defects in lactational competence and post-lactational mammary gland involution (2Lund L.R. Bjorn S.F. Sternlicht M.D. Nielsen B.S. Solberg H. Usher P.A. Osterby R. Christensen I.J. Stephens R.W. Bugge T.H. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 2000; 127: 4481-4492PubMed Google Scholar), the process by which the differentiated, lactating gland remodels after the cessation of lactation to a state approaching that of the non-pregnant animal. The effect of plasminogen loss is exacerbated after a round of pregnancy and lactation: plasminogen-null mammary glands have poorly developed secretory alveoli during lactation, and upon involution, never fully involute. Instead, the secretory alveoli fail to regress normally. Moreover, the stroma becomes fibrotic and is cleared incompletely of partially degraded epithelial basement membrane. Because plasminogen-deficient mice largely are unable to support a second round of pregnancy and lactation (2Lund L.R. Bjorn S.F. Sternlicht M.D. Nielsen B.S. Solberg H. Usher P.A. Osterby R. Christensen I.J. Stephens R.W. Bugge T.H. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 2000; 127: 4481-4492PubMed Google Scholar), this suggests that the involution defect is not overcome by activities of other proteases eventually. These studies establish plasminogen as a crucial protease in normal mammary gland biology.Plasminogen is synthesized in the liver and circulates as a zymogen through blood plasma to all vascularized tissues of the body. As this expression and circulation are constant, activation of the plasminogen cascade must be controlled locally to avoid rampant tissue proteolysis. Accordingly, plasminogen can be activated to plasmin by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), 2The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PKal, plasma kallikrein; DPPI, dipeptidyl peptidase I; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; RT-qPCR, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction; HPRT, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; RQ, quantile regression; ECM, extracellular matrix; CAE, chloroacetate esterase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 2The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PKal, plasma kallikrein; DPPI, dipeptidyl peptidase I; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; RT-qPCR, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction; HPRT, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; RQ, quantile regression; ECM, extracellular matrix; CAE, chloroacetate esterase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasma kallikrein (3Miles L.A. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 407-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Though tPA and uPA are efficient and well characterized plasminogen activators, studies of mice singly as well as doubly targeted for deficiency of these plasminogen activators show they do not recapitulate the mammary gland phenotype of plasminogen deficiency (4Selvarajan S. Lund L.R. Takeuchi T. Craik C.S. Werb Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Instead, through use of variants of ecotin, a macromolecular inhibitor for serine proteases derived from Escherichia coli, we have previously suggested that the dominant plasminogen activator for mammary stromal involution is plasma kallikrein (PKal) (4Selvarajan S. Lund L.R. Takeuchi T. Craik C.S. Werb Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).PKal, the activated form of the zymogen prekallikrein encoded by the Klkb1 gene, is an 80-kDa serine protease that also is synthesized in the liver and circulates in plasma at about 40-50 μg/ml. PKal participates in the contact activation system of intrinsic coagulation by activating high molecular weight kininogen into bradykinin (5Baumgarten C.R. Nichols R.C. Naclerio R.M.

While plasma kallikrein is so-named due to its bradykinin-generating ability, it is in fact structurally and catalytically distinct from the large family of tissue kallikreins, which activate an alternate form of bradykinin from both high and low molecular weight kininogen (9Lima A.R.

Moreover, PKal activates plasminogen into plasmin in vitro (3Miles L.A. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 407-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), albeit less efficiently than uPA and tPA.To determine the role of PKal in plasminogen activation in vivo in mammary gland involution, we used a variant of ecotin that was engineered to be highly specific for active PKal (10Stoop A.A. Craik C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This ecotin variant, named ecotin-PKal, inhibits plasminogen activation in vivo in a model of wound healing (11Lund L.R. Green K.A. Stoop A.A. Ploug M. Almholt K. Lilla J. Nielsen B.S.

In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of PKal significantly delays mammary gland involution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Animals—Care of animals and all animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC). For postlactational mammary gland involution studies, pregnant female CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) gave birth naturally, then offspring number was normalized to 8 per mouse for each experimental animal. Offspring were weaned after 10 days of lactation, which became day 0 of involution. On days 1-4 of involution, mice were injected intraperitoneally every 12 h with either normal saline or 100 μg of ecotin-PKal as previously described (4Selvarajan S. Lund L.R. Takeuchi T. Craik C.S. Werb Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed on day 5 of involution (n = 8/group) and mammary glands were harvested. Animals were also sacrificed on each of days 1-4 of involution or were treated for days 1-4 then allowed to recover until sacrifice on day 9 of involution (n = 2/time point).For PKal localization experiments, wild-type FVB and CD1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. C57BL/6J-KitW-sh/W-sh mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI (-/-)) knock-out mice (12Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Lisa Coussens (UCSF). For all mouse mammary models, thoracic mammary glands 2 and 3 were removed for RNA or protein collection, and/or abdominal mammary glands 4 were removed for microscopic analysis. To inhibit mast cell degranulation, CD1 female mice (Charles River Laboratories) were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg body weight sodium cromoglycate (Sigma) dissolved in saline as previously described (13Jamieson T. Cook D.N. Nibbs R.J. Rot A. Nixon C. McLean P. Alcami A. Lira S.A. Wiekowski M. Graham G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and then 2 h later, mammary glands were removed for analysis.Preparation of Ecotin-PKal—A pTacTac expression vector containing the Ecotin-PKal gene was transformed into XL-1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) competent E. coli and grown at 37 °C in 2xYT media with carbenicillin at 100 μg/ml to an A600 = 0.4. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to 0.5 mm concentration and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cell culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25% sucrose 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The cell suspension was then treated for 2 h with lysozyme and EDTA at final concentrations of 1.5 mg/ml and 50 mm, respectively, to release the periplasmic protein content. The cell debris was pelleted, and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 1 mm HCl. The dialysate was again centrifuged to remove any precipitated material and then adjusted to pH > 7.0 with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. NaCl was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 300 mm and the solution was boiled in water at 100 °C for 10 min. Denatured material was removed by centrifugation, and the solution was dialyzed against distilled water overnight. The dialysate was concentrated to <5 ml by membrane ultrafiltration using Amicon YM-10, (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and then syringe-filtered (0.22 μm). Trifluoroacetic acid was added to 0.1% and Ecotin-PKal was purified from a C4 semi-prep column (Vydac, Deerfield, IL) using an acetonitrile gradient. Ecotin-PKal typically eluted at 35% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid water (v/v). Fractions corresponding to Ecotin-PKal were lyophilized, re-dissolved in distilled water, and stored at 4 °C for later use.Ecotin-PKal Inhibition Kinetics—Active mouse plasmin was obtained from Haematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant mouse plasma kallikrein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was obtained as a pro-enzyme and activated with thermolysin (R&D Systems) as described by the manufacturer. All binding titrations and dilutions of reagents were carried out in reaction buffer: 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20. Ecotin-PKal was diluted to final concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm for plasmin assays and from 0.1 pm to 10 μm for plasma kallikrein assays. In the binding assays, plasmin and plasma kallikrein were present at 10 nm and 1 nm, respectively. The reactions were performed in triplicate in a 96-well plate with a final volume of 250 μl. The reactants were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After the incubation time, the activity was measured by addition of a p-nitroanilide peptide substrate and then by monitoring the absorbance (λ = 405 nm) at room temperature. Plasmin activity was measured using the S-2251 substrate (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy) at a final concentration of 600 μm. Plasma kallikrein activity was measured using the S-2232 substrate (Chromogenix) at a final concentration of 800 μm. Initial velocities of the reaction were calculated using Softmax Pro Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The rates were averaged over all three trials. The average rates were normalized to the rate of the negative control (0 nm ecotin-PKal) sample to yield V/Vmax. The rates were plotted versus ligand (ecotin-PKal) concentration and fitted to V/Vmax = 1 - L/(IC50 + L) using Kaleidograph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) to determine the Ki for each of the enzymes.Western Blotting and Affinity Chromatography—Mammary glands were lysed in pH 8 radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) plus complete protease inhibitors, homogenized, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C to collect supernatant. Ecotin-PKal biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin (EZ-Link, Pierce) was used to generate affinity chromatography columns using immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce). Mammary lysates (1 mg) were added to the columns and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. PKal was detected by Western blotting of mammary lysates, column flow-thru, and column beads boiled in sample buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis under reducing, denaturing conditions on 4-12% bis-Tris acrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscat-away, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween in PBS and incubated overnight with a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant mouse KLKB1 (1:1000, R&D Systems) in blocking solution. Membranes were washed and incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences) before detection with ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescence—Right no. 4 mammary glands were removed, weighed, and immediately embedded in OCT (Sakura, Torrance, CA) medium on dry ice. Left no. 4 mammary glands were removed and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, then processed for paraffin embedding. 5-μm frozen or paraffin sections were cut for use in histology, enzyme histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. To visualize gland lipid content, frozen sections were fixed additionally overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, then rinsed in PBS, and air-dried for ≥3 h. Slides were then stained in Oil Red O (60% saturated Oil Red O (Sigma, 0.5% in isopropyl alcohol); 40% (1% type III corn dextrin (Sigma) in distilled water)) for 20 min. Slides were rinsed in PBS then counterstained briefly in Gill's hematoxylin (Sigma) and rinsed and stored in PBS. To examine overall gland morphology and stromal composition, Masson's Trichrome (Sigma) was used to stain paraffin sections according to the manufacturer's instructions. To visualize collagen content in the glands, paraffin sections were stained with 0.1% sirius red in saturated picric acid (picro-sirius red) (14Junqueira L.C. Bignolas G. Brentani R.R. Histochem. J. 1979; 11: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar) and observed under polarizing light. We identified apoptotic cells in paraffin sections of mammary tissue using an antibody against caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (M30 CytoDEATH, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis (15Leers M.P. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. Bergman T. Tribbick G. Persson B. Bjorklund P. Ramaekers F.C. Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornvall H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Positively stained cells were visualized with mouse-on-mouse immunodetection (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (Fast DAB, Sigma).To visualize mast cells, frozen sections were air-dried for ∼30 min, post-fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, and then stained in either Toluidine blue (a metachromatic dye for mast cells, made up as 0.1% Toluidine blue O (Sigma) in 1% sodium chloride, pH 2.3), Csaba stain (Alcian blue/Safranin O, an amine/heparin stain for mast cells, made up as 0.36% Alcian blue (Sigma), 0.018% Safranin O (Sigma) in acetate buffer, pH 1.42), or by using an enzymatic reaction with naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase (Sigma) to detect chymase activity (16Moloney W.C. McPherson K. Fliegelman L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1960; 8: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), then counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin or DAPI. For inhibitor-localization, frozen sections were prepared as above, then incubated overnight with 50 nm ecotin-PKal (10Stoop A.A. Craik C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin (EZ-Link, Pierce), followed by 1-h incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen). Plasma kallikrein immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections following sodium citrate antigen retrieval using a polyclonal antibody against recombinant mouse KLKB1 (R&D Systems) 1:50 overnight at 4 °C followed by a 30 min incubation with biotinylated anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) visualized using Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (Fast DAB, Sigma).Histological and immunochemical images were acquired at 100× or 200× using a Leica DMR microscope and Leica Fire-Cam with accompanying software. Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop software for analysis. Quantification of apoptotic cells was performed by counting the number of CytoDEATH+ cells in lumen spaces per 100× field. Quantification of lipid content was performed by measuring the number of Oil red O+ pixels per 100× field and expressing this as a percentage of the total field. Quantification of collagen was performed by measuring the number of collagen+ pixels per 200× field and expressing this as a percentage of the total field. A minimum of 4 independent images per animal in each group was analyzed for each assay.Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated from thoracic mammary glands cleared for muscle and lymph tissue at 3 weeks, 5 weeks, 15 days pregnant, 10 days lactating, and 4 days involuted CD1 mice. Liver tissue was used as a positive control. RNA isolation was performed using the RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) phenol/guanidine thiocyanate/chloroform method for RNA isolation and concentration of RNA was measured spectrophotometrically. 5 μg of total RNA was used to perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using Superscript II reverse transcriptase oligo(dT) reagents (Invitrogen). cDNA products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose/TAE gels to check thoroughness of the reverse transcriptase reaction.Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed by the Biomolecular Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco. Klkb1 gene expression was normalized against expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), and reported as a RQ score relative to Klkb1 expression in 5-week-old mammary glands. Oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probe used were as follows: Klkb1 (1272): forward primer: 5′-TGGTCGCCAATGGGTACTG-3′; Klkb1 (1342): reverse primer: 5′-ATATACGCCACACATCTGGATAGG-3′; Klkb1 probe: 5′-(FAM)-CAGCTGCCCATTGCTTTGATGGAATT-(BHQ1)-3′.PCR was conducted in triplicate with 20-μl reaction volumes of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.9 mm of each primer, 250 nm probe, and 5 μl of cDNA. The PCR reaction was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C, 10 min, 1 cycle; 95 °C, 15 s then 60 °C, 2 min, 40 cycles. Analysis was carried out using the sequence detection software (SDS 2.1) supplied with TaqMan 7900HT (Applied Biosystems).RESULTSEcotin-PKal Is Specific for Human and Mouse Plasma Kallikrein—Previous work conducted in this laboratory suggested that plasma kallikrein is a regulator of in vivo adipogenesis in the mammary gland during involution (4Selvarajan S. Lund L.R. Takeuchi T. Craik C.S. Werb Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the ecotin and ecotin variant (ecotin RR) used in the previous study target numerous serine proteases, including uPA in addition to PKal (17Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a recently developed variant of ecotin that has picomolar specificity for PKal (ecotin-PKal), while having Ki* values four to seven orders of magnitude higher for related serine proteases. Importantly, the Ki*ofecotin-PKal for human plasmin is six orders of magnitude higher than the Ki* for human PKal, and seven orders of magnitude higher for the human plasminogen activators uPA and tPA (10Stoop A.A. Craik C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The only other protease that ecotin-PKal inhibits with reasonable (260-fold less) effectiveness is human Factor XIIa (10Stoop A.A. Craik C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This inhibition does not interfere with our investigation of the effects of PKal activity as PKal interacts with Factor XIIa as part of a reciprocal activation loop. Ecotin-PKal binding to serine proteases follows slow-tight binding kinetics (18Eggers C.T. Wang S.X. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 975-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To validate specificity in our mouse model system, binding titrations against mouse plasmin and mouse PKal were performed using ecotin-PKal as a ligand and measuring remaining (uninhibited) enzyme activity using p-nitroanilide substrates (Fig. 1A). The apparent affinities (Ki) of ecotin-PKal for mouse PKal and mouse plasmin were determined to be 40 nm and 60 μm, respectively. The affinity of ecotin-PKal for mouse PKal is still 1000-fold greater than its affinity for mouse plasmin, although less than for human PKal. Therefore, to inhibit PKal in vivo during mammary gland involution, we estimated that in our dosing regimen, peak circulating concentrations of ecotin-PKal in mouse plasma approach 2 μm, nearly 30-fold less than the apparent Ki for ecotin-PKal inhibition of plasmin. 3C. Craik, unpublished data. Thus, the effects of ecotin-PKal administration are due to the inhibition of mouse PKal and not of mouse plasmin in our model system.We collected mammary glands from 4-day involuting mammary glands, when PKal is highly expressed in these tissues (see below), to determine whether ecotin-PKal can bind active PKal from mammary tissue lysate. Using biotinylated ecotin-PKal-bound streptavidin beads, we pulled down PKal from mammary gland lysates (Fig. 1B). The bands indicated on the blot represent the full-length protein (∼80 kDa), and in its active form under reducing conditions, PKal heavy (∼42 kDa) and light (∼28 kDa) chains, which have at least one and two identified N-glycosylated Asn residues, respectively, according to the SwissProt Protein Data base. Similar results were obtained from 5-week-old virgin mammary gland lysates (data not shown). These data confirm that ecotin-PKal binds PKal found in the mammary gland.Mouse Plasma Kallikrein Is Differentially Expressed in the Developing Mammary Gland—Prekallikrein (gene: Klkb1), the precursor of PKal, is expressed in a variety of mouse and human tissues outside of the liver (19Cerf M.E. Raidoo D.M. Metab. Brain. Dis. 2000; 15: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Ciechanowicz A. Bader M. Wagner J. Ganten D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Neth P. Arnhold M. Nitschko H. Fink E. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wished to determine whether PKal is expressed in the mammary gland, and if its expression is altered during different phases of mammary gland development, when careful regulation of plasminogen activation is required.The process of pubertal mammary gland development begins around 3 weeks of age and continues until the advancing ductal epithelium reaches the end of the fat pad, around 8-10 weeks of age. We examined Klkb1 gene expression in the mouse mammary gland at different postnatal development time points (3 weeks, 5 weeks, 15 days pregnant, 10 days lactating, and 4 days involuting) by RT-qPCR. Klkb1 mRNA was abundant during pubertal development, when the mammary gland is undergoing active remodeling as the ductal epithelium expands and advances through the stromal fat pad (Fig. 2A). During pregnancy and lactation, when the stroma has largely been replaced by secretory alveoli and extensive ductal structures, Klkb1 mRNA was markedly reduced. Klkb1 mRNA increased significantly during mammary gland involution, when the secretory epithelial structures die by apoptosis and the mammary stromal compartment is replenished. These findings indicate that PKal is produced in the mammary gland, and that its increased expression levels correlate with periods of stromal remodeling.FIGURE 2Plasma kallikrein message is present in the mammary gland and the active protease localizes to mammary gland mast cells. A, real-time qPCR analysis of Klkb1 expression in mammary gland RNA shows that Klkb1 is differentially expressed throughout postnatal mammary gland development. RT-qPCR performed in triplicate for Klkb1 expression normalized against HPRT and reported as a RQ score relative to Klkb1 expression in 5-week-old mammary glands from CD1 mice. Increased expression correlates to periods of active stromal remodeling during mammary development. Error bars represent S.D. B, frozen section of 5-day-involuting mammary gland using Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (green) to visualize 50 nm bound biotinylated ecotin-PKal; DAPI counterstain (blue). White arrowheads indicate representative ecotin-PKal staining. C, staining is absent in presence of excess (50 μm) non-biotinylated ecotin-PKal. Scale bar for B-E is 100 μm. D, mast cells clustered around a large mammary blood vessel stain positively for active PKal when visualized using biotinylated ecotin-PKal. Frozen sections of 5-day-involuting mammary gland were stained with biotinylated ecotin-PKal as above. E, serial section of D stained for mast cells with Csaba stain shows that cells labeled by ecotin-PKal are mast cells. Black arrowheads indicate representative Csaba stained-mast cells. F, paraffin section of 5-week-old mammary gland shows mast cells in the mammary stroma stained with Toluidine blue, which stains mast cell granules purple. Sections were treated as a negative control for staining shown in G. Black arrowheads indicate Toluidine blue-stained mast cells. G, serial section of F immunostained with KLKB1 antibody followed by DAB shows that mammary gland mast cells stain positively for plasma kallikrein using conventional immunohistochemistry. Black arrowheads indicate Toluidine blue-stained, DAB+ mast cells. Scale bar for F and G is 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biotinylated Ecotin-PKal Localizes Active Plasma Kallikrein to Mast Cells—Prekallikrein is expressed in the mammary gland in addition to circulating prekallikrein from the liver. However, it is active PKal that is inhibited by ecotin-PKal in vivo, resulting in repressed mammary gland involution. Therefore, we wished to identify which cells in the mammary gland are the sites of PKal activity. We used the biotinylated form of ecotin-PKal to localize the active protease in 5-day-involuting mammary gland tissue sections, taking advantage of ecotin-PKal's high affinity for the active form of PKal. Biotinylated ecotin-PKal stained a subset of cells in the mammary gland (Fig. 2B), and this staining was absent in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of non-biotinylated ecotin-PKa"
https://openalex.org/W2118410051,"ArfGAP1 is a prototype of GTPase-activating proteins for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and has been proposed to be involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by regulating the uncoating of coat protein I (COPI)-coated vesicles. Depletion of ArfGAP1 by RNA interference, however, causes neither a discernible phenotypic change in the COPI localization nor a change in the Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport. Therefore, we also examined ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3, closely related homologues of ArfGAP1. Cells in which ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 are simultaneously knocked down show an increase in the GTP-bound ARF level. Furthermore, in these cells proteins resident in or cycling through the cis-Golgi, including ERGIC-53, β-COP, and GM130, accumulate in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport is blocked. The phenotypes observed in the triple ArfGAP knockdown cells are similar to those seen in β-COP-depleted cells. Both the triple ArfGAP- and β-COP-depleted cells accumulate characteristic vacuolar structures that are visible under electron microscope. Furthermore, COPI is concentrated at rims of the vacuolar structures in the ArfGAP-depleted cells. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 have overlapping roles in regulating COPI function in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport.

Once associated with organellar membranes in their GTP-bound form, these proteins trigger formation of coated carrier vesicles, e.g. coat protein I (COPI)-coated vesicles. ARFs cycle between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state; in the latter form they recruit various effectors, including the COPI coat (1Nickel W. Wieland F.T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Donaldson J.G. Honda A. Weigert R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Exchange of bound GDP for GTP is catalyzed by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which constitute a large family of proteins that share a Sec7-like catalytic domain (3Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 579-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 4Shin H.-W. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis in turn is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which constitute a large family that share a zinc finger-like catalytic domain (3Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 579-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 5Nie Z. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).COPI-coated vesicles mediate retrograde transport from the cis-Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to the ER and probably intra-Golgi transport as well. In budding yeasts two ARF-GAPs, Gcs1 and Glo3, have been shown to play overlapping roles in COPI-mediated transport processes (6Lewis S.M. Poon P.P. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Spang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4064-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Poon P.P. Cassel D. Spang A. Rotman M. Pick E. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). According to the prevailing view, ARF-GAPs (in particular, ArfGAP1, which is the founding member of mammalian ARF-GAPs and the counterpart of yeast Gcs1) (8Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) either induce dissociation of the coat from COPI-coated vesicles or antagonize formation of vesicles (for review, see Ref. 5Nie Z. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This view is based on several lines of evidence; first, blocking GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 by adding GTPγS or a GTPase-defective ARF1 mutant inhibits uncoating of COPI-coated vesicles in a cell-free reconstitution system (9Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), indirectly suggesting a role for ARF-GAP in vesicle uncoating; second, overexpression of the GTPase-defective ARF1 mutant stabilizes the COPI coat on Golgi membranes (10Teal S.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); third, overexpression of ArfGAP1 results in a phenotype similar to that induced by inhibiting ARF-guanine-nucleotide exchange factors; that is, cytosolic distribution of the COPI coat and disintegration of the Golgi apparatus (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); fourth, the addition of ArfGAP1 to an in vitro system inhibits formation of COPI-coated vesicles and induces uncoating of pre-existing vesicles (12Reinhard C. Schweikert M. Wieland F.T. Nickel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8253-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); finally, ArfGAP1-mediated GTP hydrolysis is stimulated by the addition of the COPI coat in vitro (13Szafer E. Rotman M. Cassel D.

Nature. 2003; 426: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have proposed a model in which ArfGAP1 and Gcs1 sense the curvature of budding vesicles through a motif outside of their catalytic domain.Despite the critical roles of ArfGAP1 in COPI-coated vesicle formation, most of the available data regarding their function have been obtained by in vitro experiments. We, therefore, attempted to determine the function of ArfGAP1 in the cell by exploiting RNA interference (RNAi). However, we could not detect any phenotypic change in ArfGAP1 knockdown cells. Because there are two poorly characterized mammalian ArfGAPs, ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 (25Kahn R.A. Bruford E. Inoue H. Logsdon Jr., J.M. Nie Z. Premont R.T. Randazzo P.A. Satake M. Theibert A.B.

An expression vector for N-terminal EGFP+VSVG-tagged KDELR (pCIpreEGFP-VSVG-KDELR) was constructed by exchanging a cDNA segment of the mature human KDELR2 region (kindly provided by Victor Hsu, Harvard Medical School) (36Yang J.-S.

Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) for the region covering the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of VSVG in pCIpreEGFP-VSVG.Cell Culture, RNAi Suppression, VSVG Transport Experiments, and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Culture of HeLa cells and transfection of expression plasmids were performed as described previously (35Shin H.-W.

Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, ArfGAP3, or β-COP was performed as previously described (39Ishizaki R. Shin H.-W. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Nakayama K. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, pools of siRNAs directed for the mRNA regions covering nucleotide residues 328-947, 400-1542, 397-1530, and 321-1040 (when the A residue of the initiation Met codon is assigned as residue 1) were prepared using a BLOCK-iT RNAi TOPO Transcription kit and a BLOCK-iT Dicer RNAi kit (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with the siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated overnight. The transfected cells were then transferred to a culture dish containing coverslips, further incubated for up to 120 and 48 h in the case of ArfGAP knockdown and β-COP knockdown, respectively, and processed for immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses and transport assays.Transport of EGFP-VSVG from the ER to the cell surface was examined as described previously (35Shin H.-W. Kobayashi H. Kitamura M. Waguri S. Suganuma T. Uchiyama Y. Nakayama K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with pCIpreEGFP-VSVG were incubated at 40 °C overnight, then at 32 °C for up to 60 min. Retrograde transport of the EGFP-VSVG-KDELR chimera was assayed as follows; HeLa cells transfected with pCIpreEGFP-VSVG-KDELR were incubated at 40 °C overnight and at 20 °C for 3 h to accumulate the KDELR chimera in the Golgi. The cells were then incubated at 40 °C again for 2 h and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. Internalization of extracellularly applied transferrin was examined as described previously (38Shin H.-W. Morinaga N. Noda M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Determination of Intracellular Level of GTP-bound ARF—To determine the level of GTP-bound ARF, lysates of control cells or of siRNA-treated cells were subjected to pulldown assays using the GAT domain of GGA1, as described previously (40Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Nakayama K. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 41Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were pulled down with the glutathione S-transferase-GGA1(GAT) domain, pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare Biosciences), and bound materials were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ARF1 antibody (3F1).Electron Microscopy—For conventional electron microscopy, control and siRNA-treated cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. They were post-fixed with 1% OsO4, embedded in Epon812, and sectioned as previously described (42Waguri S. Kohmura M. Gotow T. Watanabe T. Ohsawa Y. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1999; 62: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Small vesicles/tubules near vacuoles were counted in 1.6 × 1.6-μm regions that were randomly selected within perinuclear region (40 areas from 20 cells). The count was normalized to the total area, excluding the vacuolar area, measured using the Meta-Morph image processing software (Universal Imaging Corporation; West Chester, PA), and expressed as the number of vesicles/tubules per 1 μm2. Immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin cryosections was performed as described previously (35Shin H.-W. Kobayashi H. Kitamura M. Waguri S. Suganuma T. Uchiyama Y. Nakayama K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Waguri S. Kohmura M. Gotow T. Watanabe T. Ohsawa Y. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1999; 62: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).RESULTSKnockdown of ArfGAP1 Alone Has No Discernible Effect—In the prevailing model (5Nie Z. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) ArfGAP1 is involved in cargo selection and formation of COPI-coated vesicles, as well as in their uncoating through inactivating ARFs. To explore the role of ArfGAP1 in COPI-mediated transport, we looked for phenotypic changes in cells depleted of ArfGAP1 by RNAi. By transfecting HeLa cells with a pool of siRNAs targeted against ArfGAP1, the ArfGAP1 protein was depleted by more than 95% (supplemental Fig. S1A, top panel), and a typical Golgi-like staining for ArfGAP1 was eliminated (supplemental Fig. S1B). We then compared subcellular localization of various proteins between cells depleted of ArfGAP1 (supplemental Fig. S2B) and control cells transfected with siRNAs for LacZ (supplemental Fig. S2A). However, we failed to detect a significant difference between the knockdown and control cells in the localization of proteins. The proteins examined included: β-COP (top panels), a COPI subunit; ERGIC-53 (middle panels), which is a major type I membrane protein containing a C-terminal di-lysine motif and which cycles between the cis-Golgi and ER (43Appenzeller-Herzog C. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar); GM130 (bottom panels), a cis-Golgi matrix protein (44Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We also examined the effects of ArfGAP1 knockdown on retrograde and anterograde transport of model cargo proteins. However, ArfGAP1 knockdown affected neither retrieval of a VSVG-KDELR construct from the cis-Golgi to the ER nor anterograde transport of a GFP-VSVG construct from the ER to the plasma membrane through the Golgi (data not shown; see below).Simultaneous Depletion of ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 Disorganizes the Golgi Structure—We then examined a possibility that there might be another ARFGAP(s) that also participates in the COPI-mediated process. In mammals there are less well characterized paralogs (ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3) of ArfGAP1. At the sequence level, ArfGAP1 is similar to yeast Gcs1, whereas ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 are more similar to Glo3 (26Yahara N. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2604-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Frigerio G. Grimsey N. Dale M. Majoul I. Duden R. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1644-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Liu X. Zhang C. Xing G. Chen Q. He F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Zhang C. Yu Y. Zhang S. Liu M. Xing G. Wei H. Bi J. Liu X. Zhou G. Dong C. Hu Z. Zhang Y. Luo L. Wu C. Zhao S. He F. Genomics. 2000; 63: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).We raised and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to ArfGAP2 and ArfGAP3 and used them to compare protein localization with that of various marker proteins. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, the antibodies each recognize a single band in immunoblot analysis; band intensities were specifically decreased by the appropriate siRNA treatment. When HeLa cells were doubly stained for any one of the ArfGAPs and GM130, the staining for ArfGAPs overlapped almost completely with the GM130 staining in the perinuclear Golgi region (supplemental Fig. S3, A-C). In contrast, the ArfGAP staining was juxtaposed to, but not significantly overlapping with staining for golgin-245 (supplemental Fig. S3, D-F), a protein associated with the trans-Golgi (45Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.-H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To unequivocally show cis-Golgi localization of these ArfGAPs, HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole to fragment the Golgi structure; the fragmented Golgi structures are composed of mini-stacks and are suitable for examining cis and trans polarity (46Cole N.B. Sciaky N. Marotta A. Song J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 631-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In the fragmented Golgi structures, the staining for any ArfGAP overlapped almost completely with that for GM130 (supplemental Fig. S3, G-I) but juxtaposed to that for golgin-245 (supplemental Fig. S3, J-L), indicating that these three ArfGAPs are associated predominantly with the cis-Golgi.We then examined whether depletion of ArfGAP2 or ArfGAP3 affected the localization of Golgi proteins and transport between the ER and Golgi. Despite the successful depletion of ArfGAP2 or ArfGAP3 by RNAi (supplemental Fig. S1), however, we failed to detect any difference in either the subcellular localization of Golgi proteins examined, anterograde transport of GFP-VSVG from the ER to the Golgi, or retrograde transport of VSVG-KDELR from the cis-Golgi to the ER (data not shown) between control cells and cells knocked down of ArfGAP2 or ArfGAP3.We next examined effects of depletion of any pairwise combination of ArfGAPs but failed to detect any significant difference in the subcellular distribution of the Golgi proteins, including ERGIC-53, β-COP, and GM130, between control cells and double-depleted cells (ArfGAP1 + 2, ArfGAP1 + 3, or ArfGAP2 + 3) (Fig. 1).However, in a subpopulation (∼30%) of cells in which ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3 were simultaneously knocked down, we found significant changes in the distribution of the Golgi proteins. ERGIC-53 disappeared from reticular ER-like structures and instead became predominant in punctate ERGIC-like structures (Fig. 1R). In contrast, the reticular staining for protein disulfide isomerase, an ER marker, was unchanged in the triple knockdown cells (Fig. 1Q), indicative of the integrity of the ER. These observations suggest that retrieval of ERGIC-53 from the ERGIC/cis-Golgi to the ER is blocked in cells simultaneously depleted of ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3. Furthermore, β-COP and GM130 were redistributed from perinuclear Golgi-like structures to punctate ERGIC-like structures in a subpopulation of the triple knockdown cells (Fig. 1, S and T).To support the hypothesis that these phenotypic changes are indeed induced by ArfGAP depletion, we then compared levels of GTP-bound active ARF in the control and knockdown cells. To this end we employed a pulldown assay using the GAT domain of GGA1, which specifically interacts with GTP-bound but not GDP-bound ARF (38Shin H.-W. Morinaga N. Noda M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) under the assumption that GTP hydrolysis on ARF would be slowed (i.e. that the level of GTP-bound ARF would be increased) if the ArfGAP levels were decreased. As shown in Fig. 2, the level of GTP-bound ARF was not significantly changed in cells depleted of single ArfGAP (lanes 7-9) as compared with the control cells (lane 6). In striking contrast, the level of GTP-bound ARF was robustly increased in the triple ArfGAP knockdown cells (lane 10). Thus, the phenotypic changes observed in the triple knockdown cells are correlated with an increase in the level of GTP-bound ARF, i.e. with a decrease in the ArfGAP levels.FIGURE 2Increase in the GTP-bound ARF level in cells simultaneously knocked down of ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3. Lysates were prepared from HeLa cells treated for 120 h with siRNAs for LacZ (lanes 1, 6, and 11) or for ArfGAP1 (lanes 2, 7, and 12), ArfGAP2 (lanes 3, 8, and 13), ArfGAP3 (lanes 4, 9, and 14), or ArfGAP1+ArfGAP2+ArfGAP3 (lanes 5, 10, and 15) and subjected to pulldown with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GGA1(GAT) (lanes 6-10) or GST (lanes 11-15). The data are representatives of five independent experiments for the control and triple ArfGAP knockdown cells and two independent experiments for the single ArfGAP knockdown cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the course of these experiments, we noticed that the triple knockdown cells showed two distinct phenotypes in terms of subcellular distribution of ERGIC-53 and β-COP. As shown in Fig. 3A, a fraction of these cells showed a punctate ERGIC-like distribution of ERGIC-53 and β-COP (stage 1), whereas a minor fraction showed perinuclear aggregates of ERGIC-53 and β-COP (stage 2). Extending the period of siRNA treatment (96 to 120 h) resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of both the stage 1 (21-34%) and stage 2 (4-11%) cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the stage 2 phenotype is the more severe of the two. However, further siRNA treatment resulted in a decrease in the stage 1 and stage 2 populations (data not shown), probably because of the death of cells completely depleted of all the three ArfGAPs, as reported previously (27Frigerio G. Grimsey N. Dale M. Majoul I. Duden R. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1644-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and because of selective growth of cells incompletely depleted of any of the three ArfGAPs. For the following experiments we, therefore, used cells treated for 120 h with siRNAs for ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3.FIGURE 3Two distinct phenotypic stages in cells triple-depleted of ArfGAP1, ArfGAP2, and ArfGAP3. A, HeLa cells treated for 120 h with siRNAs for ArfGAP1+ArfGAP2+ArfGAP3 were double-stained for ERGIC-53 (a-c) and β-COP (a′-c′). Cells with normal distribution of ERGIC-53 and β-COP (a and a′) or with typical stage 1 (b and b′) or stage 2 (c and c′) distributions are shown. B, HeLa cells treated with siRNAs for ArfGAP1+ArfGAP2+ArfGAP3 for 96 or 120 h were classified as having normal, stage 1, and stage 2 distributions of ERGIC-53, and the number of cells with each distribution was counted. The number (n) is the sum of counted cells in three independent experiments. C, HeLa cells treated with siRNAs for ArfGAP1+ArfGAP2+ArfGAP3 for 96 h were transfected with an expression vector for C-terminal-HA-tagged ArfGAP2 (a-a″) or ArfGAP3 (b-b″) and incubated for 24 h, then triply stained for HA (a and b), ERGIC-53 (a′ and b′) and β-COP (a′ and b′). Cells overexpressing ArfGAP2-HA or ArfGAP3-HA are indicated by asterisks. D, the number of cells with normal, stage 1, and stage 2 distribution of ERGIC-53 in mock-transfected cells or cells overexpressing either ArfGAP2-HA or ArfGAP3-HA.

https://openalex.org/W2020476577,"Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) modification of IκBα has been described to actively participate in NFκB regulation. Following proteosomal degradation of IκBα, an auto-regulatory loop consisting of transcriptional activation of IκBα gene and SUMO-1 modification of newly synthesized IκBα proceeds. The SUMOylated IκBα form is resistant to signal-induced degradation, consequently halting NFκB activation. We describe a mechanistic model by which adenosine (Ado) signaling results in significant accumulation of SUMO-1 modified IκBα with subsequent attenuation of NFκB activation. Using models of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (H/R), we have documented an H/R cycle-dependent increase in extracellular Ado correlating with increases in the cytoplasmic pool of IκBα/SUMO-1. We demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in IκBα/SUMO in cells treated with the general Ado receptor agonist NECA and abolished by Ado receptor antagonists. Experiments in cells exposed to cycles of H/R followed by hypoxia demonstrated differential patterns of SUMOylation and phosphorylation of IκBα, greatly impacting its proteosomal degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Assays targeting knockdown and overexpression of SUMO-1 demonstrated significant regulation of NFκB activation and NFκB-mediated gene transcription (interleukin-6). These results were confirmed in vivo using wild type and cd73 null mouse lung tissue. In summary, we present an endogenous mechanism by which cells and tissues acquire anti-inflammatory properties by recruiting a nondegradable form of IκBα, a major control point for NFκB activation via Ado signaling.

Ado signaling results in inhibition of NFκB activation by active deneddylation of Cullin-1, an integral component of the E3 SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex (SKP1, Cullin-1, and the F-box domain of β-TrCP). Under enhanced Ado signaling the deneddylated form of E3 ligase looses its activity and is unable to polyubiquitinate IκBα, preventing proteosomal degradation by the 26 S proteasome and nuclear translocation of NFκB. This effect proved of physiologic significance to different cell types and was specifically relevant to lung tissue (4Khoury J. Ibla J.C. Neish A.S. Colgan S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifiers of IκBα degradation have been described including the small ubiquitin-like protein (SUMO-1) (5Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S.

SUMO-1 directly modifies IκBα using three steps similar to ubiquitination using the E1 equivalent activating complex (SAE I and II) and E2 also known as Ubc9 (10Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although Ubc9 can directly conjugate SUMO-1 to IκBα without the use of E3, SUMO-1 E3-related proteins have been described to participate in the efficient SUMO-1 modification of IκBα (11Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Ubc9 utilizes the same ubiquitination site (Lys21/Lys22) of IκBα, transferring a single molecule of SUMO-1 preventing ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (12Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T.

SUMO modification of IκBα confers anti-inflammatory properties and provides a nondegradable isoform inhibiting the transcriptional activity of NFκB. The SUMO modification of targeted proteins is a dynamic process and also involves removal by specific SUMO isopeptidases returning the protein to its native state (14Mikolajczyk J. Drag M. Bekes M.

Cytoplasmic levels of SUMO-1 and unmodified IκBα control NFκB activity independent of phosphorylation or ubiquitination events. As such, we sought to investigate whether SUMO-1 modification of IκBα would also be under the influence of Ado signaling and potentially contributing to the potent anti-inflammatory phenotype observed with H/R. Murine Hypoxia and Reoxygenation (H/R) Model—As described previously (4Khoury J. Ibla J.C. Neish A.S. Colgan S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), C57BL/6 (Charles River Laboratories), and CD 73 null male mice 8–10 weeks old were used in this study. The Animal Care and Use Committee of Children's Hospital approved all procedures. Briefly, the mice were placed in humidified environmental chambers and subjected to FiO2 of 8% for 10 min followed by FiO2 21% for 10 min for three cycles. Hypoxic conditions were achieved by exposure to FiO2 5% for 10 min. For each experiment (n = 3 mice), the experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell Culture and in Vitro Hypoxia/Reoxygenation Model— HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were placed in a hypoxia chamber (Coy Laboratory Products Inc.) in pre-equilibrated hypoxic media at 1% O2 for 40 min, then removed from the hypoxia chamber, and allowed to be fully reoxygenated in normoxic conditions (21% O2) for 20 min. This protocol was followed for three cycles for a total time of 3 h. Hypoxia protocol was achieved by exposure of cells to 1% O2 for 3 h. Cell Transfection and NFκB Reporter Assays—Transfection of HeLa cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as directed by the manufacturer. The plasmids used in the transfections were full-length cDNA SUMO-1 plasmid, small hairpin RNA anti-SUMO-1, and control plasmids (Origene). To measure the activity of NFκB, on the second day of the transfection, the cells were transfected for the second time with pNFκB-Luc (pNRE; Clontech). The cell lysates were assayed using the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) with the use of a Luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Cell Treatment—Where indicated, the cells were treated with 8-phenyltheophylline in double distilled H2O at concentration of 100 nm; N-ethylcarbamido-adenosine (NECA) in Me2SO at a range from 100 nm to 100 μm and PSB1115 at concentration of 10 μm in double distilled H2O. All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise noted. Transcriptional Analysis of IL-6—Total RNA was extracted from cells using an isolation kit (RNAqueous, Ambion Inc). RNA from lung tissue was purified using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's specification (Invitrogen). PCRs for IL-6 expression were carried out using PCR Master Mix (Eurogentec) on a Thermocycler (ABI 7300). Human and mouse IL-6 primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems. All of the samples were controlled for β-actin using the following primers: sense, 5′-GGTGGCTTTTAGGATGGCAAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACTGGAACGGTGAAGGTGACAG-3′ (162 bp). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein was isolated from HeLa cells using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) or extracted from whole lung tissue from mice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), both containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). The protein concentrations were measured by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein was boiled in 2% SDS loading buffer (Bio-Rad), then resolved on 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the membranes were stained with Ponceau S stain to verify equal loading. Antibodies used for Western blotting included rabbit anti-SUMO-1 (1:1000), rabbit anti-I κBα (1:1000), and rabbit anti-phospho-IκBα (1:1000), all of which were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., and anti-actin antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The blots were washed, and species-matched peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added. Labeled bands from washed blots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermol Scientific). Immunoprecipitation—Total protein was isolated from HeLa cells and measured as described above. After preclearing with 60 μl of immobilized protein A/G (Thermol Scientific) for 2 h, rabbit anti-SUMO-1 antibody or rabbit anti-IκBα antibody and normal rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the protein gently shaken overnight. 60 μl of immobilized protein A/G were added into each tube, incubated for 2 h, and centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 4 min, and complex-bound gel was then collected and washed with cell lysis buffer three times. Finally, 100 μl of 2% SDS loading buffer was added into each tube, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, loaded to 12% gel, and subjected to the Western blot steps mentioned above. For p65 nuclear translocation studies, HeLa cells were plated on 4-well glass chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc International) and allowed to grow to ∼70% confluence. The cells were exposed to protocols of hypoxia and H/R as described earlier or coincubated with NECA (10 μm) for 24 h. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 10 min and permeabilized with prechilled 0.2% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-p65 (1:200; Rockland Immunochemicals) in 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h followed by anti-rabbit Oregon Green 488 (1:100, Molecular Probes; Invitrogen) in the same buffer for 30 min. The cell images were captured on a fluorescence microscope. Statistics—The values are expressed as the means ± S.D. Where appropriate, groups were compared by analysis of variance. Otherwise, comparisons between groups were conducted using two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Hypoxia/Reoxygenation Attenuates NFκB Activation in a Cycle-dependent Manner—We profiled the pattern of NFκB activity in cells exposed to H/R followed by hypoxia. We addressed whether H/R would attenuate NFκB activity in a cycle-dependent fashion consistent with cumulative concentrations of Ado. To this end, we transfected a NFκB luciferase reporter plasmid and exposed cells to increasing cycles of H/R followed by 24 h of hypoxia. These experiments revealed a significant cycle-dependent attenuation NFκB activity when compared with the individual response of one or three cycles of H/R followed by hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Further, to document that, in fact, NFκB attenuation was related to enhanced Ado receptor signaling, we studied NFκB activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of the NECA in hypoxic cells. For this, we exposed cells to 24 h of hypoxia coincubated with increasing concentrations of NECA. These experiments demonstrated a dose-dependent attenuation of NFκB activity with increasing concentrations of NECA, similar to the effect observed for H/R (Fig. 1B). Given the potential association between cycles of H/R, Ado concentrations, and NFκB activity, we pursued NFκB regulatory mechanisms potentially modulated by extracellular Ado accumulation. Adenosine Signaling Promotes Sumoylation of IκBα—We explored the possibility that known modulators of IκBα ubiquitination would also be regulated by Ado signaling. Activation of NFκB-mediated pathways occurs largely by proteosomal degradation of IκBα (15Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar) and potentially a regulatory site for innate anti-inflammatory responses mediated by Ado. The SUMO-1 modification of IκBα renders NFκB resistant to signal-induced degradation by blockade of its ubiquitination site Lys21/Lys22 and inhibition of NFκB dependent transcription (13Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). We addressed whether enhanced Ado receptor signaling resulting from H/R would directly increase the cytoplasmic pool of SUMO-1·IκBα complex, potentially influencing NFκB activation. We initially determined whether IκBα was SUMO-1 conjugated to a higher degree in H/R. To do this, we immunoprecipitated lysates from HeLa cells exposed to protocols of hypoxia and H/R using a SUMO-1 antibody and immunoblotted against IκBα. It has been established by Desterro et al. (13Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), specifically in HeLa cells coimmunoprecipitation of SUMO-1/IκBα results in a polypeptide of 55 kDa, which is consistent with the addition of a single molecule of SUMO-1 to IκBα. We confirmed the presence of a single 55-kDa band and observed a significantly increased association of SUMO-1 with IκBα in cells pre-exposed to H/R (Fig. 2A). This finding suggested that H/R promoted the SUMO-1 modification of IκBα, a mechanism potentially enhanced by Ado signaling. In addition, the degree of SUMO-1 modified IκBα was consistently decreased in hypoxia when compared with normoxic levels (Fig. 2A). This effect was attributed to the physiologic increases in IκBα degradation normally occurring during hypoxia, confirming the protective role of SUMO-1 modification of IκBα to ubiquitination and degradation by E3 SCF ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 2A). To further understand whether exogenous Ado stimulation would significantly increase the cytoplasmic SUMO-1·IκBα complex concentrations, we stimulated cells with NECA and probed the SUMOylated IκBα protein (55 kDa) levels by Western blotting. Stimulation with NECA produced a concentration-dependent increase in SUMO-1/IκBα levels with an EC50 of ∼100 nm (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the nonselective Ado receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline completely inhibited the basal and NECA induced SUMOylation of IκBα (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the specific Ado A2B receptor antagonist PSB 1115 nearly completely inhibited the basal SUMO-1/IκBα levels, yet partially inhibited the NECA-induced SUMOylation of IκBα, verifying that cooperative signaling is required among Ado receptor populations for most physiologic effects mediated by Ado (Fig. 2D). Hypoxia and Reoxygenation Prevents IκBα Ubiquitination via SUMO-1 Modification—To better define the functional attributes conferred differentially by H/R to IκBα degradation, we determined individual levels of SUMO-1/IκBα, IκBα, and the IκB kinase (Iκκβ) proteins by Western blotting. Here, cell lysates from sets of experiments comparing either incremental exposure to hypoxia or cycles of H/R were performed. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” one cell cycle of H/R consisted of 40 min of hypoxia (normobaric 1% O2), followed by 20 min of reoxygenation (21% O2) comparatively, hypoxia exposure was performed by increasing uninterrupted (60-min periods) exposure to 1% O2. This analysis revealed that a pool of SUMO-1/IκBα species exists in normoxic cells, because this isoform is part of the normal re-generative mechanism of IκBα, and also as negative feed back to limit NFκB activation (16Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies established a time-dependent degradation of SUMO-1/IκBα and IκBα species in wild type cells exposed to continuous hypoxia (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells exposed to sequential cycles of H/R demonstrated stable concentrations of SUMO-1/IκBα and of IκBα protein, corroborating the differential effect of H/R on IκBα degradation. Relative density ratios of IκBα and SUMO-1/IκBα demonstrate graphically the distinct effect of increasing cycles of H/R, clearly augmenting both isoforms in a cycle-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). We then explored the possibility that H/R could lead also to inhibition of Iκκβ by protein degradation and therefore result in the loss of phosphorylation as mechanism of inhibited degradation of SUMO-1/IκBα and IκBα during H/R. No significant differences in the protein levels of Iκκβ between continuous hypoxia and cycles of H/R were detected, suggesting that cells exposed to H/R conserved Iκκβ activity, providing a normal phosphorylation pattern. Unlike ubiquitination, SUMO-1 modification of IκBα does not require initial phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 (13Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 17Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar); however, SUMO-1 modification prevents phosphorylation of Ser32/Ser36 by a mechanism not fully understood (13Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 18Hay R.T. Vuillard L. Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is clear that SUMOylation of IκBα prevents proteosomal degradation by blockade of its ubiquitination (Lys21/Lys22) and its phosphorylation sites (Ser32/Ser36) (6Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 19Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To further examine whether enhanced SUMOylation of IκBα provided by Ado signaling would modify the phosphorylation pattern of IκBα Ser32/Ser36 sites as a mechanism of decreased degradation by hypoxia, we designed cell models of SUMO-1 overexpression. In wild type cells exposed to continuous hypoxia the native pools of SUMO-1/IκBα (55 kDa) and IκBα proteins demonstrated a time-dependent degradation over a period of 24 h with early phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 3C). Both SUMO-1/IκBα and IκBα protein levels show similar time-dependent degradation starting at 3 h of hypoxia with near complete degradation at 24 h, allowing NFκB activation. We then studied the degradation and phosphorylation characteristics of SUMO-1/IκBα and IκBα proteins in HeLa cells overexpressing the SUMO-1 full-length cDNA under continuous hypoxia. These experiments revealed a significant stabilization of SUMO-1/IκBα and IκBα proteins without appreciable evidence of degradation despite 24 h of hypoxia. In addition, the basal degree of phosphorylation of IκBα observed in cells overexpressing SUMO-1 was substantially lower than naive cells without significant change despite continuous hypoxia (Fig. 3D). Because proof of principle that H/R through Ado signaling and increased SUMOylation modulates IκBα degradation, we exposed wild type HeLa cells to protocols of H/R followed by 24 h of continuous hypoxia. Similarly as found in cells overexpressing SUMO-1, SUMO-1/IκBα, and IκBα species were distinctively stabilized without evidence of proteosomal degradation despite hypoxia. Interestingly and as noted in overexpressing cells, the pattern of IκBα phosphorylation was similar to the one observed by SUMO-1 overexpression (Fig. 3E). No significant phosphorylation was detected in cells pre-exposed to H/R, despite 24 h of hypoxia. These results support the concept that H/R significantly halts IκBα degradation by SUMO-1 modification, preventing its phosphorylation by Iκκβ, potentially modulating NFκB-mediated transcription. SUMO-1 Modification of IκBα Controls NFκB Activation— Guided by initial results suggesting that H/R trough Ado receptor signaling stabilized specifically the levels of SUMO-1/IκBα isoform, we extended the experiments to understand whether this effect will have functional repercussion on NFκB activation and mediated transcription. Initially SUMO-1 overexpression and SUMO-1 knockdown cell assays were designed to assess their transcriptional contribution to NFκB-mediated pathways (Fig. 4A). To this end we profiled the pattern of NFκB activation using the NFκB luciferase-reporter plasmid in SUMO-1 knockdown cells during hypoxia in the presence of NECA. As demonstrated in preliminary experiments using hypoxia, wild type cells demonstrate significant attenuation of NFκB activation in the presence of enhanced Ado signaling despite 24 h of hypoxia (Figs. 1B and 4B). In contrast SUMO-1 knockdown cells demonstrated a significantly increased NFκB activation (∼3-fold) during hypoxia when compared with wild type cells. NECA did in fact attenuate the degree of NFκB activation in hypoxic SUMO-1 knockdown cells; however, this level was 2.5-fold higher than native levels treated with NECA. Next, we compared the profile of NFκB activation in cells exposed to hypoxia and protocols of H/R of both SUMO-1 overexpressing and knockdown cells. In hypoxia, SUMO-1 knockdown cells demonstrated significantly increased NFκB activation (∼4-fold) when compared with native cells, confirming the regulatory effect of SUMO-1 to IκBα degradation. In contrast SUMO-1-overexpressing cells showed substantial attenuation of NFκB activation during hypoxia and close to normoxic levels. As documented in previous experiments, wild type cells exposed to protocols of H/R followed by 24 h of hypoxia demonstrated significant attenuation of NFκB activation (p < 0.05); however, this attenuation was less impressive in SUMO-1 knockdown cells, returning the NFκB activity to similar levels expressed by wild type hypoxic cells (Fig. 4C). SUMO-1-overexpressing cells pre-exposed to H/R followed by 24 h of hypoxia returned the NFκB activation levels to identical levels observed in wild type cells. These results demonstrate that transcriptional levels of SUMO-1 directly control NFκB activation by increasing specifically the intracellular pool of SUMO-1 modified IκBα, an isoform resistant to proteosomal degradation attenuating NFκB activity. To obtain additional evidence of the effect of adenosine on NFκB activation, we examined the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit NFκB in cells exposed to hypoxia, H/R, and NECA. This experiment demonstrates that in contrast to normoxia (Fig. 4D); 24 h of hypoxia induced a significant nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 4E). In cells pre-exposed to H/R, hypoxia did not significantly increased p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 4F). Further, cells coincubated with NECA demonstrated a predominant cytoplasmic localization of p65 similar to the one observed during H/R (Fig. 4G). SUMO-1 Modification of IκBα Controls NFκB-mediated Transcription—To further confirm that modulation of SUMO-1 cellular levels will significantly influence downstream NFκB-mediated pathways and to document a physiologically relevant role, we profiled IL-6 mRNA transcript levels by real time PCR. IL-6 is transcriptionally regulated at the promoter level by NFκB through a unique binding sequence (20Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Nat;. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 21Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is up-regulated by known pro-inflammatory stimuli using NFκB activation (tumor necrosis factor-α, lipopolysaccharide) (22Zhang Y.H. Lin J.X. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 23Crisostomo P.R. Wang Y. Markel T.A. Wang M. Lahm T. Meldrum D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: C675-C682Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We used wild type cell levels of IL-6 mRNA expression as a control during normal oxygen conditions. We then used our models of SUMO-1 knockdown and overexpression to determine whether SUMO-1 would directly control IL-6 expression. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, SUMO-1 knockdown cells demonstrated a vigorous expression of IL-6 transcripts (∼6-fold, p < 0.005) compared with the native response of wild type cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, SUMO-1-overexpressing cells demonstrated a significant reduction in IL-6 expression, to levels below the ones observed for wild type hypoxic cells. To verify that the effect of SUMO-1 on NFκB-mediated pathways was not limited to cultured cells, we extended these findings to models of hypoxia and H/R in vivo (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Here we used lung tissue from CD 73 null mice and C57BL6 adult mice. CD 73 null mice lack the ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD 73), a critical enzyme for extracellular Ado generation (2Synnestvedt K. Furuta G.T. Comerford K.M. Louis N. Karhausen J. Eltzschig H.K. Hansen K.R. Thompson L.F. Colgan S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have demonstrated the pulmonary-specific pro-inflammatory effects of CD 73 gene deletion (24Thompson L.F. Eltzschig H.K. Ibla J.C. Van De Wiele C.J. Resta R. Morote-Garcia J.C. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and selected the lung tissue as suitable model to also understand SUMO-1 regulation in vivo. Initially we profiled IL-6 mRNA transcripts from lung tissue from wild type and CD 73 null mice exposed to environmental conditions of hypoxia and cycles of H/R. Wild type animals demonstrated significantly increased IL-6 expression (p < 0.05) during hypoxia and attenuation (p < 0.05) when exposed to cycles of H/R, consistent with results in vitro documenting similar patterns of NFκB activity (Fig. 5B). We then compared IL-6 mRNA levels in CD73 null mice exposed to hypoxia and H/R. These results demonstrated that in CD 73 (-/-) lung tissue, the level of expression of IL-6 was significantly (∼11-fold, p < 0.01) increased at base-line normoxia with a substantial (∼12-fold, p < 0.01) increased expression exerted by hypoxic conditions. No significant attenuation of IL-6 expression was observed by exposure to H/R (p = 0.2). Further, to demonstrate that Ado signaling is required in vivo to maintain regulatory levels of SUMO-1, we compared protein levels of SUMO-1/IκBα of wild type lung tissue lysates. These experiments demonstrated that le"
https://openalex.org/W1995505969,"Controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic remains a major challenge, with approximately 5 million new HIV infections annually. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CyPG), such as 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), are arachidonic acid-derived endogenous electrophiles that possess anti-HIV activity by an unknown mechanism. Given that the reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone in the cyclopentenone ring of 15d-PGJ(2) covalently modifies key Cys thiols in select proteins, we hypothesized that 15d-PGJ(2) inhibits HIV transcription and replication by targeting Cys thiols in HIV-1 Tat. Tat is a potent transactivator of viral gene expression required for HIV transcriptional elongation and replication. Our studies indicate that 15d-PGJ(2) treatment of cells inhibits Tat-dependent transcription and replication of HIV-1, while 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ(2), PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), or PGD(2) that lack the reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone were ineffective. The inhibition of Tat activity by 15d-PGJ(2) was dose-dependent, with an IC(50) of 1.2 microM and independent of NF-kappaB pathway. Furthermore, using a biotinylated derivative of 15d-PGJ(2), we demonstrate that 15d-PGJ(2) modifies free Cys-thiols in Tat to form covalent Michael adducts and that the interaction was further increased on reduction of Tat. 15d-PGJ(2)-modified Tat was unable to transactivate the HIV long terminal repeat in U937 human macrophages. These data demonstrate that Tat acts as a molecular target of CyPG leading to the inhibition of transcription and also suggest a novel therapeutic approach to complement current antiretroviral strategies for HIV/AIDS."

To date, based on the catalytic mechanism as well as functional and structural information, 15 different groups of PLA2 have been reported and named (1Schaloske R.H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys.

This lipolytic enzyme releases glycerophospholipids and arachidonic acid that serve as the precursors of signal molecules that mediate a multitude of biological functions, such as inflammation.

The C-terminal pentapeptide of PROP (GISPR) is essential for the inhibition of enzyme activity (12Gudgeon A.M. Patel G. Hermon-Taylor J. Hurley P. Bowyer R.C. Jehanli A.M. Ann. Clin.

PROP may also play an important role in the folding process as suggested by the refolding experiments of pro-hG1B and hG1B (14Cheng H.Q. Xu G.J. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (Shanghai). 2004; 36: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Helix 1 at the N-terminal of hG1B is known to play an important role in enzyme function. An engineered hG1B lacking the N-terminal helix 1 bound to membranes with weaker affinity and exhibited ∼100-fold lower enzymatic activity compared with that of the full-length hG1B. It is inferred that this helix 1 facilitates the membrane binding, thus enhances the enzymatic activity based on polarized infrared spectroscopic experiments (15Qin S. Pande A.H. Nemec K.N. Tatulian S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments using semi-synthetic hG1B demonstrated that helix 1 residues act as a regulatory domain and mediate interfacial activation (16Qin S. Pande A.H. Nemec K.N. He X. Tatulian S.A. J. Biol.

It has been generally believed that PLA2 possesses an interfacial binding surface (i-face), which orientates PLA2 for binding to membrane so that PLA2 subsequently hydrolyzes the sn-2 acyl bond of glycerophospholipids (17Dijkstra B.W. Drenth J. Kalk K.H. Nature. 1981; 289: 604-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A model for this i-face was postulated based on the crystal structure of dimeric porcine G1B (18Epstein T.M. Yu B.Z. Pan Y.H. Tutton S.P. Maliwal B.P. Jain M.K. Bahnson B.J.

The crystal structure of pro-hG1B presented here will illustrate the structural difference of G1B between the human and other species. It will provide structural insight into the activation mechanism of pro-hG1B and potentially facilitate the structure-based design of inhibitor for the treatment of a number of diseases including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. The pro-hG1B gene (GenBankTMID NM_000928) was cloned into the Pichia pastorias expression vector pPIC9k (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid pPIC9K-pro-hGIB was linearized with SacI. CompetentP. pastorisGS115 cells were prepared according to the multicopy Pichia expression manual (Invitrogen) and transformed with 1–2 μg of linearized plasmids by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 1500 V using a 0.1-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). Transformants of GS115/pro-hG1B were selected on four YPD plates containing 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/ml of G418, respectively. After incubation for 2 days at 30 °C, colonies resistant to G418 were further selected by PCR and directly transferred to BMGY medium, then switched to BMMY medium for pro-hG1B expression. The colony with the highest expression was selected based on time course experiments by SDS-PAGE. To scale up, the selected strain of pro-hG1B was expressed in a 2.0-liter shake flask. Seed cultures were generated by inoculating 10 ml of YPD with 100 μl of cells from a glycerol stock. After 24 h, 1 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 400 ml of BMGY and allowed to grow for 2 days. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then cells were resuspended in 400 ml of BMMY to begin induction for 3 days with shaking at 30 °C. 1% (v/v) fresh methanol was replenished following each day of induction. After 72 h of induction, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were discarded, and the crude media were frozen immediately at −80 °C. All cultures were incubated at 30 °C and shaken at 200 rpm. The culture supernatant contained the pro-hG1B was thawed from −80 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g to pellet any precipitant. The supernatant was then buffer-exchanged to 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.5 at 4 °C. Purification was achieved by Q-Sepharose XL (GE Healthcare) and then by Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare). Initial crystallization screening was done by vapor diffusion method using sparse-matrix crystallization screening kits from Hampton Research. The protein sample, concentrated to 45 mg·ml−1in 20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 8.5, was mixed with equal volumes of precipitant in 2-μl sitting drops on a 96-well Microplate (Grenier) at 25 °C. Crystals were grown in a mix of 1-μl protein solution, 1 μl of 0.1mTris, 0.2mlithium sulfate, 33% PEG 4000, pH 8.4 in 14 days. The data for the best crystal were collected at 110 K using the Oxford Diffraction Gemini R Ultra system. The space group of the crystal was determined to beP63, with unit cell parametersa = b = 56.55 Å,c = 60.63 Å. All data were processed by CrysAlisPro (24Oxford DiffractionCrysAlis, Version 1.171.32.24. Oxford Diffraction Ltd., Yarnton, UK2008Google Scholar), then scaled by SCALA (25Kabsch W. J. Appl.

D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). 5% of data were randomly selected for theR-free calculation. The initial structure solution was obtained by molecular replacement using the porcine pancreatic PLA2 (PDB code: 1HN4) as the search model with program Molrep (27Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

The structure was finalized with a round of TLS refinement based on the analysis carried out via TLS motion determination server (32Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr.

Crystallographic results are shown in Table 1. The final model was refined to anR-work of 14.53%, and anR-free value of 18.29%. Analysis with the program Molprobity (34Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A.

Open table in a new tab DLS experiments were carried out on a DynaPro Titan instrument (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Purified pro-hG1B was first concentrated to 30 mg/ml, and then diluted to 15 mg/ml, 7.5 mg/ml, and 3.7 mg/ml sequentially. All samples were prepared in duplicate. The solution buffer was 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, with or without 200 mmlithium sulfate added. The assays were performed at 4 °C. The hG1B sample was obtained by thrombin cleavage of the pro-hG1B and then purified on a Superdex 75 column. The same protein concentrations were prepared, and DLS assays were performed according to the procedure used for pro-hG1B. The hydrodynamic radius was measured, and the molecular weight was calculated by DYNAMICS V6 Version 6.7.7.9. The data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5. After purification by Superdex 75 column, pro-hG1B was buffer-exchanged to 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, by Amicon Ultra 5k (Millipore). The sample was divided into four aliquots. Each aliquot contained 100 μg of pro-hG1B in 10 μl of buffer. One aliquot was stored at 4 °C. The other three aliquots were incubated at 37 °C. Among these three samples, two were treated with protease, 2 μg of trypsin (Sigma), and thrombin (GE healthcare), respectively. After an overnight reaction, the four samples were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 LC/MS system (single quadrupole mass spectrometer, ESI ion source). 100 μg of purified pro-hG1B was divided into two aliquots in 100 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl with or without 2 μg of thrombin. 20 μl of the samples were taken in a time course of 0, 2, 4, and 12 h at 37 °C incubation. Samples from different time points were divided equally, and each was mixed with 2.5 μl of 5× loading buffer (60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 715 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) with or without boiling. All the samples were stored on ice immediately after treatment and subject to SDS-PAGE analysis. To test thermostability of pro-hG1B, purified pro-hG1B was dissolved in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl and incubated at 37 °C overnight, and then the samples were divided into eight aliquots. After 2.5 μl of 5× loading buffer was added to each of the 10-μl samples, the samples were then incubated at 25, 50, 64, 74, 80, 84, and 90 °C for 15 min, respectively, and then analyzed on SDS-PAGE. All the SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out on a Mini PROTEAN 3 Cell system (Bio-Rad) with 15% separating gel and 5% stacking gel. The structure of pro-hG1B shown inFig. 1 includes one monomer of pro-hG1B and one sulfate ion. Very similar to other reported structures of the PLA2 family, including bovine pancreatic PLA2 (21Steiner R.A. Rozeboom H.J. de Vries A. Kalk K.H. Murshudov G.N. Wilson K.S. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and porcine pancreatic PLA2 (23Thunnissen M.M. Franken P.A. de Haas G.H. Drenth J. Kalk K.H. Verheij H.M. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the structure of pro-hG1B consists of a typical set of four major helices (Helix 1 (α1), from residue 3 to 12; Helix 2 (α2), from residue 40 to 57; Helix 3 (α3), from residue 59 to 61; Helix 4 (α4), from residue 90 to 108) and two β-strands (β-strand 1 (β1), from residue 76 to 78; β-strand 2 (β2), from residue 81 to 83). Two short helices were found in the C terminus (Helix 5 (α5), from residue 113 to 115, and one 310 helix, Helix 6 (α6), from residue 120 to 123). One unique feature of this pro-hG1B structure is the position of PROP. The PROP (from Asp6 to Arg0) occupies the active site that was used for inhibitor binding in porcine pancreatic PLA2 (18Epstein T.M. Yu B.Z. Pan Y.H. Tutton S.P. Maliwal B.P. Jain M.K. Bahnson B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11411-11422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In porcine pancreatic PLA2 structure, there are six amino acid (aa) residues (Phe22, Gly30, His48, Asp49, Tyr52, and Phe106) interacting with the inhibitor MJ33, and these residues form the active site cavity. However, in the pro-hG1B structure, these aa residues (Tyr22, Gly30, His48, Asp49, Tyr52, and Phe106) are all buried due to the folding back of PROP. An active site water molecule that was conserved in other G1B structure is not observed in pro-hG1B structure as the position is displaced by the Nδof Arg0. Residue Arg0 also interacts with residue Tyr22, Gly30, His48, and Asp49 through a hydrogen-bonding network as shown inFig. 2. There is one pro-hG1B molecule in the asymmetric unit. Through the symmetry operation, however, it is clearly shown that pro-hG1B forms a trimer (Fig. 3). On one side of the trimer (which will be referred to as the front side), there are three chains of PROP that protrude out of the plane (Fig. 3A). Whereas on the back side of the trimer, which includes the proposed membrane-binding N-terminal helix 1 (helix α1) (15Qin S. Pande A.H. Nemec K.N. Tatulian S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,16Qin S. Pande A.H. Nemec K.N. He X. Tatulian S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36773-36783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), there is a largely positive charge surface with a center opening that is currently occupied by a sulfate ion (Fig. 3B). The interactions involved in the trimer formation consist of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 3E). Key residues forming the hydrogen bonds include Ser-5, Asp17, Lys113, Ala114, Lys116 of one chain and Ser-5, Trp3, Lys7, Asn67, Thr70, Lys89, and Glu92 of the other chain. Residues involved in the hydrophobic contacts include Asp-6, Ala1, Asp17, Phe19, Leu20, Asn24, Lys113, Asn117, and Lys121 of one chain and Asp-6, Trp3, Lys62, Tyr69, Thr70, His71, and Glu92 of the other chain. These residues clearly suggest that the N terminus, C terminus, and the 62–75 loop (also called “69-loop”) are contributing to the trimer formation. The DLS measurement further confirmed the trimer formation in solution. Pro-hG1B at concentrations above 7.5 mg/ml assumed a tri meric form (average molecular mass of 42 kDa); whereas it assumed a monomeric form at the lower protein concentration (3.7 mg/ml). Interestingly, trimerization exists only when sulfate ion is present (Fig. 3C). PROP of pro-hG1B can be cleaved by trypsin and thrombin leading to pro-hG1B activation (13Grataroli R. Dijkman R. Dutilh C.E. van der Ouderaa F. De Haas G.H. Figarella C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,37de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In our experiment, after treatment with trypsin or thrombin, PROP with a molecular mass of 731 Da was detected by mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, when pro-hG1B was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, a peak at 731 Da was also detected by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4A). This autocleavage, however, was not observed when the sample was incubated at 4 °C. To confirm the autocleavage of pro-hG1B, pro-hG1B was analyzed by SDS-PAGE after different treatments. As shown inFig. 4B, in the SDS-PAGE gel, the sample migrated to two bands (hereby referred to “upper” and “lower” band) without pre-boiling, and only one band (the lower band) with pre-boiling. In addition, the amount of upper band increased along with the time of 37 °C treatment and thrombin treatment, while the amount of lower band decreased. These results indicated that the upper band was hG1B, and the lower band was pro-hG1B. Furthermore, the lower band and the upper band samples were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The upper band was confirmed to be hG1B, and the lower band without pre-boiling was pro-hG1B. The single band at the lower position with pre-boiling treatment was identified to be the mixture of pro-hG1B and hG1B. Thermostability of pro-hG1B was tested on an SDS-PAGE gel, and results were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Pro-hG1B was autocleaved to form hG1B through incubation at 37 °C overnight.Lane 1 of Fig. 4C showed that the lower band corresponded to uncleaved pro-hG1B, and the upper band corresponded to cleaved hG1B. This sample was then incubated in various temperatures, 50, 64, 70, 74, 80, 84, and 90 °C for 15 min, respectively. Two bands are shown in the SDS-PAGE gel for the lower temperature treatment, from 50 to 74 °C (Fig. 4C). N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the upper band is hG1B, and the lower band is the mixture of hG1B and pro-hG1B. When the incubation temperature is above 74 °C, the upper band disappeared completely. Trimeric form of PLA2 has been reported only for cobra PLA2 (38Fremont D.H. Anderson D.H. Wilson I.A. Dennis E.A. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Naja naja PLA2 (39Segelke B.W. Nguyen D. Chee R. Xuong N.H. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The current study reveals the first tri meric association for pancreatic PLA2. When compared with the cobra PLA2 and Naja naja naja PLA2, the tri meric structure of pro-hG1B shows a significantly different subunit association and a much higher percentage of buried surfaces. Analyzed by the PISA Server (40Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar), 22% of the solvent accessible area (4760 Å2) is buried in the trimer of pro-hG1B. The buried surface area of pro-hG1B is significantly higher than those for the cobra PLA2 trimer and the Naja naja naja PLA2 trimer (15 and 16%, respectively). To date, most reported pancreatic PLA2 structures adopt a dimeric association. In its apo form, the dimer of porcine pancreatic PLA2 (PDB code 1HN4), which contains the PROP peptide, has only 9% buried surface area. When the inhibitor MJ33 is bound to the dimer, the buried surface area increases to 23%, and the protein becomes a much tighter dimer. In comparison, when PROP is removed, the buried surface area in the hypothetical tri meric hG1B can still reach 18.3% when calculated. We deduce that this PROP attributes to the trimer formation similar to the contribution of MJ33 to the dimerization of porcine pancreatic PLA2. Sequence alignment shows differences between the PROP sequences in the human and other species (Fig. 5A). Two residues in PROP of pro-hG1B (Asp-6 and Ser-5) are involved in the hydrogen-bonding network and hydrophobic contract in the trimer interface (Fig. 3E). These two key residues are unique for the human enzyme (Fig. 5A). Based on this, it is postulated that the tri meric formation of pro-G1B only exists in the human form of enzyme. To date, there is no report of trimer formation for any other pancreatic PLA2, including porcine pro-G1B and bovine pro-G1B. Additionally, DLS experiments show that trimerization of pro-hG1B depends on the protein concentration. And hG1B required a higher protein concentration for trimerization (30 mg/ml compared with 7.5 mg/ml for pro-hG1B) (Fig. 3,C and D). This finding corroborates with the hypothesis that PROP enhances the trimer formation. Sulfate ion, an anionic ion that may mimic the membrane-charged surface, is crucial for trimer formation in our DLS experiments. It is in agreement with previous reports and a review by Bahnson (41Bahnson B.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that the sulfate is critical for bridging the adjacent subunits along the i-face. The protein concentration of 30 mg/ml is highly non-physiological for hG1B; therefore, trimer formation of hG1B alone is unlikely to be stable. However, PROP occupies the active site in pro-hG1B structure and presumably mimics an inhibitor or substrate. As a result, pro-hG1B presents as a model for hG1B binding with a substrate molecule. When hG1B becomes activated in the reaction system, the substrate binding will stabilize the trimerization. The local concentration of hG1B on the membrane-binding surface will only need to be as low as 7.5 mg/ml (or even lower). In the pro-hG1B structure, PROP fills the active site cavity in a manner similar to inhibitor binding to other G1B structures. It is known that PROP can be cleaved by trypsin or thrombin for the enzyme to become fully active. As shown earlier, when the sample was heated to 37 °C, PROP can be cleaved. This suggests a potential autoproteolytic mechanism in the activation of pro-hG1B. In the typical serine protease, there is an Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad involved in catalysis. In the structure of pro-hG1B, there is a strikingly similar set of residues that may be involved in the cleavage of the Arg0-Ala1 peptide bond. As shown inFig. 6, comparison between Asp102-His57-Ser95 of serine protease (PDB code 1K1I) and Asp49-Arg0-Ser(-2) of pro-hG1B in the current structure shows that the R.M.S.D. over all atoms between these two sets is only 1 Å. On the basis of the spatial arrangement of these three side chains, we propose a mechanism for the self-activation of pro-hG1B. In pro-hG1B, the salt bridge between Asp49 and Arg0 may orient the NH2 of Arg0 such that the guanidinium group of Arg0 can obtain a proton from the hydroxyl group of Ser-2. Thus, the deprotonated OG of Ser-2 may attack the carbonyl carbon of Arg0, leading to the formation of oxyanion hole. The unstable peptide oxygen may promote the breakage of the peptide bond and the dissociation of the amine product. As discussed above, temperature is likely a key factor for the self-activation mechanism. Two SDS-PAGE gel results (Fig. 4,B and C) showed that hG1B can migrate to two different positions under various temperature treatments. However, pro-hG1B showed only one band. The molecular mass difference between the cleaved and un-cleaved protein is 731 Da, which is significantly smaller than the apparent molecular size difference observed on SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, pro-hG1B migrates faster than hG1B under the same conditions on SDS-PAGE. These results suggest that pro-hG1B and hG1B adopt two different conformations that correspond to the two bands on the gel. We predict that the upper band corresponds to the conformation the active hG1B adopts while the lower band corresponds to the conformation pro-hG1B adopts. When hG1B was heated, its conformation would become similar to pro-hG1B so it migrated to the same lower band as pro-hG1B. It has been indicated that upon activation and membrane binding, helix 1 of hG1B will undergo a conformational change (16Qin S. Pande A.H. Nemec K.N. He X. Tatulian S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36773-36783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our experimental results confirmed the conformational change between pro-hG1B and hG1B. The conformational change is expected to be large enough to affect the migration rate on SDS-PAGE for a protein of this small size. Aside from helix 1 that may affect the conformation of hG1B, 69-loop, which is in proximity to helix 1, may also contribute to the conformation of hG1B. Solution NMR study suggested that 69-loop is flexible and play an important role in the substrate recognition (42Peters A.R. Dekker N. van den Berg L. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10024-10030Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has also been previously observed by Tomooet al.(43Tomoo K. Yamane A. Ishida T. Fujii S. Ikeda K. Iwama S. Katsumura S. Sumiya S. Miyagawa H. Kitamura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that the 69-loop is disordered in pro-pG1B. In the current crystal structure, excellent electron density is observed for residues of the 69-loop as shown in the 2Fo-Fc map and simulated-annealing OMIT map (supplemental Fig. S2). The 69-loop of pro-hG1B showed a significantly different conformation from that of other PLA2 structures. There is a noticeable positional movement in the 69-loop, whereas the sequence of this loop shows a high degree of similarity across different species (Fig. 5,A and B). In our pro-hG1B structure, the 69-loop packs against PROP. Residues in the 69-loop (Lys62, Asn67, Tyr69, Thr70, His71) are involved in key hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the trimer interface, indicating that the 69-loop contributes to trimer formation. Apart from mediating the PROP interaction and trimer formation, this loop clearly affects the conformation of hG1B. Tyr69, the key residue in the 69-loop reported to be important for enzyme binding to the membrane (42Peters A.R. Dekker N. van den Berg L. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10024-10030Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,44Egmond M.R. Hore P.J. Kaptein R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 744: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), adopted a significantly different side chain conformation from those in other PLA2 structures as shown inFig. 5B. The anion-assisted dimerization interface of the porcine PLA2 dimer was proposed to be an analog to the interfacial-bound surface of G1B (45Pan Y.H. Epstein T.M. Jain M.K. Bahnson B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,46Winget J.M. Pan Y.H. Bahnson B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1260-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our current study demonstrates that pro-hG1B is able to trimerize, and the anionic sulfate ion is required for the trimer formation. Our model also suggests that hG1B is capable of trimerization when an additional substrate molecule is present. The trimerization of pro-hG1B and hG1B may provide a new model for membrane attachment. We hereby propose a new interface for the membrane association that is crucial for the fatty acid hydrolysis. The monomeric form of pro-hG1B or hG1B exists before its binding to membrane. When membrane is available in the reaction system, pro-hG1B or hG1B will bind to the membrane in the tri meric form using the back side of the trimer, the positively charged surface. The temporal order of trimer formation and membrane attachment will require further investigation. When the tri meric form of enzyme is anchored to the membrane surface, for pro-hG1B, PROP will need to be cleaved either by trypsin or itself. The resultant hG1B will undergo conformational changes that further open up the center hole of the trimer to form a channel for the entry of substrate. The previous study indicated that hG1B activity is significantly increased compared with that of pro-hG1B when membrane is available in the reaction system (13Grataroli R. Dijkman R. Dutilh C.E. van der Ouderaa F. De Haas G.H. Figarella C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our current model provides a reasonable explanation for this difference. Based on this model, PROP physically occupies the active site and also hinders the conformational change that is required for the opening of the substrate entry channel. When PROP is cleaved and removed as a leaving group, the efficiency of substrate entry and product release will be greatly increased. Most PLA2 family proteins have very conserved catalytic sites and the design of the inhibitor solely based on this conserved site will need to address the specificity issue. Therefore, blocking the substrate entry will confer improved specificity for potential inhibitor design. This tri meric form, the membrane-bound model, provides new insights into the activation mechanism of hG1B and a rational basis for the design of hG1B inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W1984563534,"Background Although vaccination can be a useful tool for control of avian influenza epidemics, it might engender emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain. Field and experimental studies show that some avian influenza strains acquire resistance ability against vaccination. We investigated, in the context of the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain, whether a vaccination program can prevent the spread of infectious disease. We also investigated how losses from immunization by vaccination imposed by the resistant strain affect the spread of the disease. Methods and Findings We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartment model illustrating transmission of vaccine-sensitive and vaccine-resistant strains during a vaccination program. We investigated how the loss of protection effectiveness impacts the program. Results show that a vaccination to prevent the spread of disease can instead spread the disease when the resistant strain is less virulent than the sensitive strain. If the loss is high, the program does not prevent the spread of the resistant strain despite a large prevalence rate of the program. The epidemic's final size can be larger than that before the vaccination program. We propose how to use poor vaccines, which have a large loss, to maximize program effects and describe various program risks, which can be estimated using available epidemiological data. Conclusions We presented clear and simple concepts to elucidate vaccination program guidelines to avoid negative program effects. Using our theory, monitoring the virulence of the resistant strain and investigating the loss caused by the resistant strain better development of vaccination strategies is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2090025350,"The varitint-waddler mutation A419P renders TRPML3 constitutively active, resulting in cationic overload, particularly in sustained influx of Ca(2+). TRPML3 is expressed by inner ear sensory hair cells, and we were intrigued by the fact that hair cells are able to cope with expressing the TRPML3(A419P) isoform for weeks before they ultimately die. We hypothesized that the survival of varitint-waddler hair cells is linked to their ability to deal with Ca(2+) loads due to the abundance of plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Here, we show that PMCA2 significantly reduced [Ca(2+)](i) increase and apoptosis in HEK293 cells expressing TRPML3(A419P). The deaf-waddler isoform of PMCA2, operating at 30% efficacy, showed a significantly decreased ability to rescue the Ca(2+) loading of cells expressing TRPML3(A419P). When we combined mice heterozygous for the varitint-waddler mutant allele with mice heterozygous for the deaf-waddler mutant allele, we found severe hair bundle defects as well as increased hair cell loss compared with mice heterozygous for each mutant allele alone. Furthermore, 3-week-old double mutant mice lacked auditory brainstem responses, which were present in their respective littermates containing single mutant alleles. Likewise, heterozygous double mutant mice exhibited severe circling behavior, which was not observed in mice heterozygous for TRPML3(A419P) or PMCA2(G283S) alone. Our results provide a molecular rationale for the delayed hair cell loss in varitint-waddler mice. They also show that hair cells are able to survive for weeks with sustained Ca(2+) loading, which implies that Ca(2+) loading is an unlikely primary cause of hair cell death in ototoxic stress situations."
https://openalex.org/W2056264714,"In prion diseases, PrP(c), a widely expressed protein, is transformed into a pathogenic form called PrP(Sc), which is in itself infectious. Antibodies directed against PrP(c) have been shown to inhibit PrP(c) to PrP(Sc) conversion in vitro and protect in vivo from disease. Other effectors with potential to eliminate PrPSc-producing cells are cytotoxic T cells directed against PrP-derived peptides but their ability to protect or to induce deleterious autoimmune reactions is not known. The natural tolerance to PrP(c) makes difficult to raise efficient adaptive responses. To break tolerance, adenovirus (Ad) encoding human PrP (hPrP) or control Ad were administered to wild-type mice by direct injection or by transfer of Ad-transduced dendritic cells (DCs). Control Ad-transduced DCs from Tg650 mice overexpressing hPrP were also used for immunization. DC-mediated but not direct administration of AdhPrP elicited antibodies that bound to murine native PrP(c). Frequencies of PrP-specific IFNgamma-secreting T cells were low and in vivo lytic activity only targeted cells strongly expressing hPrP. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CD3(+) T cell infiltration was similar in the brain of vaccinated and unvaccinated 139A-infected mice suggesting the absence of autoimmune reactions. Early splenic PrP(Sc) replication was strongly inhibited ten weeks post infection and mean survival time prolonged from 209 days in untreated 139A-infected mice to 246 days in mice vaccinated with DCs expressing the hPrP. The efficacy appeared to be associated with antibody but not with cytotoxic cell-mediated PrP-specific responses."

EGFR endocytosis is a critical step in signal attenuation, raising the question of how receptor expression levels affect the internalization process.

Furthermore, activated EGFR recruits various adaptor proteins that mediate receptor internalization by endocytosis (2Wiley H.S. Exp.

In light of the role of endocytosis in EGFR signal attenuation and the oncogenicity of EGFR overexpression, it is important to elucidate the relationship between high receptor expression levels relative to internalization pathway capacity and their effect on internalization dynamics.

Moreover, the possible limited capacity of internalization adaptors may restrict EGFR internalization in cells expressing abnormally high numbers of EGFR (18Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this work we investigated the potential of EGFR internalization to occur as a nonlinear process by combining mathematical modeling with novel quantitative, live cell measurements of EGF internalization. We extended the previous derivation of the ratio of internalized versus surface-located ligand·receptor complexes r(t) (16Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol.

We predicted that r(t) is not a straight line as derived previously but is a convex or concave curve depending on whether receptors or internalization components are limiting the reaction, respectively. In earlier studies, quantitative measurements of parameters of EGFR endocytosis have been performed using classical biochemical techniques to detect cellular ligand uptake using radioactively labeled EGF (16Wiley H.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Importantly, both methods do not reach single cell precision and instead yield an integrated signal over a population of cells. To test our mathematical predictions we combined the following: (i) quantitative laser scanning confocal microscopy, and (ii) multiple parametric flow cytometry, using a custom Beckman Coulter FC500 equipped with a 488 and 561 nm laser excitation, to quantitatively measure the temporal and spatial dynamics of EGFR endocytosis using tetramethylrhodamine-tagged EGF (Rh-EGF) and GFP-EGFR. We show that both quantitative imaging and flow cytometry measurements were highly sensitive, allowing for live cell investigations and confirmation of the mathematical predictions. HeLa cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HaCat cells were stably transfected with GFP-EGFR and were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum plus 0.5 mg/ml G418. Prior to EGF treatment, cells were kept in serum-free (starvation) medium for 12 h. Tetramethylrhodamine-EGF (Rh-EGF) was purchased from Invitrogen. To measure surface binding using flow cytometry, cells were stimulated with Rh-EGF on ice for 1 h, then washed with PBS, followed by trypsinization and resuspension in full medium. For internalization studies, ligand was added directly to the starvation medium at the indicated concentration, followed by washing with acid-stripping buffer (50 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.0), trypsinization, and resuspension in full medium. Samples were measured on a modified flow cytometer, FC500/MPL (Beckman Coulter). The standard argon-ion laser (488 nm/20 milliwatts; Cyonics) was removed, and a Sapphire 488-nm/20-milliwatt laser and a Compass 561-nm/40-milliwatt laser (both Coherent Inc.) were installed on the mounting platform. Lasers were aligned co-linearly. Fixed or living cells were imaged on a confocal laser scanning microscope TCS SP5 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using a 63× oil immersion objective. A helium/neon (λ543 nm) laser was used for excitation of Rhodamine. Living cells were imaged in imaging medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenyl red). For fixation, cells were washed in PBS once, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice, and then returned to PBS for imaging. To quantify rhodamine-EGF signal (Fig. 2B), the sum of pixel values was calculated from the raw images. For this, an ImageJ plugin was written that is available upon request. For normalization and comparability with flow cytometry data, the average pixel value obtained at each time point was divided by the maximal signal obtained at 30 min of stimulation. We consider the internalization of ligand-bound surface-located receptors REs, giving rise to internalized receptors Ri. Reaction 1 is described by Equation 1 REs⟶keRiREACTION 1 d(REs)dt=−ke⋅REs(Eq. 1) from which we directly obtain Equation 2, REs(t)=REs0⋅e−ke⋅t(Eq. 2) For full interpretation of the equations see under “Results.” To derive the ratio of surface-bound versus internalized ligand·receptor complexes r(t) = (Ri(t))/(REs(t)), we observe that due to mass conservation the total receptor number REs(t) + Ri(t) remains constant. Thus, with X0 denoting the initial value of variable X, we have Equation 3, REs(t)+Ri(t)= constant =REs0+Ri0=REs0(Eq. 3) because Ri0, the initial number of internalized ligand·receptor complexes, is zero From this last equation we thus have Equation 4, Ri(t)=REs0−REs(t)=REs0−REs0⋅e−ke⋅t(Eq. 4) Taken together, this gives Equation 5, r(t)=Ri(t)REs(t)=REs0(1−e−ke)REs0e−ke=eke−1(Eq. 5) We extend Reaction 1 by including the presence of internalization components IC to which activated surface receptors REs have to bind to give rise to internalized ligand·receptor complexes Ri (see Fig. 1). We thus consider Reaction 2, REs+IC⟶keRiREACTION 2 whose dynamics are given by Equation 6, d(REs)dt=d(IC)dt=−d(Ri)dt=−ke⋅REs⋅IC(Eq. 6) Again, because of mass conservation of receptors as well as internalization adaptors, we obtain Equations 7 and 8, Ri(t)=REs0−REs(t)(Eq. 7) and IC(t)=REs(t)−REs0+IC0(Eq. 8) Inserting the last equation into the differential equation yields Equation 9, d(REs)dt=−ke⋅REs(t)(REs(t)−REs0+ICs0)(Eq. 9) With ()′ denoting the first derivative, we thus have Equation 10, r(t)′=(RiREs(t))′=(REs0−REs(t)REs(t))′=−REs(t)′⋅REs(t)−REs′(t)⋅(REs0−REs(t))REs(t)2=−REs0REs(t)′REs(t)2=−REs0−ke⋅REs(t)(REs(t)−REs0+IC0)REs(t)2=REs0⋅keREs(t)−REs0+IC0REs(t)(Eq. 10) and further Equation 11, r(t)′′=(REs0⋅keREs(t)−REs0+IC0REs(t))′=REs0⋅ke⋅REs(t)′⋅REs(t)−REs(t)′(REs(t)−REs0+IC0)REs(t)2=REs0⋅ke⋅REs(t)′REs(t)2⋅(REs0−IC0)(Eq. 11) See under “Results” interpretation. Simulations (Fig. 4) were performed using MATLAB, and script files are available upon request. The following experiments were performed in the cervical cancer HeLa cell line, a cell culture model expressing abundant EGFR and that is well established for studying the various modes of endocytosis and their role in EGFR signaling (29Amit I. Citri A. Shay T. Lu Y. Katz M. Zhang F. Tarcic G. Siwak D. Lahad J. Jacob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Vaisman N. Segal E. Rechavi G. Alon U. Mills G.B. Domany E. Yarden Y. Nat.

Cell. 2004; 116: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Initial experiments were aimed at comparing the dynamics of EGF interaction with EGFR detected by high content (high resolution laser scanning confocal microscopy) and high sample size (flow cytometry) approaches. We first observed Rh-EGF internalization by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). HeLa cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml Rh-EGF at 37 °C for various times and subjected to live cell imaging. Fig. 2A shows the spatial and temporal response of Rh-EGF binding and internalization. At 2 min, the majority of Rh-EGF was located at the cell surface, with few small vesicles apparent within the cell. As incubation time increased, the amount of surface-located Rh-EGF decreased, and instead an increased number of vesicles, larger in size, were located within the cell, with localization shifting toward the perinuclear region. The increase in size is likely because of vesicle fusion processes along the endocytic route (30Miaczynska M. Christoforidis S. Giner A. Shevchenko A. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Habermann B. Wilm M. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Cell. 2004; 116: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The temporal evolution of cellular Rh-EGF was subsequently quantified from imaging data (Fig. 2B). HeLa cells were paraformaldehyde-fixed at the indicated time points after Rh-EGF stimulation, and 30 cells were imaged. The sum of pixel values of the Rh-EGF channel was normalized to its maximal value (time point 30 min). Plotting the normalized Rh-EGF signal revealed the temporal evolution of Rh-EGF binding and uptake (Fig. 2B). The resulting plot and imaging data indicate an initial Rh-EGF-EGFR binding phase (≤2 min), where the majority of fluorescence signal is due to surface-bound and not yet internalized Rh-EGF. After this, the signal increases only modestly, to reach its maximal value by 30 min. The phase from 10 to 30 min is characterized by a translocation of bound Rh-EGF into the cell interior rather than continued binding, as indicated by the stagnation of fluorescence signal at 10 min. Although microscopy is an excellent method to observe the process of endocytosis in detail, sample size is small due to the requirement for high resolution images. Thus, we sought to increase sample size by using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry has been used previously to study EGFR endocytosis using GFP-fused EGF (31Wang Q. Villeneuve G. Wang Z. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), labeled Quantum dots (32Lidke D.S. Nagy P. Heintzmann R. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Post J.N. Grecco H.E. Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M.

Tetramethylrhodamine conjugate (λex = 555) is widely used in confocal microscopy (23Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4215-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but has not been applied in flow cytometry because of the unavailability of appropriate laser lines. We tested the suitability of flow cytometric detection of Rh-EGF using a custom Beckman Coulter FC500 equipped with a DPSS laser emitting at 561 nm. We first compared the fluorescence intensity measurements obtained from 488 or 561 nm laser excitation of Rh-EGF. HeLa cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Rh-EGF for 20 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS, trypsinized, and then resuspended in medium for measurements. Fig. 2C shows that, as expected from the excitation spectra of rhodamine, the signal-to-noise ratio improved with excitation at 561 nm, demonstrating its suitability for detecting EGF·EGFR complexes by flow cytometry. We then sought to determine the temporal evolution of Rh-EGF binding and uptake. HeLa cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml Rh-EGF for different times at 37 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry. To determine the accuracy of our flow cytometry measurements, we compared them to the quantitative measurements obtained by confocal microscopy. Plotting the normalized Rh-EGF signal revealed an excellent agreement between these two different single cell techniques (Fig. 2D). Notably, for flow cytometry, 10,000 cells were measured per condition, whereas for microscopy, for each time point 30 cells were evaluated. Importantly, although the overall shape of the two curves match, the standard deviations are significantly reduced for flow cytometry, demonstrating the value of sampling higher numbers of cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that 561-nm excitation of Rh-EGF provides a sensitive tool for detecting EGF-EGFR interactions by flow cytometry. The process of receptor endocytosis begins with a ligand binding event and is followed, on a slower time scale, by binding of the ligand·receptor complex to internalization adaptors, vesicle formation, and the actual internalization of the vesicles (cf. Fig. 1) (11Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the suitability of flow cytometric detection of Rh-EGF to discriminate between surface-bound versus internalized complexes. To do so, cells can be treated with a low pH buffer to remove surface-bound but not internalized labeled EGF (2Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the acid-induced dissociation of EGF was verified using microscopy (Fig. 3A). Here, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Rh-EGF for 2 min at 37 °C to allow for formation of EGF·EGFR complexes on the cell surface (11Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Then cells were washed with PBS (Fig. 3A, left) or acid buffer (Fig. 3A, right) and then returned to 37 °C for 15 min to allow for internalization prior to imaging. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the acid wash effectively removed all surface-bound Rh-EGF, as in the acid-treated cells no EGF vesicles were detected. To determine the time course of internalization via flow cytometry, HeLa cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Rh-EGF for different times, then washed with an acid buffer (solid line) or PBS (dashed line) prior to trypsinization, and subjected to flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). We observed a significant difference between the Rh-EGF signal for the acid-treated versus PBS-treated cells for short stimulation times. This difference in fluorescence intensity was highest at early time points (≤5 min) and corresponds to surface-bound, not yet internalized Rh-EGF. These values can be used to estimate the fraction of receptors still localized on the membrane. For longer incubation times (≥10 min), the two curves coincided, meaning that all fluorescence detected corresponded to Rh-EGF·EGFR complexes that were already internalized. This time line of events is in qualitative agreement with observations using different methods and cell types (18Wiley H.S. J.

These results demonstrate the sensitivity of our measurements and the ability to distinguish the temporal evolution of surface-bound versus internalized EGF by flow cytometric detection of Rh-EGF. Mathematical modeling combined with high content, quantitative data collection can yield nonintuitive understanding of the complexity of signaling pathways in the living cell. For the EGFR numerous models have been developed that focus on signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 37Wiley H.S. Shvartsman S.Y. Lauffenburger D.A.

Moreover, it is unclear how EGFR overexpression relative to internalization capacity influences the endocytosis process. In the following we investigated the relationship between receptor number and endocytic capacity by mathematical modeling, and we subsequently tested our predictions using the quantitative methodologies detailed above. To quantitatively evaluate the internalization reaction, and in particular to assess the effect of certain perturbations on internalization, typically the temporal evolution of the ratio of internalized versus surface-associated ligand is monitored (22Kazazic M.

The p300 transcriptional co-activator binds to β-catenin and facilitates transcription by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes and general transcriptional apparatus. We have found that β-TrCp1/Fbw1a, a member of the Skp1/Cullin/Rbx1/F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, binds directly to p300 and co-localizes with it to β-catenin target gene promoters. Our data show that Fbw1a, which normally targets β-catenin for degradation, works together with p300 to enhance the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, whereas other F-box/WD40 proteins do not. Fbw1a also cooperates with p300 to co-activate transcription by SMAD3, another Fbw1a ubiquitylation target, but not p53 or HIF-1α, which are substrates for other ubiquitin ligase complexes. These results suggest that, although Fbw1a is part of a negative feedback loop for controlling β-catenin levels in normal cells, its overexpression and binding to p300 may contribute to hyperactivated β-catenin transcriptional activity in colon cancer cells.

Likewise, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rsp5 and ubiquitin ligase Ubch7 have both been shown to independently serve as co-activators for steroid hormone receptors, the latter occurring through its interaction with the p160 co-activator, SRC1 (23Huibregtse J.M.

In this study, we found that p300 and CBP bind to β-TrCp1/Fbw1a, the substrate recognition partner associated with the Skp1/Cullin/Rbx1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that normally targets β-catenin for proteasome-mediated degradation (26Latres E. Chiaur D.S. Pagano M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We found that p300/CBP, Fbw1a, and β-catenin co-localized to the promoters of target genes and that Fbw1a activated β-catenin-mediated transcription. Collectively, the data presented here provide support for the emerging theme that the integration of transcriptional activation complexes with ubiquitination machinery is a fundamental mechanism for regulating gene transcription.

Phage Display Screening—p300 N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (residues 1–595 and 1929–2261) and CBP N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (1–615 and 1970–2292) were fused to GST, expressed in BL21 bacteria, and purified on glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The four p300 and CBP fragments were cleaved from the GST moiety with Precision Protease (Amersham Biosciences). The cleaved fragments were then chemically coupled to Dynal M270 carboxylic acid magnetic beads, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target proteins, immobilized on beads, were blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS. 10 μl of the M13 phage library, (PhD-7, New England Biolabs) diluted in 100 μl of TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) was added to each of the 4 samples for 1 h at room temperature, rotating tubes end over end. Samples were then washed 10 times with TBST, and bound phages were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2, for 10 min at room temperature. Eluted phage were neutralized with Tris-HCl (pH9.1), amplified for 5 h, and titered. 2 × 1010 amplified phage from round 1 panning were used as input for round 2 panning for each sample. Three total rounds of panning were performed as in round 1, except that the concentration of Tween in the TBST was increased from 0.1% to 0.5% in rounds 2 and 3. To increase the diversity of recovered peptides, individual phage from the second round were plaque-purified for sequencing with an M13 reverse primer (New England Biolabs). In Vitro Interaction Assays—The proteins EGFP, EGFP-peptide, or Fbw1a-FLAG were produced by linked in vitro transcription-translation (TnT, Promega, Madison, WI). Mutated Fbw1a, in which residues 493–497 (KVWDL) were replaced by NERDR, was created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and then in vitro transcribed and translated. Binding to GST fusion proteins, on glutathione beads or to fragments coupled to magnetic beads was performed in NETN-A (50 mm NaCl, 1 μm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm ZnSO4) overnight at 4 °C. Six washes were performed with NETN-B (200 mm NaCl, 1 μm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm ZnSO4). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting with anti-EGFP antibody (Clontech), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-HIF1α antibody (Novus Biologics), or anti-SRC1 (Neomarkers). Cell Culture, Coimmunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting— All cell lines used (HCT116, 293T, and HeLa) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, in a 37 °C, 10% CO2 incubator. Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell lysates were made in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Nuclear extracts were made by incubating cells in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), homogenizing with a glass tissue grinder, and centrifuging to isolate nuclear pellets. Nuclear pellets were then placed in a low salt (20 mm KCl) buffer and slowly moved to a high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl) to extract nuclear protein. Dialysis in BC100 buffer (200 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) was performed to allow buffer exchange. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Protein A/G beads, mouse IgG, and rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For endogenous co-immunoprecipitation, the anti-p300 antibody RW128 (Upstate Biotechnology) was conjugated to protein G beads with the Seize X Protein G IP kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Washes were performed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer or PBST (PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100). Samples were placed in SDS-containing loading dye, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting for Fbw1a (Invitrogen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Gal4DBD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the HA tag (Upstate and Covance). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Lithium Chloride was from Sigma. Recombinant Wnt3a was from R&D Systems. ChIP assays were performed with a ChIP kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, proteins/DNA were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, cells were lysed, and chromatin was sheared with sonication. After centrifugation, lysates were diluted and proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with antibodies against β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fbw1a (Invitrogen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or FLAG (Sigma). Samples were washed, eluted, and the cross-links were reversed at 65 °C for 4 h. The isolated DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was performed on a Stratagene MX3000P, using Quantitect Sybr green master mix (Qiagen). ChIP-reChIP was performed in the same manner as above, expect that eluates from the primary β-catenin ChIP were rediluted 10-fold and re-immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 and anti-Fbw1a antibodies prior to reversal of cross-links. As previously reported (28Chen Y.H. Yang C.K. Xia M. Ou C.Y. Stallcup M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2084-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), cyclin D1 promoter primers were: fwd (5′-CGG GGC AGC AGA AGC GAG A-3′) and rev (5′-GTG AGT AGC AAA GAA ACG TGG-3′); cyclin D1 control primers (3892 bp upstream of promoter) were: fwd (5′-GGT CCT CCC CGC AGT CTT C-3′) and rev (5′-CTC TCC CCC GCA GTC AGG-3′). As previously reported (29Li J. Wang C.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), axin2 promoter primers were: fwd (5′-CTG GAG CCG GCT GCG CTT TGA TAA-3′) and rev (5′-CGG CCC CGA AAT CCA TCG CTC TGA), and axin2 control primers (2542 bp downstream from ATG start site, within open reading frame) were: fwd (5′-CTG GCT TTG GTG AAC TGT TG-3′) and rev (5′-AGT TGC TCA CAG CCA AGA CA-3′). Enolase1 primers were: fwd (5′-TGT AGT GGT GCG GGC GAA ACT CTG-3′) and rev (5′-AGA GCG ACG CTG AGT GCG T-3′). Luciferase Assays and Fbw1a Knockdown—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfections were performed in triplicate wells. A total of 3 μg of DNA per triplicate was transfected into cells with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Depending on the specific experiment, 0.7–1.2 μg of firefly luciferase reporter, 0.05–0.2 μg of Renilla luciferase, and between 1.2 and 1.8 μg of CMV-promoter vectors were used per triplicate, per experiment. The total amount of CMV-based vectors (pcDNA3.1 empty vector plus pcDNA3.1-Fbox-encoding) was always held constant in each experiment. After balancing for CMV levels, the total amount of DNA in each transfection was brought up to 3 μg per triplicate by using pBS2. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase assays were performed with a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Activities of the firefly luciferase reporters were normalized to that of the internal control vector, pCMV-Renilla-luciferase. A Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems) was used to collect luciferase readings. Knockdown of Fbw1a was performed with a combination of two lentiviral short hairpin (sh) RNA constructs from OpenBiosystems and one Dharmacon siRNA sequence that had been adapted for shRNA lentiviral infection. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with lentiviral packaging vectors and a vector containing either a non-silencing or shRNA sequence directed against Fbw1a. 48 and 72 h after transfection, equal volumes of filtered supernatants were added to 293T cells for infection with either non-silencing or Fbw1a knockdown viruses. Puromycin (2 μg/ml) was used for selection and fluorescence from the GFP-containing shRNA vectors was used to confirm nearly 100% infection efficiency. 96–120 h after infection, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting were performed to confirm Fbw1a knockdown. RNA was extracted using TRIzol and mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH after quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Primer sequences for Fbw1a mRNA were fwd (5′-GCT GAA CTT GTG TGC AAG GA-3′) and rev (5′-TAC TGT CCC CAT CCT CTT CG-3′); axin2 mRNA, fwd (5′-AGT GTG AGG TCC ACG GAA AC-3′) and rev (5′-CTT CAC ACT GCG ATG CAT TT); cyclinD1 mRNA, fwd (5′-GCG GAG GAG AAC AAA CAG AT-3′) and rev (5′-TGA GGC GGT AGT AGG ACA GG-3′). Quantification of immunoblot bands was performed using the Photoshop histogram function. Absolute band intensity was determined using the mean and pixel values for each band; relative band intensity was determined by normalizing to GAPDH. p300 Binds Peptides with Homology to F-box/WD40 Proteins— To identify peptides that target proteins for binding to p300 and CBP, we used fragments of p300 and CBP to screen a random 7-amino acid M13 phage-displayed peptide library. Four protein fragments were used as targets for the screen, two from p300 and the corresponding two from CBP (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal fragment of p300 encompassing amino acids 1–595 (and corresponding CBP fragment) includes the N terminus, CH1, and part of the KIX domains that are known binding sites for nuclear receptors, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α), and p53, among other transcription factors (8Goodman R.H.

The C-terminal fragment (p300 amino acids 1929–2261 or corresponding CBP fragment) includes the SID/IBiD domain and its flanking sequences, which contain known binding sites for the SMAD proteins, p53, ETS2, E1A, and the p160 co-activators SRC1, GRIP1, and AIB1 (34Teufel D.P.

We did not include the CH3 domain within the C-terminal fragment, because CH3 and CH1 are structurally highly similar and several transcription factors bind redundantly to these two domains (32De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After GST purification, the fragments were cleaved of their GST moieties (to avoid nonspecific peptide binding) and chemically coupled to magnetic beads for in solution library screening. In vitro interaction assays confirmed that coupling to magnetic beads did not alter the structure of the target proteins. As expected, immobilization of the N-terminal p300 and CBP fragments to magnetic beads conferred binding to in vitro translated HIF1α and coupling of the C-terminal p300 and CBP fragments to beads conferred binding to SRC1 (supplemental Fig. S1). In solution library screening was performed with an M13 phage library whose complexity of ∼1011 different peptides encompasses all possible permutations of peptides 7 amino acids in length. Three successive rounds of panning were performed to enrich for p300/CBP-binding peptides, however, to provide for diversity of recovered peptides, phage from the second round of panning were plaque-purified for sequencing. 6 of the 24 peptides sequenced from the screen of N-terminal p300 and CBP fragments contained the motif K(V/L)WXL (Fig. 1B), whereas none of the 27 peptides sequenced from the screen of C-terminal fragments contained it (supplemental Fig. S1 B), indicating a significant enrichment for binding of this motif to the N-terminal fragments (p = 0.007, Fisher's exact test). Although other motifs emerged in the collection of sequenced peptides (supplemental Fig. S1B), none of these occurred as often as K(V/L)WXL. Of note, the proline-rich motif P(L/R)XXP appeared 3–4 times in the C-terminal fragment screen. These peptides are very similar to the previously characterized proline-repeat motifs in the p53 transactivation domain, which are known to bind p300/CBP and are important for DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 (38Dornan D.S.H. Burch L. Smith A.J. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8846-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given the prominence of the K(V/L)WXL motif in our collection of peptides from the N-terminal fragment screen, we chose to focus on elucidating the significance of this motif. To verify that the K(V/L)WXL peptide was sufficient to direct binding to p300 and CBP, we cloned one of the identified peptides (KVWTLNY) (Fig. 1B) into a solution-exposed loop of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). In vitro interaction assays demonstrated that insertion of this peptide conferred binding of EGFP to the N-terminal fragments of both p300 and CBP, as well as a smaller fragment containing only the CH1 domain of p300 (Fig. 1, C and D). We searched the proteomics data base at ScanProsite to determine whether any endogenous proteins contain this binding motif. We found that several members of the F-box protein family contain a K(V/L)WXL motif (Fig. 2A). F-box proteins serve as one of the four subunits in the Skp1/Cullin/Rbx/F-box (SCF) complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. F-box proteins are further subdivided based on the type of their substrate recognition domain, either a WD40 domain, leucine-rich region, or F-box only with no defined substrate recognition region. In our data base search, all but one of the identified F-box proteins were F-box/WD40 (Fbw) proteins, whereas one F-box only (Fbx18) protein also had the motif. None of the F-box/leucine-rich repeat (Fbl) family members contained a K(V/L)WXL motif. WD40 repeat domains fold into a seven-blade propeller, and the crystal structure of Fbw1a (39Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) reveals that the K(V/L)WXL motif resides within the sixth blade, in a location likely accessible for protein-protein interactions. p300 and Fbw1a Interact in Vitro and in Cells—To determine if p300 interacts with Fbw proteins, we performed an in vitro interaction assay, which demonstrated that full-length Fbw1a bound to the N-terminal fragment of p300 and to the smaller CH1 domain located within this fragment (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, Fbw1a also bound to a C-terminal region of p300 that includes the CH3 domain but did not bind to a middle region of p300 that includes the CH2/HAT domains (Fig. 2C). CH1 and CH3 are highly similar in both primary sequence and structure (32De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and several transcription factors such as p53, E1A, and Ets-1 bind to both domains. To determine if the K(V/L)WXL motif is necessary for Fbw1a binding to p300, we mutated the KVWDL sequence within Fbw1a to NERDR. This mutation abolished binding to the N-terminal and CH1 p300 fragments, but it did not abrogate binding to the CH3-to-end fragment (Fig. 2D). This suggests multiple interaction surfaces exist between Fbw1a and p300, similar to those for p53 (34Teufel D.P. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Fbw protein, Fbw8, which does not contain a K(V/L)WXL motif, was able to bind to the CH3-to-end fragment but had little or no binding to the N-terminal or CH1 fragments (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results show that the K(V/L)WXL motif in Fbw1a can direct binding to the N-terminal/CH1 domain of p300, but, like certain transcription factors, multiple interaction surfaces mediate the binding between these two classes of proteins. Next, we wanted to characterize the p300/Fbw interaction within mammalian cells. 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged p300 alone or together with FLAG-tagged Fbw1a, Fbw2, Parkin (a Fbl protein without the K(V/L)WXL motif), or Fbw8 (40Chiaur D.S.

Science. 2004; 304: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody was performed. Western blotting revealed that HA-p300 was readily co-immunoprecipitated in cells expressing FLAG-tagged Fbw1a, Fbw2, and Fbw8 but not from control cells or cells expressing Parkin-FLAG (Fig. 3A). We also wanted to determine if endogenous p300 and Fbw1a could interact. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared, and p300 was immunoprecipitated. Western blotting revealed that Fbw1a was co-immunoprecipitated with p300 but not with a control IgG/mock IP (Fig. 3B). These results verify the binding of Fbw1a to p300 within cells. To define the region(s) of Fbw1a that can interact with p300, we expressed p300-HA and three Gal4DBD-tagged Fbw1a fragments in 293T cells (Fig. 4A). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting verified that the WD40 domain, which contains the K(V/L)WXL motif, confers binding to p300, whereas other fragments of Fbw1a (F-box, mid) did not (Fig. 4B). This result, along with the in vitro interaction studies (Figs. 1 and 2), demonstrates that the WD40 domain is necessary and sufficient to target Fbw1a for binding to p300. To confirm the binding surfaces on p300 that are able to bind Fbw1a in cells, six HA-tagged p300 fragments (Fig. 5A) were co-transfected into 293T cells with Fbw1a-FLAG.

https://openalex.org/W2081302678,"The multifunctional protein encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 (gp4) provides both helicase and primase activity at the replication fork. T7 DNA helicase preferentially utilizes dTTP to unwind duplex DNA in vitro but also hydrolyzes other nucleotides, some of which do not support helicase activity. Very little is known regarding the architecture of the nucleotide binding site in determining nucleotide specificity. Crystal structures of the T7 helicase domain with bound dATP or dTTP identified Arg-363 and Arg-504 as potential determinants of the specificity for dATP and dTTP. Arg-363 is in close proximity to the sugar of the bound dATP, whereas Arg-504 makes a hydrogen bridge with the base of bound dTTP. T7 helicase has a serine at position 319, whereas bacterial helicases that use rATP have a threonine in the comparable position. Therefore, in the present study we have examined the role of these residues (Arg-363, Arg-504, and Ser-319) in determining nucleotide specificity. Our results show that Arg-363 is responsible for dATP, dCTP, and dGTP hydrolysis, whereas Arg-504 and Ser-319 confer dTTP specificity. Helicase-R504A hydrolyzes dCTP far better than wild-type helicase, and the hydrolysis of dCTP fuels unwinding of DNA. Substitution of threonine for serine 319 reduces the rate of hydrolysis of dTTP without affecting the rate of dATP hydrolysis. We propose that different nucleotides bind to the nucleotide binding site of T7 helicase by an induced fit mechanism. We also present evidence that T7 helicase uses the energy derived from the hydrolysis of dATP in addition to dTTP for mediating DNA unwinding."
https://openalex.org/W1986153750,"With the advent of high-throughput profiling methods, interest in reverse engineering the structure and dynamics of biochemical networks is high. Recently an algorithm for reverse engineering of biochemical networks was developed by Laubenbacher and Stigler. It is a top-down approach using time discrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term order, a technicality imposed by the use of Gröbner-bases calculations. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets to be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found minimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be reverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which we characterized using a geometric property called “general position”. Moreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets, provided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a generalization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term order. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the correct model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of variables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges to zero as fast as , where and . Therefore, even if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders are overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless prodigious amounts of data are available. Such large data sets are experimentally impossible to generate with today's technologies."
