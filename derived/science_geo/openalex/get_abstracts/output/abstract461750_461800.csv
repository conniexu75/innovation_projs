https://openalex.org/W1993127959,"Obesity and diabetes are associated with excess caloric intake and reduced energy expenditure resulting in a negative energy balance. The incidence of diabetes has reached epidemic proportions, and childhood diabetes and obesity are increasing alarmingly. Therefore, it is important to develop safe, easily deliverable, and economically viable treatment alternatives for these diseases. Here, we provide data supporting the candidacy of probiotics as such a therapeutic modality against obesity and diabetes. Probiotics are live bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and impart beneficial effects for health. However, their widespread prescription as medical therapies is limited primarily because of the paucity of our understanding of their mechanism of action. Here, we demonstrate that the administration of a probiotic, VSL#3, prevented and treated obesity and diabetes in several mouse models. VSL#3 suppressed body weight gain and insulin resistance via modulation of the gut flora composition. VSL#3 promoted the release of the hormone GLP-1, resulting in reduced food intake and improved glucose tolerance. The VSL#3-induced changes were associated with an increase in the levels of a short chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate. Using a cell culture system, we demonstrate that butyrate stimulated the release of GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for VSL#3 action. These findings suggest that probiotics such as VSL#3 can modulate the gut microbiota-SCFA-hormone axis. Moreover, our results indicate that probiotics are of potential therapeutic utility to counter obesity and diabetes."

We developed a noninvasive method for imaging glucose uptake in vivo that is based on magnetic resonance imaging and allows the uptake of unlabeled glucose to be measured through the chemical exchange of protons between hydroxyl groups and water. This method differs from existing molecular imaging methods because it permits detection of the delivery and uptake of a metabolically active compound in physiological quantities. We show that our technique, named glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST), is sensitive to tumor glucose accumulation in colorectal tumor models and can distinguish tumor types with differing metabolic characteristics and pathophysiologies. The results of this study suggest that glucoCEST has potential as a useful and cost-effective method for characterizing disease and assessing response to therapy in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2086704257,"Here we report whole-exome sequencing of individuals with various myeloid malignancies and identify recurrent somatic mutations in SETBP1, consistent with a recent report on atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). Closely positioned somatic SETBP1 mutations encoding changes in Asp868, Ser869, Gly870, Ile871 and Asp880, which match germline mutations in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS), were detected in 17% of secondary acute myeloid leukemias (sAML) and 15% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cases. These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology. Mutant cases were associated with advanced age and monosomy 7/deletion 7q (-7/del(7q)) constituting poor prognostic factors. Analysis of serially collected samples indicated that SETBP1 mutations were acquired during leukemic evolution. Transduction with mutant Setbp1 led to the immortalization of mouse myeloid progenitors that showed enhanced proliferative capacity compared to cells transduced with wild-type Setbp1. Somatic mutations of SETBP1 seem to cause gain of function, are associated with myeloid leukemic transformation and convey poor prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and CMML."

https://openalex.org/W2034502973,"The list of factors that participate in the DNA damage response to maintain genomic stability has expanded significantly to include a role for proteins involved in RNA processing. Here, we provide evidence that the RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS) is a novel component of the DNA damage response. We demonstrate that FUS is rapidly recruited to sites of laser-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a manner that requires poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase activity, but is independent of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase function. FUS recruitment is mediated by the arginine/glycine-rich domains, which interact directly with PAR. In addition, we identify a role for the prion-like domain in promoting accumulation of FUS at sites of DNA damage. Finally, depletion of FUS diminished DSB repair through both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining, implicating FUS as an upstream participant in both pathways. These results identify FUS as a new factor in the immediate response to DSBs that functions downstream of PAR polymerase to preserve genomic integrity.Background: FUS has been implicated in the DNA damage response; however, the mechanisms are unknown.Results: FUS recruitment to DNA lesions is PARP-dependent.

Central to this paradigm is the activation of apical phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like kinases, including ATM, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that serve as proximal DNA damage signal transducers. The best characterized of these, ATM, is activated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) to phosphorylate an estimated 700 substrates (3.Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E.

FUS is a 526-amino acid member of the FET family of RBPs, which include Ewing sarcoma (EWSR1), Tata-binding protein-associated factor 2N (TAF15), and the Drosophila ortholog of FUS, SARFH/Cabeza (25.Bertolotti A.

FUS was initially identified as a fusion oncogene in myxoid liposarcoma, in which the transcriptional activation domain of FUS is fused to the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (27.Crozat A. Aman P.

In addition, FUS fusion proteins have been identified in a variety of human cancers including acute myeloid leukemia, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, and fibromyxoid sarcoma (29.Law W.J. Cann K.L. Hicks G.G. TLS, EWS and TAF15: a model for transcriptional integration of gene expression.Brief Funct. Genomic Proteomic. 2006; 5: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). FUS is composed of N-terminal Gln/Gly/Ser/Tyr-rich and Gly-rich regions that comprise a prion-like domain (PLD) (30.Gitler A.D. Shorter J. RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains in ALS and FTLD-U.Prion. 2011; 5: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), an RNA recognition motif (RRM), arginine/glycine-rich (RGG) domains, and a C-terminal zinc finger domain (ZNF) (see Fig. 2A) (31.Iko Y.

In addition to its participation in transcription, FUS has proposed physiological activities involving microRNA processing, splicing, and mRNA transport and maturation (36.Lagier-Tourenne C. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. TDP-43 and FUS/TLS: emerging roles in RNA processing and neurodegeneration.Hum. Mol.

Thus, FUS seems to fulfill broad functions in gene expression through transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Intriguingly, dominant mutations in FUS cause inherited forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (38.Vance C. Rogelj B. Hortobágyi T. De Vos K.J.

It is believed that ALS-associated mutations lead to trapping and aggregation of FUS in the cytoplasm; however, other pathogenic mechanisms may be at play. FUS also has an emergent, yet poorly understood participation in the DDR. FUS−/− mice exhibit defects in B lymphocyte development and activation, male sterility, chromosomal instability, and radiosensitivity, phenotypes that are closely aligned with DSB repair defects (40.Kuroda M. Sok J. Webb L. Baechtold H. Urano F. Yin Y. Chung P. de Rooij D.G. Akhmedov A. Ashley T. Ron D.

Fus deficiency in mice results in defective B-lymphocyte development and activation, high levels of chromosomal instability and perinatal death.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts from FUS−/− testes are unable to promote pairing between homologous DNA sequences in vitro (41.Hicks G.G. Singh N. Nashabi A. Mai S. Bozek G. Klewes L. Arapovic D. White E.K. Koury M.J. Oltz E.M. Van Kaer L. Ruley H.E. Fus deficiency in mice results in defective B-lymphocyte development and activation, high levels of chromosomal instability and perinatal death.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and FUS was shown to promote D-loop formation (34.Baechtold H. Kuroda M. Sok J. Ron D. Lopez B.S. Akhmedov A.T. Human 75-kDa DNA-pairing protein is identical to the pro-oncoprotein TLS/FUS and is able to promote D-loop formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34337-34342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), an essential step in the repair of DSBs through the HR pathway (42.Thompson L.H. Recognition, signaling, and repair of DNA double-strand breaks produced by ionizing radiation in mammalian cells: the molecular choreography.Mutat. Res. 2012; 751: 158-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, the available evidence suggests that FUS participates in HR repair, possibly through direct actions at DSBs. FUS may also regulate the DDR through transcriptional mechanisms. Wang et al. showed that FUS is recruited to the cyclin D1 (CCND1) promoter through an interaction with sense and antisense noncoding CCND1 RNAs. Through inhibition of CREB-binding protein, FUS acts to repress CCND1 expression in response to DNA damage (43.Wang X. Arai S. Song X. Reichart D. Du K. Pascual G. Tempst P. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Kurokawa R. Induced ncRNAs allosterically modify RNA-binding proteins in cis to inhibit transcription.Nature. 2008; 454: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Finally, the finding that FUS is directly phosphorylated by ATM on Ser-42 and possibly neighboring phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like kinase consensus motifs in response to DNA damage provides strong circumstantial support for its role in the DDR (44.Gardiner M. Toth R. Vandermoere F. Morrice N.A. Rouse J. Identification and characterization of FUS/TLS as a new target of ATM.Biochem. J. 2008; 415: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, the functional significance of these posttranslational modifications is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that FUS functions in cis to DNA damage via a PARP-dependent mechanism, which is mediated partially, if not completely, through binding of the RGG2 domain to PAR. In addition, we identify a role for the N-terminal PLD in accumulation of FUS at sites of DNA damage. Finally, FUS is required for efficient DNA repair through both HR and NHEJ pathways and for radioresistance. These data establish that FUS is dynamically regulated by DNA damage and functions downstream of PARP to maintain the stability of the genome.

https://openalex.org/W2104505841,"An inhibitor of oxysterol-induced Smoothened activation defines a 20-OHC binding site in the extracellular domain of this essential component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Oxysterols bind the seven-transmembrane protein Smo (Smo) and potently activate vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a pathway essential in embryonic development, adult stem cell maintenance and cancer. It is unknown, however, whether oxysterols are important for normal vertebrate Hh signaling and whether antagonizing oxysterols can inhibit the Hh pathway. We developed azasterols that block Hh signaling by binding the oxysterol-binding site of Smo. We show that the binding site for oxysterols and azasterols maps to the extracellular, cysteine-rich domain of Smo and is completely separable from the site bound by other small-molecule modulators, located within the heptahelical bundle of Smo. Smo mutants in which oxysterol binding is abolished no longer respond to oxysterols and cannot be maximally activated by the Hh ligand. Our results show that oxysterol binding to vertebrate Smo is required for normal Hh signaling and that targeting the oxysterol-binding site is an effective strategy to inhibit Smo."

https://openalex.org/W2087524781,"Increased hepatic lipid content is an early correlate of insulin resistance and can be caused by nutrient-induced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor). This activation of mTor increases basal Akt activity, leading to a self-perpetuating lipogenic cycle. We have previously shown that the developmental Notch pathway has metabolic functions in adult mouse liver. Acute or chronic inhibition of Notch dampens hepatic glucose production and increases Akt activity and may therefore be predicted to increase hepatic lipid content. Here we now show that constitutive liver-specific ablation of Notch signaling, or its acute inhibition with a decoy Notch1 receptor, prevents hepatosteatosis by blocking mTor complex 1 (mTorc1) activity. Conversely, Notch gain of function causes fatty liver through constitutive activation of mTorc1, an effect that is reversible by treatment with rapamycin. We demonstrate that Notch signaling increases mTorc1 complex stability, augmenting mTorc1 function and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenesis. These data identify Notch as a therapeutically actionable branch point of metabolic signaling at which Akt activation in the liver can be uncoupled from hepatosteatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2008811778,"GluN2A and GluN2B are the major subunits of functional NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Previous studies have suggested that GluN2A and GluN2B may differentially mediate NMDAR function at synaptic and extrasynaptic locations and play opposing roles in excitotoxicity, such as neurodegeneration triggered by ischemic stroke and brain injury. By using pharmacological and molecular approaches to suppress or enhance the function of GluN2A and GluN2B in cultured cortical neurons, we examined NMDAR-mediated, bidirectional regulation of prosurvival signaling (i.e. the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-Bdnf cascade) and cell death. Inhibition of GluN2A or GluN2B attenuated the up-regulation of prosurvival signaling triggered by the activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDAR. Inhibition of GluN2A or GluN2B also attenuated the down-regulation of prosurvival signaling triggered by the coactivation of synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. The effects of GluN2B on CREB-Bdnf signaling were larger than those of GluN2A. Consistently, compared with suppression of GluN2A, suppression of GluN2B resulted in more reduction of NMDA- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced excitotoxicity as well as NMDAR-mediated elevation of intracellular calcium. Moreover, excitotoxicity and down-regulation of CREB were exaggerated in neurons overexpressing GluN2A or GluN2B. Together, we found that GluN2A and GluN2B are involved in the function of both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR, demonstrating that they play similar rather than opposing roles in NMDAR-mediated bidirectional regulation of prosurvival signaling and neuronal death."

Tuberculosis infections are one of the leading causes of death due to infectious disease. The World Health Organization estimates that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects one-third of the world population, and 8 million new cases of tuberculosis are reported annually (1.World Health Organization Tuberculosis. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2010Google Scholar). The mycobacterial cell wall plays a crucial role in mycobacterial intrinsic resistance to external stresses and antibiotics. Cell wall lipids contribute to mycobacterial biofilm formation and have immunomodulatory properties that are essential to the infectious strategy of pathogenic mycobacteria. The composition and architecture of the mycobacterial cell wall are unique. The outer membrane contains an inner leaflet of very long chain mycolic acids, covalently bound to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan layer, and an outer leaflet composed of noncovalently associated lipids such as trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (TDM), 2The abbreviations used are: TDM, trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate; GPL, glycopeptidolipid; PDIM, phthiocerol dimycocerosate; TMM, trehalose monomycolate; MMDAG, monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol; MycPL, mycolyl phospholipid; MAME, mycolic acid methyl ester; ESI, electrospray ionization. glycopeptidolipids (GPLs), phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), and sulfolipids (2.Brennan P.J.

Mycolic acids are β-hydroxyl fatty acids with an α-alkyl side chain and require the fatty acid synthase systems FAS-I and FAS-II and the polyketide synthase Pks13 for synthesis (4.Takayama K. Wang C.

Microbial biofilms are defined as communities of microorganisms that range from surface-attached colonies to well developed pellicles formed at the air-liquid interface (9.O'Toole G. Kaplan H.B. Kolter R. Biofilm formation as microbial development.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). Bacteria within biofilm communities are typically associated with a complex architecture of extracellular material that contains secreted molecules such as polysaccharides, lipids, proteins, and DNA. This matrix provides a physical barrier to environmental stresses and allows for the emergence of a drug-tolerant phenotype. As such, the ability to form biofilms is associated with virulence in a number of bacterial pathogens. Although the presence and role of biofilms during M. tuberculosis infections remain unclear, biofilm formation by M. smegmatis and other environmental species has been established. The extracellular matrix associated with mycobacterial biofilms is notably rich in lipids. Free mycolic acids are associated with the formation of biofilms by M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (10.Ojha A. Anand M. Bhatt A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F.

Mutants lacking MSMEG_1529 or that are defective in mycolic acid biosynthesis have impaired biofilm formation. In M. smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, GPLs also contribute to biofilm formation (13.Recht J. Martínez A. Torello S. Kolter R. Genetic analysis of sliding motility in Mycobacterium smegmatis.J.

The mycobacterial cell wall is a rich area for research, and biochemical and genetic approaches are being employed to further elucidate the mechanism of cell wall biosynthesis. In mycobacteria, MmpL (mycobacterial membrane protein large) proteins appear to be dedicated to the export of cell wall lipid constituents. MmpL3 was recently demonstrated to be the transporter responsible for delivery of TMM to the mycobacterial surface (16.Grzegorzewicz A.E. Pham H. Gundi V.A.K.B. Scherman M.S. North E.J. Hess T.

M. smegmatis mutants lacking the MmpL4a and MmpL4b (originally named TmtpB and TmtpC) transporters do not have GPLs on their surface. These mutants, along with mutants lacking the accessory protein MmpS4, have altered colony morphology and reduced sliding motility and biofilm formation (13.Recht J. Martínez A. Torello S. Kolter R.

Although substrates for M. tuberculosis MmpL4, MmpL5, and MmpL11 have not yet been described, data suggest that they also contribute to M. tuberculosis virulence (22.Domenech P. Reed M.B. Barry C.E.

Two independent studies found that an M. tuberculosis mmpL11 mutant is attenuated in a mouse model of infection; however, neither group determined the substrate of MmpL11 or defined the mechanism by which their mutant was attenuated (22.Domenech P.

We showed that the loss of MmpL11 reduces the membrane permeability of M. smegmatis (26.Purdy G.E. Niederweis M. Russell D.G. Decreased outer membrane permeability protects mycobacteria from killing by ubiquitin-derived peptides.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 844-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that the M. smegmatis mmpL11 mutants had differences in cell wall lipid composition compared with wild-type mycobacteria. Specifically, mutant bacteria were unable to transport monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol (MMDAG) and mycolate ester wax to the bacterial surface. In addition, the mycolic acid precursor molecule mycolyl phospholipid (MycPL) accumulated in the absence of MmpL11. MmpL11 is encoded at the MmpL3/MmpL11 chromosomal locus that is conserved across mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium leprae. Expression of the M. tuberculosis MmpL11 protein complemented the M. smegmatis mmpL11 mutant phenotypes. Our data are consistent with a model in which MmpL11 plays a conserved role in mycobacterial cell wall biology and can function across species. M. smegmatis mc2155 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Mycobacterial strains were maintained in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium (Difco) or on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin/dextrose/saline. When required, cultures were incubated with the antibiotics kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and hygromycin (75 μg/ml). Planktonic M. smegmatis strains were grown in 7H9 liquid medium containing oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase supplements and the detergent Tween 80 with shaking. For biofilm growth, M. smegmatis was grown in polystyrene Petri dishes at 30 °C in modified Sauton's medium without Tween 80. Sauton's medium contained 0.5 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter MgSO4, 4.0 g/liter l-asparagine, 0.05 g/liter ferric ammonium citrate, 4.76% glycerol, and 1.0 mg/liter ZnSO4 at a final pH of 7.0. Pellicle formation in borosilicate glass tubes was observed when M. smegmatis was grown in 7H9 medium without shaking at 37 °C for several days. To enumerate bacteria grown under biofilm-inducing conditions, Tween 80 was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to promote dissociation of biofilm-associated bacteria. The pellicle was mechanically disrupted, and the bacteria were completely dispersed by syringing through a tuberculin syringe. Serial dilutions were performed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 and plated in Middlebrook 7H10 medium. The isolation of the M. smegmatis mmpL11 mutant GP02 was described previously (26.Purdy G.E. Niederweis M. Russell D.G. Decreased outer membrane permeability protects mycobacteria from killing by ubiquitin-derived peptides.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 844-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For complementation, the M. smegmatis mmpL11 gene was amplified using primers MSMmpL11NdeI (CATATGATGCGCTTGAGCAGCAC) and MSMmpL11H3 (AAGCTTCGCCTCCTCCAGCATTGC) and cloned into pVV16 (27.Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Phosphatidylinositol is an essential phospholipid of mycobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) in frame with a C-terminal His6 affinity tag. For heterologous complementation with M. tuberculosis mmpL11, the gene was amplified from M. tuberculosis CDC1551 genomic DNA using primers RvMmpL11NdeI (ATCATATGATGCGCTTGAGCCGCAACCTG) and RvMmpL11H3 (ATAAGCTTCCTCGCCTCCTCCAACATCGC) and cloned into pVV16 in frame with a C-terminal His6 affinity tag. All plasmid constructs were sequence-verified. M. smegmatis biofilms were cultured in a 24-well plate as described above. At the time of harvest, the medium below the pellicle was removed with a tuberculin syringe and replaced with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). A 5-mm polystyrene coverslip was used to capture a portion of the pellicle that had been in contact with the fixative. Samples were dried and subsequently gold-sputtered (PELCO 91000 sputter coater) and imaged using a Sirion XL30 scanning electron microscope (FEI, Portland, OR) at the Portland State University Center for Electron Microscopy and Nanofabrication. To harvest total lipids, cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Following extraction, total lipids were dried under N2 gas. Apolar lipids were harvested as described (11.Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis biofilms containing free mycolic acids and harbouring drug-tolerant bacteria.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids were resuspended in 5 ml of methanol and 0.3% NaCl (10:1, v/v) and 2.5 ml of petroleum ether. Samples were rocked for 30 min at room temperature; after centrifugation, the upper layer containing the apolar lipids was retained and dried under N2 gas. Surface lipids were extracted from M. smegmatis biofilms as described previously (20.Converse S.E. Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Cox J.S. MmpL8 is required for sulfolipid-1 biosynthesis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, biofilms grown in polystyrene dishes were harvested, resuspended in 5 ml of hexane, and then sonicated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min, the hexane-extracted lipids were dried under N2 gas. The above total, apolar, and surface lipids were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and equivalent amounts were spotted onto TLC plates. TDM, MycPL, and TMM were resolved by TLC in a chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2, v/v/v) solvent system (28.Besra G.S. Sievert T. Lee R.E. Slayden R.A. Brennan P.J. Takayama K. Identification of the apparent carrier in mycolic acid synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12735-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Free mycolates were resolved by TLC in a chloroform/methanol/distilled H2O (90:10:1, v/v/v) solvent system. Meromycolyl diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol were resolved by TLC in a toluene/acetone (99:1, v/v) solvent system. The TLC plates were visualized by spraying with 5% molybdophosphoric acid in ethanol and charred. Lipids were also purified from silica plates (Analtech) using standard preparative TLC procedures. Radiolabeled lipids and mycolyl arabinogalactan were isolated as described (29.Mikusová K. Slayden R.A. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Biogenesis of the mycobacterial cell wall and the site of action of ethambutol.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, M. smegmatis strains were grown to mid-log phase and then radiolabeled with 1 μCi/ml [14C]sodium acetate ([1,2-14C]acetic acid sodium salt, specific activity of 100–120 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals). At each time point indicated, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and sonicated. TDM, MycPL, and TMM were resolved by TLC using a chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2) solvent system. Mycolyl arabinogalactan was isolated from the delipidated cells and analyzed as mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) as described previously (22.Domenech P. Reed M.B. Barry C.E. Contribution of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis MmpL protein family to virulence and drug resistance.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3492-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The MAMEs were separated by TLC by running the plate five times using a petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1, v/v) solvent system. To detect radiolabeled lipids, TLC plates were exposed to a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare) and visualized using a STORM imager (GE Healthcare). Densitometry on the lipid profiles was performed using NIH ImageJ software. The mean intensities of TDM and mycolyl arabinogalactan were normalized to the total signal from each sample, and the means ± S.D. from three independent experiments were graphed. This normalization ensured that each sample was controlled internally rather than in comparison with other samples and compensated for the reduced radiolabel incorporation that we routinely observed for the mmpL11 mutant. M. smegmatis strains were grown to mid-log phase and then radiolabeled with 1 μCi/ml [14C]sodium acetate. These conditions were chosen to mimic the conditions used for lipid incorporation. At the indicated time points, the cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Both electrospray ionization (ESI) high-resolution (R = 100,000 at m/z 400) and low-energy collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectra were acquired with a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer with an Xcalibur operating system. Total lipid extracts were fractionated using a CHROMABOND Sep-Pak amino column (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) as described previously (15.Chen J.M. German G.J. Alexander D.C. Ren H. Tan T. Liu J.

Inhibition of mycolic acid transport across the Mycobacterium tuberculosis plasma membrane.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Fractions were loop-injected onto the ESI source, where the skimmer was set at ground potential, the electrospray needle was set at 4.5 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was 275 °C. The automatic gain control of the ion trap was set to 5 × 107, with a maximum injection time of 400 ms. Helium was used as the buffer with collision gas at a pressure of 1 × 10−3 millibars (0.75 millitorrs). The MSn experiments were carried out with a relative collision energy ranging from 30 to 40% and with an activation q value at 0.25. The activation time was set at 10 ms. Mass spectra were accumulated in the profile mode. The MALDI-TOF spectra of the total lipid and fractionated lipid extracts were acquired in the reflector mode using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and delayed extraction. The final mass spectra were from an average of 5–10 spectra, in which each spectrum was a collection from 200 laser shots. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid was used as the matrix. We demonstrated previously that the M. smegmatis mmpL11 transposon mutant GP02 is hyper-resistant to host antimicrobial peptides and has decreased membrane permeability relative to wild-type M. smegmatis (26.Purdy G.E. Niederweis M. Russell D.G. Decreased outer membrane permeability protects mycobacteria from killing by ubiquitin-derived peptides.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 844-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our further characterization of the mutant indicated that there was no difference in the growth rate of wild-type M. smegmatis and GP02 grown planktonically in 7H9 medium containing the detergent Tween 80 to prevent clumping (Fig. 1A). However, we noted differences when the two strains were cultivated in standing culture in medium lacking Tween 80. Surfactants and detergents are known inhibitors of biofilm formation (30.Mireles 2nd, J.R. Toguchi A. Harshey R.M. Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium swarming mutants with altered biofilm-forming abilities: surfactin inhibits biofilm formation.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5848-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 31.Nguyen K.T. Piastro K. Gray T.A. Derbyshire K.M. Mycobacterial biofilms facilitate horizontal DNA transfer between strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Wild-type M. smegmatis grown under biofilm-inducing conditions formed a pellicle or film at the air-liquid interface 3 days post-inoculation that developed further into a reticulated biofilm (Fig. 1B). The mmpL11 mutant GP02 had delayed pellicle formation relative to wild-type M. smegmatis upon standing culture in borosilicate glass tubes. At later time points, the mmpL11 mutant defect in biofilm formation was seen as a reduced ability of the pellicle to attach and extend upwards along the glass tube (Fig. 1B, middle and lower). The defect in biofilm formation is better appreciated when cultured under biofilm-inducing conditions in polystyrene plates. The mmpL11 mutant GP02 formed a less textured, or reticulated, biofilm compared with wild-type and complemented strains (Fig. 1D). We also noted that the pellicle formed by the mmpL11 mutant was easily disturbed upon handling either the standing cultures in glass tubes or polystyrene plates. In contrast, the pellicle formed by wild-type or complemented strains remained intact. To ensure that reduced biofilm formation did not result from reduced bacterial numbers in the mutant biofilm cultures, biofilms were mechanically disrupted, and the number of bacteria were determined by plating serial dilutions. This enumeration, which included planktonic bacteria at the bottom of the culture tube and biofilm-associated bacteria, indicated that there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria present in each culture (Fig. 1C). Therefore, replication of the mmpL11 mutant is not impaired in 7H9 medium lacking Tween 80. The GP02/pVV16SM complemented mutant formed a robust biofilm that initiated sooner than compared with the wild type (Fig. 1B, upper). We believe that this phenotype likely resulted from our complementation strategy, in which mmpL11 is expressed constitutively from the hsp60 promoter of the pVV16 plasmid. Quantification of mmpL11 expression by quantititavie RT-PCR indicated that there was 8-fold more mmpL11 transcript in the GP02/pVV16SM complemented strain relative to wild-type M. smegmatis (mc2155/pVV16) (data not shown).

During genotoxic challenge, these factors can be influenced by secondary agents that facilitate the induction of apoptosis. Piceatannol is a natural metabolite of the stilbene resveratrol found in grapes and is converted from its parent compound by the enzyme CYP1BA1 p450. It has been hypothesized to exert specific effects against various cellular targets; however, its ability to influence CDDP resistance in cancer cells has not been investigated to date. Here, we show that piceatannol is a potent enhancer of CDDP sensitivity in OVCA, and this effect is achieved through the modulation of several major determinants of chemoresistance. Piceatannol enhances p53-mediated expression of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA, increases XIAP degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and enhances caspase-3 activation. This response is associated with an increase in Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, leading to more effective induction of apoptosis. In vivo studies using a mouse model of OVCA reveal that a number of these changes occur in association with a greater overall reduction in tumor weight when mice are treated with both piceatannol and CDDP, in comparison to treatment with either agent alone. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential application of piceatannol to enhance CDDP sensitivity in OVCA, and it acts on p53, XIAP, and mitochondrial fission."

Thus, a better understanding of the signaling and transcriptional networks that regulate the expression of genes important for mitochondrial biogenesis, fueling, and function may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with muscle bioenergetic defects.

Interestingly, PGC-1α and/or PGC-1β expression in muscle is decreased in states associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as diabetes, denervation, cancer cachexia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting that decreases in PGC-1 activity may contribute to the pathology of these states (21.Mootha V.K.

However, transgenic expression of PGC-1α can also promote pathophysiological changes in a tissue-, developmental stage-, and environment-dependent manner, leading to heart failure or skeletal muscle insulin resistance, and underlying the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms by which PGC-1α/β control muscle energy homeostasis pathways (28.Russell L.K.

PGC-1α and PGC-1β exert their regulatory functions by interacting with DNA-binding transcription factors, such as estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), nuclear respiratory factor 1, and GA-binding protein, and activating the expression of genes targeted by these factors (6.Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 coactivators, energy homeostasis, and metabolism.Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). ERRα and the related receptors ERRβ and ERRγ are orphan nuclear receptors that act both downstream and parallel to PGC-1 coactivators to control the expression of a broad set of genes important for energy homeostasis, including genes for mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function (30.Villena J.A.

Transcriptional control of energy homeostasis by the estrogen-related receptors.Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 677-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Genome-wide studies show that ERRα and ERRγ bind and regulate the same target genes, suggesting that they act in a redundant and/or complementary fashion (32.Dufour C.R. Wilson B.J. Huss J.M.

ERRγ-null mice also show defects in PGC-1-controlled pathways, such as cardiac oxidative capacity, and die shortly after birth (35.Alaynick W.A. Kondo R.P. Xie W. He W. Dufour C.R. Downes M.

The transcriptional programs induced by PGC-1α/β and ERRs include genes that encode components of cellular energy pathways (e.g. tricarboxylic acid cycle, OxPhos, and mitochondrial biogenesis genes) as well as genes that encode additional gene expression regulators, which act with or downstream of PGC-1/ERRs to amplify and/or specify the induced program. For example, PGC-1α acts with ERRα in myotubes to induce nuclear respiratory factor 1, GA-binding protein α chain, PPARα, and striated muscle activator of Rho signaling, each of which further contributes to the activation of subsets of PGC-1/ERR targets (39.Huss J.M.

To identify new regulators that may act in the PGC-1/ERR pathway and enable the execution of muscle energy programs, we searched for uncharacterized genes that are induced by PGC-1α in differentiated myotubes, are expressed selectively in muscle, and are required for the induction of PGC-1/ERR-regulated genes. We show here that PGC-1/ERR-induced regulator in muscle 1 (Perm1) is a muscle-specific gene that is induced by PGC-1α/β and ERRs and required for the expression of a subset of genes important for muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity. For the identification of PGC-1α-induced genes, C2C12 myotubes were infected on day 6 of differentiation with adenoviruses expressing LacZ (control) or PGC-1α at an m.o.i. of 50 and in triplicates. RNA was isolated 20 h later and profiled using Illumina MouseWG-6 v1.1 Expression Beadchip microarrays (48,318 probes). Raw data were normalized using Illumina software. Significantly differentially regulated genes were determined by one-way analysis of variance. Genes of unknown function that were strongly induced by PGC-1α were next screened in silico for tissue-specific expression patterns using BioGPS (44.Wu C. Macleod I. Su A.I.

The shPerm1 sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. All plasmids were sequenced to verify the sequence of inserts. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Confluent myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes by the addition of DMEM with 2% horse serum. For experiments using shRNA, myotubes were infected on day 4 after differentiation with adenoviruses expressing shRNAs (at an m.o.i. of 50) and on day 6 after differentiation with adenoviruses expressing LacZ (control), FLAG-PGC-1α, FLAG-PGC-1β, or FLAG-ERRγ (at an m.o.i. of 50) together with a second dose of shRNA-expressing adenoviruses (at an m.o.i. of 25).

https://openalex.org/W2026265784,"Mapping the yeast ABC transporter interactome suggests functional significance of transporter-transporter interactions and also shows function of some transporters in zinc homeostasis. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a ubiquitous class of integral membrane proteins of immense clinical interest because of their strong association with human disease and pharmacology. To improve our understanding of these proteins, we used membrane yeast two-hybrid technology to map the protein interactome of all of the nonmitochondrial ABC transporters in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and combined this data with previously reported yeast ABC transporter interactions in the BioGRID database to generate a comprehensive, integrated 'interactome'. We show that ABC transporters physically associate with proteins involved in an unexpectedly diverse range of functions. We specifically examine the importance of the physical interactions of ABC transporters in both the regulation of one another and in the modulation of proteins involved in zinc homeostasis. The interaction network presented here will be a powerful resource for increasing our fundamental understanding of the cellular role and regulation of ABC transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2162212603,"Lipotoxic stress-induced β-cell death (lipotoxicity) is recognized as a key contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current study reports a critical role of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in β-cell survival under lipotoxic conditions. In an attempt to investigate the role of SphK1 in lipotoxicity in vivo, we fed Sphk1–/– and wild-type (WT) mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow diet. Remarkably, while HFD-fed WT mice developed glucose intolerance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, all HFD-fed Sphk1–/– mice manifested evident diabetes, accompanied by a nearly 3-fold reduction in insulin levels compared with the WT mice. Pancreatic β-cell mass was increased by 140% in HFD-fed WT mice but decreased to 50% in HFD-fed Sphk1–/– mice, in comparison with the chow diet control groups, respectively. Accordingly, by blocking the enzyme activity, expression of a dominant negative form of SphK1 markedly promoted palmitate-induced cell death in MIN6 and INS-1 β-cell lines. Moreover, primary islets isolated from Sphk1–/– mice exhibited higher susceptibility to lipotoxicity than WT controls. Of note, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) profoundly abrogated lipotoxicity in β cells or the cells lacking SphK1 activity and Sphk1–/– islets, highlighting a pivotal role of S1P in β-cell survival under lipotoxic conditions. These findings could suggest a new therapeutic strategy for preventing β-cell death and thus the onset of T2DM.—Qi, Y., Chen, J., Lay, A., Don, A., Vadas, M., Xia, P., Loss of sphingosine kinase 1 predisposes to the onset of diabetes via promoting pancreatic β-cell death in diet-induced obese mice.

https://openalex.org/W2049761630,"The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contains a complete body map that mirrors the subcortical maps developed by peripheral sensory input projecting to the sensory hindbrain, the thalamus and then S1. Peripheral changes during development alter these maps through 'bottom-up' plasticity. Unknown is how S1 size influences map organization and whether an altered S1 map feeds back to affect subcortical maps. We show that the size of S1 in mice is significantly reduced by cortex-specific deletion of Pax6, resulting in a reduced body map and loss of body representations by an exclusion of later-differentiating sensory thalamocortical input. An initially normal sensory thalamus was repatterned to match the aberrant S1 map by apoptotic deletion of thalamic neurons representing body parts with axons excluded from S1. Deleted representations were rescued by altering competition between thalamocortical axons using sensory deprivation or increasing the size of S1. Thus, S1 size determined the resolution and completeness of body maps and engaged 'top-down' plasticity that repatterned the sensory thalamus to match S1."
https://openalex.org/W2093368037,"Demyelination and axonal damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) are thought to be a consequence of inflammatory processes that are perpetuated by activated glia and infiltrating leukocytes. Galectin-9 is a β-galactoside binding lectin capable of modulating immune responses and appears to be up-regulated in MS. However, its role in the pathogenesis of MS has yet to be determined. Here, we report that proinflammatory cytokines induce galectin-9 (Gal-9) expression in primary astrocytes and the mechanism by which TNF up-regulates Gal-9. Astrocytes did not express Gal-9 under basal conditions nor did IL-6, IL-10, or IL-13 trigger Gal-9 expression. In contrast, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and particularly TNF up-regulated Gal-9 in astrocytes. TNF-induced Gal-9 expression was dependent on TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) as TNF failed to induce Gal-9 in TNFR1(-/-) astrocytes. Blockade of the JNK MAP kinase pathway with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abrogated TNF-induced Gal-9, whereas p38 and MEK inhibitors had minimal effects. Furthermore, specific knockdown of c-Jun via siRNA in astrocytes before TNF treatment greatly suppressed Gal-9 transcription, suggesting that TNF induces astroglial Gal-9 through the TNF/TNFR1/JNK/cJun signaling pathway. Finally, utilizing astrocytes from Lgals9 mutant (Gal-9(-/-)) mice as well as a myelin basic protein-specific Tim-3(+) encephalitogenic T-cell clone (LCN-8), we found that conditioned medium from TNF-stimulated Gal-9(+/+) but not Gal-9(-/-) astrocytes increased the percentage of apoptotic encephalitogenic T-cells. Together, our results suggest that Gal-9 is induced in astrocytes by TNF via the JNK/c-Jun pathway and that astrocyte-derived Gal-9 may function as an immunoregulatory protein in response to ongoing neuroinflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2138045219,"Cholesterol can be converted to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24SOHC) by neuronal cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing 24SOHC levels reduced AD pathology. However, mechanisms underlying the effects of 24SOHC on amyloid-β (Aβ) production have remained unclear. Here we report that 24SOHC treatment reduces Aβ production and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident immature amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and CHO cells stably expressing human APP. Treatment with 1-10 μM 24SOHC (equivalent to the concentrations detected in human brain homogenates) diminished Aβ production (IC50=4.6 μM for Aβ40) without affecting secretase activities. To evaluate the intracellular APP transport, we established an in vitro vesicle formation assay. We found that APP budding via COPII vesicles was diminished by 70% in 24SOHC-treated cells. The proteomics and immunoblotting analysis revealed that 24SOHC induced the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an ER chaperone, through unfolded protein response pathways, and enhanced the formation of the APP/GRP78 complex. Knockdown of GRP78 diminished the inhibitory effects of 24SOHC on Aβ production. These results suggest that 24SOHC down-regulates APP trafficking via enhancement of the complex formation of APP with up-regulated GRP78 in the ER, resulting in suppression of Aβ production.—Urano, Y., Ochiai, S., Noguchi, N., Suppression of amyloid-β production by 24S-hydroxycholesterovia inhibition of intracellular amyloid precursor protein trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W1595618914,"Cytochrome P450c17, a steroidogenic enzyme encoded by the CYP17A1 gene, catalyzes the steroid 17α-hydroxylation needed for glucocorticoid synthesis, which may or may not be followed by 17,20 lyase activity needed for sex steroid synthesis. Whether or not P450c17 catalyzes 17,20 lyase activity is determined by three post-translational mechanisms influencing availability of reducing equivalents donated by P450 oxidoreductase (POR). These are increased amounts of POR, the allosteric action of cytochrome b5 to promote POR-P450c17 interaction, and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of P450c17, which also appears to promote POR-P450c17 interaction. The kinase(s) that phosphorylates P450c17 is unknown. In a series of kinase inhibition experiments, the pyridinyl imidazole drugs SB202190 and SB203580 inhibited 17,20 lyase but not 17α-hydroxylase activity in human adrenocortical HCI-H295A cells, suggesting an action on p38α or p38β. Co-transfection of non-steroidogenic COS-1 cells with P450c17 and p38 expression vectors showed that p38α, but not p38β, conferred 17,20 lyase activity on P450c17. Antiserum to P450c17 co-immunoprecipitated P450c17 and both p38 isoforms; however, knockdown of p38α, but not knockdown of p38β, inhibited 17,20 lyase activity in NCI-H295A cells. Bacterially expressed human P450c17 was phosphorylated by p38α in vitro at a non-canonical site, conferring increased 17,20 lyase activity. This phosphorylation increased the maximum velocity, but not the Michaelis constant, of the 17,20 lyase reaction. p38α phosphorylates P450c17 in a fashion that confers increased 17,20 lyase activity, implying that the production of adrenal androgens (adrenarche) is a regulated event."

Here we show that the HSR is not activated by mutant huntingtin (HTT) even in cells selected for the highest expression levels and for the presence of inclusion bodies containing aggregated protein. Surprisingly, HSR activation by HSF1 overexpression or by administration of a small molecule activator lowers the concentration threshold at which HTT forms inclusion bodies in cells expressing aggregation-prone, polyglutamine-expanded fragments of HTT. These data suggest that the HSR does not mitigate inclusion body formation."

https://openalex.org/W2095372185,"T cells use the αβ T cell receptor (TCR) to recognize antigenic peptides presented by class I major histocompatibility complex proteins (pMHCs) on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells. Flexibility in both TCRs and peptides plays an important role in antigen recognition and discrimination. Less clear is the role of flexibility in the MHC protein; although recent observations have indicated that mobility in the MHC can impact TCR recognition in a peptide-dependent fashion, the extent of this behavior is unknown. Here, using hydrogen/deuterium exchange, fluorescence anisotropy, and structural analyses, we show that the flexibility of the peptide binding groove of the class I MHC protein HLA-A*0201 varies significantly with different peptides. The variations extend throughout the binding groove, impacting regions contacted by TCRs as well as other activating and inhibitory receptors of the immune system. Our results are consistent with statistical mechanical models of protein structure and dynamics, in which the binding of different peptides alters the populations and exchange kinetics of substates in the MHC conformational ensemble. Altered MHC flexibility will influence receptor engagement, impacting conformational adaptations, entropic penalties associated with receptor recognition, and the populations of binding-competent states. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized aspect of the ""altered self"" mechanism of immune recognition and have implications for specificity, cross-reactivity, and antigenicity in cellular immunity."

In the present study, we examined the role of LCN2 in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain using a mouse model of spared nerve injury (SNI). Lcn2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord after SNI, and LCN2 protein was mainly localized in neurons of the dorsal and ventral horns. LCN2 receptor 24p3R was expressed in spinal neurons and microglia after SNI. Lcn2-deficient mice exhibited significantly less mechanical pain hypersensitivity during the early phase after SNI, and an intrathecal injection of recombinant LCN2 protein elicited mechanical pain hypersensitivity in naive animals. Lcn2 deficiency, however, did not affect acute nociceptive pain. Lcn2-deficient mice showed significantly less microglial activation and proalgesic chemokine (CCL2 and CXCL1) production in the spinal cord after SNI than wild-type mice, and recombinant LCN2 protein induced the expression of these chemokines in cultured neurons. Furthermore, the expression of LCN2 and its receptor was detected in neutrophils and macrophages in the sciatic nerve following SNI, suggesting the potential role of peripheral LCN2 in neuropathic pain. Taken together, our results indicate that LCN2 plays a critical role in the development of pain hypersensitivity following peripheral nerve injury and suggest that LCN2 mediates neuropathic pain by inducing chemokine expression and subsequent microglial activation."

However, a few aspects of this model are unclear. The N-terminal domains of syntaxins (Habc domains) and some VAMPs (e.g. longin domains) are not accounted for. Furthermore, Marz et al. (17.Marz K.E.

Here, we performed comparative studies of binding constants and disassembly kinetics of four different physiological ternary SNARE complexes and one binary (t-SNARE) complex with NSF and α-SNAP. We found that the disassembly kinetics and binding properties are conserved for the four SNARE complexes and the binary complex and that α-SNAP and the SNARE complex initially interact with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We propose a conserved SNARE complex disassembly mechanism in which one α-SNAP binds the SNARE complex at any given time, with subsequent α-SNAP binding events possibly occurring during the disassembly process. All DNAs used in this study encode rat proteins except NSF, which is from Chinese hamster. The recombinant expression of NSF and α-SNAP and the coexpression (Escherichia coli) of VAMP2(1–96) (simply referred to as VAMP2), syntaxin1A(1–265)-C145S/S249C/K253C (simply referred to as syntaxin1), syntaxin1A(191–265)-C145S/S249C/K253C (simply referred to as ΔNsyntaxin1), and SNAP25A (simply referred to as SNAP25) were performed as described (19.Cipriano D.J. Jung J. Vivona S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Bryant Z. Processive ATP-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes by the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) molecular machine.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23436-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For coexpression of VAMP7 and VAMP8 with their corresponding SNAREs, the DNAs encoding VAMP7(1–190)-C21S/C56V (simply referred to as VAMP7), VAMP7(119–190) (simply referred to as ΔNVAMP7), and VAMP8(1–76)-I76C (simply referred to as VAMP8) were fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and cloned (NcoI/BamHI) in the pACYCDuet vector (Novagen) from commercially available, full-length open reading frames (GeneArt, Invitrogen) using standard PCR-based techniques. The tag-free syntaxin4A(1–274)-C141S/E257C/I261C (simply referred to as syntaxin4) and SNAP23 constructs were cloned into the first cloning site (BamHI/SalI) and the second cloning site (NdeI/XhoI) of the pETDuet vector (Novagen), respectively. Coexpression of the corresponding SNARE complexes (i.e. VAMP7-syntaxin1-SNAP25, VAMP7-syntaxin4-SNAP23, VAMP8-syntaxin4-SNAP23) was performed by transforming one pACYCDuet vector with the respective pETDuet vectors into competent cells. Expression of the syntaxin1-SNAP25 binary complex was achieved by transforming competent cells with one pACYCDuet vector containing syntaxin1A(1–265)-C145S/S249C/K253C and SNAP25A (cloned into NcoI/SalI and NdeI/XhoI, respectively). Disassembly of the VAMP7-syntaxin1-SNAP25 SNARE complex fused to either an N-terminal or a C-terminal His6 tag was compared to rule out a possible effect of the His6 tag on the disassembly reaction (data not shown). NSF was expressed and purified as described (19.Cipriano D.J. Jung J. Vivona S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Bryant Z.

All other recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) at an absorbance of 0.6 by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The four different ternary SNARE complexes and the syntaxin1-SNAP25 binary complex were coexpressed for 12 h at 25 °C, whereas α-SNAP was expressed for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication after 30 min of incubation in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 μg/ml DNase, and protease inhibitors. Crude lysates were centrifuged for 40 min at 48,400 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer A with 30 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; 50 column volumes). Beads loaded with α-SNAP-His6 were eluted with buffer A, 300 mm imidazole, and 0.1 mm TCEP (5 column volumes), whereas beads loaded with the SNARE complex were further washed (50 volume columns) and resuspended (1 volume column) in labeling buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm TCEP) for on-bead labeling with Oregon Green 488 (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 23 °C, washed again to remove excess dye, and finally eluted in buffer A with 300 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm TCEP (3 column volumes). The same protocol was used to biotinylate the VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25 SNARE complex through use of maleimide-PEG2-biotin (Thermo Scientific). The His6 tag was removed from α-SNAP with tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) by overnight dialysis (3500 nominal molecular weight cutoff, Pierce) at 4 °C. Cell pellets overexpressing the syntaxin1-SNAP25 binary complex were lysed by sonication after 30 min of incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 μg/ml DNase, and protease inhibitors. Crude lysates were centrifuged for 40 min at 48,400 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Mono Q 10/100 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 0–100% gradient of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP implemented over 20 column volumes. The binary complex dissociated from the column at ∼750 mm NaCl and was then gel-filtered in degassed labeling buffer to perform in-solution labeling with Oregon Green 488 dye for 15 min at 23 °C. Excess dye was removed by dialysis for 3 h at 23 °C (10 nominal molecular weight cutoff, Pierce). All protein preparations were finally purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm TCEP. The progress and quality of the purification process were monitored by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, and multiangle light scattering (MALS). NSF ATPase activity was measured using a microplate photometric assay coupled with the conversion of NADH (measuring absorbance at 340 nm) into NAD+ through pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. All experiments were conducted simultaneously on a 96-well plate (150-μl samples, 0.5-cm path length) at 37 °C using a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). 20 nm NSF was added to 200 nm SNARE complex and 2 μm α-SNAP in disassembly buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2). The rates of NSF-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes were measured using the fluorescence dequenching method described previously (19.Cipriano D.J. Jung J. Vivona S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Bryant Z. Processive ATP-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes by the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) molecular machine.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23436-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Disassembly rates as a function of SNARE complex concentration were measured on a 384-well plate using a temperature-controlled FlexStation 3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). After base-line recording, 1.5 nm NSF was added to 30, 60, 100, 150, and 210 nm SNARE complex and a 12-fold α-SNAP-SNARE complex molar excess in disassembly buffer. Disassembly rates as a function of α-SNAP concentration were measured on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer (four ternary SNARE complexes) and on a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (binary SNARE complex). After base-line recording, 22 nm NSF was added to 220 nm SNARE complex and 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.8, 1.7, 3.3, and 7.5 μm α-SNAP. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with MALS (SEC-MALS) was performed by injecting 200 μl of the following samples onto a WTC-030S5 column (Wyatt Technology) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min: (i) 30 μm ΔNVAMP7-ΔNsyntaxin1-SNAP25, (ii) 30 μm α-SNAP, (iii) 30 μm ΔNVAMP7-ΔNsyntaxin1-SNAP25 and 30 μm α-SNAP, (iv) 30 μm ΔNVAMP7-ΔNsyntaxin1-SNAP25 and 90 μm α-SNAP, and (v) 30 μm VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25 and 90 μm α-SNAP. Measurements were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm TCEP. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm (Jasco UV-975 UV-visible system), light scattering at 658 nm (HELEOS system, Wyatt Technology), and differential refractometry (Optilab system, Wyatt Technology). Data analyses were carried out using ASTRA 6.0 software (Wyatt Technology). A differential refractive index increment (dn/dc) value of 0.185 was used in all calculations. Analyses were conducted at 30 °C on an Octet RED system (FortéBio) using 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.002% Tween 20. Streptavidin-coated tips were loaded over 200 s in 80 nm SNARE complex (VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25) containing biotinylated cysteines with a capture level of ∼2.1 ± 0.2 nm within a row of eight tips. To monitor 7 S complex formation as a function of α-SNAP concentration, SNARE complex-loaded tips were dipped into an α-SNAP dilution series (0, 0.094, 0.188, 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3, and 6 μm) and allowed to associate for 100 s. Dissociation (100 s) was performed in buffer. A reference plate with no ligands was used to subtract unspecific binding. To compare the kinetics of NSF-driven disassembly of SNARE variants, we selected four different physiological SNARE complexes with differences in both primary sequence and domain architecture (Fig. 1A). VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25 (VAMP2 is also referred to as synaptobrevin-2) is the neuronal SNARE complex involved in neurotransmitter release (2.Südhof T.C. Rothman J.E. Membrane fusion: grappling with SNARE and SM proteins.Science. 2009; 323: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). VAMP7-syntaxin1-SNAP25 forms at the neuronal plasma membrane, where VAMP7 sustains axon outgrowth through transport of the cell adhesion molecule L1 (20.Alberts P. Rudge R. Hinners I. Muzerelle A.

VAMP7-syntaxin4-SNAP23 participates in synaptotagmin VII-regulated lysosomal exocytosis in fibroblasts (23.Rao S.K. Huynh C. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Galli T. Andrews N.W. Identification of SNAREs involved in synaptotagmin VII-regulated lysosomal exocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20471-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). VAMP8-syntaxin4-SNAP23 is involved in cytokine/chemokine trafficking by segregating lysosomal secretory granules in mast cells (24.Tiwari M. Hemalatha T. Ganesan K. Nayeem M. Murali Manohar B.

Cell. Biochem. 2008; 312: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These four different ternary SNARE complexes allowed us to test if NSF-driven disassembly is influenced by primary sequence variation of the SNARE core domains and by differences in the N-terminal domains (i.e. VAMP2 versus VAMP7). The four selected ternary SNARE complexes (Fig. 1A) were coexpressed, purified, and labeled as described previously (19.Cipriano D.J. Jung J. Vivona S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Bryant Z. Processive ATP-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes by the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) molecular machine.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23436-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proper folding, thermal stability, and oligomeric state were assessed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 1, B and C) and SEC-MALS (Fig. 1D). We measured the stimulation of NSF ATPase activity by the four different ternary SNARE complexes. All four complexes similarly stimulated the steady-state rate of NSF-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis activity (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the stimulation of ATPase activity is independent of SNARE primary sequence variation and N-terminal domain architecture. We next investigated whether the similarity of ATPase activity stimulation would be reflected in the kinetics of the SNARE complex disassembly itself for the four ternary SNARE complexes. We studied the steady-state kinetics of NSF-driven disassembly of the four SNARE complexes by measuring the initial disassembly rates as a function of SNARE complex concentration (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1A) and fitted them to a first-order Michaelis-Menten equation (y = kcat·x/(Km + x)). We obtained statistically similar Km values, ranging from 17 to 45 nm (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1), implying similar apparent specificity of NSF for the four SNARE complexes. However, we found small differences between the kcat of the two complexes containing the t-SNAREs syntaxin1 and SNAP25 and that of the two containing the t-SNAREs syntaxin4 and SNAP23 (Fig. 2B). To test the requirement for α-SNAP in the disassembly of the four complexes, we also measured the initial disassembly rates as a function of α-SNAP concentration (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1B). The resulting plots were fitted with a simple first-order Michaelis-Menten equation (y = kcat·x/(Km + x)) and yielded Km values that are statistically similar across different SNARE complexes and consistent with the K0.5 values reported by Lauer et al. (25.Lauer J.M. Dalal S. Marz K.E. Nonet M.L. Hanson P.I. SNARE complex zero layer residues are not critical for N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-mediated disassembly.J. Biol.

In analogy to Fig. 2B, there is a small difference between the kcat observed for the two complexes containing syntaxin4-SNAP23 and that observed for the two complexes containing syntaxin1-SNAP25. Previous reports have shown qualitatively that α-SNAP can interact with isolated t-SNAREs, but not with isolated VAMPs (26.Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R.

Reconstitution of the vital functions of Munc18 and Munc13 in neurotransmitter release.Science. 2013; 339: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To quantitate these early findings, we compared the disassembly kinetics of binary (i.e. VAMP-free) and ternary complexes (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1B). This analysis yielded kinetic values that are statistically similar to those of the corresponding VAMP2/VAMP7-syntaxin1-SNAP25 ternary complexes (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the data presented in Fig. 2 suggest that NSF disassembles both ternary and binary SNARE complexes through a conserved mechanism, with a small dependence on the composition of the t-SNARE part of the SNARE complex. We hypothesized that our results could be explained by a conserved interaction between the adaptor protein α-SNAP and the SNARE complex. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the observation that the fluorescence quantum yield of complexes labeled at their C termini with Oregon Green is sensitive to α-SNAP binding (supplemental Fig. S2), likely due to the change of chemical environment sensed by the fluorophores upon interaction with α-SNAP. Measuring the change in Oregon Green fluorescence intensity as a function of α-SNAP concentration and fitting the resulting titration curves with a simple first-order binding model (y = Fmax·x/(KD + x)) yielded no significant differences among dissociation constants (KD) (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2), supporting an overall common mode of binding of α-SNAP to all SNARE complexes, in agreement with the similar steady-state kinetics of the disassembly reaction (Fig. 2). This effect is α-SNAP-specific, as no change is seen with BSA (supplemental Fig. S2). It is also in agreement with previous reports suggesting that α-SNAP binds to the C terminus of the SNARE complex (17.Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I.

Chem. 2009; 284: 31817-31826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To validate these results, we studied the α-SNAP-SNARE complex interaction using biolayer interferometry. Biotinylated SNARE complex (VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25) was loaded onto streptavidin sensors and then dipped into α-SNAP solution at different concentrations (Fig. 3B). Complete dissociation was achieved upon buffer exchange. The experiment consisted of three replicates globally fit together with a simple 1:1 model to extract the kinetic parameters. The KD obtained with this analysis (i.e. 1.5 μm) agrees within ∼3-fold with the highest value allowed with our fluorescence-based binding constant (0.47 μm), a relatively small difference considering the differences in techniques. Our fluorescence and biolayer interferometry data of α-SNAP binding to the four different SNARE complexes can be explained with a simple 1:1 binding model. However, more complicated models with multiple binding events could be possible as well. To determine the stoichiometry, we incubated α-SNAP and the core of the VAMP7-syntaxin1-SNAP25 SNARE complex (without the N-terminal domains; 30 μm each, corresponding to a saturating concentration), and we measured the molecular mass of the resulting complex by SEC-MALS. The mixture of α-SNAP and ΔNVAMP7-ΔNsyntaxin1-SNAP25 eluted as a single species with a molecular mass of 74.0 ± 3.1 kDa, which agrees well with a 1:1 complex (Fig. 3C). We then repeated the experiment with a 3-fold molar excess of α-SNAP (30 μm ΔNVAMP7-ΔNsyntaxin1-SNAP25 and 90 μm α-SNAP) and found that the excess of α-SNAP did not alter the stoichiometry of the complex of α-SNAP with ΔNVAMP7-ΔNsyntaxin1-SNAP25 and that the excess α-SNAP eluted later as monomeric isolated species (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained for the VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25 complex (Fig. 3C). Taken together, our SEC-MALS results suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry for the complex between α-SNAP and the ternary SNARE complex. Our kinetic and binding data suggest a conserved mechanism for NSF-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes, mediated by a conserved interaction between α-SNAP and both binary and ternary SNARE complexes. These common features may arise from a conserved electrostatic potential surface of the SNARE complex, based on the observation that the SNARE complex interacts with α-SNAP mostly through its acidic residues (17.Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. Defining the SNARE complex binding surface of α-SNAP. Implications for SNARE complex disassembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, modeling the SNARE core bundles of VAMP7-syntaxin1-SNAP25, VAMP7-syntaxin4-SNAP23, and VAMP8-syntaxin4-SNAP23 based on the crystal structure of the neuronal SNARE complex (VAMP2-syntaxin1-SNAP25; Protein Data Bank Code 1SFC (4.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Crystal structure of a SNARE complex involved in synaptic exocytosis at 2.4 Å resolution.Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar)) revealed a conserved electrostatic potential surface distribution (Fig. 4), suggesting that α-SNAP recognizes different SNARE complexes via conserved features of their electrostatic potential surfaces. The ATPase NSF and its adaptor protein α-SNAP recognize and disassemble SNARE complexes in a promiscuous manner. The SNARE core domains show only limited amino acid sequence identity (for example, 33% identity between VAMP2 and VAMP7) (Fig. 1A), and the N-terminal domains can be quite different (Fig. 1A). The question arises at to how such promiscuous recognition is mediated in molecular detail. Moreover, the architecture of the 20S complex and the location of the SNARE N-terminal domains remain unclear, even in the recent low-resolution EM reconstruction (18.Chang L.F. Chen S. Liu C.C. Pan X. Jiang J. Bai X.C. Xie X. Wang H.W. Sui S.F. Structural characterization of full-length NSF and 20S particles.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the NSF molecular mechanism focused on the neuronal SNARE complex formed by VAMP2, syntaxin1, and SNAP25, so the possible effects of SNARE sequence variations and SNARE N-terminal domains on the disassembly had not been considered (25.Lauer J.M. Dalal S. Marz K.E. Nonet M.L. Hanson P.I. SNARE complex zero layer residues are not critical for N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-mediated disassembly.J. Biol.

Disassembly of membrane-associated NSF 20S complexes is slow relative to vesicle fusion and is Ca2+-independent.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study thus goes beyond this previous body of work by measuring the disassembly kinetics of four selected ternary SNARE complexes with both sequence and N-terminal domain variations. We found that NSF disassembles the selected four ternary SNARE complexes with similar rates and affinities (Fig. 2), suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism that is not influenced by the presence and type of SNARE N-terminal domains. Our disassembly kinetics data revealed statistically similar Km values (Fig. 2B) and α-SNAP dependence for the disassembly of the different SNARE complexes (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the disassembly kinetics for the binary neuronal complex (t-SNAREs syntaxin1 and SNAP25) was similar to that for the corresponding ternary complexes (Fig. 2C). Consistent with previous observations (27.Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H.

In particular, α-SNAP interacts with all four ternary SNARE complexes with statistically similar equilibrium dissociation constants (KD = 0.2–0.6 μm) (Fig. 3A) and produces similar Km values as observed by steady-state kinetics (Fig. 2C). Moreover, using SEC-MALS, we found that α-SNAP and the SNARE complex interact with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 3B). Our fluorescence, biolayer interferometry, and SEC-MALS data (Fig. 3) collectively point to an initial 1:1 α-SNAP-SNARE complex. It is possible that the affinity of this interaction in vivo could be different from what we observed in solution, as the capability of α-SNAP to bind membranes may favor the encounter with the SNARE complex (32.Winter U. Chen X. Fasshauer D. A conserved membrane attachment site in α-SNAP facilitates N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)-driven SNARE complex disassembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31817-31826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis studies suggested that a mostly basic face of α-SNAP binds to the ternary neuronal SNARE complex (17.Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. Defining the SNARE complex binding surface of α-SNAP. Implications for SNARE complex disassembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the basis of this and conservation of the electrostatic potential surface among the four different SNARE complexes (Fig. 4), we speculate that one α-SNAP likely binds the four different ternary SNARE complexes through a negative electrostatic pattern produced by a conserved motif involving the t-SNARE components of the SNARE complexes. This reasoning is based on our observation that the disassembly kinetics of the binary (t-SNARE) complex is similar to that of the ternary SNARE complex. Quantitation of the components of the 20S particle using a cross-linking approach suggested the presence of three α-SNAP molecules (16.Wimmer C. Hohl T.M. Hughes C.A. Müller S.A. Söllner T.H. Engel A. Rothman J.E. Molecular mass, stoichiometry, and assembly of 20 S particles.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29091-29097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another study suggested a 3:1 molar ratio based on gel densitometry of fluorescently labeled α-SNAP and SNAP25, although the authors considered the analysis to be semiquantitative due to variability in protein labeling efficiency (17.Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. Defining the SNARE complex binding surface of α-SNAP. Implications for SNARE complex disassembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recent low-resolution reconstruction of the 20S particle from electron microscopy data also suggested the presence of three α-SNAP molecules (18.Chang L.F. Chen S. Liu C.C. Pan X. Jiang J. Bai X.C. Xie X. Wang H.W. Sui S.F. Structural characterization of full-length NSF and 20S particles.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding of three α-SNAPs to one ternary SNARE complex would require α-SNAP to interact with three different binding sites on the SNARE complex, considering the absence of apparent 3-fold symmetry in the electrostatic potential surface of the SNARE core bundle (Fig. 4). Because we observed only one binding site between α-SNAP and the SNARE complex in our SEC-MALS experiments even at saturating conditions, any additional binding sites would have to be of much weaker affinity. Our data suggest a model (Fig. 5) in which one α-SNAP molecule binds the t-SNARE components of the ternary SNARE complex with medium affinity (KD = 0.3–1.5 μm). NSF binds the α-SNAP-SNARE complex with high affinity in an arrangement that is not influenced by the VAMP and syntaxin N-terminal domains. The processive mechanism of ATP-driven disassembly by NSF is then initiated (19.Cipriano D.J. Jung J. Vivona S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Bryant Z. Processive ATP-driven disassembly of SNARE complexes by the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) molecular machine.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23436-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At this stage or during the processive disassembly, additional α-SNAP molecules may be recruited. It is possible that two of three putative α-SNAP molecules in the 20S complex do not concurrently contact the SNARE complex. The low resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction of the 20S complex would allow this possibility (18.Chang L.F. Chen S. Liu C.C. Pan X. Jiang J. Bai X.C. Xie X. Wang H.W. Sui S.F. Structural characterization of full-length NSF and 20S particles.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). If this were the case, subsequent binding and unbinding events of α-SNAP molecules with the SNARE complex could be an important part of the processive disassembly mechanism by NSF.

To understand the molecular basis for this heterogeneity, the HDL particles produced by apoA-I-mediated solubilization of phospholipid (PL)/free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) bilayer membranes in cell and cell-free systems are compared. Incubation of apoA-I with ATP binding cassette transporter A1-expressing baby hamster kidney cells leads to formation of two populations of FC-containing discoidal nascent HDL particles.

In plant cells, light can induce de novo formation of nuclear bodies called photobodies (PBs) composed of the photosensory pigments, phytochrome (PHY) or cryptochrome (CRY). The mechanisms of formation, the exact compositions, and the functions of plant PBs are not known. Here, we have expressed Arabidopsis CRY2 (AtCRY2) in mammalian cells and analyzed its fate after blue light exposure to understand the requirements for PB formation, the functions of PBs, and their potential use in cell biology. We found that light efficiently induces AtCRY2-PB formation in mammalian cells, indicating that, other than AtCRY2, no plant-specific proteins or nucleic acids are required for AtCRY2-PB formation. Irradiation of AtCRY2 led to its degradation; however, degradation was not dependent upon photobody formation. Furthermore, we found that AtCRY2 photobody formation is associated with light-stimulated interaction with mammalian COP1 E3 ligase. Finally, we demonstrate that by fusing AtCRY2 to the TopBP1 DNA damage checkpoint protein, light-induced AtCRY2 PBs can be used to activate DNA damage signaling pathway in the absence of DNA damage.Background: AtCRY2 forms photobodies in plants.Results: AtCRY2 forms photobodies in human cells.

https://openalex.org/W2028916192,"GATA and Friend of GATA (FOG) form a transcriptional complex that plays a key role in cardiovascular development in both fish and mammals. In the present study we demonstrate that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Atonal homolog 8 (Atoh8) is required for development of the heart in fish but not in mice. Genetic studies reveal that Atoh8 interacts specifically with Gata4 and Fog1 during development of the heart and swim bladder in the fish. Biochemical studies reveal that ATOH8, GATA4, and FOG2 associate in a single complex in vitro. In contrast to fish, ATOH8-deficient mice exhibit normal cardiac development and loss of ATOH8 does not alter cardiac development in Gata4(+/-) mice. This species difference in the role of ATOH8 is explained in part by LacZ and GFP reporter alleles that reveal restriction of Atoh8 expression to atrial but not ventricular myocardium in the mouse. Our findings identify ATOH8 as a novel regulator of GATA-FOG function that is required for cardiac development in the fish but not the mouse. Whether ATOH8 modulates GATA-FOG function at other sites or in more subtle ways in mammals is not yet known."
https://openalex.org/W2088926707,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (DIs) are promising drugs for the treatment of several pathologies including ischemic and failing heart where they demonstrated efficacy. However, adverse side effects and cardiotoxicity have also been reported. Remarkably, no information is available about the effect of DIs during tissue regeneration following acute peripheral ischemia. In this study, mice made ischemic by femoral artery excision were injected with the DIs MS275 and MC1568, selective for class I and IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively. In untreated mice, soon after damage, class IIa HDAC phosphorylation and nuclear export occurred, paralleled by dystrophin and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) down-regulation and decreased protein phosphatase 2A activity. Between 14 and 21 days after ischemia, dystrophin and nNOS levels recovered, and class IIa HDACs relocalized to the nucleus. In this condition, the MC1568 compound increased the number of newly formed muscle fibers but delayed their terminal differentiation, whereas MS275 abolished the early onset of the regeneration process determining atrophy and fibrosis. The selective DIs had differential effects on the vascular compartment: MC1568 increased arteriogenesis whereas MS275 inhibited it. Capillarogenesis did not change. Chromatin immunoprecipitations revealed that class IIa HDAC complexes bind promoters of proliferation-associated genes and of class I HDAC1 and 2, highlighting a hierarchical control between class II and I HDACs during tissue regeneration. Our findings indicate that class-selective DIs interfere with normal mouse ischemic hindlimb regeneration and suggest that their use could be limited by alteration of the regeneration process in peripheral ischemic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2081953381,"In animal cells, nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are associated with the three auxiliary proteins p18, p38, and p43 to form a stable and conserved large multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MARS), whose molecular mass has been proposed to be between 1.0 and 1.5 MDa. The complex acts as a molecular hub for coordinating protein synthesis and diverse regulatory signal pathways. Electron microscopy studies defined its low resolution molecular envelope as an overall rather compact, asymmetric triangular shape.

Our data reveal that the MARS exhibits a much more elongated and multi-armed shape than expected from previous reports. The hydrodynamic and structural features of the MARS are large compared with other supramolecular assemblies involved in translation, including ribosome.

Significance: This type of structural organization provides new insights to understand the structure-function relationship and spatiotemporal regulation of the activity of its multiple components. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential enzymes for genetic code decoding. They activate amino acids and transfer them on cognate tRNAs (1.Ibba M. Soll D. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Because the establishment of a univocal link between an amino acid and the nucleotide triplet present on the anticodon loop of the tRNA molecule is essential for the fidelity of translation, the process of tRNA aminoacylation has been extensively studied in the past 30 years. These enzymes are generally monomers (α), homodimers (α2), or tetramers (α4 or α2β2), and the three-dimensional structure of at least one member of each component of this family of 20 enzymes has been determined from bacteria, archaea, or lower eukaryotes. However, our knowledge of the structural arrangement of these enzymes in higher eukaryotes remains essentially unknown at the atomic level due to their organization into large supramolecular assemblies, which represents a challenge for high resolution structural studies. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from animal cells display several distinctive features (2.Guo M. Schimmel P. Yang X.L. Functional expansion of human tRNA synthetases achieved by structural inventions.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3.Mirande M. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 298-308Google Scholar). First, polypeptide extensions are generally appended to the N- or C-terminal extremity of their bacterial-like core enzyme. There are tRNA binding domains (tRBD) 4The abbreviations used are: tRBD, tRNA binding domain; MARS, multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; SAXS, small-angle x-ray scattering; SEC-MALLS, size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering; Rh, hydrodynamic radius; DLS, dynamic light scattering; Rg, radius of gyration; Dmax, maximal diameter. that strengthen tRNA-enzyme interactions (4.Mirande M. Processivity of translation in the eukaryote cell. Role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), or PBD (protein binding domains) involved in protein-protein associations (5.Mirande M. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Structural domains and their implications.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Second, examples of fused synthetases have been described, such as in the case of GluProRS where a long polypeptide of 1512 amino acid residues results from the fusion between bona fide GluRS and ProRS. Third, some of these enzymes are gathered within supramolecular assemblies. The emergence of stable multiprotein assemblies amenable to structural characterization has been essentially described in the bilaterian phylum of metazoans. The largest supramolecular complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases described so far is the MARS complex (multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex) containing the nine enzymes ArgRS, AspRS, GlnRS, GluRS, IleRS, LeuRS, LysRS, MetRS, and ProRS and the three nonsynthetase components p18, p38, and p43 (3.Mirande M.

In addition to its essential role in translation, MARS acts as a reservoir for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases where, in response to cellular changes, synthetases are subsequently released from the complex to participate in non-canonical tasks (9.Ray P.S. Arif A. Fox P.L. Macromolecular complexes as depots for releasable regulatory proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

Although these data shed some light on the structural organization of individual components of MARS, the detailed architecture of the whole particle is not yet deciphered. A structural working model of the particle has been proposed based on electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions. These studies revealed an asymmetric three-domain Y-shaped arrangement of proteins showing large external dimensions ranging from 25 × 30 × 23 nm (26.Norcum M.T.

To gain more insight into the functioning of the synthetases associated within supramolecular assemblies, it is necessary to get a deeper understanding of their structural organization. In this study we purified the native complex from rabbit liver, analyzed the structural homogeneity of the enzyme preparation, and characterized its overall size and shape at low resolution by hydrodynamic methods and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) in solution. Our data reveal that the MARS complex has a much more elongated shape than expected from previous reports and displays the largest maximum particle size for a stable supramolecular assembly involved in translation, including the ribosome. Livers (600 g) from 8 rabbits were recovered immediately after sacrifice of the animals and homogenized in a Waring blender (2 × 15 s) after the addition (1 ml/g) of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (10 mm PMSF, 10 mm benzamidine). Extract was cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min and further subjected to high speed centrifugation at 230,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant (500 ml) was applied on a 5600 ml (9 × 88 cm) Sephacryl S-400 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A (85 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and developed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions eluted between 2820 and 3600 ml were directly applied on a 170-ml (5 × 8.6 cm) tRNA-Sepharose column developed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. After washing with buffer A, the complex was eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer (85–300 mm). After a 2.5-fold dilution with a solution containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol, fractions were applied on a 4.6-ml Source 15Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer AQ (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) and developed at 2 ml/min with a linear gradient of KCl from 80 to 200 mm. Fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration on Vivaspin 50,000. Protein concentration was determined by using a calculated absorption coefficient of 0.931 A280 units·mg−1·cm2. The apparent native molecular mass of MARS was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaeptoethanol, and developed at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. All samples (50 μg of protein) were loaded in 0.2 ml. The calibration curve was established by using cytochrome c, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, and thyroglobulin as marker proteins. For a particular protein, its elution was described in term of the corresponding Kav value. Kav = (Ve − V0)/(Vt − V0), where Ve is the elution volume of the particular molecule, V0 is the void volume of the column, and Vt is the total bed volume. V0 and Vt were determined with dextran blue (>5 MDa) and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa), respectively. The elution profile at 280 nm was fitted to a gaussian model following the equation y = a0 + ymaxexp[−(x − xmax)2/x1/22], where ymax is the value of A280 at the apex of the peak, xmax is the elution volume at ymax, x1/2 is the half-width of the peak at ymax/2, and a0 is the base line of A280. For SEC-MALLS analysis, MARS (0.02 ml at 1 mg/ml) was loaded on a 300 × 4.6-mm BioSep-SEC-s4000 column (Phenomenex) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT and developed at room temperature on a Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Detection was performed using a three-detector static light scattering apparatus (MiniDAWN TREOS, Wyatt Technology, equipped with a quasi-elastic light scattering module) and a refractometer (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). Molecular weight calculations were performed with the ASTRA V software (Wyatt Technology) using a dn/dc (Refractive Index Increment) value of 0.183 ml/g. Hydrodynamic radius (Rh) measurements were made at 20 °C with a DynaPro DLS instrument (Protein Solutions Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Before measuring 90° light scattering intensity, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. MARS samples in different buffers were incubated at room temperature before measurements. Particle translational diffusion coefficients were calculated from decay curves of autocorrelation of light scattering data and converted to the Rh with the Stokes-Einstein equation using Dynamics data analysis software V5 from Protein Solutions Inc. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an An 60 Ti rotor and a double-sector cell of 12-mm path length. Sedimentation velocity measurements were performed at 25,000 rpm at 15 °C. Samples of MARS were extensively dialyzed against the buffers used for sedimentation analysis. Solvent densities were calculated using SEDNTERP software. Scans were analyzed to derive the distribution of sedimentation coefficients using SEDFIT (30.Schuck P.

J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted as described previously (31.Agou F. Waller J.P. Mirande M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29295-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Equilibrium was verified from the superimposition of duplicate scans recorded at 4-h intervals. The experimental sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted to a model for a single homogeneous species following the equation, c(r)=c(rref)exp{[Mr(1−v¯ρ)ω2/2RT](r2−rref2)}(Eq. 1) where c(r) is the protein concentration at radial position r, c(rref) is the concentration of the protein at an arbitrary reference radial distance rref, Mr is the molecular mass, ̄ν is the partial specific volume (0.733 at 4 °C for MARS) of the solute, ρ is the density of the solvent, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, and R and T are the molar gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. SAXS data were collected on the SWING beamline at SOLEIL Synchrotron using an Aviex CCD detector. The sample to detector distance was 1.84 m to cover a Q-range from 0.004 to 0.5 Å−1, with Q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.03 Å is the x-ray wavelength. Accurate SAXS measurements were performed on the MARS complex eluting from an analytical size-exclusion chromatography column with 20-MDa exclusion limit (Shodex KW405–4F 4.6 × 300 mm) directly into the SAXS flow-through capillary cell (32.David G.

The volume and concentration of the MARS complex injected on the column were 0.1 ml and 8.5 mg/ml, respectively. The individual SAXS patterns of the frames displaying a constant radius of gyration (Rg) in the elution peak were averaged to provide a high statistics SAXS curve for the complex (32.David G.

The data were processed and analyzed using Foxtrot, a SAXS software developed on the SWING beamline, and the program package ATSAS (v.2.5.0) (34.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I.

Previous studies have shown that serum levels of MIC-1 closely parallel cancer progression and are being explored as a diagnostic tool. MIC-1 has also shown potential as a therapeutic agent as it has exhibited several anti-carcinogenic activities. Thus, MIC-1 displays two opposing effects: tumor suppression versus promotion.

Additionally, we demonstrate that RNPC1 can bind to MIC-1 mRNA via an AU-rich element within MIC-1 3′-UTR and then enhances MIC-1 mRNA stability.

The importance of p53 is seen because more than half of all human cancers lack a functional p53 (21.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar). As a direct target of p53, MIC-1 has been shown to become up-regulated upon treatment with anti-cancer drugs (22.Yang H. Filipovic Z. Brown D. Breit S.N. Vassilev L.T. Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1: a novel biomarker for p53 pathway activation.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 1023-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in some cases an increase in MIC-1 can be induced in cells either with or without p53 (23.Kim I.Y. Park S.Y. Kang Y. Thapa D. Choi H.G. Kim J.A. Role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 in docetaxel-induced cell death of human colorectal cancer cells with different p53 status.Arch. Pharm. Res. 2011; 34: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Additionally, MIC-1 has also been shown to be able seemingly to induce apoptosis in the absence of p53, making MIC-1 a potential therapeutic as well as a diagnostic agent against cancer. Inhibition of cell death can also occur if MIC-1 expression is diminished by disrupting p53 binding to the MIC-1 promoter (24.Qian Y. Jung Y.S. Chen X. Differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene 1 regulates p53-dependent cell survival versus cell death through macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 11300-11305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNPC1, also known as RBM38, is an RNA-binding protein belonging to the RNA recognition motif-containing family of RNA-binding proteins. It is expressed as two isoforms, RNPC1a, and RNPC1b (25.Shu L. Yan W. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 transcript.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2961-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RNPC1 is a direct target of p53 and has been shown to interact with other members of the p53 family including stabilization of p21 and p73 transcripts and destabilization of p63 transcripts (25.Shu L. Yan W. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 transcript.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2961-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang J. Jun Cho S. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, regulates p63 expression through mRNA stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chen X. p73 expression is regulated by RNPC1, a target of the p53 family, via mRNA stability.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 2336-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RNPC1 also functions in a negative feedback loop against p53 by repressing p53 mRNA translation (28.Zhang J. Cho S.J. Shu L. Yan W. Guerrero T. Kent M. Skorupski K. Chen H. Chen X. Translational repression of p53 by RNPC1, a p53 target overexpressed in lymphomas.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1528-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As an RNA-binding protein, RNPC1 regulates expression of various genes through binding of AU-rich elements (AREs) usually located within the 3′-UTR. The MIC-1 transcript carries an AU-rich region in its 3′-UTR. Therefore, it is likely that MIC-1 is a target of RNPC1. As it has been shown previously that MIC-1 can have anti-tumorigenic properties in the presence or absence of p53, we hypothesize that RNPC1 can regulate MIC-1 post-transcriptionally by binding to and modulating the MIC-1 transcript, leading to increased MIC-1 expression and cell growth suppression. RKO, MCF7, and H1299 cells were cultured using DMEM with 8% FBS supplied by Hyclone and Benchmark. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured with DMEM containing 10% FBS (Hyclone), 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids. Inducible RNPC1a-expressing cell lines were generated previously with RKO, MCF7, HCT116, and H1299 cells using the Tet-on inducible system (25.Shu L. Yan W. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 transcript.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2961-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two plasmids were used including pcDNA4/TO containing two Tet operators within a human CMV promoter as well as our gene of interest RNPC1, and pcDNA6/TR which contains a Tet repressor under the control of the CMV promoter. Without tetracycline, the Tet repressor binds to the promoter within the plasmid containing RNPC1a, preventing gene expression. Upon treatment, the tetracycline binds the repressor, leading to RNPC1a expression. Lentiviral infection was done by first obtaining a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA against RNPC1 and another against luciferase to be used as a negative control. 10 μg of either shRNPC1 or shLuciferase was added to three other plasmids including pCMV-VSVG (5 μg), pMDL-g/pRRE (5 μg), and pRSV-REV (5 μg) and cotransfected into 293T cells using Expressfect transfection reagent. Lentiviral particles were collected from the medium and concentrated through ultracentrifugation (25,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1.5 h). Cells were then infected using our concentrated lentiviral particles and selected using puromycin for 3 days. Whole cell lysates were obtained using 1× SDS sample buffer and run on 8–11% acrylamide gel. The blots were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Antibodies used include anti-p53 (mouse monoclonal), anti-NAG-1/PTGFβ (rabbit polyclonal; Millipore), anti-p21 SX-118 (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RNPC1(rabbit polyclonal), anti-actin (Sigma), and anti-GAPDH FL-335 (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of secreted MIC-1, conditioned media were collected and immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of anti-MIC-1 antibody (FL-308, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were brought down with Sepharose beads and eluted with SDS-PAGE and analyzed through Western blotting as above. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was performed using MMLV-reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was run using GoTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega). The primers used to detect human and mouse mRNA and premature mRNA are summarized in Table 1. Primers used to amplify p21, GAPDH, and RNPC1 were used as described previously (29.Cho S.J. Zhang J. Chen X. RNPC1 modulates the RNA-binding activity of, and cooperates with, HuR to regulate p21 mRNA stability.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2256-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Primers used for RT-PCRPrimer nameSequenceMIC-F5′-CCAGAGCTGGGAAGATTCGAACAAC-3′MIC-R5′-AGATTCTGCCAGCAGTTGGTCCGAC-3′Pre-MIC-F5′-ACGCTACGAGGACCTGCTAA-3′Pre-MIC-R5′-CCAAGGGGATCCAGGATATT-3′mMIC-F5′-GCTGTCCGGATACTCAGTCC-3′mMIC-R5′-CCTGCCACAGTCTCCAAGTGA-3′Pre-mMIC-F5′-CTGGCACACACCCTAAGGACAT-3′Pre-mMIF-R5′-CCTGCACAGTCTCCAAGTGA-3′ Open table in a new tab RNA immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (25.Shu L.

The cytosolic extracts from RKO cells were prepared with polysome lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT) and then incubated with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-RNPC1 or nonimmunized rabbit IgG at 4 °C for 4 h. The RNA-protein immunocomplexes were brought down by protein G beads followed by RT-PCR analysis. The primers to detect human RNPC1 mRNA are the same as those described previously (29.Cho S.J. Zhang J. Chen X. RNPC1 modulates the RNA-binding activity of, and cooperates with, HuR to regulate p21 mRNA stability.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2256-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription using cDNA containing T7 promoter and various regions of MIC-1 3′-UTR. For the RNA EMSA assay, 250 nm recombinant GST or GST-RNPC1 fusion protein, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA probe were mixed in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) for 20 min at 25 °C. RNA-protein complexes were digested by adding 100 units of RNase-T1 for 15 min at 37 °C and then separated in 6% of native polyacrylamide gel. RNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. RKO cells were plated in triplicate at 300 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Cells were cultured either with or without tetracycline (0.25 μg/ml) to induce RNPC1 expression for 10 days. Cells were then fixed using a 7:1 mixture of ethanol to acetic acid and then stained using 0.2 g/liter crystal violet overnight. The results were quantified through densitometry, and statistical relevance was determined by the t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. First, to examine whether there is any correlation between MIC-1 and RNPC1, protein and RNA samples were gathered from inducible RNPC1a-overexpressing cell lines under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. RKO, MCF7, and H1299 cells that can be induced to express RNPC1a were treated with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline for 24, 48, or 72 h, and the results were analyzed by Western blotting. Without RNPC1a induction, MIC-1 expression remained low (Fig. 1, A–C). Upon induction, increased levels of MIC-1 were detected at 24 h and were further increased at 48 and 72 h in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A–C). Increases in MIC-1 were also seen in H1299 cells, but the overall basal expression levels were lower than in RKO and MCF7 cells perhaps due to the absence of p53 in H1299 (Fig. 1, A–C). Consistent with previous reports, MIC-1 levels closely paralleled p21 levels (13.Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. Placental transforming growth factor-β is a downstream mediator of the growth arrest and apoptotic response of tumor cells to DNA damage and p53 overexpression.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22.Yang H. Filipovic Z. Brown D. Breit S.N. Vassilev L.T. Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1: a novel biomarker for p53 pathway activation.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 1023-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, secreted mature MIC-1 was increased upon induction of RNPC1a within MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D). Second, to determine how RNPC1 regulates MIC-1 expression, the MIC-1 transcript was measured by RT-PCR. RKO, MCF7, H1299, and HCT116 cells were induced or uninduced to express RNPC1a for 36 h. Upon induction of RNPC1a, an increase in MIC-1 mRNA was detected (Fig. 1E). We also examined pre-mRNA levels of MIC-1 to check whether the increased expression was due to post- or pre-transcriptional changes. Whereas mature mRNA levels were affected by changing RNPC1 levels, pre-mRNA levels remained relatively even (Fig. 1E), suggesting that MIC-1 is regulated mainly at a post-transcriptional level. Third, we wanted to verify whether knockdown of RNPC1 can negatively impact MIC-1 expression in RKO, MCF7, and H1299 cells. RNPC1 expression was knocked down with shRNA targeting RNPC1 through lentiviral transduction. shRNA targeting luciferase was used as a negative control. We found that knockdown of RNPC1 through shRNA was able to decrease levels of MIC-1 in RKO and MCF7 (Fig. 2, A and B). This effect was seen at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, p53 expression was increased, whereas p21 expression was decreased (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with previous reports (25.Shu L. Yan W. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 transcript.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2961-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang J. Cho S.J. Shu L. Yan W. Guerrero T. Kent M. Skorupski K. Chen H. Chen X. Translational repression of p53 by RNPC1, a p53 target overexpressed in lymphomas.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1528-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, MIC-1 protein levels were difficult to detect in H1299 cells likely due to the lack of p53. Nevertheless, the decrease in MIC-1 mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). Once again, we found that MIC-1 pre-mRNA remained relatively unchanged, suggesting that MIC-1 is regulated by RNPC1 primarily at a post-transcriptional level (Fig. 2B). Fourth, we examined the effect of RNPC1 on MIC-1 expression in wild-type and RNPC1−/− MEFs using RT-PCR. Whereas MIC-1 mRNA expression was seen clearly within wild-type MEF cells, the levels of MIC-1 were markedly reduced in MEFs without RNPC1 (Fig. 2C). Additionally, MIC-1 pre-mRNA remained unchanged (Fig. 2C). Together, our data indicate that RNPC1 can positively affect MIC-1 expression. As an RNA-binding protein, RNPC1 is known to regulate gene expression through mRNA stability. Thus, we examined whether RNPC1 regulates MIC-1 expression by altering the stability of its mRNA. To test this, MCF7 cells were treated with tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml) to induce RNPC1a expression for 36 h prior to treatment with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor. Total RNAs were harvested from the cells over a 5-h period at 1-h intervals and then analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). With induced expression of RNPC1, the half-life of MIC-1 transcript was increased from ∼2.1 to ∼ 4.4 h (Fig. 3), suggesting that MIC-1 mRNA stability is regulated by RNPC1. Next, we wanted to determine whether RNPC1 physically associates with MIC-1 transcripts in RKO cells. To test this, we performed an RNA immunoprecipitation assay followed by RT-PCR and found that MIC-1 transcript was detectable in RNPC1, but not control IgG immunocomplexes (Fig. 4A). p21 transcript was measured as a positive control as it has previously been shown to form immunocomplexes with RNPC1 (25.Shu L. Yan W. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 transcript.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2961-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). No noticeable GAPDH band was seen to associate with either RNPC1 or IgG as expected. These results indicate that RNPC1 can physically bind to MIC-1 transcripts. To map out the RNPC1 binding region in MIC-1, we performed RNA-EMSA using radiolabeled RNA probes. RNA fragments containing wild-type MIC-1 3′-UTRs and an altered ARE were generated (Fig. 4B). We found that whereas GST alone did not bind to the MIC-1 3′-UTR, GST-fused RNPC1a formed a complex with wild-type MIC-1 3′-UTR (Fig. 4C, lane 2). Formation of this complex was abrogated with the addition of a cold probe, indicating that the binding was specific (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Addition of cold p21, which is known to contain an ARE recognized by RNPC1 (29.Cho S.J. Zhang J. Chen X. RNPC1 modulates the RNA-binding activity of, and cooperates with, HuR to regulate p21 mRNA stability.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2256-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), also mitigated the binding between MIC-1 and GST-RNPC1a (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 2 and 3). Mutant MIC-1 3′-UTR, designated as UtC, was also probed with GST-RNPC1a (Fig. 4B). The UtC fragment was unable to form a complex with RNPC1, indicating that the ARE is indeed necessary for binding of RNPC1 (Fig. 4E, lane 4). Finally, we examined whether RNPC1 mutants (ΔRNP2 and ΔRNP1), which lack a subdomain in the RNPC1 RNA recognition motif, are capable of binding to MIC-1 3′-UTR (Fig. 4F). Whereas a binding complex was detected between MIC-1 and GST-RNPC1a (Fig. 4G, lane 2), little if any binding was detected if either RNP site was absent (Fig. 4G, lanes 3 and 4). Altogether, this suggests that MIC-1 requires the ARE within its 3′-UTR to physically associate with RNPC1. The RNA binding domains in RNPC1 are also required for binding to the MIC-1 transcript. Previous reports have indicated that MIC-1 exhibits both anti-tumorigenic and oncogenic activity. To examine the role of MIC-1 in cancer cell growth, we generated MIC-1 knockdown RKO cell lines in which RNPC1 can be inducibly expressed. The resulting cell line was designated RKO(MIC-1KD)/RNPC1a. Clone 10 was selected for further study. RKO-RNPC1 17, which is capable of inducibly expressing RNPC1a (25.Shu L. Yan W. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 transcript.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2961-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was used for control. Whereas MIC-1 was induced by RNPC1 (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2), increased MIC-1 expression was not as prominent in MIC-1 knockdown cells despite similar levels of RNPC1 (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Next, colony formation assay was performed and showed that upon induction of RNPC1, cell growth was markedly inhibited. However, by knocking down MIC-1, cell growth inhibition was greatly mitigated (Fig. 5B). Quantitative analysis showed that RNPC1-mediated growth inhibition was diminished from 80% in the presence of MIC-1 to 38% upon knockdown of MIC-1 (Fig. 5C). Previous studies showed that overexpression of MIC-1 suppresses cell growth by signaling downstream through the TGF-β pathway, which can increase p21 expression (3.Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. PTGF-β, a type β transforming growth factor (TGF-β) superfamily member, is a p53 target gene that inhibits tumor cell growth via TGF-β signaling pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 30.Soto-Cerrato V. Viñals F. Lambert J.R. Pérez-Tomás R. The anticancer agent prodigiosin induces p21WAF1/CIP1 expression via transforming growth factor-β receptor pathway.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1340-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeting MIC-1 expression using siRNA has been observed to down-regulate p21 (31.Kim J.S. Baek S.J. Sali T. Eling T.E. The conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide arrests ovarian cancer cell growth via the expression of NAG-1/MIC-1/GDF-15.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that RNPC1 induction of p21 was decreased when MIC-1 was knocked down (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 2 and 4). Altogether, this suggests that MIC-1 mediates RNPC1-induced cell growth suppression at least in part via p21. Previous studies have shown that the RNA-binding protein RNPC1 can regulate several p53 family members through binding of their AREs. In this study, we have shown that induction of RNPC1 can increase MIC-1 transcript and protein expression. Conversely, lack of RNPC1 negatively affects MIC-1 levels. Pre-mRNA levels in both cases, however, are unaffected by RNPC1, indicating that regulation of MIC-1 occurs at a post-transcriptional level. Consistent with this, we have identified an ARE within MIC-1 3′-UTR which acts as a potential binding site for RNPC1. Binding of MIC-1 ARE within its 3′-UTR by RNPC1 leads to enhanced stability of the MIC-1 transcript and cell growth suppression. This binding can only occur if MIC-1 ARE is present. Altogether, our data indicate that RNPC1 is a positive post-transcriptional regulator of MIC-1 expression. Expression of MIC-1 can be induced in response to a variety of factors including cellular stress, inflammation, and chemicals such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, DNA-damaging agents, and anti-cancer drugs through either p53-dependent or -independent pathways (18.Yoshioka H. Kamitani H. Watanabe T. Eling T.E. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene (NAG-1/GDF15) expression is increased by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.J. Biol.

Whereas reports thus far have investigated mainly regulation of MIC-1 at a transcriptional level, here we have uncovered a novel post-transcriptional mechanism by which MIC-1 expression can be regulated. Due to its high levels within certain cancers such as gastric, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, and breast cancer and its close association with the presence particularly of premalignant colonic diseases, MIC-1 is being explored as a marker of tumor progression and a prognostic serum biomarker (10.Brown D.A.

Growth/differentiation factor-15: prostate cancer suppressor or promoter?.Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 2012; 15: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the signaling pathways involving MIC-1 within the context of tumor development is still incomplete. Similar to other members of the TGF-β family, MIC-1 displays conflicting roles during early and late stage cancers. Through this study, we propose that under nonstressed conditions, p53 expression remains low, resulting in negligible levels of MIC-1. Wild-type p53 activation in response to a stress signal leads to increased levels of RNPC1 and transcriptional activation of MIC-1. RNPC1 can then function simultaneously in a negative feedback loop to inhibit further p53 expression while binding and stabilizing MIC-1 transcripts, which results in the overall increased expression of MIC-1 seen in early stage and premalignant cancers (Fig. 5D). This post-transcriptional regulation of MIC-1 serves to amplify tumor cell death and growth inhibition signals that are mediated in part by p21. As the cancer progresses into later stages, wild-type p53 may no longer be present. Given that p53 acts as an up-regulator of MIC-1, loss of wild-type p53 should result in a corresponding decrease in MIC-1. However, MIC-1 levels tend to increase rather than decrease as cancers progress. We may speculate that this is due to another transcriptional activator. Regardless, the high levels of MIC-1 observed in late stage cancers suggest that whatever anti-tumorigenic properties MIC-1 displayed early on are no longer functional. Furthermore, additional mutations that may occur within downstream targets of MIC-1 in cancer cells can render them immune to regulation by MIC-1. More studies are required to clarify the dual pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles of MIC-1 and its signaling pathway, which may provide an insight into possible therapeutic as well as diagnostic uses for MIC-1."

Because the intimate structure of such pseudoviral particles is still a matter of debate, we investigated the robustness of the external barrier and its structure and dynamics using the noninvasive solid-state NMR technique. This barrier is made of 60% proteins and 40% lipids. Phospholipids represent 83% of all lipids, and chain unsaturation is of 72%. Dynamics was reported by embedding small amounts of deuterium chain-labeled unsaturated phospholipid into the external barrier of entire subviral particles, while controlling particle integrity by cryoelectron microscopy, tomography, and light scattering. Variable preparation modes were used, from mild incubation of small unilamellar vesicles to very stringent incorporation with freeze-drying. A lipid bilayer structure of 4- to 5-nm thickness was evidenced with a higher rigidity than that of synthetic phospholipid vesicles, but nonetheless reflecting a fluid membrane (50-52% of maximum rigidity) in agreement with the elevated unsaturation content. The HBsAg particles of 20- to 24-nm diameter were surprisingly found resistant to lyophilization, in such a way that trapped water inside particles could not be removed. These dual properties bring more insight into the mode of action of native subviral particles and their recombinant counterparts used in vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2075993475,"The E2F1 transcription factor is active in many types of solid tumors and can function as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor in vivo. E2F1 activity is connected with a variety of cell fates including proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, and autophagy, and these effects are mediated through differential target gene expression. E2F1-induced cell death is an innate anti-cancer mechanism to kill cells with a spontaneous oncogenic mutation that might otherwise form a cancer. Relatively little is known about the molecular circuitry that tips E2F1 balance toward proliferation during normal growth versus apoptosis during oncogenic stress, and which pathways mediate this decision. To further explore these mechanisms, we utilized an unbiased shRNA screen to identify candidate genes that mediate E2F1-induced cell death. We identified the ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2 (UHRF2) gene as an important mediator of E2F1-induced cell death. UHRF2 encodes a nuclear protein involved in cell-cycle regulation. Several of these domains have been shown to be essential for the regulation of cell proliferation, and UHRF2 has been implicated as an oncogene in some settings. Other reports have suggested that UHRF2 causes growth arrest, functions as a tumor suppressor, and is deleted in a variety of tumors. We show that UHRF2 is a transcriptional target of E2F, that it directly interacts with E2F1, and is required for E2F1 induction of apoptosis and transcription of a number of important apoptotic regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1978369665,"Using a cell-free bioluminescence resonance energy transfer strategy we compared the levels of spontaneous and ligand-induced receptor-G protein coupling in δ (DOP) and μ (MOP) opioid receptors. In this assay GDP can suppress spontaneous coupling, thus allowing its quantification. The level of constitutive activity was 4-5 times greater at the DOP than at the MOP receptor. A series of opioid analogues with a common peptidomimetic scaffold displayed remarkable inversions of efficacy in the two receptors. Agonists that enhanced coupling above the low intrinsic level of the MOP receptor were inverse agonists in reducing the greater level of constitutive coupling of the DOP receptor. Yet the intrinsic activities of such ligands are identical when scaled over the GDP base line of both receptors. This pattern is in conflict with the predictions of the ternary complex model and the ""two state"" extensions. According to this theory, the order of spontaneous and ligand-induced coupling cannot be reversed if a shift of the equilibrium between active and inactive forms raises constitutive activation in one receptor type. We propose that constitutive activation results from a lessened intrinsic barrier that restrains spontaneous coupling. Any ligand, regardless of its efficacy, must enhance this constraint to stabilize the ligand-bound complexed form."

In NhaA, the Escherichia coli Na+/H+ antiporter, specific single site mutations modulating the pH profile of the transporter have been described in the past. To clarify the mechanism by which these mutations influence the pH dependence of NhaA, the substrate dependence of the kinetics of selected NhaA variants was electrophysiologically investigated and analyzed with a kinetic model. It is shown that the mutations affect NhaA activity in quite different ways by changing the properties of the binding site or the dynamics of the transporter. In the first case, pK and/or KDNa are altered, and in the second case, the rate constants of the conformational transition between the inside and the outside open conformation are modified.

Na+/H+ antiporters are crucial for survival in all biological kingdoms, as they control the intracellular sodium and proton concentration (1.Brett C.L. Donowitz M. Rao R.

For more than 20 years, NhaA from Escherichia coli served as a prototype for Na+/H+ antiporters. Moreover, NhaA is an example for the general mechanistic properties of transporters. The transport activity of NhaA shows a pronounced pH dependence (4.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. A point mutation (G338S) and its suppressor mutations affect both the pH response of the NhaA-Na+/H+ antiporter as well as the growth phenotype of Escherichia coli.J. Biol.

On the basis of a large number of functional and structural investigations, a model of allosteric pH regulation was proposed for NhaA (6.Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H.

It was hypothesized that the pH-dependent change of the transport activity is due to the transition of the transporter from an inactive to an active conformation. Furthermore, the existence of a cytoplasmically located pH sensor was postulated. It is assumed that the pH sensor senses the intrabacterial pH and mediates the transition from an inactive conformation to an active conformation. Many pH-dependent conformational changes were revealed in various regions of the protein (8.Kozachkov L. Padan E. Conformational changes in NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2013; 30: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recent electrophysiological analysis of NhaA in combination with kinetic analysis has provided further insights into the transport function of the antiporter (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K.

Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These measurements show that the decrease of the transport activity at acidic pH values is due to an increase of the KmNa and not due to a decrease of the Vmax (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: An electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and explain this behavior with competitive binding of the substrates to a common binding site. A kinetic model (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: An electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) is proposed that explains the substrate dependence of the transport activity over a large concentration range. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that lowering the pH at the sodium release side to pH 5 does not inactivate NhaA in the forward mode nor in the reverse mode (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K.

Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), thus providing strong evidence that NhaA is not adopting an inactive conformation even at pH 5 at the cytoplasmic or periplasmic side. That the competition mechanism is a realistic hypothesis is supported by the observation that some of the conformational transitions are not only pH- but also Na+-dependent (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: An electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, a site-directed fluorescence study of a single Trp NhaA (Trp-less F136W NhaA) has recently revealed a pH-induced conformational change that is independent of the ligand (10.Kozachkov L. Padan E. Site-directed tryptophan fluorescence reveals two essential conformational changes in the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15769-15774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The two mechanisms of pH regulation described above represent obviously different mechanistic concepts, although they are not mutually exclusive and the conformational transitions they rely on are not necessarily different. A central argument for the existence of a pH sensor and the related allosteric model of pH regulation is based on the drastic effects that mutations in regions very remote from the cation-binding site (2.Padan E.

In this study, we therefore analyzed a number of different NhaA variants with mutations remote from and close to the cation-binding site.

To investigate the effect of mutations remote from the active site on the pH profile, we functionally characterized the mutants V254C NhaA and H225R NhaA (Fig. 1A). Val-254 is located at the cytoplasmic end of helix IX, which is part of the postulated pH sensor region. His-225 is in helix VIII, which is flanking the periplasmic funnel. These mutants showed an altered pH dependence at preceding biochemical investigations (7.Padan E.

Chem. 2009; 284: 6337-6347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also investigated the effect of dimerization on the transport properties of NhaA by using the monomeric mutant ΔP45-N58 NhaA (18.Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E. Monomers of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli are fully functional yet dimers are beneficial under extreme stress conditions at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ or Li+.J. Biol.

This mutation is located at transmembrane helix V in close proximity to the binding site (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, this novel mutant did not show the characteristic property expected for an electrogenic transporter such as wild type (WT) NhaA with a stoichiometry of 2H+/1Na+. In particular, the enhancement of Na+ uptake rate by collapsing the membrane potential is drastically smaller in A167P than in WT NhaA. The following study explains the differential effects of mutations on the transport properties of NhaA from E. coli on the basis of a detailed kinetic analysis. The mutants (Fig. 1A) ΔP45-N58 (18.Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E.

C-terminally His-tagged A167P, ΔP45-N58, V254C, Cys-less, and H225R NhaA were overexpressed and purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described previously (20.Venturi M. Padan E.

Purified protein in 25 mm potassium acetate (pH 5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.03% dodecyl β-d-maltoside was stored at 4 °C until reconstitution. Reconstitution of the variant protein was carried out with E. coli phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) using polystyrene beads for detergent removal at a lipid to protein mass ratio of 10 (9.Mager T.

The final proteoliposomes were adjusted to a lipid concentration of 5 mg/ml, frozen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Prior to the SSM measurements, the samples were gently sonicated with cooling breaks on ice. ISO membrane vesicles were produced as described (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K.

The ISO membrane vesicles were further purified by metal affinity two-phase partitioning according to Ref. 21.Everberg H. Clough J. Henderson P. Jergil B. Tjerneld F. Ramírez I.B. Isolation of Escherichia coli inner membranes by metal affinity two-phase partitioning.J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1118: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. NhaA proteoliposomes were reconstituted, and ΔpH-driven 22Na uptake was determined as described previously (4.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. A point mutation (G338S) and its suppressor mutations affect both the pH response of the NhaA-Na+/H+ antiporter as well as the growth phenotype of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least twice with practically identical results. SSM measurements were performed as described previously (22.Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, 45 μl of proteoliposomes at a lipid concentration of 5 mg/ml or ISO membrane vesicles at a total membrane protein concentration of 1.5–3 mg/ml were adsorbed to an octadecanethiol/phospholipid hybrid bilayer on a gold surface (sensor). Proteoliposomes were allowed to adsorb to the sensor for 2–3 h. Adsorption of the ISO membrane vesicles was carried out for 3–12 h. Electrogenic transport was initiated by a rapid concentration jump of Na+ ions (sodium gradient-driven transport) using a single solution exchange protocol (nonactivating solution, 0.5 s; activating solution, 0.5 s; nonactivating solution, 0.5 s). Currents recorded throughout the measurements were amplified with a current amplifier set to a gain of 108–1010 V/A and low pass filtering at 2000 Hz. To minimize Na+ concentration jump artifacts, sodium was compensated for by an equal amount on an inert cation (K+) in the nonactivating solution. For the same reason, the ionic strength was kept high by adding K+ to a total cation concentration of 305 mm. Details concerning the composition of the solutions are given in the figure legends. Na+ concentration jumps on the SSM are accompanied by transient currents of positive signs (solution exchange artifact). In contrast, NhaA transporter currents after a Na+ concentration jump have a negative sign. The negative transient currents were subtracted by the positive solution exchange artifacts to get transient currents that reflect only the transport activity (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K.

Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Na+ dependences of the peak currents (three data sets) were normalized to the corresponding Vmax values resulting from a hyperbolic fit to the individual data set and then averaged. To describe the pH dependence of the transient currents, peak currents Ipeak were recorded at 10 and 100 mm Na+. Normalization of the data was performed according to Ref. 9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E.

To perform a kinetic analysis of the transporter activity of ΔP45-N58, V254C, H225R, and A167P NhaA, right-side out (RSO) proteoliposomes, exposing the periplasmic side of the transporter to the outside, were prepared and investigated using SSM-based electrophysiology. Note that NhaA spontaneously adopts an RSO orientation in proteoliposomes (23.Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Kinetics of charge translocation in the passive downhill uptake mode of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA of Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). V254C NhaA and ΔP45-N58 NhaA were also studied in the opposite transport direction using ISO membrane vesicles derived from bacteria overexpressing the corresponding mutant proteins and exposing the cytoplasmic side to the outside (Fig. 2A, right panel) (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: An electrophysiological study.J. Biol.

Membrane vesicles prepared by French press cell disruption have a preferential ISO orientation (24.Adler L.W. Ichikawa T. Hasan S.M. Tsuchiya T. Rosen B.P. Orientation of the protonmotive force in membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli.J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A complete ISO orientation of the vesicles was further ensured using an extraction procedure with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-tagged beads (21.Everberg H. Clough J. Henderson P. Jergil B. Tjerneld F. Ramírez I.B. Isolation of Escherichia coli inner membranes by metal affinity two-phase partitioning.J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1118: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transport was initiated by a rapid Na+ concentration jump. The ensuing transporter activity generates a transient current. Its peak value is a reliable estimate of the steady-state transport activity of NhaA (23.Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Kinetics of charge translocation in the passive downhill uptake mode of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA of Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By applying an inwardly directed Na+ gradient to the RSO proteoliposomes, transport against physiological transport direction (reverse mode) was investigated (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). Transport in physiological transport direction (forward mode) was investigated by applying an inwardly directed Na+ gradient (Na+ inside = 0) to ISO membrane vesicles (Fig. 2, C and E). Peak currents corresponding to the reverse mode were recorded after 10 or 100 mm Na+ concentration jumps applied to RSO proteoliposomes at pH values from 6 to 9.5 for ΔP45-N58 (Fig. 2D) and V254C NhaA (Fig. 2B) and at pH values from 5 to 9.5 for H225R NhaA (Fig. 2A). No pre-steady-state current components were observed throughout the displayed pH range. V254C NhaA and ΔP45-N58 NhaA were also investigated in the forward mode (Fig. 2, C and E) using ISO membrane vesicles. The Na+ gradient-driven transport resulted in negative transient currents in agreement with the 2H+/1Na+ stoichiometry of NhaA (5.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Overproduction and purification of a functional Na+/H+ antiporter coded by nhaA (ant) from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peak currents at optimal pH and 100 mm Na+ were −1.0 ± 0.5 nA for H225R NhaA (pH 8), −3.5 ± 1.0 nA for ΔP45-N58 NhaA (pH 9), and −6 ± 3 nA for V254C NhaA (pH 9). The relatively large variation of the absolute current values stems from the fact that the amount of adsorbed proteoliposomes varies between different sensors. The pH dependences of ΔP45-N58 NhaA and WT NhaA in both transport directions were virtually the same (Fig. 2, D and E). However, the other mutants show clear alterations of the transport properties compared with WT NhaA (Fig. 2). Values for the pH of optimal transport, pHopt, are compared in Table 1. The pH dependence of H225R NhaA in the reverse mode was shifted by ∼1 pH unit to the acidic range compared with the wild type. In addition, the ratio of the peak currents after performing a 10 mm Na+ concentration jump and after a 100 mm Na+ concentration jump differed significantly from WT NhaA (Fig. 2A). For V254C NhaA, an alkaline shift to pH 9.0 was observed in the reverse mode (Fig. 2B). Moreover, in this mutant, the bell-shaped pH dependence was widened in comparison with WT. In contrast, in the forward mode the pH dependence of V254C NhaA and WT NhaA was virtually the same (Fig. 2C) demonstrating a clear asymmetric behavior of V254C NhaA. The mutation V254C was introduced in an NhaA variant with all cysteines being mutated to serines (Cys-less NhaA). Cys-less NhaA has the same transport properties like WT NhaA (19.Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. Histidine 225, a residue of the NhaA-Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli is exposed and faces the cell exterior.J. Biol.

To verify this by SSM measurements, the pH dependence of ΔNa-driven transport using reconstituted Cys-less NhaA was investigated between pH 6 and pH 9.5.

The Na+ dependences of Na+ gradient-driven reverse mode transport of the mutants were determined at pH values, where the transport activity is maximal, and at more acidic pH values, where the transport activity is reduced (Fig. 2). In addition, forward mode transport of V254C NhaA and ΔP45-N58 NhaA was investigated for comparison. The individual data sets obtained with different sensors were fitted with a hyperbolic model function with a half-saturation concentration KmNa and a saturation value Vmax. As discussed above, comparison of Vmax is associated with large errors (see Table 1) because different sensors were used in each experiment and different amounts of proteoliposomes were absorbed per sensor. Nevertheless, the values demonstrate that mutants and WT have approximately the same transport capacity in the reverse mode. A comparison with forward mode is also not possible, because the concentration of NhaA in the ISO membrane vesicles was not determined. However, a direct comparison of Vmax at different pH values is possible, by comparing data determined with the same sensor. Performing this analysis led to the conclusion that in both transport directions, Vmax did not change significantly with pH (data not shown), but KmNa did. This finding has already proven to be valid for WT NhaA and G338S NhaA and is a strong indicator for Na+/H+ competition being a significant reason for the decrease of transport activity at low pH (9.Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: An electrophysiological study.J. Biol.

As expected for an electrogenic transporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/1Na+, WT NhaA reconstituted in proteoliposomes shows a dramatic increase of the ΔpH-driven Na22 uptake rate upon addition of a permeant ion (K+ in the presence of valinomycin) to collapse the membrane potential (Fig. 3A). In marked contrast the mutant A167P, in a similar experiment, was nearly indifferent to a change in the membrane potential. This difference can suggest that variant A167P is less electrogenic as compared with the WT or is an electroneutral antiporter. Surprisingly, transporter currents were measured with A167P proteoliposomes using SSM-based electrophysiology (Fig. 3B). Hence, A167P NhaA is electrogenic, ruling out that it is an electroneutral transporter. The pH dependence of the mutant is not shifted in comparison with the wild type (Fig. 3C). However, A167P NhaA differs from the WT"
https://openalex.org/W2003188806,"Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that are involved, as Nature's “glycosylation reagents,” in many fundamental biological processes including cell adhesion and blood group biosynthesis. Although of similar importance to that of other large enzyme families such as protein kinases and proteases, the undisputed potential of GTs for chemical biology and drug discovery has remained largely unrealized to date. This is due, at least in part, to a relative lack of GT inhibitors and tool compounds for structural, mechanistic, and cellular studies. In this study, we have used a novel class of GT donor analogues to obtain new structural and enzymological information for a representative blood group GT. These analogues interfere with the folding of an internal loop and the C terminus, which are essential for catalysis. Our experiments have led to the discovery of an entirely new active site folding mode for this enzyme family, which can be targeted in inhibitor development, similar to the DFG motif in protein kinases. Taken together, our results provide new insights into substrate binding, dynamics, and utilization in this important enzyme family, which can very likely be harnessed for the rational development of new GT inhibitors and probes.Background: Modified UDP-Gal donor substrates with 5-formylthienyl and 5-phenyl substituents on the uracil base exhibit differential inhibition patterns for glycosyltransferases.Results: Structural studies reveal a new enzyme loop folding mode for the 5-formylthienyl analogue.Conclusion: Differential inhibition is attributed to alternate enzyme conformational changes and interactions with the respective inhibitors.Significance: The conformational plasticity of glycosyltransferases can be exploited in designing novel inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2023182523,"The epithelium of mucosal and skin surfaces serves as a permeability barrier and affords mechanisms for local immune defense. Crucial to the development and maintenance of a properly functioning epithelium is the balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Here we show that this balance depends on cross-regulatory interactions among multiple protein kinase-mediated signals and their coordinated transmission. From an investigation of conditional gene knock-out mice, we find that epithelial-specific loss of the protein kinase p38α leads to aberrant activation of TAK1, JNK, EGF receptor, and ERK in distinct microanatomical areas of the intestines and skin. Consequently, the epithelial tissues display excessive proliferation, inadequate differentiation, and sensitivity to apoptosis. These anomalies leave the tissue prone to damage and collapse at the trigger of an environmental insult. The vulnerability of p38α-deficient epithelium predicts adverse effects of long term pharmacological p38α inhibition; yet such limitations could be overcome by concomitant blockade of one or more of the dysregulated protein kinase signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2090638860,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome is episomally maintained in latently infected cells. The viral protein EBNA1 is a bridging molecule that tethers EBV episomes to host mitotic chromosomes as well as to interphase chromatin. EBNA1 localizes to cellular chromosomes (chromatin) via its chromosome binding domains (CBDs), which are rich in glycine and arginine residues. However, the molecular mechanism by which the CBDs of EBNA1 attach to cellular chromatin is still under debate. Mutation analyses revealed that stepwise substitution of arginine residues within the CBD1 (amino acids 40-54) and CBD2 (amino acids 328-377) regions with alanines progressively impaired chromosome binding activity of EBNA1. The complete arginine-to-alanine substitutions within the CBD1 and -2 regions abolished the ability of EBNA1 to stably maintain EBV-derived oriP plasmids in dividing cells. Importantly, replacing the same arginines with lysines had minimal effect, if any, on chromosome binding of EBNA1 as well as on its ability to stably maintain oriP plasmids. Furthermore, a glycine-arginine-rich peptide derived from the CBD1 region bound to reconstituted nucleosome core particles in vitro, as did a glycine-lysine rich peptide, whereas a glycine-alanine rich peptide did not. These results support the idea that the chromosome binding of EBNA1 is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the basic amino acids within the CBDs and negatively charged cellular chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2153803211,"The ATP-dependent insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX is the first committed step in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The reaction is catalyzed by magnesium chelatase, which consists of three gene products: BchI, BchD, and BchH. The BchI and BchD subunits belong to the family of AAA+ proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) and form a two-ring complex with six BchI subunits in one layer and six BchD subunits in the other layer. This BchID complex is a two-layered trimer of dimers with the ATP binding site located at the interface between two neighboring BchI subunits. ATP hydrolysis by the BchID motor unit fuels the insertion of Mg(2+) into the porphyrin by the BchH subunit. In the present study, we explored mutations that were originally identified in semidominant barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutants. The resulting recombinant BchI proteins have marginal ATPase activity and cannot contribute to magnesium chelatase activity although they apparently form structurally correct complexes with BchD. Mixing experiments with modified and wild-type BchI in various combinations showed that an exchange of BchI subunits in magnesium chelatase occurs during the catalytic cycle, which indicates that dissociation of the complex may be part of the reaction mechanism related to product release. Mixing experiments also showed that more than three functional interfaces in the BchI ring structure are required for magnesium chelatase activity."

It provides salt tolerance by removing excess intracellular sodium (or lithium) in exchange for protons. We examined the role of amino acid residues of transmembrane segment IV (TM IV) (126FPQINFLGSLLIAGCITSTDPVLSALI152) in activity by using alanine scanning mutagenesis and examining salt tolerance in sod2-deficient S. pombe. Two amino acids were critical for function. Mutations T144A and V147A resulted in defective proteins that did not confer salt tolerance when reintroduced into S. pombe. Sod2 protein with other alanine mutations in TM IV had little or no effect. T144D and T144K mutant proteins were inactive; however, a T144S protein was functional and provided lithium, but not sodium, tolerance and transport. Analysis of sensitivity to trypsin indicated that the mutations caused a conformational change in the Sod2 protein. We expressed and purified TM IV (amino acids 125–154). NMR analysis yielded a model with two helical regions (amino acids 128–142 and 147–154) separated by an unwound region (amino acids 143–146). Molecular modeling of the entire Sod2 protein suggested that TM IV has a structure similar to that deduced by NMR analysis and an overall structure similar to that of Escherichia coli NhaA.

https://openalex.org/W1963895013,"Respiratory processes often use quinone oxidoreduction to generate a transmembrane proton gradient, making the 2H(+)/2e(-) quinone chemistry important for ATP synthesis. There are a variety of quinones used as electron carriers between bioenergetic proteins, and some respiratory proteins can functionally interact with more than one quinone type. In the case of complex II homologs, which couple quinone chemistry to the interconversion of succinate and fumarate, the redox potentials of the biologically available ubiquinone and menaquinone aid in driving the chemical reaction in one direction. In the complex II homolog quinol:fumarate reductase, it has been demonstrated that menaquinol oxidation requires at least one proton shuttle, but many of the remaining mechanistic details of menaquinol oxidation are not fully understood, and little is known about ubiquinone reduction. In the current study, structural and computational studies suggest that the sequential removal of the two menaquinol protons may be accompanied by a rotation of the naphthoquinone ring to optimize the interaction with a second proton shuttling pathway. However, kinetic measurements of site-specific mutations of quinol:fumarate reductase variants show that ubiquinone reduction does not use the same pathway. Computational docking of ubiquinone followed by mutagenesis instead suggested redundant proton shuttles lining the ubiquinone-binding site or from direct transfer from solvent. These data show that the quinone-binding site provides an environment that allows multiple amino acid residues to participate in quinone oxidoreduction. This suggests that the quinone-binding site in complex II is inherently plastic and can robustly interact with different types of quinones."
