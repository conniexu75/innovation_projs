https://openalex.org/W1631320694,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2104994033,"Despite great advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying blood production, lineage specification at the level of multipotent progenitors (MPPs) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MPP2 and MPP3 are distinct myeloid-biased MPP subsets that work together with lymphoid-primed MPP4 cells to control blood production. We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1608233475,"eIF4E, the major cap-binding protein, has long been considered limiting for translating the mammalian genome. However, the eIF4E dose requirement at an organismal level remains unexplored. By generating an Eif4e haploinsufficient mouse, we found that a 50% reduction in eIF4E expression, while compatible with normal development and global protein synthesis, significantly impeded cellular transformation. Genome-wide translational profiling uncovered a translational program induced by oncogenic transformation and revealed a critical role for the dose of eIF4E, specifically in translating a network of mRNAs enriched for a unique 5' UTR signature. In particular, we demonstrate that the dose of eIF4E is essential for translating mRNAs that regulate reactive oxygen species, fueling transformation and cancer cell survival in vivo. Our findings indicate eIF4E is maintained at levels in excess for normal development that are hijacked by cancer cells to drive a translational program supporting tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W582182564,"Neuroinflammation is the local reaction of the brain to infection, trauma, toxic molecules or protein aggregates. The brain resident macrophages, microglia, are able to trigger an appropriate response involving secretion of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the activation of astrocytes and recruitment of peripheral immune cells. IL-1β plays an important role in this response; yet its production and mode of action in the brain are not fully understood and its precise implication in neurodegenerative diseases needs further characterization. Our results indicate that the capacity to form a functional NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of IL-1β is limited to the microglial compartment in the mouse brain. We were not able to observe IL-1β secretion from astrocytes, nor do they express all NLRP3 inflammasome components. Microglia were able to produce IL-1β in response to different classical inflammasome activators, such as ATP, Nigericin or Alum. Similarly, microglia secreted IL-18 and IL-1α, two other inflammasome-linked pro-inflammatory factors. Cell stimulation with α-synuclein, a neurodegenerative disease-related peptide, did not result in the release of active IL-1β by microglia, despite a weak pro-inflammatory effect. Amyloid-β peptides were able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia and IL-1β secretion occurred in a P2X7 receptor-independent manner. Thus microglia-dependent inflammasome activation can play an important role in the brain and especially in neuroinflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2103260279,"Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Mutations in the innate immune sensor AIM2 are frequently identified in patients with colorectal cancer, but how AIM2 modulates colonic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we found that Aim2-deficient mice were hypersusceptible to colonic tumor development. Production of inflammasome-associated cytokines and other inflammatory mediators was largely intact in Aim2-deficient mice; however, intestinal stem cells were prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Aberrant Wnt signaling expanded a population of tumor-initiating stem cells in the absence of AIM2. Susceptibility of Aim2-deficient mice to colorectal tumorigenesis was enhanced by a dysbiotic gut microbiota, which was reduced by reciprocal exchange of gut microbiota with healthy wild-type mice. These findings uncover a synergy between a specific host genetic factor and gut microbiota in determining the susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Therapeutic modulation of AIM2 expression and microbiota has the potential to prevent colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1504600256,"Lipid composition affects the biophysical properties of membranes that provide a platform for receptor-mediated cellular signaling. To study the regulatory role of membrane lipid composition, we combined genetic perturbations of sphingolipid metabolism with the quantification of diverse steps in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. Membrane lipid composition was broadly affected by these perturbations, revealing a circular network of coregulated sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids. This evolutionarily conserved network architecture simultaneously reflected membrane lipid metabolism, subcellular localization, and adaptation mechanisms. Integration of the diverse TLR-induced inflammatory phenotypes with changes in lipid abundance assigned distinct functional roles to individual lipid species organized across the network. This functional annotation accurately predicted the inflammatory response of cells derived from patients suffering from lipid storage disorders, based solely on their altered membrane lipid composition. The analytical strategy described here empowers the understanding of higher-level organization of membrane lipid function in diverse biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1898753515,"β-adrenergic signaling pathways mediate key aspects of cardiac function. Its dysregulation is associated with a range of cardiac diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Previously, we established an iPSC model of familial DCM from patients with a mutation in TNNT2, a sarcomeric protein. Here, we found that the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced mature β-adrenergic signaling in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) but that this pathway was blunted in DCM iPSC-CMs. Although expression levels of several β-adrenergic signaling components were unaltered between control and DCM iPSC-CMs, we found that phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 2A and PDE3A were upregulated in DCM iPSC-CMs and that PDE2A was also upregulated in DCM patient tissue. We further discovered increased nuclear localization of mutant TNNT2 and epigenetic modifications of PDE genes in both DCM iPSC-CMs and patient tissue. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of PDE2A and PDE3A restored cAMP levels and ameliorated the impaired β-adrenergic signaling of DCM iPSC-CMs, suggesting therapeutic potential."

Histamine can suppress, for example, glutamate or GABA inputs to local circuits by activating hetero-H3 metabotropic receptors on terminals; it can also depolarize cells via H1 and H2 metabotropic receptors or cause phosphorylation of ion channels that influence firing rate (Atzori etВ al., 2000Atzori M.

These effects can occur in the same local circuitry. At the behavioral level, the net effects of histamineвҖҷs actions on circuits are enhanced aspects of wakefulness such as cognition, locomotion, feeding, and motivation (Torrealba etВ al., 2012Torrealba F.

Physiological investigations have focused on the histaminergic aspect of TMN neurons. But these neurons also contain glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) enzymes and GABA itself (Airaksinen etВ al., 1992Airaksinen M.S. Alanen S. Szabat E. Visser T.J. Panula P.

GABAвҖҷs presence in histaminergic neurons is conserved, from fish through to humans, suggesting a core function (Sundvik and Panula, 2012Sundvik M. Panula P. Organization of the histaminergic system in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain: neuron number, location, and cotransmitters.J.В Comp.

It is not known what this function is, and there has been no demonstration that these cells actually release GABA. Optogenetic stimulation of histaminergic fibers in the ventral lateral preoptic (VLPO) area of the hypothalamus found that histamine release stimulated local GABAergic interneurons (Williams etВ al., 2014Williams R.H. Chee M.J. Kroeger D. Ferrari L.L. Maratos-Flier E. Scammell T.E. Arrigoni E. Optogenetic-mediated release of histamine reveals distal and autoregulatory mechanisms for controlling arousal.J.В Neurosci. 2014; 34: 6023-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but provided no evidence of GABA release from the histamine fibers. Varicosities on TMN axons broadcast histamine by volume transmissionвҖ”histaminergic neurons rarely use synapses (Takagi etВ al., 1986Takagi H. Morishima Y. Matsuyama T. Hayashi H. Watanabe T. Wada H. Histaminergic axons in the neostriatum and cerebral cortex of the rat: a correlated light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical study using histidine decarboxylase as a marker.Brain Res. 1986; 364: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). So it is likely that if these same TMN axons do release GABA, then this particular source of GABA would also function, similar to histamine, in a paracrine manner that would principally affect extrasynaptic receptors. Because GABA is an electroneutral zwitterion at physiological pH, it hasВ diminished interactions with the extracellular matrix. ThusВ GABA is well suited for diffusion over long distances (Roberts and Sherman, 1993Roberts E. Sherman M.A. GABA--the quintessential neurotransmitter: electroneutrality, fidelity, specificity, and a model for the ligand binding site of GABAA receptors.Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ambient (nonsynaptic) GABA produces sustained inhibitory currents by activating high-affinity extrasynaptic ionotropic GABAA receptors (Brickley etВ al., 1996Brickley S.G. Cull-Candy S.G. Farrant M.

Maguire J. The impact of tonic GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition on neuronal excitability varies across brain region and cell type.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); this is termed the tonic inhibitory conductance (Gtonic). In this paper we start by showing that selective pharmacogenetic stimulation of histamine neurons enhances behavioral arousal. We then demonstrate that knocking down or removing vgat gene expression from histaminergic neurons increases locomotion, and causes a substantial increase in wakefulness during the night. Optogenetically stimulating histaminergic fibers in the neocortex and caudate-putamen increases Gtonic onto pyramidal neurons and medium spiny cells, respectively. Eliminating vgat from histaminergic neurons selectively abolishes these evoked tonic inhibitory currents. Thus, during wakefulness, GABA can be deposited widely in neocortical and striatal circuitry by volume transmission. The GABA and histamine TMN components work together to regulate the amount of wakefulness. We first tested the excitatory nature ofВ histaminergic neurons on behavior byВ selectively stimulating them pharmacogenetically inВ vivo with DREADD hM3Dq-mCherry receptors and clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Alexander etВ al., 2009Alexander G.M.

Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The hM3Dq receptor is an excitatory metabotropic receptor. Histaminergic neurons can be genetically targeted because of their unique expression of the histidine decarboxylase (hdc) gene, allowing the generation of HDC-Cre mice (Yu etВ al., 2014Yu X. Zecharia A. Zhang Z. Yang Q. Yustos R. Jager P. Vyssotski A.L. Maywood E.S. Chesham J.E. Ma Y. et al.Circadian factor BMAL1 in histaminergic neurons regulates sleep architecture.Curr.

GABAergic inhibition of histaminergic neurons regulates active waking but not the sleep-wake switch or propofol-induced loss of consciousness.J.В Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13062-13075Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The TMN area of HDC-Cre mice was bilaterally transduced with AAV-flex-hM3Dq-mCherry (FigureВ 1A) to produce HDC-hM3Dq mice. Intraperitoneal administration of CNO, but not saline, to these HDC-hM3Dq mice significantly increased their motor activity in an open area (FigureВ 1B) (saline, nВ = 4; CNO, nВ = 4, two-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni, вҲ—pВ < 0.05; вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.01; measurements taken 30В min post CNO or saline injection). In these mice, the hM3Dq-mCherry receptor was selectively expressed in most histaminergic neurons (348 mCherry-positive cells out of 405 HDC-positive cells were counted across three animals; 85%В Вұ 3.5% of the HDC-neurons were mCherry positive) (FigureВ 1C). Using whole-cell recording in acute slices from the TMN area of HDC-hM3Dq mice (nВ = 4 mice), we demonstrated that CNO significantly (paired t test, pВ < 0.05) depolarized TMN neurons by вҲј5В mV (nВ = 11 cells, control, вҲ’46В Вұ 3В mV; CNO,В вҲ’41В Вұ 2В mV). This was sufficient to elicit action potential (AP) firing in silent cells (5 out of 11) or increase AP firing rate in spontaneously active cells (FigureВ 1D). Thus, selectively activating histaminergic neurons generated hyperlocomotion and behavioral arousal. In spite of this excitatory effect on behavior, histaminergic TMN cells contain GABA and its synthetic enzyme GAD67 (gad1) (Airaksinen etВ al., 1992Airaksinen M.S. Alanen S. Szabat E. Visser T.J.

Hypothalamic gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons project to the neocortex.Science. 1983; 220: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). By immunocytochemistry, we found that a majority of HDC-positive neurons costained strongly with GAD67 antisera (1,399 GAD67-positive cells out of 1,720 HDC-positive cells were counted across three animals; 81%В Вұ 10% of the HDC neurons were GAD67 positive; FigureВ 2A). We corroborated this result genetically by crossing HDC-Cre mice with conditional rosa-lox-stop-lox-YFP mice (Srinivas etВ al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). In these crosses, 85%В Вұ 5% (nВ = 3 mice) of YFP-positive neurons in the TMN also expressed GAD67 (FigureВ 2B). Conventionally, if histaminergic neurons were to release GABA, they should also express the vesicular GABA transporter (vgat, Slc32a1) gene. With the exception of midbrain dopamine neurons (Tritsch etВ al., 2012Tritsch N.X. Ding J.B. Sabatini B.L.

Thus histaminergic neurons express the vgat gene and have the potential to package GABA into vesicles. To remove the putative GABAergic function from histaminergic neurons, we considered crossing either vgatlox/lox mice or double gad1lox/lox/gad2lox/lox mice with the HDC-Cre mice. However, the hdc-cre, vgat, gad1, and gad2 genes are all in the same region of mouse chromosome 2, which precluded easy generation of homozygous HDC-Cre/vgatlox/lox or HDC-Cre/gad1lox/lox/gad2lox/lox animals. We therefore developed vgat-selective shRNA constructs to knock down vgat expression (FigureВ 3 and see FigureВ S1 available online). For this we placed putative vgat shRNA sequences into a microRNA gene, mir30, in the 3вҖІ untranslated region of a transcript that also encodes dsRed (Stegmeier etВ al., 2005Stegmeier F. Hu G. Rickles R.J. Hannon G.J. Elledge S.J. A lentiviral microRNA-based system for single-copy polymerase II-regulated RNA interference in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13212-13217Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These constructs were termed dsRed-shvgat (oligo1, oligo2, or oligo3) (FigureВ 3A). We tested how well these constructs could reduce vgat reporter gene expression in transfected HEK293 cells by cotransfecting dsRed-shvgat (oligo1, oligo2, or oligo3) with CMV-vGAT, respectively. Two shRNAs strongly knocked down vgat reporter gene expression in HEK cells (Figures 3B and 3C, pВ < 0.05, t test). Before moving to the more challenging area of the TMN, we used a striatum-based motor assay to demonstrate that the constructs, delivered in AAVs, worked effectively inВ vivo (FigureВ S1). To compare the behavior produced by knockdown and knockout of vGAT in the caudate-putamen (CPu), we unilaterally injected AAV-dsRed-shvgat and AAV-Cre-2A-Venus into wild-type and vgatlox/lox mice, respectively, to generate CPu-vgat KD and CPu-О”vgat mice (Figures S1A and S1D). Both CPu-vgat KD and CPu-О”vgat groups had significantly decreased vgat transcript levels (Figures S1B and S1E) and increased ipsilateral turning compared with controls (Figures S1C and S1F). To knock down vgat expression selectively in histaminergic neurons, we placed the dsRed-shvgat and dsRed-scramble cassettes in reverse orientation between heterologous lox sites (a FLEX switch) (FigureВ 3D), so that expression could only be induced by CRE recombinase (Atasoy etВ al., 2008Atasoy D. Aponte Y. Su H.H. Sternson S.M. A FLEX switch targets Channelrhodopsin-2 to multiple cell types for imaging and long-range circuit mapping.J.В Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7025-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The AAV-flex-dsRed-shvgat or AAV-flex-dsRed-scramble viruses were bilaterally injected into the TMN area of HDC-Cre mice (FigureВ 3D). The groups of mice are referred to as HDC-vgat KD and HDC-scramble, respectively. We also injected AAV-Cre-2A-Venus and AAV-GFP into the TMN area of vgatlox/lox mice to produce TMN-О”vgat and TMN-GFP mice, respectively (FigureВ 3F). In TMN-О”vgat mice, the injections covered the TMN area; 77%В Вұ 2% of HDC-positive neurons expressed Cre-2A-Venus (FigureВ S2). In the TMN, all of the GAD67-positive neurons also contained HDC (FigureВ 2A). These TMN-О”vgat mice formed an approximate comparison for the HDC-vgat KD mice, with the caveat that some GABAergic cells in the TMN area in addition to the histaminergic cells could be affected. We tested the vgat gene expression levels in the TMN area of HDC-vgat KD and TMN-О”vgat mice by both qPCR on tissue punches and also single-cell qPCR from identified neurons in acute brain slices prepared from the TMN area (FigureВ S3). The tissue-punch analysis showed that in both TMN-О”vgat and HDC-vgat KD mice, vgat mRNA levels in the TMN were significantly decreased compared with those in TMN-GFP or HDC-scramble mice (TMN-GFP, 1В ВұВ 0.06 versus TMN-О”vgat, 0.5В Вұ 0.06, t test, вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.01; HDC-scramble, 1В Вұ 0.04 versus HDC-vgat KD, 0.76В Вұ 0.05, t test, вҲ—pВ < 0.05) (Figures S3AвҖ“S3C). The single-cell qPCR showed that in both TMN-О”vgat and HDC-vgat KD mice, the vgat mRNA levels from identified single neurons were also significantly decreased compared with those in TMN-GFP or HDC-scramble mice (TMN-GFP, 1В Вұ 0.46 versus TMN-О”vgat, 0.06В Вұ 0.02, t test, вҲ—pВ < 0.05; HDC-scramble, 1В Вұ 0.24 versus HDC-vgat KD, 0.35В Вұ 0.17, t test, вҲ—pВ < 0.05) (Figures S3DвҖ“S3G). The content of histamine in the neocortex and caudate-putamen of HDC-vgat KD and TMN-О”vgat mice was unchanged (see FigureВ S4). We first quantified the general activity of the mice. In an open field assay, HDC-vgat KD mice ran significantly further and had higher instantaneous speeds than the HDC-scramble controls, maintaining a stable and high activity for the 30В min duration of the test (FigureВ 3E; HDC-scramble, nВ = 7; HDC-vgat KD, nВ = 8, two-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni, вҲ—pВ < 0.05; вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.01). Similarly, the TMN-О”vgat mice were continuously more active compared with TMN-GFP control mice (FigureВ 3G; TMN-GFP, nВ = 10; TMN-О”vgat, nВ = 6, two-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni, вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.01; вҲ—вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.001). In fact, the activity of the TMN-О”vgat mice, as measured by instantaneous speed and distance covered, tended to increase toward the end of the experiment (FigureВ 3G). We used EEG/EMG analysis to assess the sleep-wake cycle (Figures 4 and S5A). The HDC-vgat KD and TMN-О”vgat mice exhibited similar changes in their sleep-wake behavior, largely confined to the night. First we describe the HDC-vgat KD (nВ =В 6) and HDC-scramble (nВ = 6) groups (Figures 4AвҖ“4C and S5B). For the first half of the night, HDC-vgat KD mice had significantly more wake than the HDC-scramble controls (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5B) (wake, HDC-scramble, 400В Вұ 13В min versus HDC-vgat KD, 511В Вұ 15В min, t test, вҲ—вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.001). The example in FigureВ 4A shows the EEG from an HDC-vgat KD mouse that was awake continuously for 6В hr during the first half of the night. In fact, during the night, HDC-vgat KD mice had only about 65% of normal NREM sleep compared with HDC-scramble mice (NREM, HDC-scramble, 293В Вұ 12В min versus HDC-vgat KD, 190В Вұ 14В min, t test, вҲ—вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.001). Their REM sleep was also slightly decreased (HDC-scramble, 22В Вұ 2В min versus HDC-vgat KD, 17В Вұ 2В min, t test, вҲ—pВ < 0.05). The EEG Оё power of HDC-vgat KD mice was significantly increased selectively during the night (FigureВ 4C) (two-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni, вҲ—вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.001), consistent with the heightened wakefulness of HDC-vgat KD mice (FigureВ 4B). In the day, both the HDC-vgat KD and HDC-scramble mice showed a similar sleep-wake patternвҖ”with the same amount of NREM sleep and wake (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5B; wake, HDC-scramble (nВ = 6), 243В Вұ 10В min versus HDC-vgat KD (nВ = 6), 252В Вұ 18В min, t test, p > 0.05; NREM, HDC-scramble (nВ = 6), 425В Вұ 10В min versus HDC-vgat KD (nВ =В 6), 409В Вұ 12В min, t test, p > 0.05). Similar to HDC-vgat KD mice, TMN-О”vgat mice had a strong вҖңsustained wakefulnessвҖқ phenotype confined to the night (Figures 4D, 4E, and S5C). Compared with the TMN-GFP controls (nВ = 5), TMN-О”vgat (nВ = 7) animals were awake nearly the whole night (TMN-GFP, 411В Вұ 9В min versus TMN-О”vgat, 586В Вұ 27В min, tВ test, вҲ—вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.001). Conversely, these TMN-О”vgat mice exhibited little NREM sleep during the dark period (Figures 4E and S5C; TMN-GFP, 258В Вұ 12В min versus TMN-О”vgat, 118В Вұ 25В min, t test, вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.01). Their amount of REM sleep was also decreased (TMN-GFP, 48В Вұ 9В min versus TMN-О”vgat, 13В Вұ 3В min, t test, вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.01). Similar to the HDC-vgat KD mice, selectively during the night, TMN-О”vgat mice had a strong increase of their maximum Оё power frequency (FigureВ 4F). Thus both the HDC-vgat KD and TMN-О”vgat mice slept less. Their loss of sleep during the dark phase was not balanced by a corresponding increase in sleep duration during the day (two-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni, вҲ—вҲ—вҲ—pВ < 0.001). Given the lack of sleep displayed by the HDC-vgat KD and TMN-О”vgat mice during a typical 24В hr cycle, we investigated how they behaved after sleep deprivation. Compared with control mice, would they demonstrate more recovery sleep to compensate for general lack of sleep during the normal sleep-wake cycle? Mice were sleep deprived for 5В hr during the beginning of the day by presenting them with novel objects. After sleep deprivation, mice were allowed recovery sleep in their home cages (FigureВ S6"
https://openalex.org/W1623601970,"Sox9 is a transcription factor expressed in most solid tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Sox9 function during tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, using a genetic mouse model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most frequent cancer in humans, we show that Sox9 is expressed from the earliest step of tumor formation in a Wnt/β-catenin-dependent manner. Deletion of Sox9 together with the constitutive activation of Hedgehog signaling completely prevents BCC formation and leads to a progressive loss of oncogene-expressing cells. Transcriptional profiling of oncogene-expressing cells with Sox9 deletion, combined with in vivo ChIP sequencing, uncovers a cancer-specific gene network regulated by Sox9 that promotes stemness, extracellular matrix deposition, and cytoskeleton remodeling while repressing epidermal differentiation. Our study identifies the molecular mechanisms regulated by Sox9 that link tumor initiation and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2274570194,"The tuberculous granuloma is an elaborately organized structure and one of the main histological hallmarks of tuberculosis. Macrophages, which are important immunologic effector and antigen-presenting cells, are the main cell type found in the tuberculous granuloma and have high plasticity. Macrophage polarization during bacterial infection has been elucidated in numerous recent studies; however, macrophage polarization during tuberculous granuloma formation and development has rarely been reported. It remains to be clarified whether differences in the activation status of macrophages affect granuloma formation. In this study, the variation in macrophage polarization during the formation and development of tuberculous granulomas was investigated in both sections of lung tissues from tuberculosis patients and an in vitro tuberculous granuloma model. The roles of macrophage polarization in this process were also investigated. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection was found to induce monocyte-derived macrophage polarization. In the in vitro tuberculous granuloma model, macrophage transformation from M1 to M2 was observed over time following M. tuberculosis infection. M2 macrophages were found to predominate in both necrotic and non-necrotic granulomas from tuberculosis patients, while both M1 and M2 polarized macrophages were found in the non-granulomatous lung tissues. Furthermore, it was found that M1 macrophages promote granuloma formation and macrophage bactericidal activity in vitro, while M2 macrophages inhibit these effects. The findings of this study provide insights into the mechanism by which M. tuberculosis circumvents the host immune system as well as a theoretical foundation for the development of novel tuberculosis therapies based on reprogramming macrophage polarization."

We have identified cytokine, signaling, and transcription factors that are required for cachexia in the mouse C26 colon carcinoma model of cancer. C2C12 myotubes treated with conditioned medium from C26 cancer cells induced atrophy and activated a STAT-dependent reporter gene but not reporter genes dependent on SMAD, FOXO, C/EBP, NF-κB, or AP-1. Of the gp130 family members IL-11, IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), only OSM and LIF were sufficient to activate the STAT reporter in myotubes. LIF was elevated in C26 conditioned medium (CM), but IL-6, OSM, TNFα, and myostatin were not. A LIF-blocking antibody abolished C26 CM-induced STAT reporter activation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and myotube atrophy but blocking antibodies to IL-6 or OSM did not. JAK2 inhibitors also blocked C26 CM-induced STAT reporter activation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and atrophy in myotubes. LIF at levels found in the C26 CM was sufficient for STAT reporter activation and atrophy in myotubes. In vivo, an increase in serum LIF preceded the increase in IL-6 in mice with C26 tumors. Overexpression of a dominant negative Stat3Cβ-EGFP gene in myotubes and in mouse muscle blocked the atrophy caused by C26 CM or C26 tumors, respectively.

Cancer cachexia is the systematic loss of body weight that cannot be reversed by diet and is a burden often determining the prognosis of the disease. In up to 30% of all cancers it leads to death through a combination of extreme weakness, decreased resistance to infection, and the inability to tolerate needed therapy (1Tisdale M.J.

STAT3 activation in skeletal muscle links muscle wasting and the acute phase response in cancer cachexia.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e22538 Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from the ATCC and used within the first 15 passages. C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM/10% FBS, passed at least every 2 days, and differentiated in DMEM/2% horse serum (HS) for 4 days. Transfections were done on C2C12 myoblasts using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for reporter assays and GeneCellin (Bulldog Bio, Portsmouth, NH) for transfections when myotube diameters were measured, with the following details. For Effectene, myoblasts were seeded in growth medium at 5 × 104 cells/well on a 24-well plate the night before transfection in growth medium. 12–16 h later, DNA (0.5 μg/well)-Effectene mixes were added to the cells in differentiation medium. For GeneCellin, cells were seeded in growth medium at 5 × 105 cells/well on a 6-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, cells were switched to differentiation medium and transfected with 2 μg of DNA/well for a 6-well plate using GeneCellin transfection reagent. The medium was refreshed 24 h later. Conditioned medium for C26 cells was made using the method of Lokireddy et al. (10Lokireddy S. Wijesoma I.W. Bonala S. Wei M. Sze S.K. McFarlane C. Kambadur R. Sharma M. Myostatin is a novel tumoral factor that induces cancer cachexia.Biochem. J. 2012; 446: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). C26 cells and C2C12 myoblasts were grown in 5% FBS or 10% FBS, respectively, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. When the plates reached a confluency of >90%, the growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and three times with DMEM with no serum plus antibiotics and glutamine. It was found to be important that conditioned medium was taken from the cells in medium without serum. Fetal bovine serum contains myostatin (see below) and induces C26 cells to produce IL-6 at a level 50-fold higher than when it is not present. C26 cells were grown in DMEM plus antibiotics and glutamine with no serum for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was collected and centrifuged in 50-ml Falcon tubes at 4500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-micron filter in a sterile environment. Aliquots of the filtered medium were stored at −80 °C for up to a year. Conditioned medium treatment was 33% CM in differentiation medium (2% HS in DMEM plus antibiotics and glutamine). Treatment for controls was 33% DMEM plus antibiotics and glutamine without serum. C2C12 myoblasts in growth serum were plated on a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and left overnight for attachment. Cells were then switched to differentiation medium and transfected with 0.5 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.05 μg of EGFP/well. The differentiation medium was changed 24 h later, and was EGFP visualized for transfection efficiency. Cells were treated 4 days post-transfection, lysed with 200 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was measured as detailed previously (20Yamaki T. Wu C.L. Gustin M. Lim J. Jackman R.W. Kandarian S.C. Rel A/p65 is required for cytokine-induced myotube atrophy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C135-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The antibodies for Western blots were anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705, catalog no. 9139), anti-STAT3 (catalog no. 9139), anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701, catalog no. 7649), anti-STAT1 (catalog no. 9172), anti-phospho-STAT5 (Tyr-694, catalog no. 4322), anti-STAT5 (catalog no. 9363), anti-pERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204, catalog no. 4370), anti ERK1/2 (catalog no. 4695) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-myostatin (catalog no. AF788, R&D Systems), and anti-GAPDH (Sigma). Myotubes were lysed with 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) and 1 mm PMSF. The protein concentration of cell lysates was measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as detailed previously (21Cornwell E.W. Mirbod A. Wu C.L. Kandarian S.C. Jackman R.W. C26 cancer-induced muscle wasting is IKKβ-dependent and NF-κB-independent.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e87776 Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein signals were visualized using indirect immunostaining with infrared fluorescence imaging using a LiCor Odyssey imager. For phase and fluorescence micrographs of C2C12 myotubes, cultures were treated with differentiation medium supplemented with 33% DMEM (control) or 33% C26 CM for 48 h beginning at 3 d of differentiation. The myotubes were photographed and measured as detailed previously (20Yamaki T. Wu C.L. Gustin M. Lim J. Jackman R.W. Kandarian S.C. Rel A/p65 is required for cytokine-induced myotube atrophy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C135-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When needed, differentiated myotubes were visualized with MF20, a sarcomeric myosin-specific antibody from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa), followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies). Total RNA was isolated from myotubes treated with LIF for 4, 8, or 24 h and from vehicle-treated (PBS) myotubes at each time point. Each of these six groups contained three independent samples. Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and quantity and quality were measured by NanoDrop spectroscopy and Agilent Bioanalyzer assay. The Boston University Microarray Resource Core Facility performed first-strand synthesis and hybridization to Affymetrix mouse 1.0 ST arrays. For microarray studies, the RNA samples in each of the six groups were pooled. For quantitative real-time PCR, RNA samples were converted to cDNA with the Qiagen QuantiTect kit, followed by real-time quantitative PCR on an ABI 7300 thermal cycler using Fast Advanced Master Mix and TaqMan primer-probe sets purchased from Life Technologies. The probe sets were as follows: Mm00545913_s1, Socs3; Mm00504306_m1, Bcl-3; Mm00786711_s1, CEBPδ; Mm01275601_g1, Bnip3; Mm00432307_m1, Casp4; Mm01197698_m1, Gusb; and Mm01545399_m1, Hprt. Mice with C26 tumors were prepared as described previously (21Cornwell E.W. Mirbod A. Wu C.L. Kandarian S.C. Jackman R.W. C26 cancer-induced muscle wasting is IKKβ-dependent and NF-κB-independent.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e87776 Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Eight-week-old male CDF1 mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were used for all experiments. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations given in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number 12–016). Plasmids were prepared and injected into mouse tibialis anterior (TA) muscles 14 days after C26 tumor cell inoculations, as detailed previously (21Cornwell E.W. Mirbod A. Wu C.L. Kandarian S.C. Jackman R.W. C26 cancer-induced muscle wasting is IKKβ-dependent and NF-κB-independent.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e87776 Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On day 25 post-inoculation, TA muscles were removed from control and C26 tumor-bearing mice and prepared for analysis. The myofiber cross-sectional area was measured as detailed previously (21Cornwell E.W. Mirbod A. Wu C.L. Kandarian S.C. Jackman R.W. C26 cancer-induced muscle wasting is IKKβ-dependent and NF-κB-independent.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e87776 Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TA muscle fiber cross-sectional areas of plasmid-transfected fibers (green) were compared with fiber areas in the same fields that did not take up the plasmid (black) in both tumor-bearing and control mice. Laminin was stained with an antibody coupled to Texas Red-X to demarcate the muscle fiber membranes. For one variable analysis, an unpaired Student's t test was used to determine significant difference. For multivariable analysis, a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test was used. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical difference was defined at p < 0.05. To focus on the factors that trigger muscle wasting in C26 mouse colon carcinoma, we used medium from C26 cells and treated cultured myotubes. First, we isolated C26 CM to verify that it produced atrophy, as measured by decreased myotube diameters of differentiated C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 1A). A 15% decrease in myotube diameter could be seen as early as 24 h after addition of the C26 CM, and there was a 20% decrease in diameter at 48 h (Fig. 1B). To test a role for several transcription factors as expediently as possible in CM-treated myotubes, we transfected a series of transcription factor-dependent reporter genes into myoblasts, differentiated the cultures to myotubes, and surveyed them for inducibility by C26 CM (Fig. 1C). Despite several transcription factors being implicated in different types of cancer cachexia in the literature, including AP-1 (2Argilés J.M. Busquets S. López-Soriano F.J.

Although data for 4 h are shown, reporters dependent on the other transcription factors did not respond to CM at any time over a 24-h time period (data not shown). A time course showed that the STAT reporter was activated significantly by 1 h after C26 CM addition, peaked at 2 h after CM addition, and continued to be elevated for 8 h (Fig. 1D). We next tested the source of STAT induction in the C26 CM by treating C2C12 myotubes with a battery of cytokines that are active in the JAK/STAT pathway and that have been found in the serum of C26 cachectic mice (6Yasumoto K.

We added 10 ng/ml of IL-11, IL-6, OSM, or LIF to the myotubes and assayed for STAT reporter activity (Fig. 2A). OSM and LIF were able to markedly induce the STAT reporter, whereas IL-6 had a smaller effect. To test whether these cytokines were responsible for CM-induced STAT reporter activation in myotubes, blocking antibodies were added to the myotubes treated with C26 CM (Fig. 2, B–D). The results show that the antibodies were effective against their particular ligands, but only the antibody to LIF could block the STAT reporter activity induced by C26 CM. We recently showed that an antibody to IL-6 blocks myotube atrophy because of IL-6 treatment (10 ng/ml), indicating the effectiveness of this antibody (20Yamaki T. Wu C.L. Gustin M. Lim J. Jackman R.W. Kandarian S.C. Rel A/p65 is required for cytokine-induced myotube atrophy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C135-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, C26 CM-induced STAT activation could not be blocked by the same IL-6-blocking antibody (Fig. 2D). We assayed C26 CM for levels of LIF and several other cytokines that could be inducing atrophy in our myotube model (Fig. 3A). TNFα or myostatin was not detected in C26 CM, as measured by ELISA. Also, myostatin was not detected in C26 CM, as measured by Western blot (Fig. 3B). The IL-6 concentration in C26 CM was 7 pg/ml, and this was not significantly different from the levels in C2C12 CM (Fig. 3A). The OSM concentration in C26 CM was ∼350 pg/ml, but this was not different from levels in C2C12 CM. LIF was elevated significantly in C26 CM compared with undetectable levels in C2C12 CM (Fig. 3A). LIF was sufficient to induce atrophy when tested at the C26 CM level of 370 pg/ml (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the blocking antibody to LIF completely blocked the myotube atrophy induced by the C26 CM (Fig. 3D). Although not elevated in C26 CM, high levels of IL-6 (10 or 100 ng/ml) are sufficient to induce atrophy in cultured myotubes, as we and others have shown (12Bonetto A. Aydogdu T. Jin X. Zhang Z. Zhan R. Puzis L. Koniaris L.G. Zimmers T.A. JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibition blocks skeletal muscle wasting downstream of IL-6 and in experimental cancer cachexia.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Because the STAT reporter was instrumental in leading our investigation into the signaling of C26 cachexia, we next studied the involvement of two major STATs. The activation of STAT is known to be due to specific phosphorylation (24Schindler C. Levy D.E. Decker T. JAK-STAT signaling: from interferons to cytokines.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20059-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), and so we investigated the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 by C26 CM and LIF. The time course for the appearance of pSTAT3 (Fig. 4A) and pSTAT1 (Fig. 4B) when C2C12 myotubes were treated with C26 CM or with LIF showed the following. There is a strong phosphorylation of STAT3 a"

Recent genome-wide chromatin states mapping efforts revealed that DNA elements are associated with characteristic chromatin modification signatures, based on which several approaches have been developed to predict transcriptional enhancers. However, their practical application is limited by incomplete extraction of chromatin features and model inconsistency for predicting enhancers across different cell types. To address these issues, we define a set of non-redundant shape features of histone modifications, which shows high consistency across cell types and can greatly reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. Integrating shape features with a machine-learning algorithm AdaBoost, we developed an enhancer predicting method, DELTA (Distal Enhancer Locating Tool based on AdaBoost). We show that DELTA significantly outperforms current enhancer prediction methods in prediction accuracy on different datasets and can predict enhancers in one cell type using models trained in other cell types without loss of accuracy. Overall, our study presents a novel framework for accurately identifying enhancers from epigenetic data across multiple cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2121702635,"We investigated the role of periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). In OA, dysregulated gene expression and phenotypic changes in articular chondrocytes culminate in progressive loss of cartilage from the joint surface. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We examined periostin expression by immunohistochemical analysis of lesional and nonlesional cartilage from human and rodent OA knee cartilage. In addition, we used small interfering (si)RNA and adenovirus transduction of chondrocytes to knock down and up-regulate periostin levels, respectively, and analyzed its effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, a disintegrin and MMP with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4, and type II collagen expression. We found high periostin levels in human and rodent OA cartilage. Periostin increased MMP-13 expression dose [1-10 µg/ml (EC50 0.5-1 μg/ml)] and time (24-72 h) dependently, significantly enhanced expression of ADAMTS4 mRNA, and promoted cartilage degeneration through collagen and proteoglycan degradation. Periostin induction of MMP-13 expression was inhibited by CCT031374 hydrobromide, an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous periostin blocked constitutive MMP-13 expression. These findings implicate periostin as a catabolic protein that promotes cartilage degeneration in OA by up-regulating MMP-13 through canonical Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W818174151,"The α1β1 collagen receptor is only present in a few epithelial cell types. In the intestine, it is specifically expressed in proliferating crypt cells. This integrin has been reported to be involved in various cancers where it mediates the downstream activation of the Ras/ERK proliferative pathway. We have recently shown that integrin α1β1 is present in two-thirds of colon adenocarcinomas, but the mechanism by which ITGA1 expression is regulated is not known. DNA methylation, involved in ITGA1 repression during megakaryocyte differentiation, is not the mechanism of ITGA1 regulation in colorectal cancer cells. Our in silico analysis of the ITGA1 promoter revealed two response elements for MYC, an oncogenic factor known to regulate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In situ, the expressions of both MYC and ITGA1 are localized in the lower crypt of the normal colon and correlate in 72% of the 65 analyzed colorectal cancers. MYC pharmacological inhibition or downregulation of expression with short hairpin RNA in HT29, T84 and SW480 cells resulted in reduced ITGA1 expression at both the transcript and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that MYC was bound to the chromatin region of the ITGA1 proximal promoter, whereas MYC overexpression enhanced ITGA1 promoter activity that was reduced with MAD co-transfection or by the disruption of the response elements. We concluded that MYC is a key regulating factor for the control of ITGA1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1553675845,"The construction of spinal sensory-motor circuits involves the selection of appropriate synaptic partners and the allocation of precise synaptic input densities. Many aspects of spinal sensory-motor selectivity appear to be preserved when peripheral sensory activation is blocked, which has led to a view that sensory-motor circuits are assembled in an activity-independent manner. Yet it remains unclear whether activity-dependent refinement has a role in the establishment of connections between sensory afferents and those motor pools that have synergistic biomechanical functions. We show here that genetically abolishing central sensory-motor neurotransmission leads to a selective enhancement in the number and density of such ""heteronymous"" connections, whereas other aspects of sensory-motor connectivity are preserved. Spike-timing-dependent synaptic refinement represents one possible mechanism for the changes in connectivity observed after activity blockade. Our findings therefore reveal that sensory activity does have a limited and selective role in the establishment of patterned monosynaptic sensory-motor connections."
https://openalex.org/W892366173,"Interleukin (IL)-12 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates T-helper type 1 responses and cytotoxic T-cell activation, contributing to its utility as anti-cancer agent. Systemic administration of IL-12 often results in unacceptable toxicity; therefore, strategies to direct delivery of IL-12 to tumors are under investigation. The objective of this study was to assist the preclinical development of NHS-IL12, an immunocytokine consisting of an antibody, which targets necrotic tumor regions, linked to IL-12. Specifically this study sought to evaluate the safety, serum pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor activity, and immune modulation of NHS-IL12 in dogs with naturally occurring cancers.A rapid dose-escalation study of NHS-IL12 administered subcutaneously to dogs with melanoma was conducted through the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC). Eleven dogs were enrolled in four dose-escalation cohorts; thereafter, an additional seven dogs were treated at the defined tolerable dose of 0.8 mg/m2. The expanded cohort at this fixed dose (ten dogs in total) was accrued for further pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics assessment. NHS-IL12 levels, serum cytokine concentrations, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell characterization (post-treatment) and draining lymph node immune profiling, and tumor biopsies (pre- and post-treatment) were collected. Adverse events included thrombocytopenia, liver enzymopathies, fever, and vasculitis. Correlation between interferon (IFN)-γ induction, adverse events, and NHS-IL12 exposure (maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve) were dose-dependent. Serum IL-10 levels and intratumoral CD8+ populations increased after treatment. Partial responses, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, were observed in two dogs treated with NHS-IL12 0.8 mg/m2 and 1.6 mg/m2.NHS-IL12 was administered safely to dogs with melanoma and both immunologic and clinical activity was observed. This study successfully defined a narrow therapeutic window for systemic delivery of NHS-IL12 via the subcutaneous route. Results will inform the design and implementation of first-in-human clinical trials of NHS-IL12 in cancer patients."

A cross-sectional study was conducted of university students in 49 universities across 7 cities in China from September 2007 to January 2008. We distributed 74,800 questionnaires, of which 69,842 were returned. In this paper, the data from 35,383 unmarried female university students were analyzed. The prevalence of sexual intercourse in unmarried female university students was 10.2%. The prevalence of unintended pregnancy in those sexually active female university students, was 31.8%. Among students with pregnancy, 53.5% experienced two or more pregnancies. 28.3% of the students with sexual intercourse reported that they always adopted contraceptive methods, and of those 82.9% chose to use male condoms. The majority (83.9%) of students with unintended pregnancy chose to terminate the latest pregnancy by surgical abortion or medical abortion. The contraceptive knowledge level of students who experienced unintended pregnancy was lower than those who did not. In China, about one third of unmarried female students with sexual intercourse experience unintended pregnancy. A variety of contraceptive methods are adopted, but the frequency of contraceptive use is low. Most of unmarried female students who experienced unintended pregnancy would choose to terminate the pregnancy with surgical or medical abortion.

https://openalex.org/W1540376590,"Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8) has been shown to influence various cellular functions. As monocytes and macrophages (Mϕ) express MMP8, we investigated if MMP8 played a role in macrophage differentiation and polarization. MMP8 expression was significantly increased during monocyte differentiation into Mϕ. Monocyte-derived Mϕ from MMP8-deficient mice expressed higher levels of M1-Mϕ markers but lower levels of M2-Mϕ markers than monocyte-derived Mϕ from wild-type mice. Although Mϕ from either MMP8-deficient or wild-type mice were inducible by interferon-γ into M1-Mϕ, only wild-type Mϕ but not MMP8-deficient Mϕ could be induced into M2-Mϕ by interleukin-4. However, MMP8-deficient Mϕ exposed to conditioned culture media of wild-type Mϕ developed a M2-Mϕ phenotype. Compared with conditioned culture media of wild-type Mϕ, conditioned culture media of MMP8-deficient Mϕ contained a lower concentration of active transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), an M2-Mϕ inducer. Moreover, evidence also showed that the degradation of the TGF-β sequester, fibromodulin, was modulated by MMP8.

Although Mϕ from either MMP8-deficient or wild-type mice were inducible by interferon-γ into M1-Mϕ, only wild-type Mϕ but not MMP8-deficient Mϕ could be induced into M2-Mϕ by interleukin-4. However, MMP8-deficient Mϕ exposed to conditioned culture media of wild-type Mϕ developed a M2-Mϕ phenotype. Compared with conditioned culture media of wild-type Mϕ, conditioned culture media of MMP8-deficient Mϕ contained a lower concentration of active transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), an M2-Mϕ inducer. Moreover, evidence also showed that the degradation of the TGF-β sequester, fibromodulin, was modulated by MMP8. The data indicate a previously unknown role of MMP8 in M2-Mϕ polarization by cleaving fibromodulin and therefore increasing the bioavailability of the M2-Mϕ inducer TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W1519215874,"Background Functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMD) have features associated with voluntary movement (e.g. distractibility) but patients report movements to be out of their control. One explanation for this phenomenon is that sense of agency for movement is impaired. The phenomenon of reduction in the intensity of sensory experience when movement is self-generated and a reduction in sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) amplitude at the onset of self-paced movement (sensory attenuation) have been linked to sense of agency for movement. Methods We compared amplitude of SEPs from median nerve stimulation at rest and at the onset of a self-paced movement of the thumb in 17 patients with FMD and 17 healthy controls. Results Patients showed lack of attenuation of SEPs at the onset of movement compared to reduction in amplitude of SEPs in controls. FMD patients had significantly different ratios of movement onset to rest SEPs than did healthy controls at each electrode: 0.79 in healthy controls and 1.35 in patients at F3 (t = -4.22, p<0.001), 0.78 in healthy controls and 1.12 at patients C3 (t = -3.15, p = 0.004) and 0.77 in healthy controls and 1.05 at patients P3 (t = -2.88, p = 0.007). Conclusions Patients with FMD have reduced sensory attenuation as measured by SEPs at onset of self-paced movement. This finding can be plausibly linked to impairment of sense of agency for movement in these patients."

The outcome measured is usually global TUG performance-time. Assessment of spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters during the Oriented gait and Turn sub-tasks of the TUG would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying patients' performance and therefore may help to guide rehabilitation. The aim of this study was thus to determine the spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters which were most related to the walking and turning sub-tasks of TUG performance in stroke patients.29 stroke patients carried out the TUG test which was recorded using an optoelectronic system in two conditions: spontaneous and standardized condition (standardized foot position and instructed to turn towards the paretic side). They also underwent a clinical assessment. Stepwise regression was used to determine the parameters most related to Oriented gait and Turn sub-tasks. Relationships between explanatory parameters of Oriented gait and Turn performance and clinical scales were evaluated using Spearman correlations.Step length and cadence explained 82% to 95% of the variance for the walking sub-tasks in both conditions. Percentage single support phase and contralateral swing phase (depending on the condition) respectively explained 27% and 56% of the variance during the turning sub-task in the spontaneous and standardized conditions.Step length, cadence, percentage of paretic single support phase and non-paretic swing phase, as well as dynamic stability were the main parameters related to TUG performance and they should be targeted in rehabilitation."

It is not clear whether cellular heterogeneity within a breast tumor results from transformation of bipotent basal cells or from transformation and subsequent basal conversion of the more differentiated luminal cells. Here we used a retroviral vector to express an oncogene specifically in a small number of the mammary luminal epithelial cells and tested their potential to produce basal cells during tumorigenesis. This in-vivo lineage-tracing work demonstrates that luminal cells are capable of producing basal cells on activation of either polyoma middle T antigen or ErbB2 signaling. These findings reveal the plasticity of the luminal compartment during tumorigenesis and provide an explanation for cellular heterogeneity within a cancer."

The mechanisms underpinning apoptosis activation following HSP90 inhibition and how they are modified during acquired drug resistance are unknown. We show for the first time that, to induce apoptosis, HSP90 inhibition requires the cooperation of multi BH3-only proteins (BID, BIK, PUMA) and the reciprocal suppression of the pro-survival BCL-2 family member MCL1, which occurs via inhibition of STAT5A. A subset of tumour cell lines exhibit dependence on MCL1 expression for survival and this dependence is also associated with tumour response to HSP90 inhibition. In the acquired resistance setting, MCL1 suppression in response to HSP90 inhibitors is maintained; however, a switch in MCL1 dependence occurs. This can be exploited by the BH3 peptidomimetic ABT737, through non-BCL-2-dependent synthetic lethality."

https://openalex.org/W1506428037,"Understanding the fundamental dynamics of epigenome variation during normal aging is critical for elucidating key epigenetic alterations that affect development, cell differentiation and diseases. Advances in the field of aging and DNA methylation strongly support the aging epigenetic drift model. Although this model aligns with previous studies, the role of other epigenetic marks, such as histone modification, as well as the impact of sampling specific CpGs, must be evaluated. Ultimately, it is crucial to investigate how all CpGs in the human genome change their methylation with aging in their specific genomic and epigenomic contexts. Here, we analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing DNA methylation maps of brain frontal cortex from individuals of diverse ages. Comparisons with blood data reveal tissue-specific patterns of epigenetic drift. By integrating chromatin state information, divergent degrees and directions of aging-associated methylation in different genomic regions are revealed. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing data also open a new door to investigate whether adjacent CpG sites exhibit coordinated DNA methylation changes with aging. We identified significant ‘aging-segments’, which are clusters of nearby CpGs that respond to aging by similar DNA methylation changes. These segments not only capture previously identified aging-CpGs but also include specific functional categories of genes with implications on epigenetic regulation of aging. For example, genes associated with development are highly enriched in positive aging segments, which are gradually hyper-methylated with aging. On the other hand, regions that are gradually hypo-methylated with aging (‘negative aging segments’) in the brain harbor genes involved in metabolism and protein ubiquitination. Given the importance of protein ubiquitination in proteome homeostasis of aging brains and neurodegenerative disorders, our finding suggests the significance of epigenetic regulation of this posttranslational modification pathway in the aging brain. Utilizing aging segments rather than individual CpGs will provide more comprehensive genomic and epigenomic contexts to understand the intricate associations between genomic neighborhoods and developmental and aging processes. These results complement the aging epigenetic drift model and provide new insights."
https://openalex.org/W1780088415,"Background Defective cellular transport processes can lead to aberrant accumulation of trace elements, iron, small molecules and hormones in the cell, which in turn may promote the formation of reactive oxygen species, promoting DNA damage and aberrant expression of key regulatory cancer genes. As DNA damage and uncontrolled proliferation are hallmarks of cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we hypothesized that inherited variation in the cellular transport genes contributes to EOC risk. Methods In total, DNA samples were obtained from 14,525 case subjects with invasive EOC and from 23,447 controls from 43 sites in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Two hundred seventy nine SNPs, representing 131 genes, were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium iSelect BeadChip as part of the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS). SNP analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression under a log-additive model, and the FDR q<0.2 was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results The most significant evidence of an association for all invasive cancers combined and for the serous subtype was observed for SNP rs17216603 in the iron transporter gene HEPH (invasive: OR = 0.85, P = 0.00026; serous: OR = 0.81, P = 0.00020); this SNP was also associated with the borderline/low malignant potential (LMP) tumors (P = 0.021). Other genes significantly associated with EOC histological subtypes (p<0.05) included the UGT1A (endometrioid), SLC25A45 (mucinous), SLC39A11 (low malignant potential), and SERPINA7 (clear cell carcinoma). In addition, 1785 SNPs in six genes (HEPH, MGST1, SERPINA, SLC25A45, SLC39A11 and UGT1A) were imputed from the 1000 Genomes Project and examined for association with INV EOC in white-European subjects. The most significant imputed SNP was rs117729793 in SLC39A11 (per allele, OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.5-4.35, p = 5.66x10-4). Conclusion These results, generated on a large cohort of women, revealed associations between inherited cellular transport gene variants and risk of EOC histologic subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W653849438,"The size of the human population is relevant to the development of a sustainable world, yet the forces setting growth or declines in the human population are poorly understood. Generally, population growth rates depend on whether new individuals compete for the same energy (leading to Malthusian or density-dependent growth) or help to generate new energy (leading to exponential and super-exponential growth). It has been hypothesized that exponential and super-exponential growth in humans has resulted from carrying capacity, which is in part determined by energy availability, keeping pace with or exceeding the rate of population growth. We evaluated the relationship between energy use and population size for countries with long records of both and the world as a whole to assess whether energy yields are consistent with the idea of an increasing carrying capacity. We find that on average energy use has indeed kept pace with population size over long time periods. We also show, however, that the energy-population scaling exponent plummets during, and its temporal variability increases preceding, periods of social, political, technological, and environmental change. We suggest that efforts to increase the reliability of future energy yields may be essential for stabilizing both population growth and the global socio-economic system."

https://openalex.org/W1956102933,"Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a trophic factor that is thought to have important roles in the regulating brain circuitry. Recent studies suggest that NRG1 regulates synaptic transmission, although the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report that NRG1 influences glutamate uptake by increasing the protein level of excitatory amino acid carrier (EAAC1). Our data indicate that NRG1 induced the up-regulation of EAAC1 in primary cortical neurons with an increase in glutamate uptake. These in vitro results were corroborated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice given NRG1. The stimulatory effect of NRG1 was blocked by inhibition of the NRG1 receptor ErbB4. The suppressed expression of ErbB4 by siRNA led to a decrease in the expression of EAAC1. In addition, the ablation of ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons in PV-ErbB4(-/-) mice suppressed EAAC1 expression. Taken together, our results show that NRG1 signaling through ErbB4 modulates EAAC1. These findings link proposed effectors in schizophrenia: NRG1/ErbB4 signaling perturbation, EAAC1 deficit, and neurotransmission dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1599707061,"DNA repair is critical for the maintenance of genome stability. Upon genotoxic stress, dysregulated DNA repair may induce apoptosis. Translin-associated factor X (TRAX), which was initially identified as a binding partner of Translin, has been implicated in genome stability. However, the exact role of TRAX in DNA repair remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that TRAX participates in the ATM/H2AX-mediated DNA repair machinery by interacting with ATM and stabilizing the MRN complex at double-strand breaks. The exogenous expression of wild-type (WT) TRAX, but not a TRAX variant lacking the nuclear localization signal (NLS), rescued the vulnerability of TRAX-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). This finding confirms the importance of the nuclear localization of TRAX in the repair of DNA damage. Compared with WT MEFs, TRAX-null MEFs exhibited impaired DNA repair (for example, reduced phosphorylation of ATM and H2AX) after treatment with ultra violet-C or γ-ray irradiation and a higher incidence of p53-mediated apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate that TRAX is required for MRN complex-ATM-H2AX signaling, which optimizes DNA repair by interacting with the activated ATM and protects cells from genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1490487906,"Many human malignancies lack de novo biosynthesis of arginine (Arg) as the key enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) is silenced. These tumors acquire ectopic Arg for survival, and depleting this source by Arg-depleting recombinant enzyme ADI-PEG20 results in cell death. Mechanisms underlying Arg auxotrophy in these tumors and how they respond to Arg-auxotrophic stress are poorly understood. Here, we report that an immediate-early event of Arg-auxotrophic response involves reactive oxygen species-mediated secretion of Gas6, which interacts with its receptor Axl and activates the downstream Ras/PI3K/Akt growth signal leading to accumulation of c-Myc by protein stabilization. Arg-auxotrophic challenge also transcriptionally upregulates c-Myc expression, which provides a feedback mechanism to enhance Axl expression. c-Myc is a positive regulator of ASS1, but elevated ASS1 provides a feedback mechanism to suppress c-Myc and Axl. Our results revealed multiple inter-regulatory pathways in Arg-auxotrophic response, consisting of Axl, c-Myc and ASS1, which regulate Arg homeostasis and ADI-PEG20 sensitivity. These pathways provide potential targets for improving the efficacy of treating Arg-auxotrophic tumors using Arg-deprivation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1593282536,"The oscillatory expression of Notch signaling in neural progenitors suggests that both repressors and activators of neural fate specification are expressed in the same progenitors. Since Notch1 regulates photoreceptor differentiation and contributes (together with Notch3) to ganglion cell fate specification, we hypothesized that genes encoding photoreceptor and ganglion cell fate activators would be highly expressed in Notch1 receptor-bearing (Notch1+) progenitors, directing these cells to differentiate into photoreceptors or into ganglion cells when Notch1 activity is diminished. To identify these genes, we used microarray analysis to study expression profiles of whole retinas and isolated from them Notch1+ cells at embryonic day 14 (E14) and postnatal day 0 (P0). To isolate Notch1+ cells, we utilized immunomagnetic cell separation. We also used Notch3 knockout (Notch3KO) animals to evaluate the contribution of Notch3 signaling in ganglion cell differentiation. Hierarchical clustering of 6,301 differentially expressed genes showed that Notch1+ cells grouped near the same developmental stage retina cluster. At E14, we found higher expression of repressors (Notch1, Hes5) and activators (Dll3, Atoh7, Otx2) of neuronal differentiation in Notch1+ cells compared to whole retinal cell populations. At P0, Notch1, Hes5, and Dll1 expression was significantly higher in Notch1+ cells than in whole retinas. Otx2 expression was more than thirty times higher than Atoh7 expression in Notch1+ cells at P0. We also observed that retinas of wild type animals had only 14% (P < 0.05) more ganglion cells compared to Notch3KO mice. Since this number is relatively small and Notch1 has been shown to contribute to ganglion cell fate specification, we suggested that Notch1 signaling may play a more significant role in RGC development than the Notch3 signaling cascade. Finally, our findings suggest that Notch1+ progenitors—since they heavily express both pro-ganglion cell (Atoh7) and pro-photoreceptor cell (Otx2) activators—can differentiate into either ganglion cells or photoreceptors."

These descriptors are obtained from the fractal dimension of the object computed at a range of scales. In this way, they provide rich information regarding the spatial distribution of the analysed structure and, as a consequence, they measure the multiscale morphology of the object of interest. In Biology, such morphology is of great importance because it is related to evolutionary aspects and is successfully employed to characterize and discriminate among different biological structures. Here, the fractal descriptors are used to identify the species of plants based on the image of their leaves. A large number of samples are examined, being 606 leaf samples of 50 species from Brazilian flora. The results are compared to other imaging methods in the literature and demonstrate that fractal descriptors are precise and reliable in the taxonomic process of plant species identification."

Numerous studies have examined the determinants of neonatal mortality, but few have explored neonatal danger signs which potentially cause morbidity. This study assessed danger signs observed in neonates at birth, determined the correlations of multiple danger signs and complications between neonates and their mothers, and identified factors associated with neonatal danger signs.A cross-sectional study was conducted in three sites across Ghana between July and September in 2013. Using two-stage random sampling, we recruited 1,500 pairs of neonates and their mothers who had given birth within the preceding two years. We collected data on their socio-demographic characteristics, utilization of maternal and neonatal health services, and experiences with neonatal danger signs and maternal complications. We calculated the correlations of multiple danger signs and complications between neonates and their mothers, and performed multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with neonatal danger signs.More than 25% of the neonates were born with danger signs. At-birth danger signs in neonates were correlated with maternal delivery complications (r = 0.20, p < 0.001), and neonatal complications within the first six weeks of life (r = 0.19, p < 0.001). However, only 29.1% of neonates with danger signs received postnatal care in the first two days, and 52.4% at two weeks of life. In addition to maternal complications during delivery, maternal age less than 20 years, maternal education level lower than secondary school, and fewer than four antenatal care visits significantly predicted neonatal danger signs.Over a quarter of neonates are born with danger signs. Maternal factors can be used to predict neonatal health condition at birth. Management of maternal health and close medical attention to high-risk neonates are crucial to reduce neonatal morbidity in Ghana."

Here we evaluated two cohorts: i) one of 58 HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESNs) who were compared with 59 healthy controls (HCs), and ii) another of 13 HIV-controllers who were compared with 20 HIV-progressors. Peripheral blood, oral and genital mucosa and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) samples were obtained to analyze the mRNA expression of ELAFIN, APOBEC3G, SAMHD1, TRIM5α, RNase 7 and SerpinA1 using real-time PCR. Results HESNs exhibited higher expression of all antiviral factors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), oral or genital mucosa when compared with HCs. Furthermore, HIV-controllers exhibited higher levels of SerpinA1 in GALT.

Methods Data from 560 lymph node biopsy reports of specimens from patients older than 12 years at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH) between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012 was extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), division of Anatomical Pathology. Cytology reports of lymph node fine needle aspirates (FNAs) performed prior to lymph node biopsy in 203 patients were also extracted from the NHLS. Consent was not obtained from participants for their records to be used as patient information was anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. Results The majority of patients were female (55%) and of the African/black racial group (90%). The median age of patients was 40 years (range12–94). The most common indication for biopsy was an uncertain diagnosis (more than two differential diagnoses entertained), followed by a suspicion for lymphoma, carcinoma and TB. Overall, malignancy constituted the largest biopsy pathology group (39%), with 36% of this group being carcinoma and 27% non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 22% of the total sampled nodes displayed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (including histopathology and cytology demonstrating definite, and suspicious for mycobacterial infection), 8% comprised HIV reactive nodes; in the remainder no specific pathology was identified (nonspecific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia). Kaposi sarcoma (KS) accounted for 2.5% of lymph node pathology in this sample. Concomitant lymph node pathology was diagnosed in four cases of nodal KS (29% of the subset). The co-existing pathologies were TB and Castleman disease. HIV positive patients constituted 49% of this study sample and the majority (64%) of this subset had CD4 counts less than 350 cells/ul. 27% were HIV negative and in the remaining nodes, the HIV status of patients was unknown. The most common lymph node pathologies in HIV positive patients were Mycobacterial infection (31%), HIV reactive nodes (15%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (15%) and nonspecific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (15%). Only 8.7% were of Hodgkin lymphoma. In contrast, the most common lymph node pathologies in HIV negative patients were nonspecific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (45%), carcinoma (25%) and Mycobacterial infection (11%). In this group, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma constituted 9% and 8%, respectively. There were more cases of high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the HIV positive group compared to the HIV negative group. FNA and lymph node biopsy had statistically significant good agreement with regard to Hodgkin lymphoma (K 0.774, SE 0.07, 95% CI 0.606-0.882, p=0.001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (K 0.640, SE 0.07, 95% CI 0.472-0.807, p=0.001), carcinoma (K 0.723, SE 0.069, 95% CI 0.528-0.918, p=0.001), and mycobacterial infection (K 0.726, SE 0.07, 95% CI 0.618-0.833, p=0.001). Conclusions The most common lymph node pathologies in CHBAH are malignancies, nonspecific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and HIV reactive nodes. The distribution of disease differs in HIV positive patients. Overall, adequate FNA samples of lymph nodes have been found to have good correlation with lymph node biopsy findings in our setting."

Previous studies reported that network diffusion generally outperforms direct neighborhood for human diseases. Although prioritization power is generally measured for all ranked genes, only the top candidates are significant for subsequent functional analysis. We found that high prioritizing power of a network algorithm for all genes cannot guarantee successful prioritization of top ranked candidates for a given phenotype. Indeed, the majority of the phenotypes that were more efficiently prioritized by network diffusion showed higher prioritizing power for top candidates by direct neighborhood. We also found that connectivity among pathway genes for each phenotype largely determines which network algorithm is more effective, suggesting that the network algorithm used for each phenotype should be chosen with consideration of pathway gene connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1607364197,"Research on the ecology of sympatric dolphins has increased worldwide in recent decades. However, many dolphin associations such as that between common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) are poorly understood. The present study was conducted in the San Matías Gulf (SMG) ecosystem (North Patagonia, Argentina) where a high diet overlap among both species was found. The main objective of the present work was to explore the niche overlap of common and dusky dolphins in the habitat and temporal dimensions. The specific aims were (a) to evaluate the habitat use strategies of both species through a comparison of their group attributes (social composition, size and activity), and (b) to evaluate their habitat preferences and habitat overlap through Environmental Niche modeling considering two oceanographic seasons. To accomplish these aims, we used a historic database of opportunistic and systematic records collected from 1983 to 2011. Common and dusky dolphins exhibited similar patterns of group size (from less than 10 to more than 100 individuals), activity (both species use the area to feed, nurse, and copulate), and composition (adults, juveniles, and mothers with calves were observed for both species). Also, both species were observed travelling and feeding in mixed-species groups. Specific overlap indices were higher for common dolphins than for dusky dolphins, but all indices were low, suggesting that they are mainly segregated in the habitat dimension. In the case of common dolphins, the best habitats were located in the northwest of the gulf far from the coast. In the warm season they prefer areas with temperate sea surface and in the cold season they prefer areas with relatively high variability of sea surface temperature. Meanwhile, dusky dolphins prefer areas with steep slopes close to the coast in the southwestern sector of the gulf in both seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2159726856,"In order to overcome the problems of poor understandability of the pattern recognition-based transient stability assessment (PRTSA) methods, a new rule extraction method based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and an improved Ant-miner (IAM) algorithm is presented in this paper. First, the basic principles of ELM and Ant-miner algorithm are respectively introduced. Then, based on the selected optimal feature subset, an example sample set is generated by the trained ELM-based PRTSA model. And finally, a set of classification rules are obtained by IAM algorithm to replace the original ELM network. The novelty of this proposal is that transient stability rules are extracted from an example sample set generated by the trained ELM-based transient stability assessment model by using IAM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by the application results on the New England 39-bus power system and a practical power system — the southern power system of Hebei province."
https://openalex.org/W1848371318,"Neurospora crassa is a filamentous fungus that has been extensively studied as a model organism for eukaryotic biology, providing fundamental insights into cellular processes such as cell signaling, growth and differentiation. To advance in the study of this multicellular organism, an understanding of the specific mechanisms for protein transport into the cell nucleus is essential. Importin-α (Imp-α) is the receptor for cargo proteins that contain specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that play a key role in the classical nuclear import pathway. Structures of Imp-α from different organisms (yeast, rice, mouse, and human) have been determined, revealing that this receptor possesses a conserved structural scaffold. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the Impα mechanism of action may vary significantly for different organisms or for different isoforms from the same organism. Therefore, structural, functional, and biophysical characterization of different Impα proteins is necessary to understand the selectivity of nuclear transport. Here, we determined the first crystal structure of an Impα from a filamentous fungus which is also the highest resolution Impα structure already solved to date (1.75 Å). In addition, we performed calorimetric analysis to determine the affinity and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between Imp-α and the classical SV40 NLS peptide. The comparison of these data with previous studies on Impα proteins led us to demonstrate that N. crassa Imp-α possess specific features that are distinct from mammalian Imp-α but exhibit important similarities to rice Imp-α, particularly at the minor NLS binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2192526455,"Epigenetic modifications play a major role in the development of multiple myeloma. We have previously reported that the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone (PIO) enhances, in-vitro, the cytotoxic effect of the Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), valproic acid (VPA), on multiple myeloma cells. Here, we described the development of a new multiple myeloma mouse model using MOLP8 cells, in order to evaluate the effect of VPA/PIO combination on the progression of myeloma cells, by analyzing the proliferation of bone marrow plasma cells. We showed that VPA/PIO delays the progression of the disease and the invasion of myeloma cells in the bone marrow. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that VPA/PIO increases the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, and induces the acetylation of Histone 3 (H3). Furthermore, we provided evidence that PPARγ agonist is able to enhance the action of other HDACi such as Vorinostat or Mocetinostat. Using PPARγ antagonist or siPPARγ, we strongly suggest that, as described during adipogenesis, PIO behaves as an epigenetic regulator by improving the activity of HDACi. This study highlights the therapeutic benefit of PIO/VPA combination, compared to VPA treatment as a single-arm therapy on multiple myeloma and further highlights that such combination may constitute a new promising treatment strategy which should be supported by clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W838876216,"In normal eyes, the amplitude of the b-wave of the photopic ERGs increases during light adaptation, but the mechanism causing this increase has not been fully determined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of receptoral and post-receptoral components of the retina to this phenomenon. To accomplish this, we examined the ERGs during light adaptation in Pikachurin null-mutant (Pika -/-) mice, which have a misalignment of the bipolar cell dendritic tips to the photoreceptor ribbon synapses. After dark-adaptation, photopic ERGs were recorded from Pika -/- and wild type (WT) mice during the first 9 minutes of light adaptation. In some of the mice, post-receptoral components were blocked pharmacologically. The photopic b-waves of WT mice increased by 50% during the 9 min of light adaptation as previously reported. On the other hand, the b-waves of the Pika -/- mice decreased by 20% during the same time period. After blocking post-receptoral components, the b-waves were abolished from the WT mice, and the ERGs resembled those of the Pika -/- mice. The extracted post-receptoral component increased during light adaptation in the WT mice, but decreased for the first 3 minutes to a plateau in Pika -/- mice. We conclude that the normal synaptic connection between photoreceptor and retinal ON bipolar cells, which is controlled by pikachurin, is required for the ERGs to increase during light-adaptation. The contributions of post-receptoral components are essential for the photopic b-wave increase during the light adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1735232779,"The Achillea millefolium aggregate is one of the most diverse polyploid complexes of the Northern hemisphere and has its western Eurasian boundary in the Iberian Peninsula. Four ploidy levels have been detected in A. millefolium, three of which have already been found in Iberia (diploid, hexaploid and octoploid), and a fourth (tetraploid) reported during the preparation of this paper. We collected a sample from 26 Iberian populations comprising all ploidy levels, and we used microsatellite markers analyzed as dominant in view of the high ploidy levels. Our goals were to quantify the genetic diversity of A. millefolium in the Iberian Peninsula, to elucidate its genetic structure, to investigate the differences in ploidy levels, and to analyse the dispersal of the species. The lack of spatial genetic structure recovered is linked to both high levels of gene flow between populations and to the fact that most genetic variability occurs within populations. This in turn suggests the existence of a huge panmictic yarrow population in the Iberian Peninsula. This is consistent with the assumption that recent colonization and rapid expansion occurred throughout this area. Likewise, the low levels of genetic variability recovered suggest that bottlenecks and/or founder events may have been involved in this process, and clonal reproduction may have played an important role in maintaining this genetic impoverishment. Indeed, the ecological and phenologic uniformity present in the A. millefolium agg. in Iberia compared to Eurasia and North America may be responsible for the low number of representatives of this complex of species present in the Iberian Peninsula. The low levels of genetic differentiation between ploidy levels recovered in our work suggest the absence of barriers between them."
https://openalex.org/W2266633950,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), caused by Paracoccidioides species is a prevalent systemic and progressive mycosis that occurs in Latin America. It is caused by Paracoccidioides species. Immunization with dendritic cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the scFv (pMAC/PS-scFv) that mimics the main antigen of P. brasiliensis (gp43) confers protection in experimental PCM. DCs link innate and adaptive immunity by recognizing invading pathogens and selecting the type of effector T cell to mediate the immune response. Here, we showed that DC-pMAC/PS-scFv induces the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that BALB/c mice infected with P. brasiliensis and treated with DC-pMAC/PS-scFv showed the induction of specific IgG production against gp43 and IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-4 cytokines. Analysis of regional lymph nodes revealed increases in the expression of clec7a, myd88, tlr2, gata3 and tbx21, which are involved in the immune response. Taken together, our results indicate that the scFv modulates the humoral and cellular immune responses and presents epitopes to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W568046606,"By overcoming the diffraction limit in light microscopy, super-resolution techniques, such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, are experiencing an increasing impact on life sciences. High costs and technically demanding setups, however, may still hinder a wider distribution of this innovation in biomedical research laboratories. As far-field microscopy is the most widely employed microscopy modality in the life sciences, upgrading already existing systems seems to be an attractive option for achieving diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy in a cost-effective manner. Here, we demonstrate the successful upgrade of a commercial time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscope to an easy-to-align STED microscope in the single-beam path layout, previously proposed as ""easy-STED"", achieving lateral resolution < λ/10 corresponding to a five-fold improvement over a confocal modality. For this purpose, both the excitation and depletion laser beams pass through a commercially available segmented phase plate that creates the STED-doughnut light distribution in the focal plane, while leaving the excitation beam unaltered when implemented into the joint beam path. Diffraction-unlimited imaging of 20 nm-sized fluorescent beads as reference were achieved with the wavelength combination of 635 nm excitation and 766 nm depletion. To evaluate the STED performance in biological systems, we compared the popular phalloidin-coupled fluorescent dyes Atto647N and Abberior STAR635 by labeling F-actin filaments in vitro as well as through immunofluorescence recordings of microtubules in a complex epithelial tissue. Here, we applied a recently proposed deconvolution approach and showed that images obtained from time-gated pulsed STED microscopy may benefit concerning the signal-to-background ratio, from the joint deconvolution of sub-images with different spatial information which were extracted from offline time gating."
https://openalex.org/W606513383,"Mathematical cell models are effective tools to understand cellular physiological functions precisely. For detailed analysis of model dynamics in order to investigate how much each component affects cellular behaviour, mathematical approaches are essential. This article presents a numerical analysis technique, which is applicable to any complicated cell model formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to quantitatively evaluate contributions of respective model components to the model dynamics in the intact situation. The present technique employs a novel mathematical index for decomposed dynamics with respect to each differential variable, along with a concept named instantaneous equilibrium point, which represents the trend of a model variable at some instant. This article also illustrates applications of the method to comprehensive myocardial cell models for analysing insights into the mechanisms of action potential generation and calcium transient. The analysis results exhibit quantitative contributions of individual channel gating mechanisms and ion exchanger activities to membrane repolarization and of calcium fluxes and buffers to raising and descending of the cytosolic calcium level. These analyses quantitatively explicate principle of the model, which leads to a better understanding of cellular dynamics."
