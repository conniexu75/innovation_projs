https://openalex.org/W1974829777,"Fly ash specimens from four power plants in the Tennessee Valley Authority system have been separated into three matrices: glass, mullite-quartz, and magnetic spinel. Chemical species of trace elements are defined to a large extent by the matrices that contain them. The magnetic component of fly ash is ferrite. The mullite-quartz phase is relatively pure and can be recovered as a resource."

During this same period, there has been greatly increased deforestation in the upper parts of the Amazon watershed in Peru and Ecuador, but no significant changes in regional patterns of precipitation. The change in Amazonian water balance during the last decade appears to be the result of increased runoff due to deforestation. If so, the long-predicted regional climatic and hydrological changes that would be the expected result of Amazonian deforestation may already be beginning."
https://openalex.org/W1974783814,"Benzo[a]pyrene deposited on a glass fiber filter reacts rapidly in the dark or light with ambient levels of ozone to yield a mixture of products that display strong direct mutagenicity in the Ames assay. The major stable contributor to this activity has been identified as benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-oxide, a DNA-binding metabolite in biological systems, known to be a strong direct mutagen with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98."
https://openalex.org/W1972087239,Regression equations relating pollen taxa from surface samples to temperature and precipitation are applied to a radiocarbon-dated pollen sequence in a lake core from Alerce. The resulting curves are a measure of the fluctuations of these climatic variables and show similarities to other late Quaternary records from the Southern Hemisphere.
https://openalex.org/W2044976271,"A small coryneform bacterium was consistently isolated from sugarcane with ratoon stunting disease and shown to be the causal agent. A similar bacterium was isolated from Bermuda grass. Both strains multiplied in sugarcane and Bermuda grass, but the Bermuda grass strain did not incite the symptoms of ratoon stunting disease in sugarcane. Shoot growth in Bermuda grass was retarded by both strains."
https://openalex.org/W2128623625,"appearance of strangeness were well-defined parts of the picture, but they could not be easily fitted together. Things have changed. Today we have what has been called a “standard theory” of elementary particle physics in which strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions all arise from a local symmetry principle. It is, in a sense, a complete and apparently correct theory, offering a qualitative description of all particle phenomena and precise quantitative predictions in many instances. There is no experimental data that contradicts the theory. In principle, if not yet in practice, all experimental data can be expressed in terms of a small number of “fundamental” masses and coupling constants. The theory we now have is an integral work of art: the patchwork quilt has become a tapestry. Tapestries are made by many artisans working together. The contributions of separate workers cannot be discerned in the completed work, and the loose and false threads have been covered over. So it is in our picture of particle physics. Part of the picture is the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions and the prediction of neutral currents, now being celebrated by the award of the Nobel Prize. Another part concerns the reasoned evolution of the quark hypothesis from mere whimsy to established dogma. Yet another is the development of quantum chromodynamics into a plausible, powerful, and predictive theory of strong interactions. All is woven together in the tapestry; one part makes little sense without the other. Even the development of the electroweak theory was not as simple and straightforward as it might have been. It did not arise full blown in the mind of one physic&t, nor even of three. It, too, is the result of the collective endeavor of many scientists, both experimenters and theorists. Let me stress that I do not believe that the standard theory will long"
https://openalex.org/W2082957448,Historical documents indicate that great earthquakes ruptured at least a 500-kilometer-long segment of the plate boundary near the Alaska Peninsula in 1788 and 1847. At least half of a major seismic gap in the Shumagin Islands ruptured during those shocks but has not experienced a great earthquake for at least 77 years. Large shocks along this and other plate boundaries occur in bursts followed by several decades during which there is very little energy release.
https://openalex.org/W2059997761,"Total eclipses of the sun offer research opportunities in a variety of sciences. Some of the advances in solar physics resulting from eclipse observations are discussed. Experiments at the total eclipse of 16 February 1980 in India are also described. These included a test of general relativity, studies in coronal physics, investigations of solar prominences, diameter measurements, a search for interplanetary dust, a study of the gravity waves in the earth's atmosphere, and experiments on the biological effects on animals and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2154117845,"Voyager data on the optical and radio-frequency detection of lightning discharges in the atmosphere of Jupiter suggest a stroke rate significantly lower than on the earth. The efficiency of conversion of atmospheric convective energy flux into lightning is almost certainly less than on the earth, probably near 10(-7) rather than the terrestrial value of 10(-4). At this level the rate of production of complex organic molecules by lightning and by thunder shock waves is negligible compared to the rates of known photochemical processes for forming colored inorganic solids."

https://openalex.org/W2023004851,"Concentrations of fluoride in the ash fallout in central Washington from the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens varied severalfold, but none are high enough to constitute any immediate hazard to animal life. The heaviest fallout (Moses Lake) contained 113 parts per million (ppm) of acid-labile fluoride, but of this only 11 ppm was water-soluble and 20 ppm was available to rats. The fluoride concentrations in the urine of cattle feeding for 4 days on hay contaminated with this ash were essentially normal. Samples of ash from other areas generally had higher concentrations of acid-labile fluoride but lower concentrations of water-soluble fluoride. The concentration of water-soluble fluoride was inversely correlated with the coarseness of the fallout."
https://openalex.org/W2022057974,"By examining the occurrence or absence of a resonance Raman effect for a carbonyl bond-stretching vibration, one can achieve a unique characterization of the carbonyl pi-electrons. It can be concluded, for example, that the carbonyl pi-electrons of nicotinamide do not migrate into the ring pi-electron orbitals responsible for the 265-nanometer band, whereas those of dihydronicotinamide do migrate into orbitals responsible for the 340-nanometer band."
