https://openalex.org/W2007219314,"Densities of molten silicates at high pressures (up to approximately 230 kilobars) have been measured for the first time with shock-wave techniques. For a model basaltic composition (36 mole percent anorthite and 64 mole percent diopside), a bulk modulus K(s), of approximately 230 kilobars and a pressure derivative (dK(s)/dP) of approximately 4 were derived. Some implications of these results are as follows: (i) basic to ultrabasic melts become denser than olivine-and pyroxene-rich host mantle at pressures of 60 to 100 kilobars; (ii) there is a maximum depth from which basaltic melt can rise within terrestrial planetary interiors; (iii) the slopes of silicate solidi [(dT(m)/dP), where T(m) is the temperature] may become less steep at high pressures; and (iv) enriched mantle reservoirs may have developed by downward segregation of melt early in Earth history."

The redistribution of food resources might have contributed to the reproductive failure of seabirds and marine mammals on these islands during this El Niño.
https://openalex.org/W2012329108,"Fluxes of biogenic carbonates moving out of the euphotic zone and into deeper undersaturated waters of the North Pacific were estimated with free-drifting sediment traps. Short-duration (1 to 1.5 day) sampling between 100 and 2200 meters points to a major involvement in the oceanic carbonate system by a class of organisms which had been relegated to a secondary role-aragonitic pteropods. Pteropod fluxes through the base of the euphotic zone are almost large enough to balance the alkalinity budget for the Pacific Ocean. Dissolution experiments with freshly collected materials shed considerable light on a mystery surrounding these labile organisms: although plankton collections from net tows almost always contain large numbers of pteropods, these organisms are never a major component of biogenic materials in long-duration sediment trap collections. Their low abundance in long-duration collections results from dissolution subsequent to collection. Shortduration sampling showed significant increases in the ratio of calcitic foraminifera to aragonitic pteropods in undersaturated waters, indicating the more stable mineralogic form, calcite, was preserved relative to aragonite. Approximately 90 percent of the aragonite flux is remineralized in the upper 2.2 kilometers of the water column."

https://openalex.org/W1988820082,"Two years ago, upon a similar occasion, it was my privilege to address many of you and to point out some of the relationships existing between the chemist and the community. In so doing, there naturally devolved upon me the pleasant duty of recalling to your minds a few of the great and more significant achievements of members of our profession by way of indicating, although briefly and most inadequately, something of the extent to which the chemist has already placed the community in his debt. It is good for any body of men, animated by a common purpose, to take, from time to time, mental stock of what they have accomplished and of the relation in which they really stand to their environment. Where, as in our own case, the record is one of which we all may well be proud, its contemplation brings a new sense of the dignity of the work itself, a pride of fellowship and an incentive to increased endeavor. We move, however, in a world where it is easy to take much for granted, where symbols and conventions quickly come to take the place of the realities they represent. Our mental processes are apt to run along the line of least resistance and the apparent and the obvious obscure the fundamental truths. This being so, we can well afford to leave our achievements in the security of the past while we consider for the moment the things we have left undone. The volume of chemical literature has become so great, so many compounds have"
