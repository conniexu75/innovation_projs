https://openalex.org/W2164659462,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are sensors for a wide range of cellular and environmental signals, but elucidating how these channels respond to physical and chemical stimuli has been hampered by a lack of detailed structural information. Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4 Å resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function."

At the same time, in many locations, conventional coastal engineering solutions such as sea walls are increasingly challenged by these changes and their maintenance may become unsustainable. We argue that flood protection by ecosystem creation and restoration can provide a more sustainable, cost-effective and ecologically sound alternative to conventional coastal engineering and that, in suitable locations, it should be implemented globally and on a large scale."

https://openalex.org/W1973796039,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are polymodal signal detectors that respond to a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli. Elucidating how these channels integrate and convert physiological signals into channel opening is essential to understanding how they regulate cell excitability under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Here we exploit pharmacological probes (a peptide toxin and small vanilloid agonists) to determine structures of two activated states of the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1. A domain (consisting of transmembrane segments 1–4) that moves during activation of voltage-gated channels remains stationary in TRPV1, highlighting differences in gating mechanisms for these structurally related channel superfamilies. TRPV1 opening is associated with major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism. Allosteric coupling between upper and lower gates may account for rich physiological modulation exhibited by TRPV1 and other TRP channels. Using a peptide toxin and small vanilloid agonists as pharmacological probes, high-resolution electron cryo-microscopy structures of rat TRPV1–ligand complexes are solved; these structures highlight conformational differences between TRP and voltage-gated ion channels in their active states, and suggest a dual gating mechanism that may account for the ability of members of the TRP channel superfamily to integrate diverse physiological signals. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are sensors for a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli. In the first of a pair of related papers, Maofu Liao et al. solve the high-resolution electron cryo-microscopy structure of rat TRPV1, the receptor for capsaicin (a pungent agent from chili peppers), in a 'closed' state. The overall structure is fairly similar to that of a voltage-gated ion channel, but there are several structural features unique to TRP channels. In the second paper, Erhu Cao et al. present the structures of rat TRPV1 in the presence of a peptide neurotoxin (resiniferatoxin) and in the presence of capsaicin, yielding structures of activated states of the channel. Comparison of the closed and open structures suggests that TRPV1 has a unique two-gate mechanism of channel activation."

The number of reports of these events in previously unaffected areas has increased worldwide in recent years. These 'seaweed tides' can harm tourism-based economies, smother aquaculture operations or disrupt traditional artisanal fisheries. Coastal eutrophication is the obvious, ultimate explanation for the increase in seaweed biomass, but the proximate processes that are responsible for individual beaching events are complex and require dedicated study to develop effective mitigation strategies. Harvesting the macroalgae, a valuable raw material, before they beach could well be developed into an effective solution."
https://openalex.org/W2093450191,"To sustain neurotransmission, synaptic vesicles and their associated proteins must be recycled locally at synapses. Synaptic vesicles are thought to be regenerated approximately 20 s after fusion by the assembly of clathrin scaffolds or in approximately 1 s by the reversal of fusion pores via ‘kiss-and-run’ endocytosis. Here we use optogenetics to stimulate cultured hippocampal neurons with a single stimulus, rapidly freeze them after fixed intervals and examine the ultrastructure using electron microscopy—‘flash-and-freeze’ electron microscopy. Docked vesicles fuse and collapse into the membrane within 30 ms of the stimulus. Compensatory endocytosis occurs within 50 to 100 ms at sites flanking the active zone. Invagination is blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, and scission is blocked by inhibiting dynamin. Because intact synaptic vesicles are not recovered, this form of recycling is not compatible with kiss-and-run endocytosis; moreover, it is 200-fold faster than clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is likely that ‘ultrafast endocytosis’ is specialized to restore the surface area of the membrane rapidly. Sustained neurotransmission requires recycling of synaptic vesicles, but the proposed mechanisms have been controversial; here a ‘flash-and-freeze’ method for electron microscopy reveals a new ultrafast form of endocytosis that is actin- and dynamin-dependent and occurs within 100 milliseconds of stimulation. Sustained neurotransmission requires recycling of synaptic vesicles but the proposed mechanisms — clathrin-mediated endocytosis and 'kiss-and-run' reversal of fusion — have been controversial. Now Erik Jorgensen and colleagues, using ultrafast, 'flash-and-freeze' electron microscopy, have identified a previously unknown actin- and dynamin-dependent mechanism of endocytosis, occurring within 100 milliseconds of stimulation in mouse hippocampal neurons. This is 200-times faster than the clathrin-mediated process, and morphological characteristics rule out the 'kiss-and-run' model. This work suggests that rapid internalization of membrane from the surface is the first step in endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1987681742,"Playing Hide and Seek Targeted cancer therapies have shown promising results in patients, but few of these drugs provide long-term benefits because tumor cells rapidly develop drug resistance. Nathanson et al. (p. 72 , published online 5 December) show that glioblastoma cells can become resistant to erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–targeted drug, by eliminating extrachromosomal copies of the mutant EGFR gene. After a period of drug withdrawal, the mutant EGFR gene reappears on extrachromosomal DNA and the tumor cells become resensitized. The discovery that cancer cells can evade drug therapy by this “hide and seek” mechanism may help to optimize the dosing schedule of erlotinib in glioblastoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W1977964679,"Excavations of a complex of caves in the Sierra de Atapuerca in northern Spain have unearthed hominin fossils that range in age from the early Pleistocene to the Holocene. One of these sites, the 'Sima de los Huesos' ('pit of bones'), has yielded the world's largest assemblage of Middle Pleistocene hominin fossils, consisting of at least 28 individuals dated to over 300,000 years ago. The skeletal remains share a number of morphological features with fossils classified as Homo heidelbergensis and also display distinct Neanderthal-derived traits. Here we determine an almost complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos and show that it is closely related to the lineage leading to mitochondrial genomes of Denisovans, an eastern Eurasian sister group to Neanderthals. Our results pave the way for DNA research on hominins from the Middle Pleistocene."
https://openalex.org/W2067573570,"In budding yeast, one-ended DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and damaged replication forks are repaired by break-induced replication (BIR), a homologous recombination pathway that requires the Pol32 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. DNA replication stress is prevalent in cancer, but BIR has not been characterized in mammals. In a cyclin E overexpression model of DNA replication stress, POLD3, the human ortholog of POL32, was required for cell cycle progression and processive DNA synthesis. Segmental genomic duplications induced by cyclin E overexpression were also dependent on POLD3, as were BIR-mediated recombination events captured with a specialized DSB repair assay. We propose that BIR repairs damaged replication forks in mammals, accounting for the high frequency of genomic duplications in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2013968350,"Cancer Immunosurveillance Gone Bad? A subset of patients who develop scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disease, have an elevated risk of developing cancer. These patients harbor autoantibodies to RPC1, an RNA polymerase subunit encoded by the POLR3A gene. Joseph et al. (p. 152 , published online December 5; see the Perspective by Teng and Smyth ) explored whether the RPC1 autoantibodies target a “foreign” antigen derived from a mutated POLR3A gene. Sequence analysis revealed that POLR3A mutations were present in tumors from six of eight patients with RPC1 autoantibodies but in no tumors from eight control patients who lacked RPC1 autoantibodies. Cell culture data suggested that the POLR3A mutations triggered cellular and humoral immune responses in the patients. These results provide support for the “immunosurveillance” hypothesis, which posits the continual eradication of nascent tumor cells via immune responses."

The nonlinearity results from the constructive addition of interacting photons, but the amount of nonlinear light produced is crucially dependent on meeting strict phase-matching conditions of the interacting photon fields. Suchowski et al. (p. 1223 ; see the Perspective by Kauranen ) now show that metamaterials can be designed with optical properties that relax the phase-matching requirements. At a specific wavelength where the metamaterial exhibits zero refractive index, the photons are found to interact nonlinearly with the phasematching done automatically."

https://openalex.org/W2167101174,"Pericytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are ontogenically related, and in fact, no significant phenotypic differences could be observed by flow cytometry. Transcriptome analysis of human pericytes and MSCs revealed that 43 genes were up-regulated more than 10-fold in pericytes compared with MSCs. Identification of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as one of the most abundant RNA species in pericytes with respect to MSCs and confirmation of TLR4 expression on the cell surface led us to obtain a comprehensive overview of the expression program of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated pericytes. Transcriptional profiling of LPS-treated cells revealed that 22 genes were up-regulated more than 5-fold. Of them, 10 genes encoded chemokines and cytokines (CXCL10, CCL20, IL8, CXCL1, IL6, CCL2, IL1B, CXCL2, IL1A, and CXCL6), and three genes encoded adhesion molecules (ICAM1, VCAM1, and SELE). LPS induced nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB in stimulated pericytes. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB activation by SC-514 blocked LPS-induced up-regulation of a subset of chemokine genes, confirming the key role of NF-κB in LPS signaling in pericytes. At the protein level, we assessed the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CCL2 not only after LPS treatment but also in HMGB1-stimulated pericytes. Up-regulation of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 resulted in an increased adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes to an LPS-treated pericyte monolayer. The role of pericytes in the inflammatory context has been scarcely addressed; according to these results, pericytes should be considered as active players in the inflammatory cascade with potential physiopathological implications."

https://openalex.org/W2072621593,"The yellow fever vaccine YF-17D is one of the most successful vaccines ever developed in humans. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in more than 600 million people, the mechanisms by which it stimulates protective immunity remain poorly understood. Recent studies using systems biology approaches in humans have revealed that YF-17D-induced early expression of general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2) in the blood strongly correlates with the magnitude of the later CD8(+) T cell response. We demonstrate a key role for virus-induced GCN2 activation in programming dendritic cells to initiate autophagy and enhanced antigen presentation to both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These results reveal an unappreciated link between virus-induced integrated stress response in dendritic cells and the adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2002984932,"Human GABA(B) (γ-aminobutyric acid class B) receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor central to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It functions as an obligatory heterodimer of the subunits GBR1 and GBR2. Here we present the crystal structures of a heterodimeric complex between the extracellular domains of GBR1 and GBR2 in the apo, agonist-bound and antagonist-bound forms. The apo and antagonist-bound structures represent the resting state of the receptor; the agonist-bound complex corresponds to the active state. Both subunits adopt an open conformation at rest, and only GBR1 closes on agonist-induced receptor activation. The agonists and antagonists are anchored in the interdomain crevice of GBR1 by an overlapping set of residues. An antagonist confines GBR1 to the open conformation of the inactive state, whereas an agonist induces its domain closure for activation. Our data reveal a unique activation mechanism for GABA(B) receptor that involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2092616115,"During the neonatal period, activity-dependent neural-circuit remodelling coincides with growth and refinement of the cerebral microvasculature. Whether neural activity also influences the patterning of the vascular bed is not known. Here we show in neonatal mice, that neither reduction of sensory input through whisker trimming nor moderately increased activity by environmental enrichment affects cortical microvascular development. Unexpectedly, chronic stimulation by repetitive sounds, whisker deflection or motor activity led to a near arrest of angiogenesis in barrel, auditory and motor cortices, respectively. Chemically induced seizures also caused robust reductions in microvascular density. However, altering neural activity in adult mice did not affect the vasculature. Histological analysis and time-lapse in vivo two-photon microscopy revealed that hyperactivity did not lead to cell death or pruning of existing vessels but rather to reduced endothelial proliferation and vessel sprouting. This anti-angiogenic effect was prevented by administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME and in mice with neuronal and inducible NOS deficiency, suggesting that excessive nitric oxide released from hyperactive interneurons and glia inhibited vessel growth. Vascular deficits persisted long after cessation of hyperstimulation, providing evidence for a critical period after which proper microvascular patterning cannot be re-established. Reduced microvascular density diminished the ability of the brain to compensate for hypoxic challenges, leading to dendritic spine loss in regions distant from capillaries. Therefore, excessive sensorimotor stimulation and repetitive neural activation during early childhood may cause lifelong deficits in microvascular reserve, which could have important consequences for brain development, function and pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2004899254,"Polar molecules are desirable systems for quantum simulations and cold chemistry. Molecular ions are easily trapped, but a bias electric field applied to polarize them tends to accelerate them out of the trap. We present a general solution to this issue by rotating the bias field slowly enough for the molecular polarization axis to follow but rapidly enough for the ions to stay trapped. We demonstrate Ramsey spectroscopy between Stark-Zeeman sublevels in (180)Hf(19)F(+) with a coherence time of 100 milliseconds. Frequency shifts arising from well-controlled topological (Berry) phases are used to determine magnetic g factors.

https://openalex.org/W1964348356,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways have important roles in embryonic development and cellular homeostasis, with aberrant BMP signaling resulting in a broad spectrum of human disease. We report that BMPs unexpectedly signal through the canonical transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-responsive Smad2 and Smad3. BMP-induced Smad2/3 signaling occurs preferentially in embryonic cells and transformed cells. BMPs signal to Smad2/3 by stimulating complex formation between the BMP-binding TGF-β superfamily receptors, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)3/6, and the Smad2/3 phosphorylating receptors ALK5/7. BMP signaling through Smad2 mediates, in part, dorsoventral axis patterning in zebrafish embryos, whereas BMP signaling through Smad3 facilitates cancer cell invasion. Consistent with increased BMP-mediated Smad2/3 signaling during cancer progression, Smad1/5 and Smad 2/3 signaling converge in human cancer specimens. Thus, the signaling mechanisms used by BMPs and TGF-β superfamily receptors are broader than previously appreciated.—Holtzhausen, A., Golzio, C., How, T., Lee, Y.-H., Schiemann, W.

These motions are evident at the Sun's surface in the form of two characteristic cellular structures - granules and supergranules (~1000 and ~30,000 km across respectively). The existence of much larger cells has been suggested by both theory and observation for over 45 years. We found evidence for giant cellular flows that persist for months by tracking the motions of supergranules. As expected from the effects of the Sun's rotation, the flows in these cells are clockwise around high pressure in the north, counter-clockwise in the south and transport angular momentum toward the equator, maintaining the Sun's rapid equatorial rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2161051601,"Siglecs are sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins that recognize sialoglycans via amino-terminal V-set domains. CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs) on innate immune cells recognize endogenous sialoglycans as ""self-associated molecular patterns"" (SAMPs), dampening immune responses via cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs that recruit tyrosine phosphatases. However, sialic acid-expressing pathogens subvert this mechanism through molecular mimicry. Meanwhile, endogenous host SAMPs must continually evolve to evade other pathogens that exploit sialic acids as invasion targets. We hypothesized that these opposing selection forces have accelerated CD33rSiglec evolution. We address this by comparative analysis of major CD33rSiglec (Siglec-3, Siglec-5, and Siglec-9) orthologs in humans, chimpanzees, and baboons. Recombinant soluble molecules displaying ligand-binding domains show marked quantitative and qualitative interspecies differences in interactions with strains of the sialylated pathogen, group B Streptococcus, and with sialoglycans presented as gangliosides or in the form of sialoglycan microarrays, including variations such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl groups. Primate Siglecs also show quantitative and qualitative intra- and interspecies variations in expression patterns on leukocytes, both in circulation and in tissues. Taken together our data explain why the CD33rSiglec-encoding gene cluster is undergoing rapid evolution via multiple mechanisms, driven by the need to maintain self-recognition by innate immune cells, while escaping 2 distinct mechanisms of pathogen subversion."
https://openalex.org/W2054197740,"In the mammalian retina, glutamate uptake is mediated by members of a family of glutamate transporters known as ""excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs)."" Here we cloned and functionally characterized two retinal EAATs from mouse, the GLT-1/EAAT2 splice variant GLT-1c, and EAAT5. EAATs are glutamate transporters and anion-selective ion channels, and we used heterologous expression in mammalian cells, patch-clamp recordings and noise analysis to study and compare glutamate transport and anion channel properties of both EAAT isoforms. We found GLT-1c to be an effective glutamate transporter with high affinity for Na(+) and glutamate that resembles original GLT-1/EAAT2 in all tested functional aspects. EAAT5 exhibits glutamate transport rates too low to be accurately measured in our experimental system, with significantly lower affinities for Na(+) and glutamate than GLT-1c. Non-stationary noise analysis demonstrated that GLT-1c and EAAT5 also differ in single-channel current amplitudes of associated anion channels. Unitary current amplitudes of EAAT5 anion channels turned out to be approximately twice as high as single-channel amplitudes of GLT-1c. Moreover, at negative potentials open probabilities of EAAT5 anion channels were much larger than for GLT-1c. Our data illustrate unique functional properties of EAAT5, being a low-affinity and low-capacity glutamate transport system, with an anion channel optimized for anion conduction in the negative voltage range."
https://openalex.org/W2044987317,"Although highly homologous to other methylcytosine-binding domain (MBD) proteins, MBD3 does not selectively bind methylated DNA, and thus the functional role of MBD3 remains in question. To explore the structural basis of its binding properties and potential function, we characterized the solution structure and binding distribution of the MBD3 MBD on hydroxymethylated, methylated, and unmethylated DNA. The overall fold of this domain is very similar to other MBDs, yet a key loop involved in DNA binding is more disordered than previously observed. Specific recognition of methylated DNA constrains the structure of this loop and results in large chemical shift changes in NMR spectra. Based on these spectral changes, we show that MBD3 preferentially localizes to methylated and, to a lesser degree, unmethylated cytosine-guanosine dinucleotides (CpGs), yet does not distinguish between hydroxymethylated and unmethylated sites. Measuring residual dipolar couplings for the different bound states clearly shows that the MBD3 structure does not change between methylation-specific and nonspecific binding modes. Furthermore, residual dipolar couplings measured for MBD3 bound to methylated DNA can be described by a linear combination of those for the methylation and nonspecific binding modes, confirming the preferential localization to methylated sites. The highly homologous MBD2 protein shows similar but much stronger localization to methylated as well as unmethylated CpGs. Together, these data establish the structural basis for the relative distribution of MBD2 and MBD3 on genomic DNA and their observed occupancy at active and inactive CpG-rich promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2042073406,"Background ZIP5 localizes to the baso-lateral membranes of intestinal enterocytes and pancreatic acinar cells and is internalized and degraded coordinately in these cell-types during periods of dietary zinc deficiency. These cell-types are thought to control zinc excretion from the body. The baso-lateral localization and zinc-regulation of ZIP5 in these cells are unique among the 14 members of the Slc39a family and suggest that ZIP5 plays a role in zinc excretion. Methods/Principal Findings We created mice with floxed Zip5 genes and deleted this gene in the entire mouse or specifically in enterocytes or acinar cells and then examined the effects on zinc homeostasis. We found that ZIP5 is not essential for growth and viability but total knockout of ZIP5 led to increased zinc in the liver in mice fed a zinc-adequate (ZnA) diet but impaired accumulation of pancreatic zinc in mice fed a zinc-excess (ZnE) diet. Loss-of-function of enterocyte ZIP5, in contrast, led to increased pancreatic zinc in mice fed a ZnA diet and increased abundance of intestinal Zip4 mRNA. Finally, loss-of-function of acinar cell ZIP5 modestly reduced pancreatic zinc in mice fed a ZnA diet but did not impair zinc uptake as measured by the rapid accumulation of 67zinc. Retention of pancreatic 67zinc was impaired in these mice but the absence of pancreatic ZIP5 sensitized them to zinc-induced pancreatitis and exacerbated the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles containing secretory protein in acinar cells. Conclusions These studies demonstrate that ZIP5 participates in the control of zinc excretion in mice. Specifically, they reveal a paramount function of intestinal ZIP5 in zinc excretion but suggest a role for pancreatic ZIP5 in zinc accumulation/retention in acinar cells. ZIP5 functions in acinar cells to protect against zinc-induced acute pancreatitis and attenuate the process of zymophagy. This suggests that it may play a role in autophagy."

CGRP, a 37-aa neuropeptide, is widely distributed in neuronal tissues and exerts its biological effects via CLR/RAMP1; however, the pathophysiological roles of CLR/RAMP1 remain to be clarified. To study the functions of CLR/RAMP1, we generated RAMP1-knockout (RAMP1–/–) mice. Compared with those of wild-type (WT) mice, wound healing and wound-induced angiogenesis were significantly suppressed in RAMP1–/– mice, with reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Formation of the lymphatic vessels that drain interstitial fluids was also suppressed in RAMP1–/– mice, with reduced expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in wound granulation tissues. RAMP1 was expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) in the preexisting skin blood vessels, but was not observed in ECs in newly formed blood or lymphatic vessels. Macrophages in the wound granulation tissues expressed RAMP1 and produced substantial amounts of VEGF-C in response to CGRP in vitro. RAMP1–/– bone marrow chimeric mice showed delayed wound healing with reduced angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis in wound granulation tissues. These findings suggest that RAMP1 plays a crucial role in wound healing and wound-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and that it is a promising target for controlling angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.—Kurashige, C., Hosono, K., Matsuda, H., Tsujikawa, K., Okamoto, H., Majima, M.

https://openalex.org/W2122976044,"Multidrug resistance (MDR), an unfavorable factor compromising the treatment efficacy of anticancer drugs, involves the upregulation of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and induction of galectin-3 signaling. Galectin-3 plays an anti-apoptotic role in many cancer cells and regulates various pathways to activate MDR. Thus, the inhibition of galectin-3 has the potential to enhance the efficacy of the anticancer drug epirubicin. In this study, we examined the effects and mechanisms of silencing galectin-3 via RNA interference (RNAi) on the β-catenin/GSK-3β pathway in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. Galectin-3 knockdown increased the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin in Caco-2 cells; suppressed the mRNA expression of galectin-3, β-catenin, cyclin D1, c-myc, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MDR-associated protein (MRP) 1, and MRP2; and downregulated the protein expression of P-gp, cyclin D1, galectin-3, β-catenin, c-Myc, and Bcl-2. Moreover, galectin-3 RNAi treatment significantly increased the mRNA level of GSK-3β, Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9; remarkably increased the Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio; and upregulated the GSK-3β and Bax protein expressions. Apoptosis was induced by galectin-3 RNAi and/or epirubicin as demonstrated by chromatin condensation, a higher sub-G1 phase proportion, and increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, indicating an intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Epirubicin-mediated resistance was effectively inhibited via galectin-3 RNAi treatment. However, these phenomena could be rescued after galectin-3 overexpression. We show for the first time that the silencing of galectin-3 sensitizes MDR cells to epirubicin by inhibiting ABC transporters and activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis through modulation of the β-catenin/GSK-3β pathway in human colon cancer cells."

Low concentrations of a β-agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), promote cell adhesion (87.5% cells remaining adherent to the plastic dishes following specific detachment vs. 35.0% in control, P<0.001), while increasing concentrations further engages an additional 36% inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation (p-Erk1/2)-dependent cell proliferation (P<0.01). Isoproterenol dose response on cell adhesion was fitted to a 2-site curve (EC50(1): 16.5±11.5 fM, EC50(2): 4.08 ±3.09 nM), while ISO significantly inhibited p-Erk1/2 according to a 1-site model (EC50: 0.25 ±0.13 nM). Using β-AR-selective agonist/antagonists and cAMP analogs/inhibitors, we identified a dosage-dependent signaling in which low ISO concentrations target a β2-AR population localized in raft microdomains and stimulate a Gs/cAMP/Epac/ adhesion-signaling module, while higher concentrations engage a concomitant activation of another β2-AR population outside rafts and inhibit the proliferation by a Gs/cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling module. Our data provide a new molecular basis for the dose-dependent switch of β-AR signaling. This study also sheds light on a new cAMP pathway core mechanism with a single receptor triggering dual cAMP signaling controlled by PKA or Epac but with different cellular outputs.—Bruzzone, A., Saulière, A., Finana, F., Sénard, J.-M., Lüthy, I., Galés, C.

https://openalex.org/W2089711757,"The activin/inhibin system regulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and release by pituitary gonadotrope cells in mammals. In vitro cell line data suggest that activins stimulate FSH β-subunit (Fshb) transcription via complexes containing the receptor-regulated SMAD proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3. Here, we used a Cre-loxP approach to determine the necessity for SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 in FSH synthesis in vivo. Surprisingly, mice with conditional mutations in both Smad2 and Smad3 specifically in gonadotrope cells are fertile and produce FSH at quantitatively normal levels. Notably, however, we discovered that the recombined Smad3 allele produces a transcript that encodes the entirety of the SMAD3 C-terminal Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain. This protein behaves similarly to full-length SMAD3 in Fshb transcriptional assays. As the truncated protein lacks the N-terminal Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain, these results show that SMAD3 DNA-binding activity as well as SMAD2 are dispensable for normal FSH synthesis in vivo. Furthermore, the observation that deletion of proximal exons does not remove all SMAD3 function may facilitate interpretation of divergent phenotypes previously described in different Smad3 knockout mouse lines.—Fortin, J., Boehm, U., Weinstein, M.

To identify an active compound(s) in CIE that inhibits LMP1-induced NF-κB activation, activity-guided fractionation was employed. The CH2Cl2 fraction of CIE strongly reduced LMP1-induced NF-κB activation and LCL viability with relatively low cytotoxic effects on primary human foreskin fibroblast (HFF), HeLa or Burkitt's lymphoma (BL41) cells. Furthermore, lupeol, a pentacyclic triterpene, was identified in the CH2Cl2 fraction of CIE to attenuate LMP1-induced NF-κB activation and LCL viability. This study demonstrates that lupeol is one of active compounds in the CH2Cl2 fraction of CIE that inhibits LMP1-induced NF-κB activation and reduces NF-κB-dependent LCL viability."

Our results appear to reconcile disparate published data and settle a long running dispute. Heterotrimeric G proteins (consisting of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits) are an important part of the cellular signal transduction system. They serve as transducers and amplifiers of signals from G protein-coupled receptors to intracellular effectors. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors leads to an exchange of a molecule of GDP bound to an inactive Gα subunit for a molecule of GTP, causing changes in the G protein complex, termed “activation.” Both the activated GTP-bound Gα subunits and the Gβγ dimers can modulate the activity of effectors such as adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C, or G protein-regulated inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) 2The abbreviations used are:GIRKG protein-regulated inward rectifying potassium channelGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateFPfluorescent protein2PPMtwo-photon polarization microscopyLDlinear dichroismCAconstitutively activeNE(±)-norepinephrine (+)-bitartrate saltCFPcyan fluorescent proteinα2aARα2a-adrenergic receptorGRK3ctG protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 C-terminal domain. channels.

The Gi/o family of G proteins inhibits adenylate cyclase activity (decreasing the intracellular cAMP concentration) and activates GIRK channels (hyperpolarizing the cell membrane). However, it is not clear how activation of Gi/o proteins leads to these downstream signaling events. Despite a number of published studies, even the molecular identity of the activated state of the Gi/o proteins remains disputed (1Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Feinstein T.N. Lambert N. Nikolaev V.O.

It is, however, unclear whether interactions with effectors are mediated by a rearranged, GTP-bound heterotrimer (GαGTPGβγ) or by the dissociated components (GαGTP, Gβγ). The published evidence in support of the distinct models of Gi/o activation is often contradictory. In vitro studies indicate that, similar to other heterotrimeric G proteins, the Gi/o proteins dissociate upon activation by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS (5Gilman A.G. G proteins.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17789-17794Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) upon Gi/o protein activation are consistent with heterotrimer dissociation upon activation. Because the in vitro results were obtained under conditions far from natural and the in vivo evidence is inconsistent and has mostly been obtained using G protein heterotrimers modified with two large protein tags (17Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Structural basis of function in heterotrimeric G proteins.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 117-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), better evidence is needed to elucidate the process of Gi/o activation under natural conditions. Inspired by recent advances in imaging of G protein activation, we decided to investigate the molecular nature of the activated state of Gi/o proteins under conditions as close to natural as possible. To detect interactions between Gα and Gβγ subunits, we employed the technique of two-photon polarization microscopy (2PPM), developed recently in our laboratory and described in detail in Ref. 18Lazar J. Bondar A. Timr S. Firestein S.J. Two-photon polarization microscopy reveals protein structure and function.Nat. Meth. 2011; 8: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. The 2PPM technique allows measurements of two-photon linear dichroism (LD) (the differences in two-photon absorption of light of distinct (perpendicular) linear polarizations in fluorescently labeled samples). LD is present in all assemblies of non-randomly oriented fluorophores. We have shown recently that, using 2PPM, LD can be detected in ∼80% of FP-labeled membrane proteins expressed in mammalian cells, including several G proteins (18Lazar J. Bondar A. Timr S. Firestein S.J. Two-photon polarization microscopy reveals protein structure and function.Nat. Meth. 2011; 8: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Changes in LD can be used for sensitive observations of changes in protein-protein interactions and conformational changes in proteins. Our mathematical and software tools allow reliable quantification of LD and derivation of quantitative descriptions of molecular processes taking place in living cells (18Lazar J. Bondar A. Timr S. Firestein S.J. Two-photon polarization microscopy reveals protein structure and function.Nat. Meth. 2011; 8: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because of the requirement of 2PPM for only a single FP label to observe protein-protein interactions, 2PPM is a promising tool for investigating processes such as G protein activation under conditions close to natural. In 2PPM, two images of a fluorescent sample are acquired, one with excitation light polarized horizontally in the image and one with excitation light polarized vertically. Differences between the two images signify the presence of LD, caused by presence of fluorophores that are orientationally distributed non-randomly, for example because of their tethering to a cell membrane. The extent of LD in membrane-tethered fluorophores depends on two factors: the orientation of the observed membrane with respect to the excitation light polarization and the orientation of the fluorophore assembly with respect to the cell membrane. No LD is present in membranes oriented diagonally in 2PPM images because the orientation of the membrane (and fluorophores) with respect to both excitation polarizations is identical. Maximum LD occurs in membranes oriented parallel and perpendicular to the used polarizations (vertically or horizontally in the image). Therefore, we measured LD in sections of cell outline that are oriented almost horizontally or vertically. For a particular section of the cell outline, the extent and “sign” of LD depends on fluorophore orientation with respect to the membrane. The closer a fluorophore is to being parallel to the cell membrane, the larger the excess of fluorescence it will exhibit with light polarized parallel to the cell membrane. Conversely, the closer a fluorophore is to being perpendicular to the cell membrane, the larger the excess of fluorescence it will exhibit with light polarized perpendicular to the cell membrane. Fluorophores with a random distribution of orientations, or fluorophores at an angle of 52.0° (the so-called “magic angle” for two-photon excitation) with respect to the cell membrane will produce no LD. The extent of LD can be described by a dichroic ratio (r): the ratio of fluorescence intensities excited by light polarized horizontally (Fh) and vertically (Fv), respectively, in the microscopy image. Because r depends on the orientation of the cell membrane, we characterize constructs by using a maximum dichroic ratio (rmax), calculated as Fh/Fv in sections of the cell outline oriented close to horizontal in the image and as the inverse ratio in sections of the cell outline oriented close to vertical in the image. This way, fluorophore distributions close to parallel to the cell membrane exhibit rmax > 1, and fluorophore distributions close to perpendicular to the cell membrane show rmax < 1. Wide distributions of fluorophore tilt angles and/or closeness of the mean fluorophore tilt angle to the magic angle show little or no LD (rmax = ∼1). In this work, we rely on observations of LD by the 2PPM technique to infer information on dissociation and rearrangement of G protein complexes. To verify our 2PPM results, and to extend them to non-modified G proteins, we built on a published observation (19Hollins B. Kuravi S. Digby G.J. Lambert N.A. The c-terminus of GRK3 indicates rapid dissociation of G protein heterotrimers.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that fluorescently labeled peptides derived from a G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) selectively bind free Gβγ dimers and can, thus, serve as indicators of G protein dissociation. The binding site of the GRK3 C-terminal domain (GRK3ct) on Gβ1γ2 overlaps extensively with the binding site of Gα on Gβ1γ2 (17Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E.

Molecular basis for interactions of G protein βγ subunits with effectors.Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of GRK3ct to Gβ1γ2 likely occurs only upon dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex (2Lambert N.A. Dissociation of heterotrimeric g proteins in cells.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Keeping G proteins at bay. A complex between G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and Gβγ.Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Interactions of GRK3ct with Gβ1γ2 have been observed by resonant energy transfer (FRET and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) between suitable labels attached to both GRK3ct and Gβ1γ2. For Gαo, the GRK3ct -Gβ1γ2 interaction has also been observed by monitoring cellular localization of GRK3ct-Venus, allowing the use of non-labeled Gβ1γ2. Observations of GRK3ct-FP translocation, in combination with our imaging and image processing tools, promised to yield evidence of the mechanism of Gi/o protein activation not only in Gαi/o constructs labeled with an FP but also in non-modified Gαi/o subunits. Our 2PPM and GRK3ct translocation results indicate that non-modified Gαi/o constructs extensively dissociate from Gβγ partners upon activation. In contrast, some of the FP-tagged Gαi/o constructs investigated remain in the form of a heterotrimer. Interestingly, our results show that even FP-tagged constructs that do not dissociate upon activation can activate downstream signaling pathways. Thus, at least in FP-modified constructs, Gαi/o dissociation is not required for downstream signaling. However, the extent of dissociation in non-modified Gi/o proteins indicates that the dissociated Gα and Gβγ subunits are the major activated form that mediates downstream signaling in a natural setting. Most constructs used in this study were gifts from Drs. M. Bünemann (Gαi1-L91-YFP, Gαi2-L91-YFP, Gαi3-L91-YFP, Gαo-L91-YFP, α2a adrenergic receptor (α2aAR), α2aAR-YFP, and α2aAR-CFP), A. Tinker (GAP43-CFP-Gαi1, GAP43-CFP-Gαi2, GAP43-CFP-Gαi3, and GAP43-CFP-Gαo), N. Lambert (GRK3ct-Venus), and V. Ruiz-Velasco (Gβ1, Gγ2, and Gβ1-YFP). All Gαi/o-FP constructs bore the C351I (or C352I) mutation, rendering them insensitive to pertussis toxin. Constitutively active (CA) mutants of Gαi/o-FP constructs and non-tagged Gαi1, Gαi3, and Gαo constructs (all bearing the C351I or C352I mutation) were created from the corresponding Gαi/o-FP constructs by PCR (Phusion polymerase, NEB) and verified by DNA sequencing (LGC Genomics, Germany). The plasmid encoding non-tagged Gαi2 (bearing a C351I mutation) was purchased from the Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center. We prepared GRK3ct-Cerulean by PCR from masGRK3ct-Cerulean (a gift from N. Lambert) by removing the mas membrane tag and amino acids 488–547 of GRK3. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax I and high glucose (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on 8-chamber microscopy slides (μ-Slides, Ibidi GmbH, Germany) or 6-chamber perfusion microscopy slides (μ-Slide VI Luer slides, Ibidi GmbH). Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In cotransfections, we used equimolar amounts of plasmids encoding Gαi/o, Gβ1, Gγ2, and α2aAR. The GRK3ct-encoding constructs were cotransfected at 0.8 equivalents. Microscopy experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. In experiments involving GRK3ct constructs, we inhibited endogenous Gi/o signaling by treatment with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 16 h prior to microscopy observations. G protein activation experiments were performed in perfusion slides at room temperature under a continuous flow of peristaltically pumped (Minipuls 3, Gilson, UK), HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4). Norepinephrine ((±)-norepinephrine (+)-bitartrate salt (NE), Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μm was applied for 30 s. We conducted all microscopy experiments on a customized laser scanning microscope (iMic2, Till Photonics, Germany) equipped with a titanium:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II with group velocity dispersion compensation, Coherent) using a UApoPlan/IR ×60 numerical aperture 1.2 water immersion objective lens (Olympus, Japan). A long-pass dichroic mirror and an emission filter (Q565LP, Chroma) and Brightline 479/40 (Semrock) for CFP and 740DCXR (Chroma) and Brightline 542/27 (Semrock) for YFP separated fluorescence from the excitation laser beam. Fluorescence was detected by a photomultiplier (R6357, Hamamatsu Photonics) equipped with an IR-blocking filter (HQ700SP-2P, Chroma). For each imaging experiment, we quantitatively analyzed at least 10 representative cells. The method of 2PPM, including the experimental arrangement, is described in detail in Ref. 18Lazar J. Bondar A. Timr S. Firestein S.J. Two-photon polarization microscopy reveals protein structure and function.Nat. Meth. 2011; 8: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. In 2PPM experiments, the direction of polarization of the excitation beam was alternated between horizontal and vertical by a polarization modulator (RPM-2P, Innovative Bioimaging) operated at 100 kHz and synchronized with acquisition of individual pixels by the microscope. FRET measurements were performed on an iMic2 microscope equipped with a Polychrome IV light source (both Till Photonics) using an UApoPlan/IR ×60 numerical aperture 1.2 water immersion objective lens (Olympus). FRET was determined as a ratio of YFP to CFP emission (FYFP/FCFP) using 438 ± 12 nm of excitation. The CFP signal was recorded using a Brightline 438/24 excitation filter, Brightline 458 long-pass dichroic beam splitter, and Brightline 472/30 emission filter (all Semrock). The YFP signal was recorded with a Brightline 438/24 excitation filter for FRET images or a Brightline 479/40 for direct YFP excitation, a Brightline 509 long-pass dichroic beam splitter, and a Brightline 530/25 emission filter (all Semrock). Images were recorded sequentially with an ImagoQE camera (Till Photonics). The illumination time was set to 500 ms. CFP spillover into the FRET channel and YFP direct excitation upon 438 ± 12 nm of illumination were calculated and subtracted from the FRET signal to give the corrected FYFP/FCFP ratio. For each imaging experiment, we quantitatively analyzed at least 10 representative cells. To display the ratiometric information contained in 2PPM images, we processed the raw images in ImageJ and Polaris+ (Innovative Bioimaging) (Fig. 1). In short, each raw 2PPM image was deinterleaved into two images containing pixels obtained with horizontally and vertically polarized excitation, respectively. After background subtraction and adjustment for differences in laser beam intensity and pulse duration between the two polarizations, we applied a lookup table designed to express fluorescence intensity by brightness and values of the dichroic ratio by hue. On the color scale used, green indicates an excess of fluorescence excited by vertical polarization (Fv) and red an excess of fluorescence excited by horizontal polarization (Fh). Pure red or green color pixels indicate values of the dichroic ratio exceeding the maximum value set by the color scale. Quantitative analysis of 2PPM images was carried out as described in Ref. 18Lazar J. Bondar A. Timr S. Firestein S.J. Two-photon polarization microscopy reveals protein structure and function.Nat. Meth. 2011; 8: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar using Matlab scripts developed in-house. Briefly, we calculated the dichroic ratio (r = Fh/Fv) and log ratio (log2(r)) for each pixel corresponding to the cell outline. We then associated the values of r (and log2(r)) with information on cell membrane orientation (angle θ). We determined the values of rmax (and log2(rmax)), characteristic of the construct being investigated, by calculating the mean of values of r (and log2(r)) for parts of the cell outline close to horizontal (θ - π/2 < 3°) and 1/r (and log2(1/r)) for parts of the cell outline close to vertical (θ < 3°). Thus, values of rmax > 1 (and log2(rmax) > 0) indicate that α0, the mean fluorophore angle with respect to the membrane normal, is larger than the two-photon magic angle (α0 > 52.0°). To visualize and quantitate GRK3ct-FP translocation and localization (FIGURE 5., FIGURE 7.), we performed a background subtraction (using an image area outside of a cell), a correction for bleaching, and image thresholding in ImageJ. For visualization, we applied a lookup table designed to express values of fluorescence intensity ratios by hue. We quantitated GRK3ct-FP translocation (Fig. 5, D–G) by manually selecting a cytoplasmic region of a cell and taking a ratio of fluorescence intensities before and during stimulation of the cell with NE. The procedure of quantitating GRK3ct-FP membrane localization (Fig. 7) consisted of selecting the whole cell area by thresholding, measuring the fluorescence intensity (Fmembrane) in a manually selected, 250-nm-wide cell outline, and comparing it to the fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm (Fcytoplasm). To account for low fluorescence intensities at the outer edge of the cell outline, the Fmembrane/Fcytoplasm ratios were normalized by those obtained in cells overexpressing only GRK3ct-Venus.FIGURE 1.2PPM image processing illustrated on an example of a cell expressing the GAP43-CFP-Gαi2, Gβ1, and Gγ2 constructs. A, raw 2PPM image containing pixels obtained with both excitation light polarizations.

D, linear dichroism image, obtained from images B and C, after adjustments for differences in laser beam intensity and pulse duration between the two polarizations and application of a lookup table designed to express fluorescence intensity by brightness and values of the dichroic ratio (r) by hue. The color scale indicates an excess of fluorescence excited by vertical polarization (Fv) in green and an excess of fluorescence excited by horizontal polarization (Fh) in red. E, pixels from horizontal and vertical parts of the cell outline are used for calculation of the maximum dichroic ratio. The maximum dichroic ratio rmax (and log2(rmax)) is obtained by calculating the mean values of r (and log2(r)) from horizontal and 1/r (and log2(1/r)) from vertical parts of the cell outline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7.Extent of GRK3ct-Venus translocation upon G protein activation.

https://openalex.org/W1997766924,"Cell migration is regulated by a number of small GTPases, including members of the Arf family. Cytohesins, a family of Arf-activating proteins, have been extensively implicated in the regulation of Arfs during migration and cell shape change. Membrane association of both the Arf and its activating protein is a prerequisite for Arf activation. Therefore regulating the extent of cytohesin membrane association is a mechanism for controlling the initiation of cell movement. We have discovered a novel intramolecular interaction that controls the association of cytohesins with membranes. The presence of the coiled-coil domain reduces the association of cytohesin 2 with membranes. We demonstrate that this domain interacts with more C-terminal regions of the protein. This interaction is independent of another previously identified autoinhibitory conformation. A threonine residue (T276) in the cytohesin 2 PH domain is a target for phosphorylation by Akt. Mutation of this threonine to aspartic acid, to mimic phosphorylation, disrupts the binding of the coiled-coil domain to c-terminal regions and promotes membrane association of cytohesin 2. The presence of a second autoinhibitory interaction in the cytohesins suggests that these proteins can act a signal integrators that stimulate migration only after receive multiple pro-migratory signals."

Once the Mcm2-7 complex encircles a single-strand of DNA, GINS binds to the Cdc45-Mcm2-7 complex to form the CMG complex (12Costa A. llves I. Tamberg N. Petojevic T. Nogales E. Botchan M. Berger J.

The structural basis for MCM2–7 helicase activation by GINS and Cdc45.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The sealed CMG ring allows for processive translocation of the helicase while surrounding single-stranded DNA (17Fu Y. Yardimci H. Long D. Ho T. Guainazzi A. Bermudez V. Hurwitz J. van Oijen A.

The CMG does not dissociate from DNA during replication of the genome because of its closed-ringed structure (6Ilves I. Petojevic T. Pesavento J. Botchan M.

Sld2, along with Sld3 and Dpb11, assist in the recruitment of GINS to replication origins during S phase in a manner that depends upon CDK activity (18Tanaka S. Umemori T. Hirai K. Muramatsu S.

Sld2 also forms part of the pre-loading complex, which is a CDK-dependent assembly composed of Sld2, Pol ϵ, Dpb11, and GINS (23Muramatsu S. Hirai K. Tak Y. Kamimura Y. Araki H.

It has previously been reported that in vitro, GINS and Sld2 compete with one another for Mcm2-7 binding (24Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L.

Chem. 2011; 286: 36414-36426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of this in vitro observation has not been elucidated. It has also been reported that single-stranded origin DNA binds to CDK-activated Sld2; furthermore, CDK-activated-Sld2 binding to origin ssDNA dissociates Sld2 from the Mcm2-7 complex in vitro (24Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L. Enabling association of the GINS tetramer with the Mcm2–7 complex by phosphorylated Sld2 protein and single-stranded origin DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36414-36426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A mutant of Sld2 that does not bind DNA, Sld2-K44E,K50E,K438E (Sld2-DNA), is lethal when expressed in budding yeast cells, and DNA replication is substantially inhibited when this sld2-DNA mutant is expressed in budding yeast (24Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L. Enabling association of the GINS tetramer with the Mcm2–7 complex by phosphorylated Sld2 protein and single-stranded origin DNA.J. Biol.

In this report, we identify a mutation of Sld2 that is specifically defective in binding Mcm2-7. This mutant, Sld2-m1,4 (Sld2-K416E,R435E,R436E), in contrast to wild-type Sld2, does not compete with GINS for Mcm2-7 binding in vitro. When sld2-m1,4 is expressed in budding yeast cells, there is a severe growth defect and DNA replication is substantially inhibited. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that in sld2-m1,4 mutant cells, GINS associates with Cdc45-Mcm2-7 prematurely in G1, while wild-type cells reveal no GINS association with Cdc45-Mcm2-7 until S phase. Furthermore, RPA-chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of cells exposed to hydroxyurea demonstrate that RPA is not recruited to origins in S phase in sld2-m1,4 mutant cells, unlike wild-type cells. These data suggest that Sld2-Mcm2-7 interaction is required to restrict the association of GINS with Mcm2-7 to S phase. We also find that for cells expressing sld2-DNA, GINS does not associate with Mcm2-7. These data suggest that Sld2-ssDNA interaction is essential to allow GINS to bind Mcm2-7 during S phase.

The sld2-td degron strain was transformed with a PRS415 vector containing either an empty vector, SLD2-wild-type, sld2-m1,4, or sld2-DNA under the control of the native Sld2 promoter. Positive transformants were selected on CSM-leu plates. PSF2-5FLAG and MCM4-9Myc were generated using reagents from Yeast Genetic Resource Center (Strain BY 25927) and Karim Labib (Strain YAG-355-2). Antibodies directed against RPA, Mcm2, and Pol2 were purchased (RPA-Pierce MA1-25889, Mcm2-Santa Cruz SC-28551, Pol2-Santa Cruz SC-6752). Antibodies against Psf2 and Cdc45 were generated and purified as described (27Bruck I. Kaplan D.

Open Biosystems produced polyclonal antibodies directed against Sld2 or Dpb11 (we supplied the antigens). Crude serum was purified against immobilized antigen to remove nonspecific antibodies. The specificity of each antibody was analyzed by Western analysis of purified protein and wild-type yeast extract (not shown). Antibodies directed against the flag or myc epitopes were commercially purchased. Serial dilution was performed as described (24Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L.

For G1 arrest and release experiments 6 × 106 cells/ml were treated with α-factor (Zymo Research) for 3 h. Following extensive washes and addition of 50 μg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem), cells were further incubated for the indicated time. Cell cycle progression was followed by flow cytometry (FACS) stained with propidium iodide using FACSAria. For G1 arrest and release experiments 6 × 106 cells/ml were treated with α-factor (Zymo Research) for 3 h. Cells were then subjected to extensive washes, followed by the addition of 50 μg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem). Cells were further incubated in 0.2 m hydroxyurea for the indicated time. Cells (4 × 108) were collected and lysed at 4 °C with glass beads (BeadBeater) in IP buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.9, 100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8215), 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche 04693132001). Lysed material was treated with 200 units of Benzonase nuclease (Novagen 70746–3) on ice for 1 h. Clarified extract was then mixed with 2 μl of specified antibody and rotated for 2 h in the cold room, and then 5 μl of Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen 100.01D) beads equilibrated with IP buffer, were added and further incubated for 2 h. Fixed samples (formaldehyde) were prepared as described (23Muramatsu S. Hirai K. Tak Y. Kamimura Y. Araki H. CDK-dependent complex formation between replication proteins Dpb11, Sld2, Pol (epsilon}, and GINS in budding yeast.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Beads were washed with two times with 1 ml of IP buffer and finally resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Western analysis was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Lifesciences). For G1 arrest and release experiments 6 × 106 cells/ml were treated with α-factor (Zymo Research) for 3 h. Following extensive washes and addition of 50 μg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem), cells were further incubated for the indicated time. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (27Bruck I.

Chem. 2013; 288: 7550-7563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We performed PCR with [32P-α]dCTP as a component of the PCR reaction to quantify the amplified product. Formaldehyde cross-linked cells were lysed with glass beads in a Bead Beater. DNA was fragmented by sonication (Branson 450). Antibody and magnetic protein A beads (Dynabeads Protein A, Invitrogen 100.02D) were added to the cleared lysate to immunoprecipitate the DNA. Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively to remove nonspecific DNA. Eluted DNA was then subjected to PCR analysis using primers directed against ARS305, ARS306, or a region midway between ARS305 and ARS306 as described (29van Deursen F. Sengupta S. De Piccoli G.

Mcm10 associates with the loaded DNA helicase at replication origins and defines a novel step in its activation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2195-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The radioactive band in the agarose gel, representing specific PCR-amplified DNA product, was quantified by phosphorimaging and normalized by a reference standard run in the same gel. The reference standard was a PCR reaction accomplished with known quantity of template DNA replacing immunoprecipitate. We previously reported that Sld2 binds directly to the Mcm2-7 complex by GST-pulldown assays of purified proteins and size-exclusion chromatography analysis (24Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L. Enabling association of the GINS tetramer with the Mcm2–7 complex by phosphorylated Sld2 protein and single-stranded origin DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36414-36426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We sought to identify a mutant of Sld2 that is specifically defective in Mcm2-7 binding, to characterize the role of Sld2-Mcm2-7 interaction in vivo. We previously found that region 1–106 and region 390–453 of Sld2 bind to single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1A) (24Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L. Enabling association of the GINS tetramer with the Mcm2–7 complex by phosphorylated Sld2 protein and single-stranded origin DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36414-36426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify the region of Sld2 that binds to Mcm2-7, we divided Sld2 into an N-terminal region (amino acids 1–389, Sld2–1-389), and a C-terminal region (amino acids 390–453, Sld2–390-453). We engineered a PKA tag at the N termini of the proteins to allow for protein radiolabeling with 32P and subsequent quantitation of the pulldown assay. We found that GST-Mcm2-7 pulls down [32P]Sld2-full-length protein like the C-terminal [32P]Sld2–390-453 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, GST-Mcm2-7 does not pull down the N-terminal [32P]Sld2–1-389 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, GST-Sld2–390-453 pulls down [32P]Mcm2-7 like wild-type GST-Sld2, while GST-Sld2–1-389 does not pull down [32P]Mcm2-7 (Fig. 1C). The C-terminal region (390–453) of Sld2 is rich in positively charged amino acids, and we postulated that the interaction between Sld2 and Mcm2-7 is mediated at least in part by one or more of these positively charged amino acids. We reversed the charge of the lysines and arginines in the 390–453 region of Sld2, generating 8 mutations, designated Sld2-m1 to Sld2-m8 (Fig. 1A). We screened each of these 8 mutants with the GST-pulldown assays, and we"
https://openalex.org/W2028170650,"The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is crucial in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance, in that Drd3 gene ablation in mice results in hypertension and failure to excrete a dietary salt load. The mechanism responsible for the renal sodium retention in these mice is largely unknown. We now offer and describe a novel mechanism by which D3R decreases sodium transport in the long term by inhibiting the deubiquitinylating activity of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 48 (USP48), thereby promoting Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE)-3 degradation. We found that stimulation with the D3R-specific agonist PD128907 (1 μM, 30 min) promoted the interaction and colocalization among D3R, NHE3, and USP48; inhibited USP48 activity (-35±6%, vs. vehicle), resulting in increased ubiquitinylated NHE3 (+140±10%); and decreased NHE3 expression (-50±9%) in human renal proximal tubule cells (hRPTCs). USP48 silencing decreased NHE3's half-life (USP48 siRNA t1/2=6.1 h vs. vehicle t1/2=12.9 h), whereas overexpression of USP48 increased NHE3 half-life (t1/2=21.8 h), indicating that USP48 protects NHE3 from degradation via deubiquitinylation. USP48 accounted for ∼30% of the total deubiquitinylating activity in these cells. Extending our studies in vivo, we found that pharmacologic blockade of D3R via the D3R-specific antagonist GR103691 (1 μg/kg/min, 4 d) in C57Bl/6J mice increased renal NHE3 expression (+310±15%, vs. vehicle), whereas an innovative kidney-restricted Usp48 silencing via siRNA (3 μg/d, 7 d) increased ubiquitinylated NHE3 (+250±30%, vs. controls), decreased total NHE3 (-23±2%), and lowered blood pressure (-24±2 mm Hg), compared with that in control mice that received either the vehicle or nonsilencing siRNA. Our data demonstrate a crucial role for the dynamic interaction between D3R and USP48 in the regulation of NHE3 expression and function."

The survey for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage among HCWs has mostly been conducted to investigate outbreaks or endemics. Community-associated MRSA are prevalent among children in Taiwan. We conducted this study to better understand the carriage rate of MRSA among pediatricians in non-outbreak situations in Taiwan,.A total of 220 pediatricians from Taiwan who attended the annual meeting of Taiwan Pediatric Association in April, 2010 were recruited to participate in this study and were sampled from the nares for the detection of MRSA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and further by culture. The following molecular analyses were performed, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), typing of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes.MRSA was detected from 15 attendees (6.8%) by PCR. MRSA-colonized attendees had a significantly lower rate (0.041) of working in the medical center, while borderline significantly higher rate of working in the Regional Hospital (p=0.056), than those without MRSA colonization. From those 15 samples, 12 MRSA isolates were identified by culture and molecularly characterized. Three PFGE patterns, two sequence types (ST 59, ST 508), and two SCCmec types (IV and VT) were identified, respectively. Five isolates, including three carrying SCCmec types VT, were PVL-positive. All 12 isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, fusidic acid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycyclin, and resistant to penicillin.Around seven percent of pediatricians in Taiwan harbored CA-MRSA in their nares."
https://openalex.org/W2038144055,"Proteins of the Sac10b family are highly conserved in Archaea. Ssh10b, a member of the Sac10b family from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus shibatae, binds to RNA in vivo. Here we show that binding by Ssh10b destabilizes RNA secondary structure. Structural analysis of Ssh10b in complex with a 25-bp RNA duplex containing local distortions reveals that Ssh10b binds the two RNA strands symmetrically as a tetramer with each dimer bound asymmetrically to a single RNA strand. Amino acid residues involved in double-stranded RNA binding are similar, but non-identical, to those in dsDNA binding. The dimer-dimer interaction mediated by the intermolecular β-sheet appears to facilitate the destabilization of base pairing in the secondary structure of RNA. Our results suggest that proteins of the Sac10b family may play important roles in RNA transactions requiring destabilization of RNA secondary structure in Sulfolobus."

https://openalex.org/W2040939583,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has a poor prognosis with high in-hospital mortality. Hepatic and circulating inflammatory cytokines, such as fibrinogen like protein 2 (fgl2), FasL/Fas, and TNFα/TNFR1, play a significant role in the pathophysiology of ACLF. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying constructed DNA code for non-native microRNA (miRNA) targeting mouse fgl2 (mfgl2) or both mFas and mTNFR1 on murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-3-induced fulminant hepatitis in BALB/cJ mice. Artificial miRNA eukaryotic expression plasmids against mfgl2, mFas, and mTNFR1 were constructed, and their inhibitory effects on the target genes were confirmed in vitro. pcDNA6.2-mFas-mTNFR1- miRNA，which expresses miRNA against both mFas and mTNFR1 simultaneously，was constructed. To construct a miRNA adenovirus expression vector against mfgl2, pcDNA6.2-mfgl2-miRNA was cloned using Gateway technology. Ad-mFas-mTNFR1- miRNA was also constructed by the same procedure. Adenovirus vectors were delivered by tail-vein injection into MHV-3-infected BALB/cJ mice to evaluate the therapeutic effect. 8 of 18 (44.4%) mice recovered from fulminant viral hepatitis in the combined interference group treated with Ad-mfgl2-miRNA and Ad-mFas-mTNFR1-miRNA. But only 4 of 18 (22.2%) mice receiving Ad-mfgl2-miRNA and 3 of 18 (16.7%) mice receiving Ad-mFas-mTNFR1- miRNA survived. These adenovirus vectors significantly ameliorated inflammatory infiltration, fibrin deposition, hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, and prolonged survival time. Our data illustrated that combined interference using adenovirus-mediated artificial miRNAs targeting mfgl2, mFas, and mTNFR1 might have significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of fulminant hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W1971856549,"TASK3 two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels are responsible for native leak K channels in many cell types which regulate cell resting membrane potential and excitability. In addition, TASK3 channels contribute to the regulation of cellular potassium homeostasis. Because TASK3 channels are important for cell viability, having putative roles in both neuronal apoptosis and oncogenesis, we sought to determine their behavior under inflammatory conditions by investigating the effect of TNFα on TASK3 channel current. TASK3 channels were expressed in tsA-201 cells, and the current through them was measured using whole cell voltage clamp recordings. We show that THP-1 human myeloid leukemia monocytes, co-cultured with hTASK3-transfected tsA-201 cells, can be activated by the specific Toll-like receptor 7/8 activator, R848, to release TNFα that subsequently enhances hTASK3 current. Both hTASK3 and mTASK3 channel activity is increased by incubation with recombinant TNFα (10 ng/ml for 2-15 h), but other K2P channels (hTASK1, hTASK2, hTREK1, and hTRESK) are unaffected. This enhancement by TNFα is not due to alterations in levels of channel expression at the membrane but rather to an alteration in channel gating. The enhancement by TNFα can be blocked by extracellular acidification but persists for mutated TASK3 (H98A) channels that are no longer acid-sensitive even in an acidic extracellular environment. TNFα action on TASK3 channels is mediated through the intracellular C terminus of the channel. Furthermore, it occurs through the ASK1 pathway and is JNK- and p38-dependent. In combination, TNFα activation and TASK3 channel activity can promote cellular apoptosis."
