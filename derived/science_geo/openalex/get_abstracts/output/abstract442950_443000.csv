https://openalex.org/W1993976394,"Alzheimer’s-prone mice deficient in NLRP3 or caspase-1 fail to develop learning deficits and show reduced neuropathology. Alzheimer's disease is associated with activation of the innate immune system. It is known that amyloid-β can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro in microglia, and here it is shown that the inflammasome has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease pathology in a mouse model in vivo. In the absence of NLRP3 or caspase-1, amyloidosis and neuropathology in mice is reduced, and cognition and associated electrophysiological parameters improved. Examination of post-mortem human Alzheimer's brains supports the link between NLRP3 and brain inflammation. Taken together, these results suggest that amyloid-β-induced activation of NLRP3 enhances the progression of Alzheimer's disease by mediating a harmful chronic inflammatory tissue post-mortem response, and that agents that block the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome, or inflammasome-derived cytokines, might slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the world’s most common dementing illness. Deposition of amyloid-β peptide drives cerebral neuroinflammation by activating microglia1,2. Indeed, amyloid-β activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is fundamental for interleukin-1β maturation and subsequent inflammatory events3. However, it remains unknown whether NLRP3 activation contributes to Alzheimer’s disease in vivo. Here we demonstrate strongly enhanced active caspase-1 expression in human mild cognitive impairment and brains with Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a role for the inflammasome in this neurodegenerative disease. Nlrp3−/− or Casp1−/− mice carrying mutations associated with familial Alzheimer’s disease were largely protected from loss of spatial memory and other sequelae associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and demonstrated reduced brain caspase-1 and interleukin-1β activation as well as enhanced amyloid-β clearance. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome deficiency skewed microglial cells to an M2 phenotype and resulted in the decreased deposition of amyloid-β in the APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer’s disease. These results show an important role for the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition represents a new therapeutic intervention for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2073523429,"Comparative analysis of the genomes of one mollusc (Lottia gigantea) and two annelids (Capitella teleta and Helobdella robusta) enable a more complete reconstruction of genomic features of the last common ancestors of protostomes, bilaterians and metazoans; against this conserved background they provide the first glimpse into lineage-specific evolution and diversity of the lophotrochozoans. This paper presents the draft genome sequences of two annelids — a freshwater leech (Helobdella robusta) and a bristly, segmented marine worm (Capitella teleta) — and a mollusc, the owl limpet (Lottia gigantea). These two phyla account for nearly one-third of known marine species and are of importance both ecologically and as experimental systems, yet they have not been served well by genomics efforts. Comparison of these genomes with those already available reveal some of the genetic changes linked to the origin and diversification of bilateral animals that are thought to have evolved during the 'Cambrian explosion' of multicellular life around 500 million years ago. Current genomic perspectives on animal diversity neglect two prominent phyla, the molluscs and annelids, that together account for nearly one-third of known marine species and are important both ecologically and as experimental systems in classical embryology1,2,3. Here we describe the draft genomes of the owl limpet (Lottia gigantea), a marine polychaete (Capitella teleta) and a freshwater leech (Helobdella robusta), and compare them with other animal genomes to investigate the origin and diversification of bilaterians from a genomic perspective. We find that the genome organization, gene structure and functional content of these species are more similar to those of some invertebrate deuterostome genomes (for example, amphioxus and sea urchin) than those of other protostomes that have been sequenced to date (flies, nematodes and flatworms). The conservation of these genomic features enables us to expand the inventory of genes present in the last common bilaterian ancestor, establish the tripartite diversification of bilaterians using multiple genomic characteristics and identify ancient conserved long- and short-range genetic linkages across metazoans. Superimposed on this broadly conserved pan-bilaterian background we find examples of lineage-specific genome evolution, including varying rates of rearrangement, intron gain and loss, expansions and contractions of gene families, and the evolution of clade-specific genes that produce the unique content of each genome."
https://openalex.org/W2055363965,"The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schrödinger equation is a 'non-polynomial hard' problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, electron-electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods--based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate--have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the 'gold standard' coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle-hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state problems."
https://openalex.org/W2115373764,"Focal adhesions are large protein complexes organized at the basal surface of cells, which physically connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton and have long been speculated to mediate cell migration. However, whether clustering of these molecular components into focal adhesions is actually required for these proteins to regulate cell motility is unclear. Here we use quantitative microscopy to characterize descriptors of focal adhesion and cell motility for mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human fibrosarcoma cells, across a wide range of matrix compliance and following genetic manipulations of focal adhesion proteins (vinculin, talin, zyxin, FAK, and paxilin). This analysis reveals a tight, biphasic gaussian relationship between mean size of focal adhesions (not their number, surface density, or shape) and cell speed. The predictive power of this relationship is comprehensively validated by disrupting nonfocal adhesion proteins (α-actinin, F-actin, and myosin II) and subcellular organelles (mitochondria, nuclear DNA, etc.) not known to affect either focal adhesions or cell migration. This study suggests that the mean size of focal adhesions robustly and precisely predicts cell speed independently of focal adhesion surface density and molecular composition."
https://openalex.org/W2087034915,"Mitochondrial DNA mutations transmitted maternally within the oocyte cytoplasm often cause life-threatening disorders. Here we explore the use of nuclear genome transfer between unfertilized oocytes of two donors to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial mutations. Nuclear genome transfer did not reduce developmental efficiency to the blastocyst stage, and genome integrity was maintained provided that spontaneous oocyte activation was avoided through the transfer of incompletely assembled spindle–chromosome complexes. Mitochondrial DNA transferred with the nuclear genome was initially detected at levels below 1%, decreasing in blastocysts and stem-cell lines to undetectable levels, and remained undetectable after passaging for more than one year, clonal expansion, differentiation into neurons, cardiomyocytes or β-cells, and after cellular reprogramming. Stem cells and differentiated cells had mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and oxygen consumption rates indistinguishable from controls. These results demonstrate the potential of nuclear genome transfer to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disorders in humans. Nuclear genome transfer using unfertilized donor oocytes is performed and shown to be effective in preventing the transmission of mitochondrial DNA mutations; the swapped oocytes can develop to the blastocyst stage, and produce parthenogenetic embryonic stem-cell lines that show normal karyotypes and only mitochondrial DNA from the donor oocyte. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause various human diseases. Their inheritance is through the mother because all zygotic mitochondria derive from the oocyte. Shoukhrat Mitalipov and colleagues previously reported proof-of-concept replacement of mtDNA through chromosome spindle transfer in macaque oocytes, and here they extend the technology to human oocytes. They also report on the health of a 3-year-old macaque born from an mtDNA-replaced oocyte. This work suggests that replacement therapy for mtDNA disorders could become a reality. Dieter Egli and colleagues took a different approach: they performed nuclear genome transfer between unfertilized human oocytes from two different donors. The resulting oocytes retained the ability to develop to the blastocyst stage and to produce embryonic stem cell lines with normal karyotypes. This technique has the potential to prevent the transmission of mtDNA mutations without causing manipulation-induced karyotypic abnormalities."

https://openalex.org/W2010961876,"The sulfonylurea receptor 1 (Sur1)-NC(Ca-ATP) channel plays a central role in necrotic cell death in central nervous system (CNS) injury, including ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. Here, we show that Sur1-NC(Ca-ATP) channels are formed by co-assembly of Sur1 and transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Trpm4). Co-expression of Sur1 and Trpm4 yielded Sur1-Trpm4 heteromers, as shown in experiments with Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and co-immunoprecipitation. Co-expression of Sur1 and Trpm4 also yielded functional Sur1-Trpm4 channels with biophysical properties of Trpm4 and pharmacological properties of Sur1. Co-assembly with Sur1 doubled the affinity of Trpm4 for calmodulin and doubled its sensitivity to intracellular calcium. Experiments with FRET and co-immunoprecipitation showed de novo appearance of Sur1-Trpm4 heteromers after spinal cord injury in rats. Our findings depart from the long-held view of an exclusive association between Sur1 and K(ATP) channels and reveal an unexpected molecular partnership with far-ranging implications for CNS injury."

https://openalex.org/W2087243728,"Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive protein with neuroprotective effects in animal models of neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. We constructed a set of lentiviral vectors that contain or lack the highly conserved final four amino acids of MANF (""RTDL""), which resemble the canonical ER retention signal (""KDEL""), to study MANF regulation in neuroblastoma cells and rat primary cortical neurons. The RTDL sequence was required for both ER retention and secretory response to ER stress. Overexpression of KDEL receptor paralogs (KDELRs) differentially reduced MANF secretion but had no effect on MANF lacking RTDL. MANF binding to the plasma membrane also required the RTDL sequence and was inhibited with a peptide known to interact with KDELRs, suggesting MANF binds KDELRs at the surface. We detected surface localization of FLAG-tagged KDELRs, with levels increasing following ER stress. Our study provides new insight into the regulation of MANF trafficking and has implications for other secreted proteins containing a KDEL-like retention signal."
https://openalex.org/W1998958787,"Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis evidenced by an altered microbiome forming thick biofilms on the epithelium. Additionally, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strains are frequently isolated from ileal lesions of CD patients indicating a potential role for these strains in disease pathogenesis. The composition and characteristics of the host microbiome are influenced by environmental factors, particularly diet. Polysaccharides added to food as emulsifiers, stabilizers or bulking agents have been linked to bacteria-associated intestinal disorders. The escalating consumption of polysaccharides in Western diets parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20th century. In this study, the effect of a polysaccharide panel on adhesiveness of the CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 was analyzed to determine if these food additives promote disease-associated bacterial phenotypes. Maltodextrin (MDX), a polysaccharide derived from starch hydrolysis, markedly enhanced LF82 specific biofilm formation. Biofilm formation of multiple other E. coli strains was also promoted by MDX. MDX-induced E. coli biofilm formation was independent of polysaccharide chain length indicating a requirement for MDX metabolism. MDX exposure induced type I pili expression, which was required for MDX-enhanced biofilm formation. MDX also increased bacterial adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers in a mechanism dependent on type 1 pili and independent of the cellular receptor CEACAM6, suggesting a novel mechanism of epithelial cell adhesion. Analysis of mucosa-associated bacteria from individuals with and without CD showed increased prevalence of malX, a gene essential for MDX metabolism, uniquely in the ileum of CD patients. These findings demonstrate that the ubiquitous dietary component MDX enhances E. coli adhesion and suggests a mechanism by which Western diets rich in specific polysaccharides may promote dysbiosis of gut microbes and contribute to disease susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2027829948,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), a key mediator of fibrotic responses, is increased in asthma and drives airway remodeling by inducing expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β-induced ECM expression by airway smooth muscle cells and demonstrate a novel link between TGF-β and Wingless/integrase 1 (WNT) signaling in ECM deposition. Airway smooth muscle expresses abundant WNT ligands, with the noncanonical WNT-5A being the most profoundly expressed. Interestingly, WNT-5A shows ∼2-fold higher abundance in airway smooth muscle cells isolated from individuals with asthma than individuals without asthma. WNT-5A is markedly induced in response to TGF-β (4-16-fold; EC₅₀ 0.3 ng/ml) and is required for collagen and fibronectin expression by airway smooth muscle. WNT-5A engages noncanonical WNT signaling pathways, as inhibition of Ca(2+) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling attenuated this TGF-β response, whereas the canonical WNT antagonist Dickkopf 1 (DKK-1) did not. Accordingly, WNT-5A induced JNK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Furthermore, silencing of the WNT-5A receptors Frizzled 8 (FZD8) and RYK attenuated TGF-β-induced ECM expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that noncanonical WNT-5A signaling is activated by and necessary for TGF-β-induced ECM production by airway smooth muscle cells, which could have significance in asthma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1975982215,"The diffuse B-cell lymphoma (Dbl) family of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors is a direct activator of the Rho family proteins. The Rho family proteins are involved in almost every cellular process that ranges from fundamental (e.g. the establishment of cell polarity) to highly specialized processes (e.g. the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells). Abnormal activation of the Rho proteins is known to play a crucial role in cancer, infectious and cognitive disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. However, the existence of 74 Dbl proteins and 25 Rho-related proteins in humans, which are largely uncharacterized, has led to increasing complexity in identifying specific upstream pathways. Thus, we comprehensively investigated sequence-structure-function-property relationships of 21 representatives of the Dbl protein family regarding their specificities and activities toward 12 Rho family proteins. The meta-analysis approach provides an unprecedented opportunity to broadly profile functional properties of Dbl family proteins, including catalytic efficiency, substrate selectivity, and signaling specificity. Our analysis has provided novel insights into the following: (i) understanding of the relative differences of various Rho protein members in nucleotide exchange; (ii) comparing and defining individual and overall guanine nucleotide exchange factor activities of a large representative set of the Dbl proteins toward 12 Rho proteins; (iii) grouping the Dbl family into functionally distinct categories based on both their catalytic efficiencies and their sequence-structural relationships; (iv) identifying conserved amino acids as fingerprints of the Dbl and Rho protein interaction; and (v) defining amino acid sequences conserved within, but not between, Dbl subfamilies. Therefore, the characteristics of such specificity-determining residues identified the regions or clusters conserved within the Dbl subfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W2079827512,"Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes that can use photosynthesis to convert sunlight into cellular fuel. Knowledge of the organization of the membrane systems in cyanobacteria is critical to understanding the metabolic processes in these organisms. We examined the wild-type strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and a series of mutants with altered light-harvesting phycobilisome antenna systems for changes in thylakoid membrane architecture under different conditions. Using small-angle neutron scattering, it was possible to resolve correlation distances of subcellular structures in live cells on the nanometer scale and capture dynamic light-induced changes to these distances. Measurements made from samples with varied scattering contrasts confirmed that these distances could be attributed to the thylakoid lamellar system. We found that the changes to the thylakoid system were reversible between light- and dark-adapted states, demonstrating a robust structural flexibility in the architecture of cyanobacterial cells. Chemical disruption of photosynthetic electron transfer diminished these changes, confirming the involvement of the photosynthetic apparatus. We have correlated these findings with electron microscopy data to understand the origin of the changes in the membranes and found that light induces an expansion in the center-to-center distances between the thylakoid membrane layers. These combined data lend a dynamic dimension to the intracellular organization in cyanobacterial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092489985,"The peptide hormone Urocortin 3 (Ucn 3) is abundantly and exclusively expressed in mouse pancreatic beta cells where it regulates insulin secretion. Here we demonstrate that Ucn 3 first appears at embryonic day (E) 17.5 and, from approximately postnatal day (p) 7 and onwards throughout adult life, becomes a unifying and exclusive feature of mouse beta cells. These observations identify Ucn 3 as a potential beta cell maturation marker. To determine whether Ucn 3 is similarly restricted to beta cells in humans, we conducted comprehensive immunohistochemistry and gene expression experiments on macaque and human pancreas and sorted primary human islet cells. This revealed that Ucn 3 is not restricted to the beta cell lineage in primates, but is also expressed in alpha cells. To substantiate these findings, we analyzed human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pancreatic endoderm that differentiates into mature endocrine cells upon engraftment in mice. Ucn 3 expression in hESC-derived grafts increased robustly upon differentiation into mature endocrine cells and localized to both alpha and beta cells. Collectively, these observations confirm that Ucn 3 is expressed in adult beta cells in both mouse and human and appears late in beta cell differentiation. Expression of Pdx1, Nkx6.1 and PC1/3 in hESC-derived Ucn 3+ beta cells supports this. However, the expression of Ucn 3 in primary and hESC-derived alpha cells demonstrates that human Ucn 3 is not exclusive to the beta cell lineage but is a general marker for both the alpha and beta cell lineages. Ucn 3+ hESC-derived alpha cells do not express Nkx6.1, Pdx1 or PC1/3 in agreement with the presence of a separate population of Ucn 3+ alpha cells. Our study highlights important species differences in Ucn 3 expression, which have implications for its utility as a marker to identify mature beta cells in (re)programming strategies."

Minor ampullate silk is used to make the auxiliary spiral of the orb-web and also for wrapping prey, has a high tensile strength and does not supercontract in water. So far, only partial cDNA sequences have been obtained for minor ampullate spidroins (MiSps). Here we describe the first MiSp full-length gene sequence from the spider species Araneus ventricosus, using a multidimensional PCR approach. Comparative analysis of the sequence reveals regulatory elements, as well as unique spidroin gene and protein architecture including the presence of an unusually large intron. The spliced full-length transcript of MiSp gene is 5440 bp in size and encodes 1766 amino acid residues organized into conserved nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains and a central predominantly repetitive region composed of four units that are iterated in a non regular manner. The repeats are more conserved within A. ventricosus MiSp than compared to repeats from homologous proteins, and are interrupted by two nonrepetitive spacer regions, which have 100% identity even at the nucleotide level."
https://openalex.org/W2069059734,"Tyrosine kinases have been shown to play critical roles in cancer development and progression, and their inhibitors hold the potential as effective targeted therapies for breast and other cancers. However, some of these kinases like focal adhesion kinase (FAK) also possess scaffolding functions in intracellular signaling, but such kinase-independent functions of FAK or other kinases have not been examined in cancer directly in vivo. Here, we report that disruption of the function of FAK scaffolding through its Pro-878/881 motif suppressed mammary tumor growth and metastasis in a well characterized murine model of human breast cancer. P878A/P881A mutation in the endogenous FAK gene decreased the expression of markers for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mammary cancer stem cell (MaCSC) activities in tumors derived from mutant mice. This mutation disrupted the function of FAK scaffolding to mediate endophilin A2 phosphorylation at Tyr-315 by Src, leading to the decreased surface expression of MT1-MMP, as observed previously in transformed fibroblasts in vitro. Inhibition of the downstream components of this FAK scaffolding function by Y315F endophilin A2 mutant or MT1-MMP knockdown reduced markers for EMT and MaCSC activities. Conversely, bypass of the scaffolding function using the phosphorylation mimic mutant Y315E endophilin A2 or endophilin A2 knockdown rescued the decreased markers for EMT and MaCSCs as well as surface expression of MT1-MMP in tumor cells harboring the P878A/P881A mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2078190820,"Obesity has been identified as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, characterized by insulin resistance in insulin target tissues. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) regulates pathways in energy metabolism that become dysregulated in obesity. Earlier studies revealed that HIF1α in adipose tissue is markedly elevated in high-fat diet-fed mice that are obese and insulin-resistant. Genetic ablation of HIF1α in adipose tissue decreased insulin resistance and obesity, accompanied by increased serum adiponectin levels. However, the exact mechanism whereby HIF1α regulates adiponectin remains unclear. Here, acriflavine (ACF), an inhibitor of HIF1α, induced the expression of adiponectin and reduced the expression of SOCS3 in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Mechanistic studies revealed that HIF1α suppressed the expression of adiponectin through a SOCS3-STAT3 pathway. Socs3 was identified as a novel HIF1α target gene based on chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. STAT3 directly regulated adiponectin in vitro in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ACF was found to prevent diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In vivo, ACF also regulated the SOCS3-STAT3-adiponectin pathway, and inhibition of HIF1α in adipose tissue was essential for ACF to improve the SOCS3-STAT3-adiponectin pathway to counteract insulin resistance. This study provides evidence for a novel target gene and signal transduction pathway in adipocytes and indicates that inhibitors of HIF1α have potential utility for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2060941676,"Developing a theoretical framework for conducting electronic fluids qualitatively distinct from those described by Landau’s Fermi-liquid theory is of central importance to many outstanding problems in condensed matter physics. One such problem is that, above the transition temperature and near optimal doping, high-transition-temperature copper-oxide superconductors exhibit ‘strange metal’ behaviour that is inconsistent with being a traditional Landau Fermi liquid. Indeed, a microscopic theory of a strange-metal quantum phase could shed new light on the interesting low-temperature behaviour in the pseudogap regime and on the d-wave superconductor itself. Here we present a theory for a specific example of a strange metal—the ‘d-wave metal’. Using variational wavefunctions, gauge theoretic arguments, and ultimately large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that this remarkable quantum phase is the ground state of a reasonable microscopic Hamiltonian—the usual t–J model with electron kinetic energy t and two-spin exchange J supplemented with a frustrated electron ‘ring-exchange’ term, which we here examine extensively on the square lattice two-leg ladder. These findings constitute an explicit theoretical example of a genuine non-Fermi-liquid metal existing as the ground state of a realistic model. An explicit theoretical construction of a metallic non-Fermi liquid ground state opens a route to attack long-standing problems such as the ‘strange metal’ phase of high-temperature superconductors. When is a metal not a metal? The electronic fluids that define a conventional metal — as described by Fermi liquid theory — are commonplace and well understood. However, there are some seemingly metallic systems that do not lend themselves to such a theoretical description, for example the 'strange metal' state seen in high-temperature superconductors. We are now a step closer to understanding such exotic behaviours thanks to the development of a new theoretical model based on realistic physics, in which the ground state of the system is both metallic and quite distinct from a Fermi liquid."
https://openalex.org/W2141223789,"Background Reports on metabolic syndrome in nephroblastoma and neuroblastoma survivors are scarce. Aim was to evaluate the occurrence of and the contribution of treatment regimens to the metabolic syndrome. Patients and Methods In this prospective study 164 subjects participated (67 adult long-term nephroblastoma survivors (28 females), 36 adult long-term neuroblastoma survivors (21 females) and 61 control subjects (28 females)). Controls were recruited cross-sectionally. Waist and hip circumference as well as blood pressure were measured. Body composition and abdominal fat were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA-scan). Laboratory measurements included fasting triglyceride, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose, insulin, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and free fatty acids (FFA) levels. Results Median age at follow-up was 30 (range 19–51) years in survivors and 32 (range 18–62) years in controls. Median follow-up time in survivors was 26 (6–49) years. Nephroblastoma (OR = 5.2, P<0.0001) and neuroblastoma (OR 6.5, P<0.001) survivors had more components of the metabolic syndrome than controls. Survivors treated with abdominal irradiation had higher blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL-C, FFA and lower waist circumference. The latter can not be regarded as a reliable factor in these survivors as radiation affects the waist circumference. When total fat percentage was used as a surrogate marker of adiposity the metabolic syndrome was three times more frequent in abdominally irradiated survivors (27.5%) than in non-irradiated survivors (9.1%, P = 0.018). Conclusions Nephroblastoma and neuroblastoma survivors are at increased risk for developing components of metabolic syndrome, especially after abdominal irradiation. We emphasize that survivors treated with abdominal irradiation need alternative adiposity measurements for assessment of metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2015250229,"Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are crucial effectors of the innate antiviral response against a wide range of viruses, mediated by the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway. However, the antiviral activity of Mx proteins is diverse and complicated in different species.In the current study, two novel Mx genes (CiMx1 and CiMx3) were identified in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). CiMx1 and CiMx3 proteins exhibit high sequence identity (92.1%), and low identity with CiMx2 (49.2% and 49.5%, respectively) from the GenBank database. The predicted three-dimensional (3D) structures are distinct among the three isoforms. mRNA instability motifs also display significant differences in the three genes. The spatial and temporal expression profiles of three C. idella Mx genes and the IFN-I gene were investigated by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) following infection with grass carp reovirus (GCRV) in vivo and in vitro. The results demonstrated that all the four genes were implicated in the anti-GCRV immune response, that mRNA expression of Mx genes might be independent of IFN-I, and that CIK cells are suitable for antiviral studies. By comparing expression patterns following GCRV challenge or poly(I:C) treatment, it was observed that GCRV blocks mRNA expression of the four genes. To determine the functions of Mx genes, three CiMx cDNAs were cloned into expression vectors and utilized for transfection of CIK cells. The protection conferred by each recombinant CiMx protein against GCRV infection was evaluated. Antiviral activity against GCRV was demonstrated by reduced cytopathic effect, lower virus titer and lower levels of expressed viral transcripts. The transcription of IFN-I gene was also monitored.The results indicate all three Mx genes can suppress replication of grass carp reovirus and over-expression of Mx genes mediate feedback inhibition of the IFN-I gene."
https://openalex.org/W2084476384,"High levels of NO generated in the vasculature under inflammatory conditions are usually attributed to inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), but the role of the constitutively expressed endothelial NOS (eNOS) is unclear. In normal human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), bradykinin (BK) activates kinin B2 receptor (B2R) signaling that results in Ca2+-dependent activation of eNOS and transient NO. In inflamed HLMVEC (pretreated with interleukin-1β and interferon-γ), we found enhanced binding of eNOS to calcium-calmodulin at basal Ca2+ levels, thereby increasing its basal activity that was dependent on extracellular l-Arg. Furthermore, B2R stimulation generated prolonged high output eNOS-derived NO that is independent of increased intracellular Ca2+ and is mediated by a novel Gαi-, MEK1/2-, and JNK1/2-dependent pathway. This high output NO stimulated with BK was blocked with a B2R antagonist, eNOS siRNA, or eNOS inhibitor but not iNOS inhibitor. Moreover, B2R-mediated NO production and JNK phosphorylation were inhibited with MEK1/2 and JNK inhibitors or MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 siRNA but not with ERK1/2 inhibitor. BK induced Ca2+-dependent eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177, Thr495, and Ser114 in cytokine-treated HLMVEC, but these modifications were not dependent on JNK1/2 activation and were not responsible for prolonged NO output. Cytokine treatment did not alter the expression of B2R, Gαq/11, Gαi1,2, JNK, or eNOS. B2R activation in control endothelial cells enhanced migration, but in cytokine-treated HLMVEC it reduced migration. Both responses were NO-dependent. Understanding how JNK regulates prolonged eNOS-derived NO may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders involving vascular inflammation.Background: In healthy endothelium, agonist-induced eNOS activation results in transient, calcium-dependent NO production.Results: In inflamed endothelium, bradykinin stimulates prolonged eNOS-derived NO that depends on Gαi, MEK1/2, and JNK, resulting in reduced migration.Conclusion: eNOS activation is mediated differently in normal and inflamed endothelium, resulting in divergent NO production and effects.Significance: High eNOS-derived NO may impair angiogenesis and wound healing in inflammation. High levels of NO generated in the vasculature under inflammatory conditions are usually attributed to inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), but the role of the constitutively expressed endothelial NOS (eNOS) is unclear. In normal human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), bradykinin (BK) activates kinin B2 receptor (B2R) signaling that results in Ca2+-dependent activation of eNOS and transient NO. In inflamed HLMVEC (pretreated with interleukin-1β and interferon-γ), we found enhanced binding of eNOS to calcium-calmodulin at basal Ca2+ levels, thereby increasing its basal activity that was dependent on extracellular l-Arg. Furthermore, B2R stimulation generated prolonged high output eNOS-derived NO that is independent of increased intracellular Ca2+ and is mediated by a novel Gαi-, MEK1/2-, and JNK1/2-dependent pathway. This high output NO stimulated with BK was blocked with a B2R antagonist, eNOS siRNA, or eNOS inhibitor but not iNOS inhibitor. Moreover, B2R-mediated NO production and JNK phosphorylation were inhibited with MEK1/2 and JNK inhibitors or MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 siRNA but not with ERK1/2 inhibitor. BK induced Ca2+-dependent eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177, Thr495, and Ser114 in cytokine-treated HLMVEC, but these modifications were not dependent on JNK1/2 activation and were not responsible for prolonged NO output. Cytokine treatment did not alter the expression of B2R, Gαq/11, Gαi1,2, JNK, or eNOS. B2R activation in control endothelial cells enhanced migration, but in cytokine-treated HLMVEC it reduced migration. Both responses were NO-dependent. Understanding how JNK regulates prolonged eNOS-derived NO may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders involving vascular inflammation. Background: In healthy endothelium, agonist-induced eNOS activation results in transient, calcium-dependent NO production. Results: In inflamed endothelium, bradykinin stimulates prolonged eNOS-derived NO that depends on Gαi, MEK1/2, and JNK, resulting in reduced migration. Conclusion: eNOS activation is mediated differently in normal and inflamed endothelium, resulting in divergent NO production and effects. Significance: High eNOS-derived NO may impair angiogenesis and wound healing in inflammation."

Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) participates in inositol pyrophosphate synthesis, converting inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to IP7. In the present study, we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking IP6K1 exhibit impaired DNA damage repair via homologous recombination (HR). IP6K1 knock-out MEFs show decreased viability and reduced recovery after induction of DNA damage by the replication stress inducer, hydroxyurea, or the radiomimetic antibiotic, neocarzinostatin. Cells lacking IP6K1 arrest after genotoxic stress, and markers associated with DNA repair are recruited to DNA damage sites, indicating that HR repair is initiated in these cells. However, repair does not proceed to completion because these markers persist as nuclear foci long after drug removal.

https://openalex.org/W2117131239,"Overfeeding during perinatal life leads to an overweight phenotype that persists throughout the juvenile stage and into adulthood, however, the mechanim(s) underlying this effect are poorly understood. We hypothesized that obesity due to neonatal overfeeding is maintained by changes in energy expenditure and that these changes differ between males and females. We investigated feeding, physical activity, hormonal and metabolic alterations that occur in adult rats made obese by having been nursed in small litters (SL) compared with those from control litters (CL). There were no differences in absolute food intake between the groups, and juvenile and adult SL rats ate less chow per gram body weight than the CL did in the dark (active) phase. Juvenile, but not adult SL rats did have reduced whole body energy expenditure, but there were no differences between the groups by the time they reached adulthood. Adult SL females (but not males) had reduced brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperatures compared with CL in the first half of the dark phase. Our results indicate a persistent overweight phenotype in rats overfed as neonates is not associated with hyperphagia at any stage, but is reflected in reduced energy expenditure into the juvenile phase. The reduced dark phase BAT activity in adult SL females is not sufficient to reduce total energy expenditure at this stage of life and there is an apparently compensatory effect that prevents SL and CL from continuing to diverge in weight that appears between the juvenile and adult stages."
https://openalex.org/W2155192732,"The mechanism by which class A β-lactamases hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics has been the subject of intensive investigation using many different experimental techniques. Here, we report on the novel use of both neutron and high resolution x-ray diffraction to help elucidate the identity of the catalytic base in the acylation part of the catalytic cycle, wherein the β-lactam ring is opened and an acyl-enzyme intermediate forms. To generate protein crystals optimized for neutron diffraction, we produced a perdeuterated form of the Toho-1 β-lactamase R274N/R276N mutant. Protein perdeuteration, which involves replacing all of the hydrogen atoms in a protein with deuterium, gives a much stronger signal in neutron diffraction and enables the positions of individual deuterium atoms to be located. We also synthesized a perdeuterated acylation transition state analog, benzothiophene-2-boronic acid, which was also isotopically enriched with (11)B, as (10)B is a known neutron absorber. Using the neutron diffraction data from the perdeuterated enzyme-inhibitor complex, we were able to determine the positions of deuterium atoms in the active site directly rather than by inference. The neutron diffraction results, along with supporting bond-length analysis from high resolution x-ray diffraction, strongly suggest that Glu-166 acts as the general base during the acylation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2035586817,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis and is a major mediator of sepsis in its endemic areas. Because of the low LD(50) via aerosols and resistance to multiple antibiotics, it is considered a Tier 1 select agent by the CDC and APHIS. B. pseudomallei is an encapsulated bacterium that can infect, multiply, and persist within a variety of host cell types. In vivo studies suggest that macrophages and neutrophils are important for controlling B. pseudomallei infections, however few details are known regarding how neutrophils respond to these bacteria. Our goal is to describe the capacity of human neutrophils to control highly virulent B. pseudomallei compared to the relatively avirulent, acapsular B. thailandensis using in vitro analyses. B. thailandensis was more readily phagocytosed than B. pseudomallei, but both displayed similar rates of persistence within neutrophils, indicating they possess similar inherent abilities to escape neutrophil clearance. Serum opsonization studies showed that both were resistant to direct killing by complement, although B. thailandensis acquired significantly more C3 on its surface than B. pseudomallei, whose polysaccharide capsule significantly decreased the levels of complement deposition on the bacterial surface. Both Burkholderia species showed significantly enhanced uptake and killing by neutrophils after critical levels of C3 were deposited. Serum-opsonized Burkholderia induced a significant respiratory burst by neutrophils compared to unopsonized bacteria, and neutrophil killing was prevented by inhibiting NADPH-oxidase. In summary, neutrophils can efficiently kill B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis that possess a critical threshold of complement deposition, and the relative differences in their ability to resist surface opsonization may contribute to the distinct virulence phenotypes observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2106598450,"The B3 DNA-binding domain is a plant-specific domain found throughout the plant kingdom from the alga Chlamydomonas to grasses and flowering plants. Over 100 B3 domain-containing proteins are found in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and one of these is critical for accelerating flowering in response to prolonged cold treatment, an epigenetic process called vernalization. Despite the specific phenotype of genetic vrn1 mutants, the VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) protein localizes throughout the nucleus and shows sequence-nonspecific binding in vitro. In this work, we used a dominant repressor tag that overcomes genetic redundancy to show that VRN1 is involved in processes beyond vernalization that are essential for Arabidopsis development. To understand its sequence-nonspecific binding, we crystallized VRN1(208-341) and solved its crystal structure to 1.6 Å resolution using selenium/single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. The crystallized construct comprises the second VRN1 B3 domain and a preceding region conserved among VRN1 orthologs but absent in other B3 domains. We established the DNA-binding face using NMR and then mutated positively charged residues on this surface with a series of 16 Ala and Glu substitutions, ensuring that the protein fold was not disturbed using heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra. The triple mutant R249E/R289E/R296E was almost completely incapable of DNA binding in vitro. Thus, we have revealed that although VRN1 is sequence-nonspecific in DNA binding, it has a defined DNA-binding surface."
https://openalex.org/W2023388445,"Myocardial tissue characterization using T2* relaxation mapping techniques is an emerging application of (pre)clinical cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. The increase in microscopic susceptibility at higher magnetic field strengths renders myocardial T2* mapping at ultrahigh magnetic fields conceptually appealing. This work demonstrates the feasibility of myocardial T2* imaging at 7.0 T and examines the applicability of temporally-resolved and high spatial resolution myocardial T2* mapping. In phantom experiments single cardiac phase and dynamic (CINE) gradient echo imaging techniques provided similar T2* maps. In vivo studies showed that the peak-to-peak B0 difference following volume selective shimming was reduced to approximately 80 Hz for the four chamber view and mid-ventricular short axis view of the heart and to 65 Hz for the left ventricle. No severe susceptibility artifacts were detected in the septum and in the lateral wall for T2* weighting ranging from TE = 2.04 ms to TE = 10.2 ms. For TE >7 ms, a susceptibility weighting induced signal void was observed within the anterior and inferior myocardial segments. The longest T2* values were found for anterior (T2* = 14.0 ms), anteroseptal (T2* = 17.2 ms) and inferoseptal (T2* = 16.5 ms) myocardial segments. Shorter T2* values were observed for inferior (T2* = 10.6 ms) and inferolateral (T2* = 11.4 ms) segments. A significant difference (p = 0.002) in T2* values was observed between end-diastole and end-systole with T2* changes of up to approximately 27% over the cardiac cycle which were pronounced in the septum. To conclude, these results underscore the challenges of myocardial T2* mapping at 7.0 T but demonstrate that these issues can be offset by using tailored shimming techniques and dedicated acquisition schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2050769787,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of many cellular responses, through the action of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC)- or miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (miRNP)-mediated gene repression. Here we studied the role of miRNAs in the development of dendritic cells (DCs), an important immune cell type that is divided into conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) subsets. We found that miR-22 was highly expressed in mouse CD11c(+) CD11b(+) B220(-) cDCs compared to pDCs, and was induced in DC progenitor cell cultures with GM-CSF, which stimulate CD11c(+) CD11b(+) B220(-) cDC differentiation. Enforced overexpression of miR-22 during DC development enhanced CD11c(+) CD11b(+) B220(-) cDC generation at the expense of pDCs, while miR-22 knockdown demonstrated opposite effects. Moreover, overexpression and knockdown of miR-22 showed significant effects on the mRNA abundance of Irf8, which encodes the transcription factor IRF8 that plays essential roles in DC development. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-22 binds directly to the 3'UTR of the mouse Irf8 mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-22 targets Irf8 mRNA for posttranscriptional repression and controls DC subset differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2049908551,"Cognitive task demands in one sensory modality (T1) can have beneficial effects on a secondary task (T2) in a different modality, due to reduced top-down control needed to inhibit the secondary task, as well as crossmodal spread of attention. This contrasts findings of cognitive load compromising a secondary modality’s processing. We manipulated cognitive load within one modality (visual) and studied the consequences of cognitive demands on secondary (auditory) processing. 15 healthy participants underwent a simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment. Data from 8 participants were obtained outside the scanner for validation purposes. The primary task (T1) was to respond to a visual working memory (WM) task with four conditions, while the secondary task (T2) consisted of an auditory oddball stream, which participants were asked to ignore. The fMRI results revealed fronto-parietal WM network activations in response to T1 task manipulation. This was accompanied by significantly higher reaction times and lower hit rates with increasing task difficulty which confirmed successful manipulation of WM load. Amplitudes of auditory evoked potentials, representing fundamental auditory processing showed a continuous augmentation which demonstrated a systematic relation to cross-modal cognitive load. With increasing WM load, primary auditory cortices were increasingly deactivated while psychophysiological interaction results suggested the emergence of auditory cortices connectivity with visual WM regions. These results suggest differential effects of crossmodal attention on fundamental auditory processing. We suggest a continuous allocation of resources to brain regions processing primary tasks when challenging the central executive under high cognitive load."
https://openalex.org/W2019101384,"Background Tumour suppressor genes are often transcriptionally silenced by promoter hypermethylation, and recent research has implicated alterations in chromatin structure as the mechanistic basis for this repression. In addition to DNA methylation, other epigenetic post-translational modifications that modulate the stability and binding of specific transcription factors to gene promoters have emerged as important mechanisms for controlling gene expression. The aim of this study was to analyse the implications of these mechanisms and their molecular connections in the reactivation of RASSF1A in breast cancer. Methods Compounds that modulate the intracellular concentration of adenosine, such as dipyridamole (DIPY), greatly increase the antiproliferative effects of 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(−)-catechin (TMCG), a synthetic antifolate derived from the structure of tea catechins. Quantitative real-time PCR arrays and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that this combination (TMCG/DIPY) induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by modulating the methylation levels of DNA and proteins (such as E2F1), respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were employed to confirm that this combination induced chromatin remodelling of the RASSF1A promoter and increased the occupancy of E2F1 at the promoter of this tumour suppressor gene. Results The TMCG/DIPY combination acted as an epigenetic treatment that reactivated RASSF1A expression and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition to modulating DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling, this combination also induced demethylation of the E2F1 transcription factor. The ChIP assay showed enhancement of E2F1 occupancy at the unmethylated RASSF1A promoter after TMCG/DIPY treatment. Interestingly, inhibition of E2F1 demethylation using an irreversible inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 reduced both TMCG/DIPY-mediated RASSF1A expression and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that DNA and protein demethylation may act together to control these molecular and cellular processes. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that simultaneous targeting of DNA and E2F1 methylation is an effective epigenetic treatment that reactivates RASSF1A expression and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells."

However, the settlement ecology and preferences of mussels are poorly understood and only sparse information exists in a commercial context. This study quantified the settlement preferences of pediveligers and plantigrades of Mytilus galloprovincialis on increasingly complex surfaces and settlement locations at a micro spatial scale on and within ropes under commercial hatchery operating conditions using optical microscopy and X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT). M. galloprovincialis has clear settlement preferences for more complex materials and high selectivity for settlement sites from the pediveliger through to the plantigrade stage. Pediveligers of M. galloprovincialis initially settle inside specialised culture ropes. Larger pediveligers were located close to the exterior of ropes as they increased in size over time. In contrast, smaller individuals were located deeper inside of the ropes over time. This study demonstrates that X-ray µCT is an excellent non-destructive technique for mapping settlement and attachment sites of individuals as early as one day post settlement, and quantifies the number and location of settled individuals on and within ropes as a tool to understand and optimise settlement in complex multi-dimensional materials and environments."
https://openalex.org/W1969610497,"Context-dependent decision-making conditions individual plasticity and is an integrant part of alternative reproductive strategies. In eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), the discovery of worker reproductive parasitism recently challenged the view of workers as a homogeneous collective entity and stressed the need to consider them as autonomous units capable of elaborate choices which influence their fitness returns. The reproductive decisions of individual workers thus need to be investigated and taken into account to understand the regulation of reproduction in insect societies. However, we know virtually nothing about the proximate mechanisms at the basis of worker reproductive decisions. Here, we test the hypothesis that the capacity of workers to reproduce in foreign colonies lies in their ability to react differently according to the colonial context and whether this reaction is influenced by a particular internal state. Using the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, we show that workers exhibit an extremely high reproductive plasticity which is conditioned by the social context they experience. Fertile workers reintroduced into their mother colony reverted to sterility, as expected. On the contrary, a high level of ovary activity persisted in fertile workers introduced into a foreign nest, and this despite more frequent direct contacts with the queen and the brood than control workers. Foreign workers' reproductive decisions were not affected by the resident queen, their level of fertility being similar whether or not the queen was removed from the host colony. Workers' physiological state at the time of introduction is also of crucial importance, since infertile workers failed to develop a reproductive phenotype in a foreign nest. Therefore, both internal and environmental factors appear to condition individual reproductive strategies in this species, suggesting that more complex decision-making mechanisms are involved in the regulation of worker reproduction than previously thought."

BLAST searches and phylogenetic analyses indicate pXF-RIV5 and pXFAS01 share some similarity to chromosomal and plasmid (pXF51) sequences of X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca strain 9a5c and more distant similarity to plasmids from a wide variety of bacteria. Both pXF-RIV5 and pXFAS01 encode homologues of a complete Type IV secretion system involved in conjugation and DNA transfer among bacteria. Mating pair formation proteins (Trb) from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP31758 are the mostly closely related non-X. fastidiosa proteins to most of the Trb proteins encoded by pXF-RIV5 and pXFAS01. Unlike many bacterial conjugative plasmids, pXF-RIV5 and pXFAS01 do not carry homologues of known accessory modules that confer selective advantage on host bacteria. However, both plasmids encode seven hypothetical proteins of unknown function and possess a small transposon-associated region encoding a putative transposase and associated factor.

In contrast, conjugative plasmids commonly encode TrfA and have an oriV similar to those found in IncP-1 incompatibility group plasmids. The presence of nearly identical plasmids in single strains from two distinct subspecies of X. fastidiosa is indicative of recent horizontal transfer, probably subsequent to the introduction of subspecies fastidiosa to the United States in the late 19(th) century."

https://openalex.org/W2166654868,"Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of malignancy-related mortality worldwide, and drug resistance hampered the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy. To better understand the molecular mechanism causing drug resistance, we previously established an isogenic pair of doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant gastric cancer cell lines, SGC7901 and SGC7901/ADR cells. Here, we investigated how modulation of CUTL1 activity affects the response of gastric cancer to frequently used chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we demonstrated that CUTL1 transcription activity was significantly reduced in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Furthermore, decreased CUTL1 expression was strongly associated with intrinsic drug resistance in human gastric cancer tissues and could be used as a poor prognosis biomarker. Both gain-of-function (by overexpression of active CUTL1) and loss-of-function (by CUTL1-specific shRNA knockdown) studies showed that increased CUTL1 activity significantly enhanced cell sensitivity to drugs and led to increased apoptosis, whereas decreased CUTL1 expression dramatically reduced cell sensitivity to drugs and thus fewer apoptoses. Importantly, modulation of CUTL1 activity resulted in altered sensitivity to multiple drugs. In vivo mouse studies indicated that overexpression of active CUTL1 significantly resulted in increased cancer tissue response to chemotherapy and therefore inhibited growth, whereas knockdown of CUTL1 conferred resistance to chemotherapy. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that CUTL1 activity is inversely associated with drug resistance and thus is an attractive therapeutic target to modulate multidrug resistance in gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2077653799,"Kremens are high-affinity receptors for Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) and regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by down-regulating the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Dkk1 competes with Wnt for binding to LRP6; binding of Dkk1 inhibits canonical signaling through formation of a ternary complex with Kremen. The majority of down-regulated clathrin-mediated endocytic receptors contain short conserved regions that recognize tyrosine or dileucine sorting motifs. In this study, we found that Kremen1 is internalized from the cell surface in a clathrin-dependent manner. Kremen1 contains an atypical dileucine motif with the sequence DXXXLV. Mutation of LV to AA in this motif blocked Kremen1 internalization; as reported previously for other proteins, the aspartic acid residue in Kremen1 is not critical. Inhibition of expression of the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) or inhibition of clathrin by pitstop 2 also blocked Kremen1 internalization. The novel amino acid sequence identified in Kremen1 is similar to the motif previously identified in hydra, yeast, and other organisms known to signal from the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1985649127,"The large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channel (MaxiK, BKCa, BK) is composed of four pore-forming α-subunits and can be associated with regulatory β-subunits. One of the functional roles of MaxiK is to regulate vascular tone. We recently found that the MaxiK channel from coronary smooth muscle is trans-inhibited by activation of the vasoconstricting thromboxane A2 prostanoid receptor (TP), a mechanism supported by MaxiK α-subunit (MaxiKα)-TP physical interaction. Here, we examined the role of the MaxiK β1-subunit in TP-MaxiK association. We found that the β1-subunit can by itself interact with TP and that this association can occur independently of MaxiKα. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that β1 and TP are closely associated at the cell periphery. The molecular mechanism of β1-TP interaction involves predominantly the β1 extracellular loop. As reported previously, TP activation by the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 caused inhibition of MaxiKα macroscopic conductance or fractional open probability (FPo) as a function of voltage. However, the positive shift of the FPo versus voltage curve by U46619 relative to the control was less prominent when β1 was coexpressed with TP and MaxiKα proteins (20 ± 6 mV, n = 7) than in cells expressing TP and MaxiKα alone (51 ± 7 mV, n = 7). Finally, β1 gene ablation reduced the EC50 of the U46619 agonist in mediating aortic contraction from 18 ± 1 nm (n = 12) to 9 ± 1 nm (n = 12). The results indicate that the β1-subunit can form a tripartite complex with TP and MaxiKα, has the ability to associate with each protein independently, and diminishes U46619-induced MaxiK channel trans-inhibition as well as vasoconstriction.Background: The vasoconstricting thromboxane A2 prostanoid receptor (TP) is physically coupled to the MaxiK channel α-subunit, down-regulating its activity, but the role of the MaxiK β1-subunit is unknown.Results: The MaxiK β1-subunit can interact with TP independently of the MaxiK α-subunit and counteracts activated TP-induced current inhibition, and its ablation increases TP vasoconstricting potency.Conclusion: The β1-subunit modifies TP actions.Significance: This is the first demonstration that the MaxiK β1-subunit associates with a vasoconstricting receptor.

Subcellular localization analysis revealed that β1 and TP are closely associated at the cell periphery. The molecular mechanism of β1-TP interaction involves predominantly the β1 extracellular loop. As reported previously, TP activation by the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 caused inhibition of MaxiKα macroscopic conductance or fractional open probability (FPo) as a function of voltage. However, the positive shift of the FPo versus voltage curve by U46619 relative to the control was less prominent when β1 was coexpressed with TP and MaxiKα proteins (20 ± 6 mV, n = 7) than in cells expressing TP and MaxiKα alone (51 ± 7 mV, n = 7). Finally, β1 gene ablation reduced the EC50 of the U46619 agonist in mediating aortic contraction from 18 ± 1 nm (n = 12) to 9 ± 1 nm (n = 12). The results indicate that the β1-subunit can form a tripartite complex with TP and MaxiKα, has the ability to associate with each protein independently, and diminishes U46619-induced MaxiK channel trans-inhibition as well as vasoconstriction. Background: The vasoconstricting thromboxane A2 prostanoid receptor (TP) is physically coupled to the MaxiK channel α-subunit, down-regulating its activity, but the role of the MaxiK β1-subunit is unknown. Results: The MaxiK β1-subunit can interact with TP independently of the MaxiK α-subunit and counteracts activated TP-induced current inhibition, and its ablation increases TP vasoconstricting potency. Conclusion: The β1-subunit modifies TP actions. Significance: This is the first demonstration that the MaxiK β1-subunit associates with a vasoconstricting receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2048303244,"Transposable elements (TEs) are one of the major driving forces of genome evolution, raising the question of the long-term dynamics underlying their evolutionary success. Some TEs were proposed to evolve under a pattern of periodic extinctions-recolonizations, in which elements recurrently invade and quickly proliferate within their host genomes, then start to disappear until total extinction. Depending on the model, TE extinction is assumed to be driven by purifying selection against colonized host genomes (Sel-DE model) or by saturation of host genomes (Sat-DE model). Bacterial group II introns are suspected to follow an extinction-recolonization model of evolution, but whether they follow Sel-DE or Sat-DE dynamics is not known. Our analysis of almost 200 group II intron copies from 90 sequenced Enterobacteriales genomes confirms their extinction-recolonization dynamics: patchy element distributions among genera and even among strains within genera, acquisition of new group II introns through plasmids or other mobile genetic elements, and evidence for recent proliferations in some genomes. Distributions of recent and past proliferations and of their respective homing sites further provide strong support for the Sel-DE model, suggesting that group II introns are deleterious to their hosts. Overall, our observations emphasize the critical impact of host properties on TE dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2020256909,"Objective To determine the impact of ureteroscopy-assisted retrograde nephrostomy (UARN) during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Materials and Methods From April 2009 to September 2011, a total of 50 patients underwent PCNL for large renal stones (stone burden >2 cm). We performed UARN in the Galdakao-modified Valdivia position for 27 patients (UARN PCNL) and ultrasonography-assisted percutaneous nephrostomy in the prone position for 23 patients (prone PCNL). Results UARN PCNL significantly improved the stone-free rate (81.5% vs 52.2%) and the rate of residual stones (<4 mm, 92.6% vs 65.2%, P<0.05). The median length of the operation was significantly shorter for UARN PCNL, at 160 min, compared to 299 min for prone PCNL (P<0.001). There was one intraoperative complication in prone PCNL, namely a hemorrhage that resulted in stopping the initial treatment, but it was cured conservatively. The postoperative complications included a high grade fever that persisted for three days in two UARN PCNL patients (7.4%) and six prone PCNL patients (26.1%). The Clavien grading scores showed significantly lower postoperative complications for UARN PCNL compared to prone PCNL. Conclusion UARN is associated with a higher stone-free rate, shorter operation time, and fewer complications during PCNL than prone PCNL."
https://openalex.org/W1972012981,"p63 is a close relative of the p53 tumor suppressor and transcription factor that modulates cell fate. The full-length isoform of p63, containing a transactivation (TA) domain (TAp63) is an essential proapoptotic protein in neural development. The role of p63 in epithelial development is also well established; however, its precise function during neural differentiation remains largely controversial. Recently, it has been demonstrated that several conserved elements of apoptosis are also integral components of cellular differentiation; p53 directly interacts with key regulators of neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of p63 during mouse neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and test whether the histone H3 lysine 27-specific demethylase JMJD3 interacts with p63 to redirect NSCs to neurogenesis. Our results showed that JMJD3 and TAp63γ are coordinately regulated to establish neural-specific gene expression programs in NSCs undergoing differentiation. JMJD3 overexpression increased TAp63γ levels in a demethylase activity-dependent manner. Importantly, overexpression of TAp63γ increased β-III tubulin whereas downregulation of TAp63γ by specific p63 siRNA decreased β-III tubulin. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated direct interaction between TAp63γ and JMJD3, and modulation of TAp63γ methylation status by JMJD3-demethylase activity. Importantly, the demethylase activity of JMJD3 influenced TAp63γ protein stabilization and cellular distribution, as well as TAp63γ-regulated neurogenesis. These findings clarify the role of p63 in adult neural progenitor cells and reveal TAp63γ as a direct target for JMJD3-mediated neuronal commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2068033771,"Congenital pituitary hormone deficiencies have been reported in approximately one in 4,000 live births, however studies reporting mutations in some widely studied transcription factors account for only a fraction of congenital hormone deficiencies in humans. Anterior pituitary hormones are required for development and function of several glands including gonads, adrenals, and thyroid. In order to identify additional factors that contribute to human congenital hormone deficiencies, we are investigating the forkhead transcription factor, FOXO1, which has been implicated in development of several organs including ovary, testis, and brain. We find that FOXO1 is present in the nuclei of non-dividing pituitary cells during embryonic development, consistent with a role in limiting proliferation and/or promoting differentiation. FOXO1 is present in a subset of differentiated cells at e18.5 and in adult with highest level of expression in somatotrope cells. We detected FOXO1 in p27(Kip1)-positive cells at e14.5. In the absence of p27(Kip1) the number of pituitary cells containing FOXO1 is significantly increased at e14.5 suggesting that a feedback loop regulates the interplay between FOXO1 and p27(Kip1)."

https://openalex.org/W2160887576,"Conjugation in Tetrahymena thermophila involves a developmental program consisting of three prezygotic nuclear divisions, pronuclear exchange and fusion, and postzygotic and exconjugant stages. The conjugation junction structure appears during the initiation of conjugation development, and disappears during the exconjugant stage. Many structural and functional proteins are involved in the establishment and maintenance of the junction structure in T. thermophila. In the present study, a zinc finger protein-encoding gene ZFR1 was found to be expressed specifically during conjugation and to localize specifically to the conjugation junction region. Truncated Zfr1p localized at the plasma membrane in ordered arrays and decorated Golgi apparatus located adjacent to basal body. The N-terminal zinc finger and C-terminal hydrophobic domains of Zfr1p were found to be required for its specific conjugation junction localization. Conjugation development of ZFR1 somatic knockout cells was aborted at the pronuclear exchange and fusion conjugation stages. Furthermore, Zfr1p was found to be important for conjugation junction stability during the prezygotic nuclear division stage. Taken together, our data reveal that Zfr1p is required for the stability and integrity of the conjugation junction structure and essential for the sexual life cycle of the Tetrahymena cell."
