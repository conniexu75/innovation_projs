https://openalex.org/W2032407757,"Mammalian telomeres contain a duplex array of telomeric repeats bound to the telomeric repeat-binding factors TRF1 and TRF2. Inhibition of TRF2 results in immediate deprotection of chromosome ends, manifested by loss of the telomeric 3' overhang, activation of p53, and end-to-end chromosome fusions. Electron microscopy reported here demonstrated that TRF2 can remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops (t loops) in vitro. Electron microscopy analysis of psoralen cross-linked telomeric DNA purified from human and mouse cells revealed abundant large t loops with a size distribution consistent with their telomeric origin. Binding of TRF1 and single strand binding protein suggested that t loops are formed by invasion of the 3' telomeric overhang into the duplex telomeric repeat array. T loops may provide a general mechanism for the protection and replication of telomeres."

Here, we examine the interactions between telomere dysfunction and p53 in cells and organs of telomerase-deficient mice. Coincident with severe telomere shortening and associated genomic instability, p53 is activated, leading to growth arrest and/or apoptosis. Deletion of p53 significantly attenuated the adverse cellular and organismal effects of telomere dysfunction, but only during the earliest stages of genetic crisis. Correspondingly, the loss of telomere function and p53 deficiency cooperated to initiate the transformation process. Together, these studies establish a key role for p53 in the cellular response to telomere dysfunction in both normal and neoplastic cells, question the significance of crisis as a tumor suppressor mechanism, and identify a biologically relevant stage of advanced crisis, termed genetic catastrophe."
https://openalex.org/W2082476464,"Mycobacteria are intracellular pathogens that can survive within macrophage phagosomes, thereby evading host defense strategies by largely unknown mechanisms. We have identified a WD repeat host protein that was recruited to and actively retained on phagosomes by living, but not dead, mycobacteria. This protein, termed TACO, represents a component of the phagosome coat that is normally released prior to phagosome fusion with or maturation into lysosomes. In macrophages lacking TACO, mycobacteria were readily transported to lysosomes followed by their degradation. Expression of TACO in nonmacrophages prevented lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria and prolonged their intracellular survival. Active retention of TACO on phagosomes by living mycobacteria thus represents a mechanism preventing cargo delivery to lysosomes, allowing mycobacteria to survive within macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1965947775,"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor homologue Daf-2 gene cause developmental arrest at the dauer stage. The effect of Daf-2 mutations is counteracted by mutations in the Daf-16 gene, suggesting that Daf-16 is required for signaling by Daf-2. Daf-16 encodes a forkhead transcription factor. Based on sequence similarity, the FKHR genes are the likeliest mammalian Daf-16 homologues. FKHR proteins contain potential sites for phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Because Akt is phosphorylated in response to insulin and has been implicated in a variety of insulin effects, we investigated whether insulin affects phosphorylation of FKHR. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous FKHR and of a recombinant c-Myc/FKHR fusion protein transiently expressed in murine SV40-transformed hepatocytes. The effect of insulin was inhibited by wortmannin treatment, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activity is required for FKHR phosphorylation. Mutation of serine 253, located in a consensus Akt phosphorylation site at the carboxyl-terminal end of the forkhead domain, abolished the effect of insulin on FKHR phosphorylation. In contrast, mutation of two additional Akt phosphorylation sites, at amino acids threonine 24 or serine 316, did not abolish insulin-induced phosphorylation.

Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse actions of insulin are mediated by its cell surface receptor. The insulin receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin binding. Autophosphorylation activates the receptor as a kinase that is able to phosphorylate a host of intracellular protein substrates. The proximal effectors of insulin action include insulin receptor substrate proteins and several others (2White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Insulin receptor substrate proteins serve an important function as “docking” molecules to promote the assembly of protein-protein complexes and the generation of intracellular signals.

For example, the serine/threonine kinase Akt and the atypical protein kinase C isoforms ζ and λ are among the kinases that are activated in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner to regulate glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, cell survival, and gene expression in response to insulin (4Kohn A.D.

Recent studies showed that Akt is involved in insulin regulation of gene expression. It is not clear, however, whether transcription factors are direct targets for the kinase activity of Akt or whether Akt regulates gene expression by activating other kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, p70 S6 kinase, protein kinase C isoforms, and others (5Kohn A.D.

Studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have provided insights into the conservation of signaling pathways relevant to mammalian metabolism and reproduction. Under optimal growth conditions,C. elegans grows rapidly to fertile adult hermaphrodites through four stages (L1–L4). However, when grown at high density or with high levels of pheromone, larvae enter a reversible arrest of development characterized by reduced metabolic activity, the dauer stage. Interestingly, mutations in the Daf-2, Age-1, Akt-1, and Akt-2 genes cause a constitutive dauer phenotype (11Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 12Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Genetics. 1998; 148: 703-717PubMed Google Scholar, 13Morris J.Z. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1996; 382: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 14Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 15Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The Daf-2 gene encodes the C. elegans homologue of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor (14Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar); the Age-1 gene is the homologue of PI 3-kinase (13Morris J.Z. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1996; 382: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), and the two Akt genes are homologous to mammalian Akt (11Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Thus, the dauer alleles define a signaling cascade homologous to the insulin and IGF-1 signaling cascade in mammals as important for metabolic regulation and reproduction in C. elegans. Interestingly, mutations of the Daf-16 gene in C. elegans prevent Daf-2, Age-1, and Akt mutants from entering the dauer stage. This observation suggests that Daf-16 is a negative regulator of the Daf-2/Age-1/Akt signaling pathway. Positional cloning experiments identified Daf-16 as a member of the HNF-3/forkhead family of transcription factors, with a unique forkhead DNA-binding domain consisting of about 100 amino acids (15Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar,16Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Daf-16 has four consensus Akt phosphorylation sites (17Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Daf-16 may be a direct substrate of Akt. The closest mammalian homologues of Daf-16 are three members of the FKHR family: FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX (18Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These genes were originally identified in chromosomal translocations associated with human rhabdomyosarcomas (hence the acronym forkhead in human rhabdomyosarcoma) as fusion proteins composed of the paired box and homeodomain regions of the transcription factors Pax-3 or Pax-7 and the transactivation domain of FKHR (19Barr F.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 113-129PubMed Google Scholar). Of the three genes, FKHR shares the highest identity (76%) with Daf-16 in the forkhead DNA-binding domain. We report that FKHR is the principle member of this family of proteins in murine SV40-transformed hepatocytes and that insulin stimulates its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of FKHR is inhibited by wortmannin, suggesting that it requires PI 3-kinase activity. The effect of insulin is abolished by mutation of serine 253 in an Akt phosphorylation consensus sequence in the forkhead domain of FKHR but not by mutations of two additional Akt consensus sequences at threonine 24 and serine 316. These data indicate that FKHR may be a substrate of Akt. FKHR represents a candidate transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to insulin. Anti-human FKHR antibodies were obtained from Dr. Barr (20Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti c-Myc antibodies (clone 9E10) were from Sigma. Anti-insulin receptor antibodies were from Oncogene Science (Manhasset, NY) (clone Ab 3) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (antiserum C-19). SV40-transformed mouse hepatocytes were cultured at 33 °C in α-modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 10 nm dexamethasone as described previously (21Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For 32P labeling experiments, cells were sequentially incubated in serum-free DMEM for 8 h, serum- and phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h, and DMEM supplemented with 0.05 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h. Insulin stimulation was carried out for 5–15 min and was preceded in some experiments by a 30-min incubation in the presence of wortmannin or rapamycin (Sigma). At the end of the incubation, cells were solubilized and processed for immunoprecipitation as described (21Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For 35S labeling experiments, cells were incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.05 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) and then stimulated with insulin. Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 3′ end of FKHR, including the forkhead and transactivation domains, was amplified from mouse liver Marathon cDNA (CLONTECH) using primers from expressed sequence tag AA254887 (5′-GTCCTGGGCCAAAATGTAATG-3′ and 5′-AGCCTGACACCCAGCTGTGTG-3′). The 5′ end of the cDNA, encoded by exon 1 of the FKHR gene, was amplified from genomic DNA using upstream primer 5′-GGGGGGTCTAGAGTCACCATGGCCGAGGCG-3′ (theXbaI site for subcloning is underlined), and downstream primer 5′-GACAGGTTGCCCCACGCGTTGCGGCGCGAC-3′ (nucleotides 482–453). Overlap exten- sion PCR was used to generate the T24A, S253A, and S316A mutant FKHR expression vectors (22Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Wondisford F.E. Taylor S.I. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides and other oligonucleotides employed for PCR mutagenesis are available from the authors on request. All fragments were subcloned and sequenced to rule out the presence of additional mutations. mRNA was isolated by acid phenol-guanidinium extraction, followed by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT). Northern blotting was performed as described (23Salvatore P. Hanash C.R. Kido Y. Imai Y. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6989-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The FKHR (nucleotides 1468–1963) and FKHRL1 (nucleotides 603–2866) probes were obtained by reverse PCR using mouse liver as an RNA source. Standard PCR amplification conditions were employed. Insulin affects the liver-specific expression of several genes important for metabolic regulation. To test which member of the FKHR family was the likeliest candidate as an effector of insulin action in liver, we performed Northern analysis on mRNA from murine SV40-transformed hepatocytes (21Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1 A, and indicate that FKHR is ∼10-fold more abundant than FKHRL1. AFX mRNA was not detected in the same blot (not shown). Using available partial sequence information (GenBankTM accession number AA254887), cDNA clones encoding the 3′ end of murine FKHR were amplified from a Marathon cDNA library. The 5′ end was obtained from mouse genomic DNA. Murine FKHR shares 92% identity at the amino acid level with human FKHR (data not shown). The forkhead DNA-binding domain is identical in human and mouse FKHR and is highly conserved among mouse FKHR and the other two members of the FKHR family, sharing 82 and 86% identity with human FKHRL1 and AFX cDNA, respectively (18Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encodes a 652-amino acid polypeptide, with a predicted molecular mass of 69.497 kDa. Inspection of the amino acid sequence reveals three consensus phosphorylation sites for the Akt kinase (R X R XX(S/T)) around threonine 24 (PRQRSCTW), serine 253 (PRRRAASM), and serine 316 (FRPRTSSN). To test the hypothesis that insulin stimulates FKHR phosphorylation, SV40-transformed hepatocytes from normal mice (WT) or from insulin receptor-deficient mice (−/−) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, stimulated with insulin for 5–15 min, and FKHR was immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the human protein (20Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In WT cells, insulin rapidly induced a 2-fold increase in 32P content of FKHR. This increase was associated with an electrophoretic shift of the band corresponding to FKHR on the gel. In −/− cells, which lack insulin receptors, phosphorylation of FKHR in response to insulin was slower and increased by about 50% over basal after 15 min of stimulation (Fig. 1 B). The response observed in −/− cells is presumably due to IGF-1 receptors. As a control, phosphorylation of insulin receptors in response to insulin is shown in Fig.1 C. These data indicate that FKHR is phosphorylated in an insulin- and IGF-1 receptor-dependent manner in mouse hepatocytes. Based on the Northern blot shown in Fig. 1 A, we conclude that FKHR is the main immunoreactive species recognized by the antibody. To investigate further whether phosphorylation of FKHR is mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway, we performed phosphorylation experiments in the presence of the selective inhibitors wortmannin, which blocks the activity of PI 3-kinase (24Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Shimizu Y. Shimazu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and rapamycin, which blocks the activity of p70 S6 kinase (26Abraham R.T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). For these experiments, epitope-tagged FKHR was transiently transfected in WT cells using plasmid pCMV5/c-Myc. In 10 experiments, insulin increased 32P content of the recombinant protein ∼2-fold (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2), consistent with the effect on the endogenous protein. The insulin-dependent increase in FKHR phosphorylation was abolished by treatment of cells with wortmannin (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, rapamycin caused an increase in the basal phosphorylation of FKHR without affecting the amount of32P in FKHR recovered from insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with the32P loading experiments, 35S labeling experiments revealed that wortmannin, but not rapamycin, inhibited the insulin-induced shift in molecular mass of FKHR (Fig. 2, lower panel). These data indicate that FKHR is phosphorylated by insulin receptors through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. To investigate which one of the consensus Akt phosphorylation sites is phosphorylated in vivo by insulin, WT hepatocytes were transfected with expression vectors for wild type and mutant FKHR (pCMV5/c-Myc WT, T24A, S253A, and S316A). Mutation of Ser253 completely abolished the effect of insulin on FKHR phosphorylation (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), whereas mutations of T24A and S316A decreased insulin-induced FKHR phosphorylation by ∼30% but did not abolish the effect of insulin (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 4,7, and 8). However, all three mutants inhibited the mobility shift induced by insulin stimulation of WT FKHR. The present studies support the identification of FKHR as a target of insulin-stimulated, PI-dependent kinases (possibly Akt) and as a distal effector of the insulin receptor signaling cascade. Site-directed mutagenesis data are consistent with a model in which Ser253 is required for the effect of insulin on FKHR phosphorylation, whereas Thr24 and Ser316 are not. The slight decrease of insulin-induced phosphorylation in the T24A and S316A mutants, in addition to the inhibition of the insulin-induced mobility shift, indicate that these sites may be phosphorylatedin vivo but that they are not necessary for the effect of insulin. Thus, Ser253 appears to act as a gatekeeper site for insulin-induced FKHR phosphorylation in SV40-transformed hepatocytes. Recently, it has been reported that phosphorylation of the related molecule FKHRL1 in response to IGF-1 in 293 and Jurkat cells occurs at three Akt sites: Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315, corresponding to Thr24, Ser253, and Ser316 of FKHR (27Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). However, the S253A mutant FKHRL1 still retained the ability to be phosphorylated in response to IGF-1, unlike the corresponding mutant of FKHR, which lost its ability to be phosphorylated in response to insulin. Further experiments will be required to determine whether this difference is simply a reflection of the experimental design or indicates a potential mechanism of signaling diversity among different members of the FKHR family. FKHR phosphorylation is exquisitely sensitive to wortmannin, consistent with a role of PI-dependent kinases in this process (11Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar,27Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Interestingly, basal phosphorylation of FKHR is increased in the presence of rapamycin. At present, we cannot provide an explanation for this finding. However, the insulin-dependent mobility shift is not affected by rapamycin treatment, suggesting that the insulin-dependent kinases that regulate FKHR phosphorylation are not rapamycin-inhibitable. Because FKHR has the potential to participate in cell cycle control and oncogenesis and because phosphorylation of FKHR presumably inhibits its transcriptional activity, the observation of increased FKHR phosphorylation in the presence of rapamycin is consistent with antiproliferative effect of rapamycin (26Abraham R.T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Our observations raise two important questions: how does insulin-induced phosphorylation affect the function of FKHR and what are the insulin-regulated target genes of FKHR? Based on the data of Brunet et al. (27Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar), the primary hypothesis to be tested is whether insulin affects the intracellular distribution of FKHR, in a similar fashion to the effect of IGF-1 on FKHRL1. In preliminary experiments, we have been able to show that phosphorylation of serine 253 affects FKHR binding to DNA in gel shift assays, 2J. Nakae and D. Accili, manuscript in preparation. consistent with the possibility that insulin may regulate FKHR function at different levels. With respect to the question of which genes are subject to regulation by FKHR in an insulin-dependent manner, we have shown that FKHR mediates insulin inhibition of IGFBP-1 transcription in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (28Tomizawa M. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. Diabetes. 1999; (in press (abstr.)): 48Google Scholar). The identification of the exact role of FKHR phosphorylation in insulin and IGF-1 signaling will provide important new insight into the mechanism by which insulin and IGF-1 regulate gene expression.

Barr (University of Pennsylvania) for the gift of anti-human FKHR antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2007963495,"We have previously detected an increased frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 18q during progression of colorectal carcinomas. To clarify the target of 18qLOH, mutation of Smad4 and Smad2 genes was analysed in 176 colorectal tumors with different stages, including liver metastasis, from 111 sporadic, 52 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and nine hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) patients. Mutation of other Smad gene families in the TGF-beta signaling pathway was also examined. Twenty-one Smad4 mutations and one Smad2 mutation were detected, whereas mutation of Smad3, 6 and 7 genes was not detected. Smad4 mutations included seven frameshift, one inframe deletion, four nonsense and nine missense mutations, 95% of which resulted in alteration of Smad4 protein regions included in homo-oligomer and hetero-oligomer formation. Frequencies of tumors with Smad4 mutation were 0/40 (0%) in adenoma, 4/39 (10%) in intramucosal carcinoma, 3/44 (7%) in primary invasive carcinoma without distant metastasis, 6/17 (35%) in primary invasive carcinoma with distant metastasis, and 11/36 (31%) in distant metastasis (metastatic/non-metastatic: P=0.006 approximately 0.01). Loss of the other allele was observed in 19 of 20 (95%) invasive and metastasized carcinomas with Smad4 mutations. In four cases both primary and metastasized carcinomas in the same patients showed the same mutations. The present results suggest that Smad4 gene is one of true targets of 18qLOH, and that its inactivation is involved in advanced stages, such as distant metastasis, in human colorectal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2159819769,"Maintenance of telomere length is predicted to be essential for bypass of senescence and crisis checkpoints in cancer cells. The impact of telomere dysfunction on tumorigenesis was assessed in successive generations of mice doubly null for the telomerase RNA (mTR) and the INK4a tumor suppressor genes. Significant reductions in tumor formation in vivo and oncogenic potential in vitro were observed in late generations of telomerase deficiency, coincident with severe telomere shortening and associated dysfunction. Reintroduction of mTR into cells significantly restored the oncogenic potential, indicating telomerase activation is a cooperating event in the malignant transformation of cells containing critically short telomeres.

THANK is a type II transmembrane protein with 15–20% overall amino acid sequence homology to TNF, LT-α, FasL, and LIGHT, all members of the TNF family. The mRNA for THANK was expressed at high levels by peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, spleen, and thymus and at low levels by small intestine, pancreas, placenta, and lungs. THANK was also prominently expressed in hematopoietic cell lines. The recombinant purified protein expressed in the baculovirus system had an approximate molecular size 20 kDa with amino-terminal sequence of AVQGP. Treatment of human myeloid U937 cells with purified THANK activated nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) consisting of p50 and p65. Activation was time- and dose-dependent, beginning with as little as a 1 pm amount of the cytokines and as early as 15 min. Under the same conditions, THANK also activated c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in U937 cells. THANK also strongly suppressed the growth of tumor cell lines and activated caspase-3. Although THANK had all the activities and potency of TNF, it did not bind to the TNF receptors.

At the amino acid sequence level, various members of the TNF family are 20–25% homologous to each other. Most members of this family play an important role in gene activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These ligands interact with the corresponding receptor, also members of the TNF receptor family, and activate the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (9Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar, 17Singh A. Ni J. Aggarwal B.B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a stress-activated protein kinase (c-jun NH2-terminal protein kinase, JNK), and a cascade of caspases. By searching an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base using the amino acid sequence motif of TNF, we identified a novel member of the TNF family, named THANK, for TNF homologue that activates apoptosis, NF-κB, and JNK. We found that this cytokine was primarily expressed by hematopoietic cells. The recombinant THANK activated NF-κB, c-jun NH2-terminal kinase, caspase-3, and displayed antiproliferative effects in U937 cells through binding sites distinct from those for TNF. Using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones, a data base containing more than 2 million ESTs obtained from over 750 different cDNA libraries has been generated by Human Genome Sciences, Inc. A specific homology and motif search using the known amino acid sequence motif of TNF family members against this data base revealed several ESTs having homology to members of the TNF family. One full-length cDNA clone (HNEDU15) encoding an intact NH2-terminal signal peptide was isolated from a human neutrophil library and selected for further investigation. The complete cDNA sequence of both strands of this clone was determined, and its homology to TNF was confirmed. This gene product was named THANK. THANK is a 285-amino acid-long type II transmembrane protein. The transmembrane domain was found to be located between amino acid residues 47 through 77 (Fig. 1 A). The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of THANK (amino acids 78–285) was amplified employing the polymerase chain reaction technique using the following primers: 5′ BamHI, GCGGGATCCCAGCCTCCGGGCAGAGC and 3′ XbaI, GCGTCTAGATCACAGCACTTTCAATGC. The amplified fragment was purified, digested with BamHI and Xbal I, and cloned into a baculovirus expression vector pA2-GP, derived from pVL94. The cloning, expression, and confirmation of the identity of the cloned product were performed using standard techniques (18Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M. Grubb A. Su J. Yu G.-L. Li Y.-L.

Recombinant THANK was purified from the clarified culture supernatant of 92-h postinfected Sf9 cells. The protein was stepwise purified by cation and anion exchange chromatography. The purified THANK was analyzed for purity by 12% SDS-PAGE and by Western blot analysis. Two multiple human tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane of various tissues (CLONTECH) were probed with32P-labeled THANK cDNA. RNA from a selected panel of human cell lines were probed following the same technique. Antibodies against THANK were raised by injecting 0.2 mg of purified recombinant antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco) subcutaneously into a rabbit. After 3 weeks, the injection was repeated, and the rabbit was bled every 3rd week. The specificity of the antiserum was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. TNF receptor binding assay was performed following a modified procedure described previously from our laboratory (19Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 × 106 cells/well (triplicate well) in 100 μl of binding medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum) were incubated with 125I-labeled TNF (2.5 × 105 cpm/well, specific activity 40 mCi/mg) either alone (total binding) or in the presence of 20 nmunlabeled TNF (nonspecific binding) or 150 nm unlabeled THANK in an ice bath for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to remove unbound 125I-TNF. The cells were dried at 80 °C, and the cell-bound radioactivity was determined in a γ counter (Cobra-Auto Gamma, Packard Instrument Co.) NF-κB activation was analyzed by EMSA as described previously (20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar, 21Chaturvedi M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 6-μg nuclear extracts prepared from THANK-treated cells were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide for 15 min at 37 °C and the DNA-protein complex resolved in 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with unlabeled 100-fold excess oligonucleotide. The specificity of binding was also determined by supershift of the DNA-protein complex using specific and irrelevant antibodies. The samples of supershift experiments were resolved on 5.5% native gels. The radioactive bands from dried gels were visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. Purified THANK sample was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with polyclonal antibodies (1:6000) raised in rabbits. The blot was then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and finally detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The c-Jun kinase assay was performed by a modified method as described earlier (22Kumar A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μg cytoplasmic extracts were treated with anti-JNK1 antibodies, precipitated the immune complexes with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce), and assayed for the enzymatic activity by using glutathioneS-transferase-Jun (amino acids 1–79) as substrate (2 μg) in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was carried out by incubating the above mixture at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling. Finally, protein was resolved on a 9% acrylamide gel under reduced conditions. The radioactive bands of the dried gel were visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager as mentioned previously. To determine the total amount of JNK1 protein, 30 μg of the cytoplasmic extracts were loaded on 9% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% non-fat milk protein, and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:3000) against JNK1. The blots were then reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and finally detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cytotoxic effects of THANK against tumor cells were measured by modified tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay described earlier (23Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar) and by its ability to activate caspase-3 leading to cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (24Haridas V. Darnay B. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). For cytotoxicity, 5 × 103 cells in 0.1 ml were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and exposed to variable concentrations of either THANK or TNF (for comparison) in 0.1 ml. After 72-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were examined for viability. To estimate caspase-3 activation by PARP cleavage, cell extracts (50 μg/sample) were resolved on 7.5% acrylamide gels, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% non-fat milk protein, probed with PARP monoclonal antibody (1:3000), and detected by ECL as indicated above. The predicted amino acid sequence of mature THANK (112–285) is 15, 16, 18, and 19% identical to LIGHT, FasL, TNF, and LT-α, respectively (Fig.1 A). The cDNA for this novel cytokine was cloned and expressed in a baculovirus expression system. In CM cellulose cation exchange chromatography, THANK eluted first with 1 m NaCl (fraction A) and then with 1.5m NaCl (fraction B). Fraction B had an approximate molecular mass of 20 kDa on 12% SDS-PAGE with an amino-terminal sequence starting at AVQGP, whereas fraction A contained an additional peptide of 3 kDa with an amino-terminal sequence LKIFEPP (Fig.1 B). An apparently higher molecular size obtained by SDS-PAGE than that predicted from the number of amino acids suggested a post-translational modification. The amino acid sequence of the mature THANK lacked, however, the potential N-glycosylation site. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against THANK recognized the cytokine on Western blot (Fig. 1 C). Northern blot analysis indicated that THANK was expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, lung, placenta, small intestine, and pancreas; with highest expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.1 D). Analysis of the cell line blot (CLONTECH) revealed very high expression in HL60, detectable expression in K562, A549, and G361, and no detectable transcript in HeLa, MOLT4, Raji, and SW480 cell lines. Thus cells and tissues of the immune system expressed THANK transcripts. One of the earliest events induced by most members of the TNF superfamily is NF-κB activation (25Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The results depicted in Fig. 2, Aand B, indicate that THANK activated NF-κB in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Less than 10 pm THANK was enough to activate NF-κB in U937 cells, although peak activation was obtained at 1 nm. THANK induced optimum NF-κB activation within 60 min at 1 nm; and there was no significant increase thereafter (Fig. 2 B). The gel shift band was specific, as its formation could be eliminated with excess unlabeled oligonucleotide. It was supershifted by anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies only (Fig. 2 C), thus indicating that the nuclear factor was composed of p50 and p65 subunits. No significant difference was found in the ability to activate NF-κB between the 20- and 23-kDa forms of THANK, indicating that residues 112 through 134 are optional for the biological activity (data not shown). To ascertain that the observed activation was due to THANK and not a contaminant, the protein was preincubated with anti-THANK polyclonal antibodies before treatment with the cells. Fig. 2 D shows a lack of NF-κB activation after treatment of THANK with antibodies even at a 1 to 1000 dilution. Antibody against THANK by itself had no effect. To further ascertain that NF-κB activation was due to the proteinaceous nature of THANK, the protein was either digested with trypsin or heat-denatured prior to treatment. Both treatments completely abolished NF-κB activation in U937 cells, confirming that THANK was responsible for this activation (Fig. 2 E). Although THANK was as potent as TNF with respect to both dose and time required for NF-κB activation, the overall amplitude of response was less with THANK. In this respect the activity of THANK was comparable with LT-α (21Chaturvedi M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of JNK is another early event that is initiated by different members of the TNF family (17Singh A. Ni J. Aggarwal B.B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Kumar A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). THANK activated JNK activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and B). At 10 pm the activity increased by 2.5-fold and at 1 nm it reached 4.4-fold. An additional increase in THANK concentration slightly decreased activation (Fig. 3 A). The peak activation of JNK was observed at 60 min (3.3-fold increase), which gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that, like TNF, THANK transiently activates JNK in U937 cells. The activation of JNK by THANK was not due to an increase in JNK protein levels, as immunoblot analysis demonstrated comparable JNK1 expression at all dose and time points (Fig. 3, A and B,lower panels). Activations of NF-κB and JNK are early cellular responses to TNF, which are followed by cytotoxic effects to tumor cells. The effect of different concentrations of THANK on the cytotoxic effects against tumor cell lines was examined and compared with that of TNF. Results in Fig. 4 A show that THANK inhibited the growth of human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Besides U937, THANK also inhibited the growth of prostate cancer (PC-3), colon cancer (HT-29), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and embryonic kidney cells (A293) (data not shown). The growth inhibition curve of THANK was superimposable with that of TNF, indicating comparable potency. Degradation of PARP by caspase-3 is one of the hallmarks of apoptosis in tumor cells (26Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of U937 cells with THANK for 2 h induced partial cleavage of PARP in U937 cells, whereas TNF almost completely cleaved PARP under these conditions (Fig.4 B). This suggests that THANK can activate caspase-3, although not so strongly as TNF. Previously we have shown that TNF and LT, which share homology with each other to the same extent as THANK, bind to the same cell surface receptors (4Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Hass P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Since THANK has significant amino acid sequence homology with TNF, and like TNF exhibits cytotoxic effects, and activates NF-κB and JNK, we examined its binding to the TNF receptor. The receptor binding results (Fig. 4 C) show that 20 nm unlabeled TNF almost completely blocked the binding of 125I-labeled TNF to U937 cells, whereas 150 nm unlabeled THANK did not compete for 125I-TNF binding sites. These results suggest that THANK interacts with U937 cells through a receptor distinct from that for TNF. In summary, we describe here the identification of a novel cytokine expressed by hematopoietic cells that can, like TNF and LT-α, activate NF-κB and JNK and inhibit the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells. Although the structure of THANK also exhibits homology to FasL and LIGHT, the latter have not been reported to activate NF-κB. Our preliminary results by using flow cytometry indicate that THANK protein is expressed by promyelomonocytic HL-60 cells (data not shown). Because THANK is expressed by hematopoietic cells, it appears to be similar to LT-α and dissimilar from other members of the TNF superfamily. Among all the members of the TNF superfamily, THANK exhibits cytotoxic effects similar to TNF and LT-α. Whether THANK exhibits immunomodulatory activities and in vivo antitumor activities is currently under investigation."

The converter and the lever arm are in very different positions from those in either the pre–power stroke or near-rigor state structures; moreover, in contrast to these structures, the SH1 helix is seen to be unwound. Here we compare the overall organization of the myosin head in these three states and show how the conformation of three flexible “joints” produces rearrangements of the four major subdomains in the myosin head with different bound nucleotides. We believe that this novel structure represents one of the prehydrolysis (“ATP”) states of the contractile cycle in which the myosin heads stay detached from actin."

This highly conserved ribonucleoprotein domain is the target for the thiostrepton family of antibiotics that disrupt elongation factor function. The highly compact RNA has both familiar and novel structural motifs. While the C-terminal domain of L11 binds RNA tightly, the N-terminal domain makes only limited contacts with RNA and is proposed to function as a switch that reversibly associates with an adjacent region of RNA. The sites of mutations conferring resistance to thiostrepton and micrococcin line a narrow cleft between the RNA and the N-terminal domain. These antibiotics are proposed to bind in this cleft, locking the putative switch and interfering with the function of elongation factors."
https://openalex.org/W2318098003,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, whereas Asian women, who consume a traditional diet high in soy products, have a relatively low incidence. Genistein is a prominent isoflavonoid in soy products and has been proposed as the agent responsible for lowering the rate of breast cancer in Asian women. We investigated the effects of genistein on cell growth and apoptosis-related gene expression in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. We found up-regulation of Bax and p21WAF1 expressions and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and p53 expression in genistein-treated cells. Furthermore, DNA ladder formation, CPP32 activation, and PARP cleavage were observed after treatment with genistein, indicating apoptotic cell deaths. Flow cytometry with 7-amino actinomycin D staining showed that the number of apoptotic cells increased with longer treatment of genistein. From these results, we conclude that genistein inhibits the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, regulates the expression of apoptosis-related genes, and induces apoptosis through a p53-independent pathway. The up-regulation of Bax and p21WAF1 may be the molecular mechanisms by which genistein induces apoptosis, however, further definitive studies are needed. These results suggest that genistein may be a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2014187063,"The Enabled/VASP homology 1 (EVH1; also called WH1) domain is an interaction module found in several proteins implicated in actin-based cell motility. EVH1 domains bind the consensus proline-rich motif FPPPP and are required for targeting the actin assembly machinery to sites of cytoskeletal remodeling. The crystal structure of the mammalian Enabled (Mena) EVH1 domain complexed with a peptide ligand reveals a mechanism of recognition distinct from that used by other proline-binding modules. The EVH1 domain fold is unexpectedly similar to that of the pleckstrin homology domain, a membrane localization module. This finding demonstrates the functional plasticity of the pleckstrin homology fold as a binding scaffold and suggests that membrane association may play an auxiliary role in EVH1 targeting."

https://openalex.org/W1735728105,"Free radicals may be involved in apoptosis although this is the subject of some controversy. Furthermore, the source of free radicals in apoptotic cells is not certain. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of oxidative stress in the induction of apoptosis in serum-deprived fibroblast cultures and in weaned lactating mammary glands as in vitro and in vivo experimental models, respectively. Oxidative damage to mtDNA is higher in apoptotic cells than in controls. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels in mitochondria from lactating mammary gland are also higher in apoptosis. There is a direct relationship between mtDNA damage and the GSSG/reduced glutathione (GSH) ratio. Furthermore, whole cell GSH is decreased and GSSG is increased in both models of apoptosis. Glutathione oxidation precedes nuclear DNA fragmentation. These signs of oxidative stress are caused, at least in part, by an increase in peroxide production by mitochondria from apoptotic cells. We report a direct relationship between glutathione oxidation and mtDNA damage in apoptosis. Our results support the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the induction of apoptosis—Esteve, J.

https://openalex.org/W1610329392,"Amphetamine analogs have emerged as popular recreational drugs of abuse. The number of reports of these substances producing severe acute toxicity and death is increasing. In ‘Ecstasy’ -associated deaths, focal necrosis in the liver and individual myocytic necrosis has been reported. Furthermore, serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal cell damage has been observed in experimental amphetamine intoxication in laboratory animals. Here we demonstrate that subchronic exposure to D-amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (‘Ecstasy’) results in significant neurotoxicity in rat neocortical neurons in vitro. This neuronal cell death is accompanied by endonucleosomal DNA cleavage and differential expression of anti- and proapoptotic bcl-xL/S splice variants.

https://openalex.org/W2169245276,"Most receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) contain two conserved phosphatase domains (D1 and D2) in their intracellular region. The carboxy-terminal D2 domain has little or no catalytic activity. The crystal structure of the tandem D1 and D2 domains of the human RPTP LAR revealed that the tertiary structures of the LAR D1 and D2 domains are very similar to each other, with the exception of conformational differences at two amino acid positions in the D2 domain. Site-directed mutational changes at these positions (Leu-1644-to-Tyr and Glu-1779-to-Asp) conferred a robust PTPase activity to the D2 domain. The catalytic sites of both domains are accessible, in contrast to the dimeric blocked orientation model previously suggested. The relative orientation of the LAR D1 and D2 domains, constrained by a short linker, is stabilized by extensive interdomain interactions, suggesting that this orientation might be favored in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2095276872,"Efficient export of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), a type I transmembrane protein, from the endoplasmic reticulum requires a di-acidic code (DXE) located in the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal tail (Nishimura, N., and Balch, W. E. (1997) Science 277, 556–558). Mutation of the DXE code by mutation to AXA did not prevent VSV-G recruitment to pre-budding complexes formed in the presence of the activated form of the Sar1 and the Sec23/24 complex, components of the COPII budding machinery. However, the signal was required at a subsequent concentration step preceding vesicle fission. By using green fluorescence protein-tagged VSV-G to image movement in a single cell, we found that VSV-G lacking the DXE code fails to be concentrated into COPII vesicles. As a result, the normal 5–10-fold increase in the steady-state concentration of VSV-G in downstream pre-Golgi intermediates and Golgi compartments was lost. These results demonstrate for the first time that inactivation of the DXE signal uncouples early cargo selection steps from concentration into COPII vesicles. We propose that two sequential steps are required for efficient export from the endoplasmic reticulum.

What are the molecular mechanisms directing efficient export? Movement of cargo between compartments of the secretory pathway involves selective sorting and concentration into vesicle carriers (1Aridor M. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized cargo that is translocated into the ER is incorporated into COPII-coated vesicles (2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Cargo exiting the ER includes both endogenous transport components that must be recycled from post-ER compartments for reuse and biosynthetic proteins that are delivered to downstream subcellular destinations and the cell surface. Cargo is sorted from resident ER proteins and selected for export by interacting with COPII coat components (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Kuehn M.J. Herrmann M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Selective recruitment of cargo to pre-budding protein complexes occurs in response to activation of the Sar1 GTPase to the GTP-bound form. This step is coordinated with the recruitment of the cytosolic Sec23/24 protein complex. These proteins, in combination with additional membrane proteins and the cytosolic Sec13/31 complex, promote membrane invagination and vesicle fission. Although some of the basic coat components involved in COPII coat assembly have been identified, the mechanism by which biosynthetic cargo is selected for and concentrated into COPII vesicles is unknown.A role for sorting signals was first demonstrated for clathrin-mediated vesicle formation at the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 5Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Here, tyrosine-based motifs direct both the selection and concentration of cargo molecules into clathrin-coated vesicles through the interaction with the μ2 chain of AP2 complexes (reviewed in Ref. 6Bonifacino J.S. Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 4: 285-295Google Scholar). Similarly, the selection and concentration of recycling cargo into COPI-coated vesicles that mediate retrograde transport between Golgi compartments and from pre-Golgi compartments to the ER involve the KKXX motif (7Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 8Cosson P. Letourneur F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that recycling cargo is concentrated by binding to the γ subunit of the COPI coat complex (9Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11649-11654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Signals involved in the selection of cargo for export from the ER are only beginning to emerge. Peptides containing a double Phe (FF) motif found in the cytoplasmic domain of the mammalian p24 family and p53/58 proteins that recycle between the ER and the Golgi have been shown to bind the Sec23 COPII component in vitro (10Kappeler F.

Mutation of these residues effects trafficking of these proteins in vivo (10Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Ch. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Curiously, the FF motif in the yeast p24 family member Emp24p has been reported to attenuate the effect of a separate export signal composed of adjacent Leu-Val (LV) residues present at the extreme carboxyl terminus (13Nakamura N. Yamazaki S. Sato K. Nakano A. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 9: 3493-3503Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have recently found that a number of newly synthesized type 1 transmembrane proteins destined for the cell surface, including vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV-G), require a di-acidic motif (DXE) in their cytoplasmic domains for efficient export (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 15Bannykh S. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When the DXE code is mutated to AXA, VSV-G exits the ER at ∼10-fold slower rates. Unlike the FF motif, the di-acidic code is sufficient to direct export from the ER. Addition of the code to the α subunit of the T-cell receptor-α, a resident ER protein, leads to recruitment into COPII vesicles (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although the code is necessary for efficient export, VSV-G transport is not completely blocked as the AXA mutant exits the ER with ∼10-fold reduced efficiency (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the DXE signal participates in only a subset of interactions required for the efficient coupling of biosynthetic cargo to the ER export machinery.Whereas clathrin recognizes fully folded cargo for selective delivery to distinct destinations, export of newly synthesized cargo from the ER is faced with competing pathways including those directing completion of folding (“quality control” (16Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar)) and those that target proteins for degradation (17Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike clathrin-mediated carriers, ER-derived vesicles are delivered to a common destination, the Golgi stack. Thus, cargo sorting from the ER is a problem unique to the COPII machinery. The functional relationships between signals that target biosynthetic cargo to each of the ER-specific pathways are unknown. Signal strength for each route will be expected to affect the kinetics of export from the ER. Moreover, it is now evident that a number of endogenous factors, some of which recycle between the ER and the Golgi, temporally associate with biosynthetic cargo and are essential for export (18Kuehn M.J. Schekman R. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., U. S.

Thus, multiple signals on cargo may be required to direct interaction with specialized accessory factors as well as the general COPII machinery to solicit efficient export.We have recently shown that VSV-G interacts with a subset of COPII components, the Sar1 GTPase and the Sec23/24 complex, to form pre-budding complexes that are subsequently assembled in mature COPII vesicles budding from the ER (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). From these and related studies in yeast (4Kuehn M.J. Herrmann M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), it is clear that components of the COPII machinery participate in cargo selection and concentration. Whether the DXE signal directs the initial selection event, concentration, or both remains a fundamental question that needs to be addressed.To analyze the mechanism of the DXE signal in cargo selection and concentration during ER export, we have taken advantage of cells expressing VSV-G. The transport of VSV-G has been extensively utilized to define the basic biochemical components and principles of operation of the secretory pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Aridor M. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 15Bannykh S. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In particular, the tsO45 strain of VSV-G (VSV-Gts) can be accumulated in the ER due to a temperature-sensitive folding defect when cells are incubated at the restrictive temperature of 39.5 °C. Upon shift to the permissive temperature of 32 °C its folding resumes, allowing VSV-Gts to exit the ER. The ability to synchronize movement of VSV-Gts allows us to follow a single well defined biosynthetic cargo molecule through the secretory pathway (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 23Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).In order to visualize export directly from the ER, we have tagged both the tsO45-VSV-G wild-type (Gts-DXE) and the AXA mutant (Gts-AXA) with green fluorescence protein (GFP). By monitoring the real time movement of GFP-VSV-Gts within the same cell in vivo andin vitro using video microscopy, we find that the DXE motif plays a key role in the concentration of VSV-G into COPII-coated vesicles at ER export sites. Loss of concentration of the AXA mutant is not a consequence of inability of the mutant to be recruited to pre-budding complexes formed in the presence of activated Sar1 and Sec23/24. Our ability to uncouple cargo selection by the COPII machinery from a downstream concentration event(s) preceding vesicle fission leads us to propose a minimal two-step model for ER export of cargo.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have examined the biochemical role of the di-acidic code found in the cytoplasmic tail of VSV-G (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) in mediating the efficiency of export of cargo from the ER. We have now shown that the code is involved in a step involving concentration in COPII-coated vesicles. To demonstrate this point, we used combined biochemical and morphological approaches, in particular utilizing GFP-tagged VSV-G to visualize the ER export in real time. This approach allowed us to follow the fate of VSV-G in a single cell during trafficking from the ER to the cell surface in vivo. Moreover, we have now extended this technology to visualize the movement of GFP-Gts in vitro. This facile approach gives us precise biochemical control over incubation conditions that are important to physiologically mobilize VSV-G from the ER (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 27Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 38Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Our results provide new insight into the pathway directing export of cargo from the ER.Role of DXE in Recovery of VSV-G in Pre-budding ComplexesWe found that mutation of the DXE code to AXA does not affect the ability of VSV-G to be recovered in detergent-soluble pre-budding complexes formed in vitro in the presence of activated Sar1-GTP and purified Sec23/24 when the AXA mutant is largely present in the ER. This selection event is the first detectable step in the capture of VSV-G into COPII vesicles in mammalian cells (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and for COPII vesicle assembly by endogenous recycling transport factors in yeast (44Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although we were at first surprised that the DXE code was not required for cargo selection by Sar1-GTP and Sec23/24, this result is entirely consistent with the fact that loss of the code affects the kinetics of transport but not the extent (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We conclude that at least one principal activity that is responsible for the accelerated rate of VSV-G export from the ER is downstream from selection into pre-budding complexes. These results raise the possibility that the multiple signals may be required in VSV-G and other cargo for efficient export. Experiments are currently in progress to address this possibility.DXE Is Involved in Concentration in COPII VesiclesBy using both indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy we have demonstrated an important role for the DXE motif in concentration of cargo in COPII vesicles. Evidence for this conclusion stems from the observation that the AXA mutant could not be detected in a concentrated form in pre-Golgi and Golgi compartments under a variety of incubation conditions designed to block and accumulate cargo in post-ER compartments at reduced temperature. Moreover, continuous monitoring of movement in vivo and in vitro failed to detect even a transient appearance of concentrated AXA mutant in the early secretory pathway over a time frame in which the AXA mutant is efficiently processed to endo H-resistant forms and delivered to the cell surface. Two independent approaches were used to characterize the concentration of VSV-G in post-Golgi compartments using electron microscopy. Given the fact that the concentration of VSV-G in Golgi compartments is a measure of concentration during ER export (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 24Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 38Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), the reduced level of HRP reaction product or gold particles in Golgi compartments expressing the AXA mutant when compared with wild-type demonstrates a marked deficiency in concentration during COPII vesicle budding. It is apparent that inactivation of the code (mutation of DXE to AXA) uncouples VSV-G from the concentration machineryin vivo.Requirement for Sar1-GTP in Cargo ConcentrationBecause we could not detect a difference in the recovery of wild-type VSV-G or the AXA mutant in pre-budding complexes formed in the presence of Sar1-GTP, we examined whether Sar1-GTP could bypass the concentration defect following inactivation of the code. We found that this was not the case. Incubation in the presence of Sar1-GTP did not result in normal concentration of the AXA mutant. At early time points (30 min), when wild-type VSV-G could be readily detected in a concentrated form in pre-Golgi intermediates in the presence of Sar1-GTP, the AXA mutant could not be detected. This result is consistent with the reduced kinetics of export of the AXA mutant (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Because recruitment to pre-budding complexes by Sar1-GTP appears unaffected in the AXA mutant under the current experimental conditions, it is apparent that concentration is a distinct step in the export pathway. These results emphasize that the DXE code is essential for rapid concentration even in the presence of the activated Sar1-GTP mutant.In contrast to early time points, we found that at later time points (60 min), the AXA mutant could start to be detected in a concentrated form in pre-Golgi intermediates in the presence of Sar1-GTP. This result contrasts to normal incubation conditions (in the presence of wild-type Sar1) where the AXA mutant could not be detected in pre-Golgi intermediates or Golgi compartments even after 120 min of incubation. Suppression of the AXA mutant phenotype at later time points is not due to a general loss of fidelity in cargo selection, as we have previously documented that Sar1-GTP has no effect on the ability of resident ER proteins to be efficiently excluded from COPII vesicles formed in vitro (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 27Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain concentration at late time points is that incubation with Sar1-GTP favors stable recruitment of COPII components to ER membranes (1Aridor M. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 45Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This increase in the steady-state level of the COPII components on the ER surface could result in efficient “capture” of lower affinity AXA mutant without additional DXE signal-dependent factors. An alternative, but very speculative possibility, is that the DXE code normally facilitates coat assembly by stabilizing Sar1 in the GTP-bound form upon assembly of a “recruitment” complex, thereby facilitating efficient packing of cargo by COPII complexes.The ability of excess Sar1-GTP to alter the efficiency of recruitment of wild-type and mutant biosynthetic cargo is consistent with recent observations from biochemical analysis of yeast COPII components in vesicle budding. First, COPII vesicle budding from artificial liposomes requires ∼5-fold higher concentration of activated Sar1 than that required to generate vesicles using microsomes (45Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This suggests that the liposomes form a low affinity template for COPII coat assembly.In vivo, biosynthetic and/or recycling cargo would be expected to initiate these events (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 32Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4389-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 44Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Second, the incorporation of biosynthetic cargo and recycling cargo into COPII vesicles is differentially affected by the amount of Sar1 (46Campbell J.L. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, exported proteins require different levels of COPII components for efficient export, suggesting recruitment is affected by the relative affinity of the protein for the COPII machinery.Sequential Steps Direct Pre-budding Complex Formation and ConcentrationWe have shown that recruitment of VSV-G to COPII vesicles involves selection into pre-budding complexes containing Sar1-GTP and Sec23/24 (3Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that is DXE-independent (this study). This is followed by a DXE-dependent concentration step, suggesting that mutation of the DXE signal can uncouple selection from concentration. We propose that DXE may serve as a high affinity recruitment motif for a novel “linker” component(s), possibly SNARE proteins that have recently been shown to bind to Sar1 in vitro (44Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), or it may enhance recruitment of membrane-associated components such as Sec16 that interact with Sec23/24 and whose role in COPII vesicle assembly remain to be defined (47Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 48Shaywitz D.A. Espenshade P.J. Gimeno R.E. Kaiser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25413-25416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 49Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may recruit presently unknown factors that stabilize the formation of pre-budding complexes or mediate stable coat assembly from pre-budding complexes. Our combined results suggest for the first time that export from the ER may involve at least a two-step mechanism. In this model, cargo present in pre-budding complexes (Fig. 9, step 1) undergoes a distinct concentration event for efficient recruitment to COPII vesicles (Fig. 9, step 2).The two-step model is supported by three lines of evidence. First, the inactivation of the DXE can distinguish pre-budding complex formation from concentration processes. Second, these two steps have different sensitivities for the activated Sar1-GTP mutant. Whereas Gts-AXA can be recovered in pre-budding complexes containing the Sar1-GTP mutant as efficiently as Gts-DXE, the inefficient kinetics of concentration in pre-Golgi intermediates observed in the Gts-AXA mutant cannot be restored to normal efficiency by incubation in the presence of the Sar1-GTP. This argues that following an initial interaction between VSV-G and a subset of COPII components, further step(s) are required to promote a concentration event that requires DXE-dependent factors. Third, when Gts-DXE containing microsomes are retained at the restrictive temperature (where Gts is unfolded and remains in a diffuse ER reticular distribution), Gts-DXE can be efficiently recovered in pre-budding complexes (32Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4389-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This provides an independent line of evidence that cargo selection can be uncoupled from concentration. Furthermore, a number of endogenous accessory factors, some of which recycle between the ER and Golgi, are now recognized to be essential for the export of specific biosynthetic cargo proteins, for example NinaA, receptor-associated protein, Shr3, and p53/58 that are required for ER export of rhodopsin, low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins, general amino acid permease-1, and procathepsin C, respectively (18Kuehn M.J.

Although their mechanism of action is currently unknown, it is possible that these factors regulate either selection (step 1), concentration (step 2), or novel, unidentified steps prior to COPII vesicle formation.Export from the ER requires discrimination between immature and mature cargo by the COPII machinery. The use of a multi-step pathway allows for branch points in which dysfunctional cargo can be targeted for degradation. Moreover, it provides additional flexibility of the rate in which different forms of cargo are exported from the ER, perhaps independent of their folding pathways. Such a multi-step pathway may be applicable to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of cell-surface receptors. For example, stimulation of the β2-adrenogenic receptor triggers recruitment of β-arrestin from cytosol and regulates the concentration of receptor in clathrin-coated vesicles (52Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

We have recently demonstrated that cargo selection by Sar1-GTP and Sec23/24 is an early event, as even the misfolded form of Gts can be recovered in pre-budding complexes at the restrictive temperature (32Aridor M.

These results demonstrate that cargo can modulate general COPII vesicle formation from the ER through competition for general transport factors that may participate in later steps of COPII vesicle assembly (32Aridor M.

Studies currently in progress directed at identifying the component(s) that mediate DXE-dependent cargo concentration in the ER should provide important insight into such mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2078601368,"We report that certain plasma proteins, at physiological concentrations, are potent inhibitors of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) polymerization. These proteins are also present in cerebrospinal fluid, but at low concentrations having little or no effect on Aβ. Thirteen proteins representing more than 90% of the protein content in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were studied. Quantitatively, albumin was the most important protein, representing 60% of the total amyloid inhibitory activity, followed by α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin and immunoglobulins A and G. Albumin suppressed amyloid formation by binding to the oligomeric or polymeric Aβ, blocking a further addition of peptide. This effect was also observed when the incorporation of labeled Aβ into genuine β-amyloid in tissue section was studied. The Aβ and the anti-diabetic drug tolbutamide apparently bind to the same site on albumin. Tolbutamide displaces Aβ from albumin, increasing its free concentration and enhancing amyloid formation. The present results suggest that several endogenous proteins are negative regulators of amyloid formation. Plasma contains at least 300 times more amyloid inhibitory activity than cerebrospinal fluid. These findings may provide one explanation as to why β-amyloid deposits are not found in peripheral tissues but are only found in the central nervous system. Moreover, the data suggest that some drugs that display an affinity for albumin may enhance β-amyloid formation and promote the development of Alzheimer's disease."

Here we show that in contrast to heparin, cellular heparan sulfate forms a binary complex with FGFR that discriminates between FGF-1 and FGF-2. FGFR type 4 (FGFR4) in liver parenchymal cells binds only FGF-1, whereas FGFR1 binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. Cell-free complexes of heparin and recombinant FGFR4 bound FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. However, in contrast to FGFR1, when recombinant FGFR4 was expressed back in epithelial cells by transfection, it failed to bind FGF-2 unless heparan sulfate was depressed by chlorate or heparinase treatment. Isolated heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) from liver cells in cell-free complexes with FGFR4 restored the specificity for FGF-1 and supported the binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 when complexed with FGFR1. In contrast, FGF-2 bound equally well to complexes of both FGFR1 and FGFR4 formed with endothelial cell-derived HSPG, but the endothelial HSPG was deficient for the binding of FGF-1 to both FGFR complexes.

Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A large number of genetically distinct FGF polypeptides have emerged, currently 18, for which there are only four FGFR (1McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The high ratio of ligands to receptors, the co-expression of multiple FGFs within the same tissue or cells, and the apparent ability of the four FGFR to bind multiple FGFs when heparin is used as the experimental mimic of heparan sulfate raise questions about the redundancy and functional relevance of the large number of FGF homologues. Here, we show that cellular heparan sulfate in a binary complex with the FGFR ectodomain is an FGFR isotype- and cell-specific determinant for selection of the FGF that interacts with the complex. In a physiological tissue context, this may restrict redundancy of the four FGFR for the large repertoire of FGF ligands. The culture of primary rat hepatocytes collected by perfusion (11Kan M.

Recombinant FGFR4 was constructed as follows: P1 (5′-TTGGGAATTCCAGCTTGGGTCCCT-3′) and P3 (5′-GCCAGGTATACGGACATCATC-3′) were used as sense primers beginning at 42 base pairs upstream of the translational initiation site and 15 base pairs upstream of the coding sequence for the transmembrane domain, respectively, using the polymerase chain reaction. P2 (5′-GGATGGAATTCACTTGCCGGAAGAGCC-3′) and P4 (5′-CACAGCCTCGAGCCTTGCTCATGT-3′) were used as antisense primers ending 124 base pairs downstream of coding sequence for the transmembrane region and 18 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. Paired primers P1P2 and P3P4 were separately applied using HepG2 cell cDNA as template to amplify 1.3-kilobase extracellular and intracellular fragments, respectively. The P1P2 fragment was ligated into pBSK cloning vector at an EcoRI site. The P3P4 fragment coding for the intracellular domain was then ligated into the pBSK vector with the extracellular domain fragment at AccI andXhoI sites to obtain the full-length FGFR4 cDNA. Sequence was verified and then the FGFR4 cDNA was cloned either into mammalian expression vector pcDNA1neo (Invitrogen Co., SanDiego, CA) at BamHI and XhoI sites for expression on A431 cells or into transfer plasmid pVL1393 (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA) at SmaI sites for preparation of the baculovirus. Heparin or heparan sulfate activity was assessed by binding to recombinant FGFR receptor kinase ectodomain, and then the ability of the binary complex to support the binding of radiolabeled FGF was assessed (8Kan M.

Lysates containing approximately 5 μg of FGFR were mixed with either 4 μg of anti-FGFR1 (17A3) monoclonal antibody or 16 μl of anti-FGFR4 rabbit antiserum (17Feng S. Xu J. Wang F. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The immobilized FGFR was washed with 1 mNaCl in PBS and then extensively with PBS. After division into 8–12 portions, beads were incubated with standard heparin (Sigma, 174 USP units/mg) or extracts or partially purified fractions containing heparan sulfate for 1 h at room temperature in 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.01% CHAPS (binding buffer). After washing three times with PBS, 125I-FGF (4 ng/ml in 250 μl) was added for 1 h. Beads were then washed with PBS, 1 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate was added for 15 min, and extracts from the beads were counted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Dissociation constants (K d) were determined by Scatchard analyses. Assays using isolated FGFR were performed under conditions that promote maximum dependence on external heparin/heparan sulfate for FGF binding (9Kan M. Wang F. Kan M. To B. Gabriel J. McKeehan W.L.

Procedures to determine specific binding and to distinguish binding to complexes of FGFR and heparin/heparan sulfate from FGF bound to heparin/heparan sulfate sites that are not in sufficient proximity to FGFR to yield covalent FGF-FGFR complexes have been described in detail (9Kan M.

Immobilized binary FGFR complexes were prepared by incubation of immobilized FGFR and 1 μg/ml heparin or 2 μg/ml cellular heparan sulfate followed by removal of unbound carbohydrate. Analysis was performed in a range of 1.5–10 ng/ml radiolabeled FGF. Nonspecific binding was less than 10% of total at all concentrations determined in the presence of 30-fold unlabeled FGF.K d and receptor site number were estimated by linear least squares analysis. Except where indicated, theK d values cited in the text are the mean ± S.D. of three separate determinations. Subconfluent cell cultures described in the text in 75-cm2 flasks in batches of 10 were treated with 25 μg/ml trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in PBS (5 ml/flask) for 15 min at 4 °C. The solution containing material released from the monolayers was acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dialyzed against water, and freeze-dried. One flask of cells per batch was labeled by the addition of 20 μCi/ml 35SO4overnight prior to extraction for use as a tracer. The freeze-dried powder was reconstituted in PBS and applied to a Biosil SEL-400 HPLC gel filtration column (exclusion limit, 106 kDa, 300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad). The radioactivity (35S) of each fraction was monitored by liquid scintillation, and the activity of each fraction was screened by ability to complement recombinant insect cell-derived FGFR1 for binding of 125I-FGF-1. In some cases, fractions were prescreened for binding activity using intact Sf9 cells expressing the recombinant FGFR prior to extraction and immobilization. Activity was expressed as a stimulation index, which was the binding in the presence of fraction divided by that in absence of the test fraction. Fractions of coincident radioactivity and FGF binding activity were pooled and applied directly to a Bio-Gel TSK-DEAE-5-PW anion-exchange HPLC column. Application of a gradient of NaCl from 0.15 to 1.0 m revealed a peak of coincident binding activity and 35S radioactivity at 0.5 mNaCl, which was dialyzed and freeze-dried prior to reconstitution. Carbohydrate content was measured by the carbozole method and standardized to the dry weight of heparin. Carbohydrate equivalent to about 50 μg of heparin containing 10 μg of protein was obtained from 108 HepG2 cells. A portion of the reconstituted partially purified material with uronic acid content equivalent to 2.5 μg of standard heparin was diluted with 2 ml of 200 mm borate buffer (pH 9.0), mixed with 100 μl of a fresh solution of 5 mg/ml Bolton-Hunter reagent in Me2SO and incubated for 3 h on ice. The fraction was then dialyzed against PBS and then iodinated to a specific activity of 1 × 105 cpm/ng with 1 mCi of Na125I using the Chloramine T method. Free iodine was eliminated by centrifugal filtration (Millipore Ultra free-MC, molecular weight 30,000 cut-off, Millipore Products Division, Bedford, MA) with a recovery of TCA-insoluble material of 40%. An FGFR-affinity matrix for heparan sulfate was prepared using the membrane-anchored recombinant FGFR ectodomain expressed in Sf9 cells following extraction and immobilization on antibody-protein A beads or immobilization of constructs of the FGFR ectodomain fused to glutathioneS-transferase downstream of the transmembrane domain to GSH-beads (9Kan M. Wang F. Kan M. To B. Gabriel J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate was applied in conditions described above for preparation of FGF-binding binary complexes of FGFR and heparin/heparan sulfate. Elution was carried out with increasing concentrations of NaCl or 10 mm EDTA (9Kan M. Wang F. Kan M. To B. Gabriel J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Noncovalent affinity matrices of FGF-1 and FGF-2 (5 μg) bound to Cu-chelated beads (500 μl) (Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were prepared in the presence of 100 μg of heparin and 10 mm MgCl2 in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 2 m NaCl in PBS and incubated with another 5 μg of FGF, and the procedure was repeated. About 85% of the applied FGF could be immobilized under these conditions; this percentage was unaffected by the presence or absence of heparin and the subsequent 2m NaCl wash. Separate analyses revealed that elution of the column with 10 mm imidazole removed about 75% of the bound FGF after multiple runs and that the activity of the recovered FGF was equal to unbound FGF in receptor binding and cell growth assays. The binding of radiolabeled heparin or 125I-labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycan to the affinity matrix was dependent on the presence of FGF. Nearly 100% of bound heparin/heparan sulfate was eluted by salt or imidazole. Bound heparin or heparan sulfate was routinely eluted from FGF-1 columns with 1.0 m NaCl and from FGF-2 columns with 1.5 m NaCl. Cultured rat hepatocytes, which express exclusively FGFR4 (Fig. 1 A), exhibit a mitogenic response to specifically FGF-1 (11Kan M. Huang J. Mansson P.-E. Yasumitsu H. Carr B. McKeehan W.L. Proc.

In contrast, hepatocyte-like human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells ectopically express isoforms of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 in addition to FGFR4 (Fig. 1 B), bind FGF-2, and exhibit 180,000 FGFR sites/cell that bind FGF-1 (12Kan M.

However, an analysis with antiserum specific for FGFR1 and FGFR4 revealed that the FGFR1 fraction in HepG2 cells bound both FGF-1 and FGF-2, but the FGFR4 fraction bound only FGF-1 (Fig. 1 D). This absolute specificity of FGFR4 for FGF-1 in liver parenchymal cells was similar to the specificity of recombinant FGFR4 for FGF-1 reported in monkey kidney epithelial cells (19Partanen J.

However, it differed from FGFR4 in mouse fibroblasts (20Vainikka S. Partanen J. Bellosta P. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Basilico C. Jaye M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), muscle cells (21Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), which bound both FGF-1 and FGF-2. Similar to the latter three mammalian cells, a reconstituted complex of heparin and isolated recombinant FGFR4 derived from insect cells bound FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally (Fig. 2). Separate Scatchard analyses of the binding of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to binary complexes prepared with 1 μg/ml heparin yielded apparentK d values of 243 ± 30 and 247 ± 28 pm, respectively. This was similar to the recombinant FGFR1-heparin complex, which bound both FGF-1 and FGF-2 withK d values of 253 ± 18 pm and 197 ± 61 pm, respectively. Thus both FGFR1 and FGFR4 have an intrinsic ability to bind both FGF-1 and FGF-2, but a factor that either supports or prevents the binding of FGF-2 to specifically FGFR4 differs among different types of mammalian cells.Figure 2Binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 to complexes of heparin and isolated FGFR4. The binding of radiolabeled FGF-1 and FGF-2 to binary complexes of recombinant FGFR1 and FGFR4 prepared by incubation with the indicated amounts of heparin was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Insets show results of covalent affinity cross-linking analysis at 1 μg/ml heparin (right lanes).

The data set presented is representative of three reproductions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that a cell type-dependent factor confers selectivity of FGFR4 for FGF-1, we reconstituted FGFR-deficient epithelial cells (A431 from a squamous cell carcinoma) with 1 × 105 FGFR1 or 5 × 104 FGFR4 and then examined the binding of FGF-1 and FGF-2 (Fig. 3). Scatchard analysis indicated that FGF-1 and FGF-2 bound to cells expressing FGFR1 withK d values of 104 ± 13 pm and 142 ± 9 pm, respectively, whereas cells expressing FGFR4 bound only FGF-1 with a K d of 243 ± 24 pm. The binding of FGF-2 to FGFR4 was below the limits of detection by both Scatchard analysis and covalent affinity cross-linking (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether cellular heparan sulfate played a role in specificity of the binding of FGF in the reconstituted A431 cells, we applied sodium chlorate, which inhibits sulfation of heparan sulfate, or heparinase, which modifies heparan sulfate chains. The treatment of the A431 cells expressing FGFR4 with sodium chlorate reduced the binding of FGF to cellular heparan sulfate sites for FGF-1 and FGF-2 to 15 and 35%, respectively, of untreated controls. Surprisingly, the treatment resulted in the binding of FGF-2 to FGFR4 (Fig. 3 B). Similar to chlorate, treatment of cells with heparinase also resulted in the gain in the binding of FGF-2 in the cells reconstituted with FGFR4 (Fig. 3 B). This implicated heparan sulfate as the determinant of the cell type-dependent specificity of FGFR4 for FGF-1. We then tested whether the specificity of FGFR4 for FGF-1 was mediated by cellular heparan sulfate capable of binding to FGFR4 in the absence of cells and the pericellular matrix. Cell-derived heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) was released into the medium by treatment of cells with trypsin and partially purified by molecular filtration and anion exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of HSPG fractions was assessed by their ability to form a complex with the immobilized FGFR ectodomain after removal of unbound material and then by the ability of the resultant binary complex to bind radiolabeled FGF-1 or FGF-2 (8Kan M.

The activity co-purified with macromolecules metabolically labeled with sodium [35S]sulfate, which ran ahead of the bulk of the protein on gel permeation chromatography (Fig.4 A). Activity and [35S]sulfate also co-purified during ion exchange chromatography slightly behind the main absorption peak at A280 (Fig.4 B). The partially purified fraction was radiolabeled with iodine as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 4 C). On 7.5% gels, about 90% of radiolabeled material failed to penetrate the gel, whereas the rest of the material migrated in a band with mean apparent mass of about 75 (± 10) kDa (Fig. 4 C, left panel). Treatment with heparinase resulted in a broad band of labeled material from 45 to 130 kDa. Treatment with Pronase destroyed 100% of the radiolabeled material. Analysis on 15% gels after treatment with heparinase (Fig.4 C, right panel) revealed that about 70% of the treated material migrated at apparent mass of 35 kDa that ran off the 7.5% gels. Separate experiments not shown here revealed that the FGF complementation activity survived treatment with both Pronase and chondroitinase A, B, C but was destroyed by treatment with heparinase or nitrous acid. Inclusion of 8 m urea in the SDS-PAGE gels did not change the electrophoretic pattern of the indicated bands. The iodinated partially purified heparan sulfate proteoglycan (125I-HSPG) was employed to further characterize direct binding to FGFR. Under FGF binding assay conditions, about 200 pg of the radiolabeled HSPG bound per ng of immobilized FGFR1. One hundred % of the 125I-HSPG that bound to immobilized FGFR1 was displaced by a 100-fold excess of heparin or treatment with 1m NaCl. As reported previously, introduction of FGF into complexes of FGFR and heparin/heparan sulfate increased resistance of the bound heparin/heparan sulfate to displacement with external heparin, but not with 0.5 m NaCl (16McKeehan W.L. Wu X. Jang J.-H. Kan M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 727-730Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Displacement of125I-HSPG bound to FGFR1 or FGFR4 was undetectable by either FGF-1 or FGF-2 at concentrations below 10 ng/ml. This was 2.5 times the standard amount of 125I-FGF used in binding assays and the highest concentration employed in the Scatchard analyses. Concentrations above 50 ng/ml of either FGF-1 or FGF-2 displaced 50% of the bound HSPG. Preliminary affinity chromatography experiments using immobilized FGFR1 columns (see under “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that a maximum of 20% of the125I-HSPG can be retained on FGFR1 or FGFR4 at 0.15m NaCl and that over 90% of the retained material, which elutes at 0.65 m NaCl, is in the high molecular weight fraction shown in Fig. 4 A. Additional experiments using the complementation assay with purified FGFR1 indicated that over 80% of the activity of the partially purified HSPG from HepG2 cells that bound to either FGFR1 or FGFR4 eluted from the immobilized FGFR between 0.25 and 0.65 mNaCl. This represented 7 and 5% of total material bound at 0.15m NaCl to FGFR1 and FGFR4, respectively. About 65% of the FGFR1- or FGFR4-bound material that eluted between 0.25 and 0.65m NaCl bound the other FGFR at 0.25 m NaCl after removal of the elution salt by dialysis. 75–85% of the recovered material bound back onto the homologous FGFR. Of the 0.25–0.65 eluate from FGFR1, 10 and 20% bound immobilized FGF-1 and FGF-2, respectively, at 0.25 m NaCl. About 10 and 46% of the HSPG from a similar eluate from FGFR4 bound FGF-1 and FGF-2, respectively. Of the total 125I-HSPG in the partially purified preparation from HepG2 cells, 2 and 14%, respectively, bound to affinity columns of FGF-1 and FGF-2. Of the fraction that bound to immobilized FGF-1 that was eluted by 1.0 m NaCl, 18 and 14% bound to FGFR1 and FGFR4, respectively, at 0.25 mNaCl. Of th"

The life cycle of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. includes receptor activation, desensitization, sequestration, and either resensitization (recycling) or degradation (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins were initially discovered as molecules that bind to agonist-occupied receptors following receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, thereby interdicting signal transduction to G proteins and causing receptor desensitization (2Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 3Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, however, β-arrestins have been shown to be involved in the internalization and signaling of GPCRs (4Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). For example, they serve as clathrin adaptors, which help to target agonist-occupied GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (5Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). This function is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 at a carboxyl-terminal serine, Ser-412 (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cytosolic β-arrestin1 is constitutively phosphorylated by heretofore unidentified kinase(s) and is rapidly dephosphorylated when it is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to agonist stimulation. Dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 at the plasma membrane is not required for receptor binding and receptor desensitization but is required for its clathrin binding and receptor internalization. The S412A mutant of β-arrestin1, which mimics the dephosphorylated form, has been shown to be more active than wild-type β-arrestin1 in promoting clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor. In contrast, the S412D mutant, which simulates the phosphorylated form of β-arrestin1, acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of receptor endocytosis (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, in addition to regulating the internalization of classical GPCRs, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, β-arrestin1 has been shown to bind to the tyrosine kinase insulin-like growth factor I receptor and mediate its endocytosis in an analogous fashion (7Lin F.-T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have shown that clathrin-mediated internalization is required for mitogenic signaling by various GPCRs and tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (7Lin F.-T. Daaka Y.

Thus, inhibition of clathrin-mediated internalization reduces agonist-induced activation of ERK1 and 2. The Ras-dependent activation of ERKs by GPCRs also requires c-Src (13van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been shown that β-arrestins serve to recruit the activated c-Src to the agonist-occupied β2-adrenergic receptors as well as to target this signaling complex to the clathrin-coated pits for internalization and activation of the ERK cascade (15Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Like clathrin targeting, the recruitment and activation of c-Src kinase is modulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 (15Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The S412D β-arrestin1 mutant, defective in both binding to Src and targeting the receptors to clathrin-coated pits, acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of agonist-induced ERK activation. In contrast, the S412A β-arrestin1 mutant, which binds to Src as well as the wild-type β-arrestin1, is active in promoting agonist-induced ERK phosphorylation. ERK activity appears to be tightly regulated by an activation/inactivation cycle. GPCR-mediated activation of ERKs involves the sequential involvement of components of a Ras activation complex, including c-Src, Shc, Grb2, Gab1, and Sos1, followed by activation of Raf-1 kinase and MEK1 (13van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the inactivation of this cascade is associated with the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP-1) by agonist stimulation (16Charles C.H. Sun H. lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Previous studies also suggest that it may involve the negative feedback phosphorylation of upstream activators, including Sos1, Raf-1 kinase, and MEK1, by the activated ERK (17Profiri E. McCormick F.

Recently ERK has been reported to phosphorylate IRS-1 and reduce its function, thereby inhibiting further insulin signaling (22De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These findings underscore the requirement for stringent control of cellular ERK activity by feedback regulatory mechanisms. Here we demonstrate a novel form of feedback regulation controlling GPCR-mediated activation of ERKs. Once stimulated, the ERKs phosphorylate β-arrestin1 at Ser-412, thereby reducing its endocytic functions and thus ultimately reducing ERK activation. A 1.26-kilobaseKpnI/HindIII fragment encoding (S412D)βarr1-His6 was removed from pBS/(S412D)βarr1-His6 (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

After transfection of pKK/βarr1-His6 or pKK/(S412D)βarr1-His6plasmid into E. coli, expression of the proteins was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. β-Arrestin1 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by Heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described before (6Lin F.-T.

The phosphoproteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and developed by autoradiography. Purified phospho-β-arrestin1 (wild-type or S412D) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). The phospho-β-arrestin1 band was cut out, digested with trypsin in situ, and oxidized in performic acid (23Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Lyophilized peptides were resolved by electrophoresis at pH 3.5 in the first dimension and ascending chromatography in the second dimension as described (24Huganir R.L. Miles K. Greengard P. Proc.

HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptors with or without the expression vectors of β-arrestin and a MEK1 mutant. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol in 0.1 mm ascorbic acid for 30 min before harvesting. The agonist-promoted sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors was determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry as described previously (27Barak L.S. Tiber M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that cytosolic β-arrestin1 is highly phosphorylated and is dephosphorylated only when it is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to agonist stimulation (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The major phosphorylation site is located at the carboxyl-terminal Ser-412, which accounts for 90% of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation. To identify the candidate kinase(s) that phosphorylate β-arrestin1 at Ser-412, we tested the ability of several kinases to phosphorylate β-arrestin1in vitro. Because Ser-412 is followed by a proline residue, a consensus phosphorylation sequence recognized by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family as well as by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), we speculated that these kinases might be potential candidates for mediating Ser-412 phosphorylation. Therefore, equal amounts of wild-type and S412D β-arrestin1 purified from E. coli were subjected to phosphorylation by ERK1, ERK2, or GSK-3in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, wild-type β-arrestin1 was highly phosphorylated by either ERK1 or ERK2. The stoichiometry was ∼0.8 mol of Pi/mol of protein. Mutation of Ser-412 to Asp markedly reduced ERK-mediated β-arrestin1 phosphorylation. Both wild-type and S412D β-arrestin1 were equally but weakly phosphorylated by GSK-3, indicating that GSK-3 is not the kinase responsible for Ser-412 phosphorylation. Next, we compared the two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide map of cellular β-arrestin1 with those of wild-type and S412D β-arrestin1 phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro. As shown in Fig.2 A, the two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of cellular β-arrestin1 purified from HEK 293 cells indicates that it contains three phosphopeptides: a1, a2, and b. The major phosphopeptides, a1 and a2, are partial digestion products (amino acids 401–418 and 398–418) containing Ser-412 (Fig.2 B) as confirmed by amino acid sequencing (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of β-arrestin1 phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro (Fig. 2 C) was identical with the pattern derived from cellular phospho-β-arrestin1. This was further confirmed by the identical map derived from a mixture of equal amounts of cellular phospho-β-arrestin1 and ERK2-phosphorylated β-arrestin1 (data not shown). These two phosphopeptides, a1 and a2, were missing in the map of S412D β-arrestin1 phosphorylated by ERK2 (Fig.2 D). Taken together, our results indicate that ERK is capable of phosphorylating Ser-412 of β-arrestin1. Although β-arrestin1 could be phosphorylated by protein kinases A and C, GRK2, and casein kinase I and II in vitro, in no case did the two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps match those of β-arrestin1 purified from cells (data not shown). Moreover, mutation of Ser-412 to Asp did not reduce in vitro phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 by these kinases, indicating that these kinases are not responsible for Ser-412 phosphorylation. To investigate whether ERK1 and ERK2 mediate β-arrestin1 phosphorylation in cells, we employed a dominant-negative MEK1(K97A) inhibitor (25Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine whether inhibition of ERK activity might affect β-arrestin1 phosphorylation. Overexpression of the MEK1(K97A) mutant in HEK 293 cells significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3,lower panel). This was associated with ∼70% reduction of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, upper panel). Increasing the level of activated ERKs with a constitutively active S218D/S222D mutant of MEK1 (26Huang W. Kessler D.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) did not significantly elevate β-arrestin1 phosphorylation (data not shown), consistent with the high stoichiometry of cellular phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 at Ser-412 (0.85 mol Pi/mol protein) (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that inhibition of ERK activation blocks β-arrestin1 phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells, thus further implicating ERKs as the kinases responsible for phosphorylating β-arrestin1 in cells. Previously we have shown that dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 at the plasma membrane is required for clathrin binding and agonist-induced internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be expected that increasing the level of dephosphorylated β-arrestin1 in cells by inhibiting ERK activation with the dominant-negative MEK1(K97A) mutant would augment its clathrin binding ability and function in receptor internalization. As shown in Fig.4 A, the dominant-negative MEK1(K97A) mutant significantly enhances the co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type β-arrestin1 with clathrin heavy chain. The S412A mutant of β-arrestin1, which mimics the dephosphorylated form of β-arrestin1, also robustly co-immunoprecipitated clathrin (Fig. 4 A). We did not observe any effect of the constitutively active S218D/S222D mutant of MEK1 on clathrin binding of β-arrestin1 (data not shown), presumably because cellular β-arrestin1 is already so highly phosphorylated that we could not detect its binding with clathrin. We further investigated the effect of dominant-negative K97A and constitutively active S218D/S222D mutants of MEK1 on β-arrestin1-mediated sequestration of the β2-adrenergic receptors. In the presence of the MEK1(K97A) mutant, receptor sequestration was increased in control HEK 293 cells. It was further promoted by overexpressing β-arrestin1 (Fig. 4 B), presumably because the level of active, dephosphorylated β-arrestin1 is highly increased by MEK1(K97A) mutant (as it is by S412A β-arrestin1 (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)). In contrast, the constitutively active S218D/S222D mutant of MEK1 slightly reduced receptor sequestration in control cells. This reduction was even more dramatic in cells overexpressing β-arrestin1 where receptor sequestration was now predominantly mediated by transfected β-arrestin1 (in contrast to control cells where both endogenous β-arrestin1 and 2 participate). In such cells, levels of the phosphorylated β-arrestin1 are increased to such high levels by the constitutively active MEK1 mutant that phospho-β-arrestin1 now acts essentially as a dominant-negative inhibitor of receptor internalization (as does S412D β-arrestin1 (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the effect of MEK mutants was specifically due to altered β-arrestin1 function, we also tested their effects on receptor sequestration mediated by β-arrestin2. Interestingly, this enhancement was not significantly affected by either MEK1 mutant in cells overexpressing β-arrestin2 (Fig. 4 B). This result suggests that ERKs can modulate the function of β-arrestin1 but not β-arrestin2. Although β-arrestin2 is also a phosphoprotein in cells (data not shown), it has no site corresponding to Ser-412 of β-arrestin1. This suggests that ERKs are not the kinases that phosphorylate β-arrestin2 in cells. Fig.5 provides a model for the feedback regulation of β-arrestin1 function by ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-412. Cytosolic β-arrestin1, which is predominately phosphorylated at Ser-412 (6Lin F.-T. Krueger K.K. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), is recruited to the plasma membrane upon agonist stimulation. Membrane-bound β-arrestin1 is dephosphorylated by as yet unknown phosphatases. Although dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 is not required for its receptor binding, it is required for several of its other functions including Src recruitment (15Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These events in turn are necessary for GPCR-mediated activation of the Ras-dependent ERK pathway (13van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Once activated, the ERKs are able to phosphorylate β-arrestin1 at Ser-412, thereby reducing these functions and, in a feedback regulatory fashion, reducing further ERK signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2169898991,"Space travel causes rapid and pronounced skeletal muscle wasting in humans that reduces their long-term flight capabilities. To develop effective countermeasures, the basis of this atrophy needs to be better understood. Space travel may cause muscle atrophy indirectly by altering circulating levels of factors such as growth hormone, glucocorticoids, and anabolic steroids and/or by a direct effect on the muscle fibers themselves. To determine whether skeletal muscle cells are directly affected by space travel, tissue-cultured avian skeletal muscle cells were tissue engineered into bioartificial muscles and flown in perfusion bioreactors for 9 to 10 days aboard the Space Transportation System (STS, i.e., Space Shuttle). Significant muscle fiber atrophy occurred due to a decrease in protein synthesis rates without alterations in protein degradation. Return of the muscle cells to Earth stimulated protein synthesis rates of both muscle-specific and extracellular matrix proteins relative to ground controls. These results show for the first time that skeletal muscle fibers are directly responsive to space travel and should be a target for countermeasure development."

https://openalex.org/W2152433582,"Mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene have been identified in several types of human cancers and cancer cell lines, including brain, endometrial, prostate, breast, thyroid, and melanoma. In this study, we screened a total of 96 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from Taiwan, where HCC is the leading cancer in males and third leading cancer in females, for mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. Complete sequence analysis of these samples demonstrated a missense mutation in exon 5 (K144I) and exon 7 (V255A) from HCC samples B6-21 and B6-2, respectively. A putative splice site mutation was also detected in intron 3 from sample B6-2. Both B6-21 and B6-2 were previously shown to contain missense mutations in the coding sequences of the p53 gene. Functional studies with the two missense mutations demonstrated that while mutation V255A in exon 7 resulted in a loss of phosphatase activity, mutation K144I in exon 5 retained its phosphatase activity. Additionally, we identified a silent mutation (P96P) in exon 5 of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene from HCC sample B6-22. These data provide the first evidence that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene is mutated in a subset of HCC samples."

https://openalex.org/W2327174419,"DNA-PK is a nuclear, serine/threonine protein kinase required for repairing DNA double-strand breaks and for V(D)J recombination. To determine the distribution of DNA-PK in human tissues, we assayed paraffin-embedded sections of normal and cancerous tissues for DNA-PKcs and Ku80 by immunohistochemistry. We also assayed for Brca2, a human tumor suppressor gene that is implicated in the repair of DNA strand-breaks. Brca2 was strongly expressed in epithelial cells of the breast, endometrium, and thymus, in tingible body macrophages of follicular germinal centers of lymphoid tissue, and in reticuloendothelial cells in the spleen. DNA-PKcs and Ku80 expression was usually parallel, but both were expressed in a highly cell- and tissue-specific manner. The highest levels were observed in spermatogenic cells (but not in spermatozoa), and in neurons and glial cells of the central and autonomic nervous system. Neither protein was consistently expressed in liver nor in resting mammary epithelium, but lactating breast epithelium was strongly positive for DNA-PKcs and Ku80. In contrast to established human cell cultures, expression between cells in the same tissue was highly selective in the epidermis, exocrine pancreas, renal glomeruli, the red pulp of the spleen, and within cellular compartments of tonsils, lymph nodes, and thymus. Most cancerous tissues were consistently positive for DNA-PKcs and Ku80, except invasive carcinoma of the breast. DNA-PKcs, Ku80, and Ku70 mRNAs were expressed in all normal tissues with relatively little variation in levels. Our results suggest that the apparent absence of DNA-PKcs and Ku80 from some cells or tissues is a consequence of post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W2046879173,"We recently identified DPC4/Smad4 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene mutated or lost in one half of pancreatic carcinomas and in a subset of colon and biliary tract carcinomas. DPC4 plays a key role in signal transduction of the TGF-β superfamily of molecules and inactivation of TGF-β mediated growth inhibition is supposed to be the driving force for DPC4 inactivation in human tumors. However, DPC4 mediated tumor suppression by reconstitution of defective cells has not yet been reported. Here we show suppression of tumorigenicity in nude mice by stable reexpression of DPC4 in SW480 colon carcinoma cells. In vitro growth of DPC4-transfected cells was not affected and resistance towards TGF-β mediated growth inhibition was retained. Instead, cells exhibited morphological alterations and adhesion and spreading were accelerated. These phenotypic changes were associated with reduced expression levels of the endogenous urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) genes, the products of which are implicated in the control of cell adhesion and invasion. In patients, high expression levels of uPA and PAI-1 correlate with poor prognosis. Thus, reduced expression of uPA and PAI-1 is consistent with suppression of tumorigenicity in DPC4 reconstituted cells. These results demonstrate DPC4's tumor suppressive function and suggest a potential role for DPC4 as a modulator of cell adhesion and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1921970975,"DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) is the most inaccurate of the six DNA polymerases found in mammalian cells. In a normal situation, it is expressed at a constant low level and its role is believed to be restricted to repair synthesis in the base excision repair pathway participating to the genome stability. However, excess of Pol beta, found in some human tumors, could confer an increase in spontaneous mutagenesis and result in a highly mutagenic tolerance phenotype toward bifunctional DNA cross-linking anticancer drugs. Here, we present a hypothesis on the mechanisms used by Pol beta to be a genetic instability enhancer through its overexpression. We hypothesize that an excess of Pol beta perturbs the well-defined specific functions of DNA polymerases developed by the cell and propose Pol beta-mediated gap fillings during DNA transactions like repair, replication, or recombination pathways as key processes to introduce illegitimate deoxyribonucleotides or mutagenic base analogs like those produced by intracellular oxidative processes. These mechanisms may predominate during cellular nonproliferative phases in the absence of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1541930605,"There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the former, leads to many biochemical changes and is an important contributing factor in several human chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, mutagenesis and cancer, several neurodegenerative disorders, and likely the aging process per se. For example, we know that lipid peroxidation products and oxidized forms of low density lipoproteins accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions, and that numerous modified DNA bases are formed under conditions of oxidative stress and are highly mutagenic, such as 8-oxo-guanine. For many of these oxidatively modified biomolecules, there are repair enzymes, including numerous peroxidases that reduce lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and glycosylases that remove specific DNA lesions. In addition to repairing oxidatively damaged biomolecules, another layer of defense against oxidative stress and resultant damage is to prevent formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species or to scavenge these species before they can cause oxidative damage to biomolecules. Among these defenses are antioxidant enzymes, which are mostly intracellular and include several forms of superoxide dismutases and catalase. The antioxidant enzymes are complemented by small-molecule antioxidants, some of which are derived exclusively from the diet and are vitamins. These small-molecule antioxidants are present extra-and intracellularly, and include ascorbic acid (vitamin C), glutathione (GSH), and tocopherols (primarily α-tocopherol; vitamin E). Intracellular concentrations of these compounds can be substantial, i.e., in the millimolar range both for ascorbate and GSH. α-Tocopherol is by far the most abundant lipid-soluble antioxidant in humans, present in cellular and subcellular membranes and lipoproteins. The mechanisms by which these antioxidants act at the molecular and cellular level include roles in gene expression and regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Thus, antioxidants are involved in fundamental metabolic and homeostatic processes. However, there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the basic mechanisms of oxidative damage and antioxidant defenses. Filling these gaps would allow us to more specifically target treatments and derive optimal benefits from antioxidants for health promotion and disease prevention. Therefore, in August of 1998, 37 national and international experts in free radical and antioxidant (bio)chemistry and cell biology met in Copper Mountain, Colo., to present their latest findings to ∼150 participants at a FASEB summer research conference entitled “Molecular and Biological Mechanisms of Antioxidant Action.” This conference presented a contemporary view of the mechanisms of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA and the molecular, biochemical, and physiological action of antioxidants and their role in cell biology, with a focus on small molecule antioxidants. The sessions covered the following topics: molecular mechanisms of oxidative damage; vitamin C, vitamin E, and GSH: metabolism, antioxidant (inter)actions, and pro-oxidant vs. antioxidant effects; novel aspects of vitamin E metabolism and action; nitric oxide and radical-mediated toxicity; and (anti)oxidant regulation of gene expression: transcription factors, nuclear response elements, and apoptotic cell death. This and the July issue of The FASEB Journal contain several articles selected from each of these sessions and written by the speakers. The purpose of these reviews is to provide in-depth coverage of each topic, with emphasis on the most groundbreaking developments. Thus, in this issue, Keaney et al. (1) discuss the role of vitamin E as a protein kinase C inhibitor in improving the biological activity of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and limiting platelet aggregation and monocyte adhesion; Stocker's group (2) explains the novel concept of tocopherol-mediated lipid peroxidation in lipoproteins and the conditions under which α-tocopherol acts as an antioxidant or a pro-oxidant; May (3) discusses the mechanisms of cellular ascorbate recycling and a transmembrane, ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase activity; and Carr and I (4) review the mechanisms by which vitamin C may act as a pro-oxidant and the evidence in support of or against a role of vitamin C in causing oxidative damage to biomolecules under physiological conditions. In the July issue of the journal, articles will address the current concepts and controversies of hepatic GSH synthesis; provide new insights into the metabolism and function of vitamin E; focus on the mechanisms of oxidative damage to biomolecules, including lipid peroxidation and isolevuglandin formation, protein oxidation and its role in atherogenic low density lipoprotein modification, and the intriguing link between nitric oxide and the cyclooxygenases; and, finally, discuss the role of oxidants and antioxidants in signaling mechanisms in apoptosis and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB.

I am grateful to my co-chair, Maret Traber, from the Linus Pauling Institute, the vice chairs Lester Packer and Steven Tannenbaum, to all who participated as speakers at the conference, and the authors and reviewers of the articles.

https://openalex.org/W1629553314,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelium-specific secreted protein that induces vasodilation and increases endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO). NO is also reported to modulate leukocyte–endothelium interaction. Therefore, we hypothesized that VEGF might inhibit leukocyte–endothelium interaction via increased release of NO from the vascular endothelium. We used intravital microscopy of the rat mesenteric microcirculation to measure leukocyte–endothelium interactions 2, 4, and 24 h after systemic administration of VEGF to the rat (120 µg/kg, i.v., bolus). Superfusion of the rat mesentery with either 0.5 U/ml thrombin or 50 µM L-NAME consistently increased the number of rolling, adhering, and transmigrated leukocytes (P<0.01 vs. control mesenteries superfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer). At 4 and 24 h posttreatment, VEGF significantly attenuated thrombin-induced and L-NAME-induced leukocyte rolling, adherence, and transmigration in rat mesenteric venules. In addition, adherence of isolated rat PMNs to thrombin-stimulated mesenteric artery segments in vitro was significantly reduced in mesenteric arteries isolated from VEGF-treated rats (P<0.001 vs. control rats). Direct measurement of NO demonstrated a threefold increase in basal NO release from aortic tissue of rats injected with VEGF, at 4 and 24 h posttreatment (P<0.01 vs. aortic tissue from control rats). Finally, systemic administration of VEGF to ecNOS-deficient mice failed to inhibit leukocyte–endothelium interactions observed in peri-intestinal venules. We concluded that VEGF is a potent inhibitor of leukocyte–endothelium interaction, and this effect is specifically correlated to augmentation of NO release from the vascular endothelium.—Scalia, R., Booth, G., Lefer, D.

https://openalex.org/W2062266687,"We report the molecular cloning in Rattus norvegicus of a novel mammalian enzyme (RnPIP), which shows both 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) phosphatase and inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase activities.

The phosphatase activity is strictly dependent on Mg2+, and it is inhibited by Ca2+ and Li+ ions. Lithium chloride inhibits the hydrolysis of both PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate at submillimolar concentration; therefore, it is possible that the inhibition of the human homologue of RnPIP by lithium ions is related to the pharmacological action of lithium.

The sulfation reactions in mammals affect many different physiological processes, including deactivation and bioactivation of xenobiotics, inactivation of hormones and catecholamines, structure and function of macromolecules, and elimination of end products of catabolism (1Klaassen C.D. Boles J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Sulfation involves the transfer of a sulfate group from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; EST, expressed sequence tag. to an acceptor molecule in a reaction that is catalyzed by a family of sulfotransferase enzymes (2Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Usually, the obligate co-substrate PAPS donates its sulfuryl group to a functional hydroxyl group: PAPS + R-OH → PAP + R-OSO3−. The products are a sulfoconjugate (R-OSO3−) and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP). PAP is an inhibitory end product in any sulfation reaction because it acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to PAPS (3Roth J.A. Rivett A.J. Renskers K.J. Mulder G.J. Caldwell J. Van Kempen G.M.J. Vonk R.J. Sulfate Metabolism and Sulfate Conjugation. Taylor and Francis, London1982: 107-114Google Scholar). For instance, the M and P forms of human phenolsulfotransferases are potently inhibited by PAP, exhibiting a K i value of approximately 0.1 μm (4Rens-Domiano S.S. Roth J.A. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, a toxic effect of PAP on RNA processing enzymes (5′ → 3′ exoribonucleases) has been recently described in yeast (5Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This effect might be attributed to the fact that PAP mimics the monomers of a polyribonucleotide chain and consequently, it might prevent the attack to the phosphodiester bond of RNA processing enzymes. These 5′ → 3′ exoribonucleases are highly conserved in evolution (5Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), therefore it is very likely that PAP accumulation in mammals has similar inhibitory effects on RNA processing, leading to aberrant changes in the pattern of gene expression. Consequently, a rapid removal of PAP is required both to maintain the activity of sulfotransferase enzymes and to prevent the accumulation of PAP to levels that could be inhibitory for RNA processing enzymes. Thus, it is reasonable to predict the existence in mammals of hydrolytic enzymes, such as PAP phosphatases, which could rapidly recycle PAP to AMP and inorganic phosphate. Indeed, a preliminary characterization of a 3′,5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase purified from guinea pig liver has been reported (6Ramaswamy S.G. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10044-10047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this enzyme showed a very poor affinity for PAP (K m 3 mm). No clear role for this enzymatic activity nor molecular data of the corresponding gene have been reported. In this work, we present for the first time the molecular cloning of a mammalian PAP phosphatase. The enzyme was cloned by functional complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hal2 mutant. Hal2 is a 3′,5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase that specifically hydrolyzes the 3′-phosphate from PAP (7Glaser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin K.Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), thereby preventing the accumulation of PAP. In yeast, PAP is generated as a side product of PAPS reductase, which is a key enzyme in the sulfate assimilation pathway that leads to the synthesis of methionine. PAP accumulation has deleterious effects on the cell because it inhibits PAPS reductase (9Schwenn J.D. Krone F.A. Husmann K. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and hence methionine biosynthesis, and RNA processing enzymes (5Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The PAP phosphatase activity of Hal2 is crucial for the function of PAPS reductase, which is reflected in the fact that hal2 cells are auxotrophic for methionine (7Glaser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin K.Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Thomas D. Barbey R. Henry D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this phenotype to clone the first mammalian PAP phosphatase by functional complementation of the auxotrophy for methionine of hal2cells. Interestingly, the mammalian PAP phosphatase has a dual enzymatic activity, as it is also active as inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase. All nonradioactive organic compounds were obtained from Sigma. Radioactive compounds were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PAPS (Sigma) is supplied with 4 mol of lithium/mol of PAPS. Given the instability of this compound, removal of lithium is not recommended. [35S]PAPS (NEN Life Science Products) is obtained as the triethylammonium salt. Therefore, [35S]PAPS was the substrate employed to assay the activity of RnPIP against this compound. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used in this study was JRM4 (MATaleu2–3, 112 ura3–251,328,372 hal2::LEU2), kindly provided by Dr. J. R. Murguia (Universidad Politécnica, Valencia, Spain). Complementation of the auxotrophy for methionine of the hal2 mutant was assayed in minimal synthetic glucose medium (SD), 2% glucose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 50 mm succinic acid adjusted to pH 5 with Tris. When indicated, the SD medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml methionine to give SDM medium. The yeast strain JRM4 was transformed with a Rattus norvegicus heart cDNA library constructed in the pFL61 vector (11Lesage F. Hugnot J.P. Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3685-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a yeast expression vector where expression of the rat cDNA is driven by the constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. Transformants were first selected by uracil prototrophy in SDM. 105 primary transformants were obtained and pooled together. To select clones with the ability to complement the auxotrophy for methionine of the hal2 mutant, the primary transformants were spread on minimal medium lacking methionine. Four clones (pFL61-PIP) were obtained that complemented the auxotrophy for methionine of the hal2 mutant. The yeast shuttling plasmid was recovered by electroporation of Escherichia coli WM1100 cells. Partial sequencing and restriction analysis of the plasmids recovered from the E. coli transformants showed that all of them represented the same cDNA. The coding region of RnPIP was PCR-amplified from pFL61-PIP using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primers (XhoI site underlined): upstream, 5′-CCCCTCGAGATGGCTTCCAGC; downstream, 5′-CCCCTCGAGCCCCTTCAGGGAATGAG. The PCR-amplified product was subcloned into the pT7-Blue vector (Novagen) to give pT7-PIP. The PIP open reading frame was released with XhoI and subcloned into the XhoI site of pGEX-KG (12Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), thus generating a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and PIP. The pGEX-KG-PIP construct was verified by sequencing with an ABI 377 automatic sequencer, and it was introduced into E. coli DH5α cells. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside for a period of 1 h at 30 °C, and the GST fusion protein was affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as indicated by the suppliers. The pGEX-KG-PIP construct contains a thrombin cleavage site and a poly-glycine spacer between the GST and the RnPIP moieties (12Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Thus, specific proteolysis of the fusion protein could be achieved by thrombin cleavage. The resulting RnPIP protein behaves identically to the GST fusion protein in the biochemical assays we have performed. PAP phosphatase and inositol-polyphosphate 1phosphatase activities were assayed by one of the two following methods (8Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphatase activity was routinely assayed (assay 1) in a 100-μl mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and the indicated amount of GST fusion protein and substrate. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the inorganic phosphate released was quantified by the malachite green method as described previously (13Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the enzyme activity was linear with protein quantity (up to 5 μg) and reaction time (up to 1 h). The concentration of either Ca2+ or Li+ that decreased the activity of the enzyme by 50% relative to a reaction without these cations (IC50) was estimated at a substrate concentration of 0.2 mm. Assay 2 is described next, and it involved a HPLC analysis of the reaction products. The products were detected either by ultraviolet-absorption (8Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or, in the case of radioactively labeled substrates, by coupling the HPLC device to a RadioFlow detector LB509 (EGG Berthold). The conditions for the HPLC analysis of the hydrolysis of PAP and PAPS have been described previously (8Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To improve the resolution of the analysis of PAPS hydrolysis, the mobile phase was 3% methanol instead of 4%. Inositol-1,4-bisphosphate hydrolysis was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 0.2 m potassium Bicine (pH 8.0), 1 mm Mg2+, and 10 μm[3H]inositol-1,4-bisphosphate (10 Ci/mmol). At the indicated time, 10 μl of reaction mixture were injected into a 4.6 × 10-mm Guard Cartridge 10-μm SAX column linked to a 4.6 × 250-mm Partisil 10-μm SAX column (pS Phase Sep), equilibrated in Milli-Q water, and maintained at 22 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Inositol phosphates were eluted with a linear gradient of (NH4)H2PO4, pH 3.7, according to Jenkinson (14Jenkinson S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 41: 151-165PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]PAPS, [35S]adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, and [3H]inositol phosphates were detected with a RadioFlow detector LB509 (EGG Berthold) using Optiflow as scintillation mixture at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. To explore the presence in animals of PAP hydrolytic enzymes, a screening was conducted for mammalian genes that complement the auxotrophy for methionine of the yeast hal2mutant. A rat cDNA library was constitutively expressed inhal2 cells, and as a result, a cDNA was identified that complemented the auxotrophy for methionine. Sequencing of this cDNA reveals a 927-base pair open reading frame that putatively encodes a protein of 308-amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 33.2 kDa (Fig. 1). The cDNA has 27 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence and 961 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region. The protein encoded by this gene, named RnPIP, complements the auxotrophy for methionine of hal2 cells to the same extent as Hal2, as demonstrated by the similar growth rates in methionine-free minimal medium of hal2 cells transformed with RnPIP or ScHAL2 (data not shown). A commercially available genomic DNA blot was used to analyze the presence of RnPIPin the rat genome as well as in other eukaryotic species (Fig.2 A). A major EcoRI hybridization band of approximately 4.0 kilobase pairs was detected in the rat genome. Other bands of lower intensity were also detected, suggesting that additional sequences related to RnPIP are present in the rat genome. Hybridization bands were also detected in the genome of mouse, dog, cow, rabbit, and chicken. Data base searches in the human nucleotide data base reveal the presence of human genes with high sequence similarity to RnPIP (see below). A rat multiple tissue Northern blot containing poly(A)+ RNA was used to examine the transcript level of the RnPIP gene in different tissues (Fig. 2 B). The RnPIP mRNA was detected in all the tissues examined. The transcript level was especially high in heart, brain, and kidney. The size of the mRNA fits well with the length of the cDNA sequence reported above. The RnPIP protein was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. Following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside, the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose resin. The phosphatase activity of the purified protein with respect to different substrates is summarized in TableI. PAP was the preferred substrate for RnPIP. The K m value for PAP hydrolysis was too low to be determined with the standard colorimetric assay (13Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) or even using the HPLC-based method where the products are detected by ultraviolet absorption (8Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The detection limit of the HPLC analysis for PAP hydrolysis is approximately 2 μm, therefore theK m for PAP must be below 2 μm. PAPS was used as substrate with a 50% efficiency as compared with PAP. No appreciable activity was observed against AMP, 3′-AMP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, or pNPP. Interestingly, inositol-1,4-bisphosphate also served as a substrate for the enzyme, although with a 45% efficiency as compared with PAP. In addition, RnPIP hydrolyzed inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate but not inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate or inositol monophosphate. Therefore, besides the preferred PAP, RnPIP hydrolyzes the typical substrates of inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (15Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).Table ISubstrate specificity of the RnPIP enzymeSubstratesRnPIP3′-PAP1002′-PAP33PAPSaPAPS (Sigma) is supplied with 4 mol of lithium/mol of PAPS.

Standard deviations were less than 5%. To determine the position of the phosphate liberated from PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate, we have analyzed by HPLC the reaction products of either PAP or inositol-1,4-bisphosphate hydrolysis (Fig.3). RnPIP converts 3′-PAP to AMP by hydrolysis of the 3′-phosphate (Fig. 3 A). The 2′-phosphate from 2′-PAP was also hydrolyzed by the enzyme, although with a lower efficiency. In this respect, RnPIP qualifies as a 3′(2′), 5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase. Inositol-1,4-bisphosphate was converted to inositol-4-phosphate (Fig. 3 B), therefore RnPIP catalyzes the removal of the 1′-phosphate, as inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase does. The sensitivity limit of the colorimetric assay for determination of inorganic phosphate prevents the determination of K m values in the low micromolar range. Fortunately, the above described HPLC analysis, together with the availability of [3H]inositol-1,4-bisphosphate and [35S]PAPS, made it possible to determine theK m values for these substrates (TableII). The apparent K mfor inositol-1,4-bisphosphate was 0.2 μm ± 0.1. TheK m for PAP could not be accurately determined, as radioactively labeled PAP is not available. [35S]PAPS is commercially available and RnPIP hydrolyzes the 3′-phosphate of PAPS with a 50% efficiency as compared with PAP, generating [35S]adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (Table II). Therefore, although PAPS is not likely a physiological substrate for animal PAP phosphatases (16Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we have also determined the K mvalue for PAPS. The apparent K m for [35S]PAPS was 1.2 μm ± 0.3.Table IIKm and Vmax values for PAP, PAPS, and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate hydrolysisSubstratesK mV maxμmμmol Pi × min −1 × mg −1PAP<20.8PAPS1.2 ± 0.30.4Inositol-1,4-bisphosphate0.2 ± 0.10.38Inositol-1,4-bisphosphate and PAPS hydrolysis were assayed in a reaction mixture containing 0.2 m potassium Bicine (pH 8.0), 1 mm Mg2+, and different concentrations of [3H]inositol-1,4-bisphosphate (10 Ci/mmol) or [35S]PAPS (1–3 Ci/mmol), respectively.

The reaction products were analysed by HPLC and detected with a RadioFlow detector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction product of either [3H]inositol-1,4-bisphosphate or [35S]PAPS hydrolysis is [3H]inositol-4-phosphate or [35S]adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, respectively. The estimation of the K m value for PAP is described in the text. The V max values are equivalent to the data presented in Table I.

The results are the average of two independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Hal2 and inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase belong to a family of magnesium-dependent, lithium-sensitive phosphatases (17York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the phosphatase activity of RnPIP was strictly Mg2+-dependent, with an optimal concentration of 1 mm (data not shown). Ca2+ inhibited the phosphatase activity of RnPIP (Fig.4 A) (20 μmCaCl2 for 50% inhibition at 0.2 mm PAP), probably because of competition for Mg2+, as the inhibition was abolished by increasing the Mg2+ concentration (data not shown). RnPIP was not affected by high Na+concentrations, whereas it was very sensitive to Li+ (0.8 mm LiCl for 50% inhibition at 0.2 mm PAP) (Fig. 4 B). The effect of Li+ on this enzyme is unique among the group of monovalent cations (data not shown). Biochemical characterization of the RnPIP protein shows that it is a dual enzyme that hydrolyzes both PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate. The V max value for PAP hydrolysis was approximately 2-fold higher than for inositol-1,4-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Although the K m for PAP could not be accurately determined (<2 μm), we could determine theK m for the closely related substrate PAPS (1.2 μm) and for inositol-1,4-bisphosphate (0.2 μm), indicating a high affinity for these substrates. The enzyme is very sensitive to Li+ and, therefore, RnPIP is the fourth animal enzyme that is inhibited by Li+ ions in the therapeutic range, the other three being inositol monophosphate phosphatase (18Hallcher L.M. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10896-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (15Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (19Marcus F. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2481-2486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RnPIP is the first PAP phosphatase characterized at the molecular level in mammals, and a human homologue of RnPIP can be identified in the human data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (Fig. 5). We predict that the human homologue of RnPIP will show a similar sensitivity to Li+ ions. Consequently, it might represent another target in lithium therapy, and the inhibition by lithium of the human enzyme could also contribute to the therapeutic or toxic effects of Li+ treatment. In addition to PAP phosphatase, RnPIP also qualifies as inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase. A precedent for this sort of dual enzymatic activity is found in plants (20Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar). The SAL1 enzyme ofArabidopsis thaliana exhibits both PAP phosphatase and inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase activities. However, the hydrolysis of inositol-1,4-bisphosphate proceeds with a 34% efficiency as compared with PAP. Furthermore, the K m value for inositol-1,4-bisphosphate was much higher (90 μm) than the K m value for PAP (2 to 10 μm). In contrast, RnPIP hydrolyzes both PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate with very high affinities. However, some features clearly distinguish the RnPIP enzyme from the canonical inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (15Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). First, RnPIP hydrolyzes both PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate, whereas PAP hydrolysis by inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase has not been reported. Second, bovine inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase fails to complement the yeast hal2 mutant (data not shown). Finally, amino acid sequence comparison also reflects a clear difference between RnPIP and inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (Fig.6). RnPIP is only 27% identical to bovine inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, whereas the mouse inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase is 85% identical to bovine inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the sequence identity of RnPIP to non-animal PAP phosphatases is also low (25–30%) (Fig. 6). Instead, ESTs of proteins with unidentified function, which show high identity (60–90%) to RnPIP, are present in mouse, pig, fruit fly, and man (Fig. 6). For instance, comparison of human ESTs corresponding either to the N or the C terminus of RnPIP reveals 85–90% amino acid sequence identity to the respective part of RnPIP (Fig. 5). These data, taken together with the biochemical characterization of the protein, indicate that RnPIP is a novel mammalian enzyme, which probably represents the first member of an animal gene family of dual enzymes (Fig. 6). In summary, we propose that the PAP phosphatase activity of RnPIP, by preventing accumulation of PAP, is necessary to maintain active sulfotransferase (6Ramaswamy S.G. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10044-10047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Brunngraber E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 472-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RNA processing enzymes (5Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). RNA processing is crucial in cell metabolism. The importance of sulfation in animals is illustrated by the phenotype of brachymorphic mice, which have abnormal hepatic detoxification, bleeding times, and postnatal growth (22Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger Jr., R.C. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This phenotype is because of a missense mutation inSK2 (sulfurylase kinase 2) (22Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger Jr., R.C. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a member of the gene family encoding the bifunctional enzymes that synthesize the universal sulfate donor, PAPS. In addition, the inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase activity of RnPIP could play a role in the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway. Finally, the unexpected connection between PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate metabolism remains to be investigated."

We therefore studied the role of different matrix proteins, in particular laminin I, on a shear stress-dependent endothelial response, namely nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. Primary porcine aortic endothelial cells were seeded onto glass plates either noncoated (NC cells) or precoated with fibronectin (FN cells), laminin (LN cells), or collagen I (CN cells). Western blots were used to detect differences in the final matrix composition of these cells. A shear stress of 16 dyn/cm2 was applied for 6 h. Only LN cells showed detectable amounts of laminin I in their underlying matrix when they reached confluence. They reacted with a 2-fold increase of eNOS expression (n = 16, p < 0.001) to the exposure of shear stress, which went along with enhanced eNOS protein and NO release. In contrast, neither FN cells (n = 9) nor NC cells (n = 13) showed a significant increase of eNOS expression under shear stress. The increase in CN cells was borderline (1.4-fold; n = 9,p < 0.05) and was not associated with an increase of eNOS protein. The shear-induced increase in eNOS expression of LN cells was abolished by the peptide YIGSR, which blocks the cellular binding to laminin I via a 67-kDa laminin-binding protein, whereas a control peptide (YIGSK) had no effect. The induction of eNOS expression by shear stress is stimulated by an interaction of endothelial cells with laminin which is, at least in part, mediated by a 67-kDa laminin-binding protein.

Shear stress, elicited by blood flow, represents an important signal for endothelial cells to synthesize vasoactive autacoids. In addition to an acute increased autacoid production there are also chronic effects of shear stress. One such effect is the differential expression of some proteins in endothelial cells (1Resnick N.

To date, our knowledge of the exact signal transduction cascade from the stimulus (shear stress) to the effect (gene expression) still remains incomplete.

Indeed, focal adhesion points change dynamically in endothelial cells under shear stress (19Davies P.F. Robotewskyj A. Griem M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These focal adhesion points represent not only the connection between matrix and cell membrane but also are colocated in a number of regulated kinase activities in these sites, which may be involved in the translation and transduction of extracellular signals across the cell membrane (20Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). If such focal adhesion complexes are active as a link between the shear stress and subsequent gene expression, the protein composition of the extracellular matrix should play a very important role.Among these matrix proteins, laminins represent the major glycoprotein family in all basement membranes and as such are of particular interest. In addition, the cellular laminin secretion under shear stress appears to be up-regulated, whereas fibronectin seems to be down-regulated (21Gupte A. Frangos J.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Thoumine O. Nerem R.M. Girard P.R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 565-576PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kolpakov V. Rekhter M.D. Gordon D.

Previous studies have shown that members of the laminin family specifically promote cell growth, differentiation, and migration (24Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data support that part of these effects are dependent on a so-called “laminin-binding protein” (LBP) of 67 kDa in size (25Menard S. Castronovo V. Tagliabue E. Sobel M.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This 67-kDa LBP was identified to bind highly selectively to a certain sequence of the laminin β1 chain, namely YIGSR, and to promote cell attachment as well as migration (26Iwamoto Y. Robey F.A.

Res. 1994; 74: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar).Some groups observed an increase of eNOS expression in cells being cultured on non-laminin matrices (3Xiao Z.H. Zhang Z. Diamond S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Topper J.N. Cai J.X. Falb D. Gimbrone M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This is in apparent contrast to our results because cultivating cells on fibronectin or pure glass abolished the shear stress sensitivity in terms of eNOS expression. This discrepancy may be explained by variations in the ability of the cells to produce endogenous laminin. Our observation that cells taken from the same pool produced high amounts of laminin I when grown on plastic (irrespective of the coating) but not when cultivated on glass plates, except when the glass plates were precoated by laminin, supports the explanation above. Indeed, our Western blot data suggest a laminin I-induced laminin production under these conditions.Therefore, by cultivating endothelial cells on glass plates, a specific role of laminin I could be detected when compared with other matrix proteins. This is not an effect of laminin I alone because the addition of laminin I to the superfusate did not change the eNOS expression in control cells kept under static conditions (data not shown). Only in combination with shear stress was there an effect (a 2-fold increase of eNOS expression). Interestingly, it has been reported that endothelial cells under chronic shear stress produce more laminin at the expense of fibronectin (21Gupte A. Frangos J.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Thoumine O. Nerem R.M. Girard P.R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 565-576PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, laminin expression correlates with endothelial cell differentiation during angiogenesis (24Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jiang B. Liou G.I. Behzadian M.A. Caldwell R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2499-2508PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sorokin L.M. Pausch F. Durbeej M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dynam. 1997; 210: 446-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is circumstantial evidence that eNOS expression also correlates with endothelial cell differentiation (34Babaei S. Teichert-Kuliszeaska K. Monge J.C. Mohamed F. Bendeck M.P. Stewart D.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Binding of the cell to laminin I occurs not only via integrins, especially those consisting of a β1- and one of several α-chains but also by a 67-kDa LBP (25Menard S. Castronovo V. Tagliabue E. Sobel M.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Iwamoto Y. Robey F.A. Graf J. Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. Martin G.R. Science. 1987; 238: 1132-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 27Graf J. Ogle R.C. Robey F.A. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). LBP was constitutively expressed, regardless of the underlying matrix, which may reflect its potential significance in mediating effects of matrix proteins on cell signaling. The presence of a functioning LBP at the membrane level was assessed indirectly by testing the adherence of freshly dispersed cells to a laminin matrix. High concentrations of the inhibitor of LBP binding, YIGSR (see below), reduced the adherence and led to an extensive detachment of freshly attached cells under shear stress. This may be the result of the lack of other attachment substrates. After 2–3 days in culture and using much less peptide, this shear-induced detachment was not observed, indicating that binding sites other than LBP are more important for permanent attachment and firm cell adherence. These hypothesis is supported by macroscopic inspection of the matrix protein compositions. The Coomassie-stained protein gels showed no obvious differences among the various pretreatments of the culture plates. However, when probed in Western blots there was a clear distinction between the laminin coating and collagen and fibronectin coating. This suggests that the role of LBP is not primarily in cell adhesion but perhaps in sensing external signals applied to the cell.Even after several days in culture, the laminin I-dependent eNOS expression could still be inhibited by the addition of YIGSR, a peptide deduced from the LBP binding site (27Graf J. Ogle R.C. Robey F.A. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) on the laminin I molecule. When applied in high concentrations, this peptide was shown to attenuate tumor invasion and vasculogenesis (35Mecham R.P. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in vivo, therefore suggesting a role for this protein in development and under pathophysiologic conditions. In the present experiments, a much smaller concentration of this peptide inhibited the eNOS induction on transcriptional and translational level completely. This inhibition was highly specific because the nearly identical control peptide had no effect. The central role of LBP in mediating the shear stress response is supported further by preliminary experiments using the laminin fragments P1 and E8 for coating the glass plates. Like intact laminin, the P1 fragment also resulted in a shear stress-induced increase of eNOS expression. Fragment P1 represents the “upper” part of the cross-shaped laminin molecule containing the YIGSR binding site (36Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast, coating with the fragment E8 of laminin, which represents the large stem of the protein that does not contain the binding site for LBP (36Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), led to a loss of the shear stress sensitivity of the cells in terms of eNOS expression.The mechanism by which LBP translates shear stress into gene expression is not yet clear. Massia et al. (37Massia S.P. Rao S.S. Hubbell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8053-8059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed the colocalization of the 67-kDa LBP with stress fibers of the cytoskeleton and, furthermore, with part of the focal adhesion kinase complex, α-actinin and vinculin. This colocalization suggests that LBP is involved in signaling processes located in focal adhesion points. In this context, it should be emphasized that shear stress induces a very dynamic change of focal adhesion points soon after initiation of shear stress (14Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar). Our results do not exclude that additional membrane structures are involved in the signal transduction process. This could explain why there was a small but significant increase of eNOS expression also on a collagen I matrix, although we did not find a corresponding translation to eNOS protein. Recently, Ardini et al. (38Ardini E. Tagliabue E. Magnifico A. Buto S. Castronovo V. Colnaghi M.I. Menard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2342-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as Halatsch et al. (39Halatsch M.E. Hirsch-Ernst K.I. Kahl G.F. Weinel R.J. Cancer Lett. 1997; 118: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), described a close coregulation and physical association of the 67-kDa LBP and the integrin α6β4 in the human carcinoma cell line A43. This very close association of the different receptors, possibly created by binding to the same laminin molecule, could be a crucial step in the translation of the signal which is currently being studied. Even though some steps of the signal cascade are still missing, it is reasonable to assume that the increase of eNOS expression was caused by enhanced transcription rather than a modification of the half-life time of the eNOS mRNA. The shear stress-induced increase of mRNA expression was abolished after incubation with actinomycin D, which inhibits mRNA production. In fact, the increase in eNOS expression went along with a substantial increase of eNOS protein synthesis as revealed by Western blotting. Measurements of elevated NOX concentration in the conditioned media confirmed that this eNOS protein was physiologically functional.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a cell-laminin I interaction via a 67-kDa LBP is an important step in the signal transduction pathway by which shear stress elicits eNOS expression. This function suggests a physiological role for a protein that, up to this point, was considered important mainly for pathophysiologic processes such as tumor invasion. Shear stress, elicited by blood flow, represents an important signal for endothelial cells to synthesize vasoactive autacoids. In addition to an acute increased autacoid production there are also chronic effects of shear stress. One such effect is the differential expression of some proteins in endothelial cells (1Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Davies P.F. Tripathi S.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown by several groups that, in particular, the expression of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; LBP, laminin-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; LBP, laminin-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.is increased when endothelial cells are exposed to laminar shear stress for several hours (3Xiao Z.H.

Res. 1994; 74: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar).Some groups observed an increase of eNOS expression in cells being cultured on non-laminin matrices (3Xiao Z.H. Zhang Z. Diamond S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Topper J.N. Cai J.X. Falb D. Gimbrone M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This is in apparent contrast to our results because cultivating cells on fibronectin or pure glass abolished the shear stress sensitivity in terms of eNOS expression. This discrepancy may be explained by variations in the ability of the cells to produce endogenous laminin. Our observation that cells taken from the same pool produced high amounts of laminin I when grown on plastic (irrespective of the coating) but not when cultivated on glass plates, except when the glass plates were precoated by laminin, supports the explanation above. Indeed, our Western blot data suggest a laminin I-induced laminin production under these conditions.Therefore, by cultivating endothelial cells on glass plates, a specific role of laminin I could be detected when compared with other matrix proteins. This is not an effect of laminin I alone because the addition of laminin I to the superfusate did not change the eNOS expression in control cells kept under static conditions (data not shown). Only in combination with shear stress was there an effect (a 2-fold increase of eNOS expression). Interestingly, it has been reported that endothelial cells under chronic shear stress produce more laminin at the expense of fibronectin (21Gupte A. Frangos J.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Thoumine O. Nerem R.M. Girard P.R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 565-576PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, laminin expression correlates with endothelial cell differentiation during angiogenesis (24Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jiang B. Liou G.I. Behzadian M.A. Caldwell R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2499-2508PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sorokin L.M. Pausch F. Durbeej M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dynam. 1997; 210: 446-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is circumstantial evidence that eNOS expression also correlates with endothelial cell differentiation (34Babaei S. Teichert-Kuliszeaska K. Monge J.C. Mohamed F. Bendeck M.P. Stewart D.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Binding of the cell to laminin I occurs not only via integrins, especially those consisting of a β1- and one of several α-chains but also by a 67-kDa LBP (25Menard S. Castronovo V. Tagliabue E. Sobel M.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Iwamoto Y. Robey F.A. Graf J. Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. Martin G.R.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). LBP was constitutively expressed, regardless of the underlying matrix, which may reflect its potential significance in mediating effects of matrix proteins on cell signaling. The presence of a functioning LBP at the membrane level was assessed indirectly by testing the adherence of freshly dispersed cells to a laminin matrix. High concentrations of the inhibitor of LBP binding, YIGSR (see below), reduced the adherence and led to an extensive detachment of freshly attached cells under shear stress. This may be the result of the lack of other attachment substrates. After 2–3 days in culture and using much less peptide, this shear-induced detachment was not observed, indicating that binding sites other than LBP are more important for permanent attachment and firm cell adherence. These hypothesis is supported by macroscopic inspection of the matrix protein compositions. The Coomassie-stained protein gels showed no obvious differences among the various pretreatments of the culture plates. However, when probed in Western blots there was a clear distinction between the laminin coating and collagen and fibronectin coating. This suggests that the role of LBP is not primarily in cell adhesion but perhaps in sensing external signals applied to the cell.Even after several days in culture, the laminin I-dependent eNOS expression could still be inhibited by the addition of YIGSR, a peptide deduced from the LBP binding site (27Graf J. Ogle R.C. Robey F.A. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) on the laminin I molecule. When applied in high concentrations, this peptide was shown to attenuate tumor invasion and vasculogenesis (35Mecham R.P. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in vivo, therefore suggesting a role for this protein in development and under pathophysiologic conditions. In the present experiments, a much smaller concentration of this peptide inhibited the eNOS induction on transcriptional and translational level completely. This inhibition was highly specific because the nearly identical control peptide had no effect. The central role of LBP in mediating the shear stress response is supported further by preliminary experiments using the laminin fragments P1 and E8 for coating the glass plates. Like intact laminin, the P1 fragment also resulted in a shear stress-induced increase of eNOS expression. Fragment P1 represents the “upper” part of the cross-shaped laminin molecule containing the YIGSR binding site (36Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast, coating with the fragment E8 of laminin, which represents the large stem of the protein that does not contain the binding site for LBP (36Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), led to a loss of the shear stress sensitivity of the cells in terms of eNOS expression.The mechanism by which LBP translates shear stress into gene expression is not yet clear. Massia et al. (37Massia S.P. Rao S.S. Hubbell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8053-8059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed the colocalization of the 67-kDa LBP with stress fibers of the cytoskeleton and, furthermore, with part of the focal adhesion kinase complex, α-actinin and vinculin. This colocalization suggests that LBP is involved in signaling processes located in focal adhesion points. In this context, it should be emphasized that shear stress induces a very dynamic change of focal adhesion points soon after initiation of shear stress (14Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar). Our results do not exclude that additional membrane structures are involved in the signal transduction process. This could explain why there was a small but significant increase of eNOS expression also on a collagen I matrix, although we did not find a corresponding translation to eNOS protein. Recently, Ardini et al. (38Ardini E. Tagliabue E. Magnifico A. Buto S. Castronovo V. Colnaghi M.I. Menard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2342-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as Halatsch et al. (39Halatsch M.E. Hirsch-Ernst K.I. Kahl G.F. Weinel R.J. Cancer Lett. 1997; 118: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), described a close coregulation and physical association of the 67-kDa LBP and the integrin α6β4 in the human carcinoma cell line A43. This very close association of the different receptors, possibly created by binding to the same laminin molecule, could be a crucial step in the translation of the signal which is currently being studied. Even though some steps of the signal cascade are still missing, it is reasonable to assume that the increase of eNOS expression was caused by enhanced transcription rather than a modification of the half-life time of the eNOS mRNA. The shear stress-induced increase of mRNA expression was abolished after incubation with actinomycin D, which inhibits mRNA production. In fact, the increase in eNOS expression went along with a substantial increase of eNOS protein synthesis as revealed by Western blotting. Measurements of elevated NOX concentration in the conditioned media confirmed that this eNOS protein was physiologically functional.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a cell-laminin I interaction via a 67-kDa LBP is an important step in the signal transduction pathway by which shear stress elicits eNOS expression. This function suggests a physiological role for a protein that, up to this point, was considered important mainly for pathophysiologic processes such as tumor invasion. These experiments demonstrate that the application of shear stress over several hours augments the expression of eNOS in porcine endothelial cells. The new finding in this study is that the augmentation of eNOS expression depends on the presence of laminin I in the extracellular matrix, suggesting a modulator role for it in the response of a vessel to mechanical forces. A 67-kDa LBP, which seems to be constitutively expressed in the endothelium, acts as a functional sensor at the basal side of the cell and is crucially involved in the translation of the physical force to gene expression. The increase of eNOS expression upon shear stress is in accordance with earlier reports in cultured bovine aortic (3Xiao Z.H. Zhang Z. Diamond S.L. J. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1969065141,"Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) is known for its significant anti-angiogenic properties. In a previous study, we have shown that transient or stable overexpression of the transcription factor c-Jun, in rat fibroblasts, leads to repression of TSP1. We now demonstrate that the c-Jun-induced repression of TSP1 does not occur directly and does not require binding of c-Jun to the TSP1 promoter. Instead, repression involves a factor secreted by c-Jun-overexpressing cells. This secreted factor triggers a signal transduction pathway from the membrane to the nucleus, and these signals lead to the binding of the product of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, WT1, to the -210 region of the TSP1 promoter. This region binds WT1 and SP1, but not EGR1, although its sequence fits the consensus binding site for this transcription factor. WT1 overexpression in transfected cells inhibits endogenous TSP1 gene expression and TSP1 transcription in experiments using TSP1 promoter-reporter constructs. The WT1 - KTS isoform is more active in repressing TSP1 transcription than WT1 + KTS, while EGR1 is inactive. Enhancement of WT1 binding to DNA in response to c-Jun does not require de novo protein synthesis. The above mechanism for TSP1 repression could apply to other genes, thus coordinating their regulation in the vicinity of a c-Jun-overexpressing cell. We conclude that WT1, which was discovered as a result of its tumor suppressor properties, may also possess oncogenic characteristics in the c-Jun transformation process, and thus repress the anti-angiogenic protein, TSP1."
https://openalex.org/W2314529838,"There is substantial evidence to suggest that aberrant DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of expressed genes may play a role in hematologic malignancy. In the current report, the Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning (RLGS) method was used to detect aberrant DNA methylation (M) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RLGS-M profiles were initially performed using DNA from diagnostic, remission, and relapse samples from a patient with AML. Rp18, one of the eight spots found that was absent in the relapse sample, was cloned. Sequence analysis showed that the spot represented a portion of the WIT-1 gene on human chromosome 11p13. Rp18 was missing in the relapse sample due to a distinct DNA methylation pattern of the WIT-1 gene. Twenty-seven AML patients that entered CR after therapy (i.e., chemosensitive) were studied and only 10 (37%) of the diagnostic bone marrow (BM) samples showed methylation of WIT-1. However, seven of eight (87.5%) diagnostic BM samples from primary refractory AML (chemosensitive) showed methylation of WIT-1. The incidence of WIT-1 methylation in primary refractory AML was significantly higher than that noted in chemosensitive AML (P=0.018). Together, these results indicate that RLGS-M can be used to find novel epigenetic alterations in human cancer that are undetectable by standard methods. In addition, these results underline the potential importance of WIT-1 methylation in chemoresistant AML."

Under quasi-physiological in vitro conditions (1 mml-serine and 0.25 mmpyruvate), flux through serine dehydratase accounted for only traces, and that through SPT/AGT substantially contributed no matter whether the enzyme was located in peroxisomes (rabbit and human) or largely in mitochondria (dog).

Cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes of SHMT (cSHMT and mSHMT, respectively) have been shown to catalyze the interconversion between serine and glycine in conjugation with mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS). This interconversion occurs especially when there is need for C1-substituted tetrahydrofolate cofactors or when either one of these amino acids are used or supplied (1Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In the preceding paper (7Xue H.-H. Fujie M. Sakaguchi T. Oda T. Ogawa H. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16020-16027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we considered SDH, SPT/AGT, and GCS to be the metabolic exits of the serine-glycine pool and showed that SDH is the major enzyme in the metabolism of l-serine in rat liver. The flux through SPT/AGT was enhanced by glucagon administration, but even after the induction, its contribution was about 110 of that through SDH both in vitro and in vivo. The flux through GCS was comparable with that through SPT/AGT in glucagon-treated rats (7Xue H.-H. Fujie M. Sakaguchi T. Oda T. Ogawa H. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Ichiyama A. J. Biol.

However, this pattern of l-serine metabolism in rat liver may not be extrapolated to other animals, because the SDH activity is known to decrease drastically as the body size of animals increases (8Rowsell E.V. Carnie J.A. Wahbi S.D. Al-Tai A.H. Rowsell K.V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 63B: 543-555Google Scholar). Although the results obtained with glucagon-treated rats suggested that mitochondrial SPT/AGT is involved in the metabolism ofl-serine, whether its contribution can be substantial and whether the enzyme in peroxisomes plays dual roles in the metabolism of glyoxylate and serine remain obscure. This paper deals with thel-serine metabolism in rabbit, dog, and human livers. Dog and rabbit were chosen as representatives of carnivores and herbivores, respectively.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have presented in vitro and in vivo data suggesting that, in rabbit, dog, and human livers, SPT/AGT substantially contributes to the metabolism ofl-serine, whereas the contribution of SDH is fairly small. This pattern of l-serine metabolism is in contrast to the observation that in rat liver the contribution of SDH is the largest, and the flux through SPT/AGT accounts for only traces unless this enzyme has been induced by a previous administration of glucagon (7Xue H.-H.

Such species-specific patterns of the l-serine metabolism approximately agree with the observed activities of serine-metabolizing enzymes in respective animals (Table I). Our results are compatible with the observation by Rowsell et al. (8Rowsell E.V. Carnie J.A. Wahbi S.D. Al-Tai A.H. Rowsell K.V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 63B: 543-555Google Scholar) that in rabbit and dog livers the SPT/AGT activity is more than six times higher, and the SDH activity is much lower than the respective activities in rat liver.It is noteworthy that SPT/AGT is involved in the l-serine metabolism, no matter whether the enzyme is largely located in mitochondria (dog liver) or entirely in peroxisomes (rabbit and human livers). It has been expected that mitochondrial SPT/AGT plays a role in l-serine metabolism, because in the rat, the flux through SPT/AGT in gluconeogenesis from l-serine was apparent only when liver mitochondrial SPT/AGT had been induced by glucagon (7Xue H.-H.

This was corroborated in the present study by demonstrating in in vitro experiments under quasi-physiological conditions that the flux through SPT/AGT accounts for a large portion of l-serine metabolized in dog liver. These results are in accordance with the observation of Beliveau and Freedland (17Beliveau G.P. Freedland R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 71B: 13-18Google Scholar) that serine is mainly metabolized via transamination in hepatocytes isolated from the cat, another carnivore. As for the peroxisomal SPT/AGT, on the other hand, an important role in the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine has been indicated from the studies on primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (6Danpure C.J. Purdue P.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2385-2424Google Scholar). In the present study, the peroxisomal SPT/AGT was also shown to participate inl-serine metabolism in vitro (Table II). In addition, in the case of rabbit liver, an infusion experiment withl-[3-3H,14C]serine suggested that the flux through SPT/AGT contributes to gluconeogenesis froml-serine in vivo and accounts for as much as ∼90% of it (Table III). It is evident that peroxisomal SPT/AGT plays dual roles in the metabolism of serine and glyoxylate. It is possible, although it has not yet been experimentally proved, that mitochondrial SPT/AGT also plays a role in the metabolism of glyoxylate.l-Hydroxyproline has been shown to be metabolized to glyoxylate in mitochondria (or peroxisomes, 18,000 × gprecipitate; Ref. 18Maitra U. Pekker E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 237: 1485-1491Google Scholar), and glyoxylate thus formed was proposed to be converted to glycine by mitochondrial SPT/AGT, although the quantities of the hydroxyproline-derived glyoxylate must be small (1Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Rowsell E.V. Snell K. Carnie J.A. Rowsell K.V. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SPT/AGT is thus a unique enzyme of dual organelle localization, and it is possible that the enzyme in either organelle plays dual roles, gluconeogenesis from serine and conversion of glyoxylate to glycine by transamination. Such dual functions probably come from the fact that serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.45), the plant counterpart of animal SPT/AGT (EC 2.6.1.44/2.6.1.51), catalyzes transamination between serine and glyoxylate in the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle (20Keys A.J. Bird I.F. Cornelius M.J. Lea P.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Miflin B.J. Nature. 1978; 275: 741-743Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar), forming hydroxypyruvate and glycine, the latter being converted back to serine by a mitochondrial enzyme system. It is unlikely that glyoxylate is supplied in the animal livers as abundantly as in the photorespiration in plant leaves. Therefore, the hepatic serine metabolism catalyzed by SPT/AGT may not be necessarily coupled with the glyoxylate-to-glycine conversion, and more versatile pyruvate may also be used as an amino acceptor from serine, although the affinity of the enzyme for glyoxylate is much higher than that for pyruvate, as demonstrated by much lower K m for glyoxylate (10 μm) than that for pyruvate (480 μm) of the rat liver enzyme at pH 7.4 (21Yanagisawa M. Higashi S. Oda T. Ichiyama A. Lennone D.F. Stratman F.W. Zahtten R.N. Biochemistry of Metabolic Processes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1983: 413-426Google Scholar).Because plant tissues contain significant amounts of glycolate (22Harris K.S. Richardson K.E. Invest. Urol. 1980; 18: 106-109PubMed Google Scholar), and the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate takes place in liver peroxisomes, the peroxisomal location of SPT/AGT may be favorable for herbivores to convert the glycolate-derived glyoxylate to glycine and to prevent harmful overproduction of oxalate. For carnivores, on the other hand, there may be less need of the peroxisomal location of SPT/AGT, because meats contain much less glycolate (22Harris K.S. Richardson K.E. Invest. Urol. 1980; 18: 106-109PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to its role in the disposal of serine demonstrated in this study, SPT/AGT in either of the two organelles appears to function with similar efficiency. Thus the necessity and advantages to carnivores of having SPT/AGT in mitochondria are not yet fully understood and need further studies.As for the metabolism of l-serine via glycine, the overall flux observed with reconstituted cytoplasmic extracts from rabbit, human, and dog livers was similar to that in the case of rat liver. As proposed in the preceding paper (7Xue H.-H. Fujie M. Sakaguchi T. Oda T. Ogawa H. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16020-16027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the SHMT-catalyzed interconversion between serine and glycine may contribute, at least in part, to the maintaining of their intracellular concentration balance, in response to supply or use of these amino acids and tetrahydrofolate coenzymes, and the degradation of glycine by GCS may be considered as a metabolic exit of not only glycine but also l-serine. This view was further supported in the present study by showing that, irrespective of the animal species tested, the conversion of serine to glycine catalyzed by cSHMT occurred fairly rapidly, followed by the GCS-mediated slow decarboxylation of the accumulated glycine. However, the flux through GCS as well as that through SDH and SPT/AGT varied considerably from animal to animal. In dog liver in which the activity of GCS was relatively high, the contribution of the flux through GCS was comparable with that through SPT/AGT, but in rabbit and human livers the GCS pathway accounted for only a small portion ofl-serine metabolized (Table II). It has been previously noted that the activity of GCS is relatively small, and the apparent low activity may have some rationale, because glycine is an important amino acid that is used in many ways in the cells (12Kikuchi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although the flux through SPT/AGT is one of the major metabolic exits of serine in rabbit, human, and dog livers, its activity is also relatively small, consistent with the previous observation by Felig et al.(23Felig P. Owen O.E. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) that serine, as well as glycine, is less effective than alanine as a precursor for hepatic gluconeogenesis in humans.Summarizing all the data and discussions presented in this paper together with those in the preceding one (7Xue H.-H.

Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Notable features of SPT/AGT are that this enzyme is located entirely in peroxisomes in herbivores and humans, largely in mitochondria in carnivores (2Takada Y. Noguchi T. Comp. Biochem.

In the present study, the peroxisomal SPT/AGT was also shown to participate inl-serine metabolism in vitro (Table II). In addition, in the case of rabbit liver, an infusion experiment withl-[3-3H,14C]serine suggested that the flux through SPT/AGT contributes to gluconeogenesis froml-serine in vivo and accounts for as much as ∼90% of it (Table III). It is evident that peroxisomal SPT/AGT plays dual roles in the metabolism of serine and glyoxylate. It is possible, although it has not yet been experimentally proved, that mitochondrial SPT/AGT also plays a role in the metabolism of glyoxylate.l-Hydroxyproline has been shown to be metabolized to glyoxylate in mitochondria (or peroxisomes, 18,000 × gprecipitate; Ref. 18Maitra U. Pekker E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 237: 1485-1491Google Scholar), and glyoxylate thus formed was proposed to be converted to glycine by mitochondrial SPT/AGT, although the quantities of the hydroxyproline-derived glyoxylate must be small (1Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Rowsell E.V. Snell K. Carnie J.A. Rowsell K.V. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SPT/AGT is thus a unique enzyme of dual organelle localization, and it is possible that the enzyme in either organelle plays dual roles, gluconeogenesis from serine and conversion of glyoxylate to glycine by transamination. Such dual functions probably come from the fact that serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.45), the plant counterpart of animal SPT/AGT (EC 2.6.1.44/2.6.1.51), catalyzes transamination between serine and glyoxylate in the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle (20Keys A.J. Bird I.F. Cornelius M.J. Lea P.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Miflin B.J. Nature. 1978; 275: 741-743Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar), forming hydroxypyruvate and glycine, the latter being converted back to serine by a mitochondrial enzyme system. It is unlikely that glyoxylate is supplied in the animal livers as abundantly as in the photorespiration in plant leaves. Therefore, the hepatic serine metabolism catalyzed by SPT/AGT may not be necessarily coupled with the glyoxylate-to-glycine conversion, and more versatile pyruvate may also be used as an amino acceptor from serine, although the affinity of the enzyme for glyoxylate is much higher than that for pyruvate, as demonstrated by much lower K m for glyoxylate (10 μm) than that for pyruvate (480 μm) of the rat liver enzyme at pH 7.4 (21Yanagisawa M. Higashi S. Oda T. Ichiyama A. Lennone D.F. Stratman F.W. Zahtten R.N. Biochemistry of Metabolic Processes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1983: 413-426Google Scholar). Because plant tissues contain significant amounts of glycolate (22Harris K.S. Richardson K.E. Invest. Urol. 1980; 18: 106-109PubMed Google Scholar), and the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate takes place in liver peroxisomes, the peroxisomal location of SPT/AGT may be favorable for herbivores to convert the glycolate-derived glyoxylate to glycine and to prevent harmful overproduction of oxalate. For carnivores, on the other hand, there may be less need of the peroxisomal location of SPT/AGT, because meats contain much less glycolate (22Harris K.S. Richardson K.E. Invest. Urol. 1980; 18: 106-109PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to its role in the disposal of serine demonstrated in this study, SPT/AGT in either of the two organelles appears to function with similar efficiency. Thus the necessity and advantages to carnivores of having SPT/AGT in mitochondria are not yet fully understood and need further studies. As for the metabolism of l-serine via glycine, the overall flux observed with reconstituted cytoplasmic extracts from rabbit, human, and dog livers was similar to that in the case of rat liver. As proposed in the preceding paper (7Xue H.-H. Fujie M. Sakaguchi T. Oda T. Ogawa H. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16020-16027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the SHMT-catalyzed interconversion between serine and glycine may contribute, at least in part, to the maintaining of their intracellular concentration balance, in response to supply or use of these amino acids and tetrahydrofolate coenzymes, and the degradation of glycine by GCS may be considered as a metabolic exit of not only glycine but also l-serine. This view was further supported in the present study by showing that, irrespective of the animal species tested, the conversion of serine to glycine catalyzed by cSHMT occurred fairly rapidly, followed by the GCS-mediated slow decarboxylation of the accumulated glycine. However, the flux through GCS as well as that through SDH and SPT/AGT varied considerably from animal to animal. In dog liver in which the activity of GCS was relatively high, the contribution of the flux through GCS was comparable with that through SPT/AGT, but in rabbit and human livers the GCS pathway accounted for only a small portion ofl-serine metabolized (Table II). It has been previously noted that the activity of GCS is relatively small, and the apparent low activity may have some rationale, because glycine is an important amino acid that is used in many ways in the cells (12Kikuchi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although the flux through SPT/AGT is one of the major metabolic exits of serine in rabbit, human, and dog livers, its activity is also relatively small, consistent with the previous observation by Felig et al.(23Felig P. Owen O.E. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) that serine, as well as glycine, is less effective than alanine as a precursor for hepatic gluconeogenesis in humans. Summarizing all the data and discussions presented in this paper together with those in the preceding one (7Xue H.-H. Fujie M. Sakaguchi T. Oda T. Ogawa H. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Ichiyama A. J. Biol.

We are indebted to Prof. Satoshi Nakamura (Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine) and Dr. Kazuya Suzuki (First Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine) for their kind supply of human and dog liver specimens, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1533095627,"Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of many tumors. It is difficult to determine what fraction of tumor cells survives after treatment with ionizing radiation. A convenient and sensitive biochemical assay could be efficacious in determining the potential success of radiotherapy. Since telomerase activity is frequently associated with the malignant phenotype, we sought to determine whether a correlation existed between ionizing radiation-induced cell killing and telomerase activity. We evaluated telomerase activity in two telomerase-positive and one telomerase-negative human cell line exposed to ionizing radiation. Telomerase activity was determined using a PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol coupled with ELISA. We found ionizing radiation treatment to decrease the telomerase activity (in plateau phase cells of RKO, HeLa; and growing cells of RKO) in a dose-dependent manner, which correlated with cell death in in vitro tests as well as during tumor regression in nude mice. In contrast, growing HeLa cells after 24 h postradiation treatment showed an increase in telomerase activity, but there was no increase in the levels of mRNA of hTERT. To assess the sensitivity of the telomerase activity assay, we performed mixing experiments of HeLa and AG1522 cell extracts. These studies showed that telomerase activity could be detected in lysate equal to a single HeLa cell when mixed with 10,000 AG1522 cells. Our results indicate that even a few surviving neoplastic cells can be detected by telomerase activity assay. Therefore, detection of telomerase activity may be a useful monitor of radiotherapeutic efficacy and an early predictor of outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2162960595,"The delta protein is a dispensable subunit of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase (RNAP) that has major effects on the biochemical properties of the purified enzyme. In the presence of delta, RNAP displays an increased specificity of transcription, a decreased affinity for nucleic acids, and an increased efficiency of RNA synthesis because of enhanced recycling. Despite these profound effects, a strain containing a deletion of the delta gene (rpoE) is viable and shows no major alterations in gene expression. Quantitative immunoblotting experiments demonstrate that delta is present in molar excess relative to RNAP in both vegetative cells and spores. Expression of rpoE initiates from a single, sigmaA-dependent promoter and is maximal in transition phase. A rpoE mutant strain has an altered morphology and is delayed in the exit from stationary phase. For biochemical analyses we have created derivatives of delta and sigmaA that can be radiolabeled with protein kinase A. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that delta binds core RNAP with an apparent affinity of 2.5 x 10(6) M-1, but we are unable to demonstrate the formation of a ternary complex containing core enzyme, delta, and sigmaA."
https://openalex.org/W2085286435,"l-Serine metabolism in rat liver was investigated, focusing on the relative contributions of the three pathways, one initiated by l-serine dehydratase (SDH), another by serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT), and the other involving serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS). Because serine hydroxymethyltransferase is responsible for the interconversion between serine and glycine, SDH, SPT/AGT, and GCS were considered to be the metabolic exits of the serine-glycine pool. In vitro, flux through SDH was predominant in both 24-h starved and glucagon-treated rats. Flux through SPT/AGT was enhanced by glucagon administration, but even after the induction, its contribution under quasi-physiological conditions (1 mml-serine and 0.25 mm pyruvate) was about 110 of that through SDH. Flux through GCS accounted for only several percent of the amount ofl-serine metabolized. Relative contributions of SDH and SPT/AGT to gluconeogenesis from l-serine were evaluatedin vivo based on the principle that 3H at the 3 position of l-serine is mostly removed in the SDH pathway, whereas it is largely retained in the SPT/AGT pathway. The results showed that SPT/AGT contributed only 10–20% even after the enhancement of its activity by glucagon. These results suggested that SDH is the major metabolic exit of l-serine in rat liver. l-Serine metabolism in rat liver was investigated, focusing on the relative contributions of the three pathways, one initiated by l-serine dehydratase (SDH), another by serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT), and the other involving serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS).

The results showed that SPT/AGT contributed only 10–20% even after the enhancement of its activity by glucagon. These results suggested that SDH is the major metabolic exit of l-serine in rat liver. l-Serine is known to be physiologically important as a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis (1Remesy C. Fafournoux P. Demigne C. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in addition to its role as a major donor of one-carbon units. It has been established that three pathways are involved in the metabolism of l-serine: 1) that catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1); mSHMT, mitochondrial isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; cSHMT, cytosolic isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SDH, l-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13); SPT/AGT, serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51/EC 2.6.1.44); GCS, glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 1.4.4.2-1.8.1.4-2.1.2.10); THF, tetrahydrofolate; Mit-Ps, subcellular fraction containing mitochondria and peroxisomes; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1); mSHMT, mitochondrial isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; cSHMT, cytosolic isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SDH, l-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13); SPT/AGT, serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51/EC 2.6.1.44); GCS, glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 1.4.4.2-1.8.1.4-2.1.2.10); THF, tetrahydrofolate; Mit-Ps, subcellular fraction containing mitochondria and peroxisomes; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which is responsible for the reversible conversion of l-serine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to glycine and 5,10-methylene-THF; 2) that catalyzed by serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT), leading to the formation of hydroxypyruvate; and 3) that catalyzed by l-serine dehydratase (SDH), resulting in the formation of pyruvate (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Glycine formed by the action of SHMT is thought to be metabolized mainly by the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS) (3Kikuchi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas hydroxypyruvate and pyruvate are either catabolized or converted to glucose depending on the nutritive conditions of animals (Fig. 1).SHMT exists in some eukaryotic cells, including hepatocytes, as distinct isozymes, one located in the cytosol and the other in mitochondria (referred to as cSHMT and mSHMT, respectively) (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As for their physiological functions in the liver and kidney, mSHMT has been proposed to be coupled with GCS in the conversion of glycine to serine, using 5,10-methylene-THF formed by the latter enzyme and thus regenerating THF (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4Cowin G.J. Willgoss D.A. Endre Z.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that cSHMT cooperates with mSHMT and GCS to transfer one-carbon units from mitochondria to the cytosol (5Cybulski R.L. Fisher R.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3183-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the degradation of glycine by GCS appears to be usually associated with synthesis of serine from another molecule of glycine. The SPT/AGT activity is essentially confined to the liver and shows a unique species-specific organelle distribution in mammals, based on their food habits. In carnivores such as dog, this enzyme is largely located in mitochondria, whereas in humans and herbivores such as rabbit, it is entirely peroxisomal (6Takada Y. Noguchi T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 72B: 597-604Google Scholar, 7Noguchi T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7598-7600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Danpure C.J. Guttridge K.M. Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop J. Purdue P.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 669-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rat liver, its activity is detected in both the organelles, but only the mitochondrial activity is induced by glucagon, as a result of alternative transcription initiation from two sites on a single gene and selective stimulation by cAMP of the transcription from the upstream start site (9Oda T. Funai T. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7513-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Uchida C. Funai T. Oda T. Ohbayashi K. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8849-8856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major physiological roles of peroxisomal SPT/AGT is catalysis of the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. This view is supported by the overproduction of oxalate in primary hyperoxaluria type 1, an inborn error of glyoxylate metabolism caused by a functional deficiency of peroxisomal SPT/AGT (11Danpure C.J. Purdue P.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2385-2424Google Scholar). Mitochondrial SPT/AGT has been presumed, mainly because of its induction by glucagon (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Kitagawa Y. Sugimoto E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 52: 276-282Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), to participate in gluconeogenesis, but supporting evidence is still insufficient, and whether peroxisomal SPT/AGT is involved in serine metabolism, in addition to its role in the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine, has not been studied so far. SDH is largely confined to the liver and located solely in the cytosol. The liver SDH activity is known to be inversely related to body size in higher animals (13Rowsell E.V. Carnie J.A. Wahbi S.D. Al-Tai A.H. Rowsell K.V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 63B: 543-555Google Scholar). In the rat, therefore, its activity is fairly high and induced under some gluconeogenic conditions (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, its substantial contribution to the metabolism of l-serine has been questioned, despite the high activity in rat liver, mainly because of its very highK m (50–70 mm) for l-serine, and indeed the results of experiments involving14C-serine (14Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 13: 380-392Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) argued against this possibility.Flux of the l-serine metabolism through the different pathways had been studied mainly in rat liver and in the 1970s, when the knowledge of SPT/AGT was not sufficient. It is possible from the considerations mentioned above that l-serine metabolism in different animal species shows distinct patterns, and thus investigation of this subject is necessary and intriguing. Such work was initiated focusing on the relative contributions of the three pathways, the SDH and SPT/AGT pathways and that involving SHMT and GCS (Fig. 1). This paper deals with the l-serine metabolism in rat liver in vitro and in vivo. The metabolism ofl-serine in the livers of other animal species will be described in an accompanying paper.DISCUSSIONSHMT, SDH, and SPT/AGT are known to be the three major enzymes involved in the hepatic metabolism of l-serine, but the situation of SHMT appears to be different from those of the latter two enzymes. Because both serine and glycine are physiologically important amino acids that are used in a variety of ways in the cells, their intracellular concentration should be maintained in a given range, and cSHMT and mSHMT together with GCS are thought to play crucial roles in the interconversion between serine and glycine. The equilibrium of the cSHMT-catalyzed reaction appears to lie far on the side of the glycine formation in vivo, and when glycine is to be converted to serine such as in the case of gluconeogenesis from glycine, this conversion may be accomplished mainly by mSHMT in conjugation with GCS, which supplies 5,10-methylene-THF to mSHMT at the expense of another molecule of glycine. The intracellular partitioning of the serine and glycine interconversion in the liver was suggested by the observation by Yoshida and Kikuchi (38Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 35: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that in a congenital hyperglycinemia patient deficient in GCS, the level of blood serine was in the normal range, whereas those of glycine in the blood and urine were elevated far above the normal. It was also reported that decarboxylation of [1-14C]glycine by liver mitochondrial suspensions or homogenate is accompanied by the formation of nearly an equimolar quantity of [14C]serine (3Kikuchi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Considering a role of GCS to be the disposal of glycine and serine in addition to its role in supplying C1 unit-substituted THF derivatives in mitochondria, the roles of SPT/AGT and SDH as the metabolic exits of serine and glycine are analogous to that of GCS rather than SHMT. Indeed, we observed in experiments with an SDH-depleted reconstituted cytoplasmic extract that the conversion of l-serine to glycine occurred fairly rapidly, in part owing to the lowK m of cSHMT for l-serine, followed by the GCS-catalyzed slow decarboxylation of [1-14C]glycine formed.When the flux of the serine and glycine metabolism through SDH, SPT/AGT, and GCS was compared in rat liver, the flux through SDH was shown to be the largest, contrary to the general understanding that SDH may not play a substantial role because of its very highK m for its substrate. In in vitroexperiments, the amount of l-serine metabolized through the SDH pathway, as evidenced by the pyruvate formation with the soluble fraction, far exceeded those in the cases of the SPT/AGT pathway and GCS pathway under every condition used. Under quasi-physiological conditions with 1 mml-serine and 0.25 mm pyruvate, the contribution of the SDH pathway was estimated to be 89–98% in both 24-h starved and glucagon-treated rat livers (Table III). Calculation of the contribution of individual pathways from the results of in vitro experiments alone could be misleading because of the inevitable deviation from physiological conditions. However, in this study in vivo and perfusion experiments performed withl-[3-3H,14C]serine as the substrate also indicated that gluconeogenesis from l-serine proceeds almost entirely via pyruvate in 48 h-starved rat liver. Even when the hepatic activity of SPT/AGT had been elevated 6–10-fold by glucagon administration, the flux through pyruvate was estimated to account for ∼80–90% of the gluconeogenesis (Table IV). It should be mentioned that the results obtained in this study reflect the situation after 24–48 h starvation when the SDH activity has been augmented 2–3-fold (39Sallach H.J. Sanborn T.A. Bruin W.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Beliveau G.P Freedland R.A. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Bhatia S.C. Bhatia S. Rous S. Life Sci. 1975; 17: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but because the flux through SDH measured in vitro under the quasi-physiological conditions far exceeded those through SPT/AGT and GCS (Table III), the predominant role of SDH in the disposal of serine in rat liver may be held true for non-starved conditions.It is also noteworthy that SPT/AGT was shown, in this study, to be actually involved in the metabolism of l-serine in the livers of glucagon-treated rats, although its contribution was rather small. The relative flow of serine through SDH and SPT/AGT in rat liver has been studied mainly by the use of inhibitors of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase such as quinolinate and 3-mercaptopicolinate, and a contribution of the SPT/AGT pathway has been suggested from the observations that these inhibitors had less effect on gluconeogenesis from serine than from lactate or alanine (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 40Beliveau G.P Freedland R.A. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Bhatia S.C.

Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although controversial results were also reported (44Chan T.M. Freedland R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Sandoval I.V. Soles A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 46Mendes-Mourauo J. Halestrap A.P. Crisp D.M. Pogson C.I. FEBS Lett. 1975; 53: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results agree with a study by Snell (47Snell K. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) on gluconeogenesis from serine in the suckling rat in that the contribution of the SPT/AGT-initiated pathway was notable under conditions in which the hepatic SPT/AGT activity increased.The predominant role of SDH in the metabolism of l-serine reported in this paper does not mean that l-serine is actively metabolized by SDH in rat liver. Aikawa et al. (48Aikawa T. Matsutaka H. Yamamoto H. Okuda T. Ishikawa E. Kawano T. Matsumura E. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 1003-1017PubMed Google Scholar,49Aikawa T. Matsutaka H. Yakezawa K. Ishikawa E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 179: 234-244Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that alanine contributes most to hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acids in starved rats in vivo, and the contribution of serine is far less. Their results are in accordance with the fact that the activity of alanine aminotransferase is six to eight times higher than that of SDH in rat liver, and in addition theK m of SDH for l-serine is as high as 50–70 mm. It appears that l-serine is relatively inert as a substrate for energy metabolism in rat liver.As for the mechanism by which ATP/Mg2+ stimulates the decarboxylation of [1-14C]pyruvate in mitochondria, we assume that when pyruvate is supplied to mitochondria in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and HCO3−, it is readily carboxylated to oxaloacetate in addition to its oxidation to acetyl-CoA. A portion of the oxaloacetate thus formed is converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase with the concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD+, and another portion is converted to citrate by citrate synthase in conjugation with the release of CoASH. The NAD+ and CoASH thus formed may then enhance the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, allowing the efficient decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which in turn activates carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. In support of this view, Pande and Parvin (50Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol.

Fafournoux P. Demigne C. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in addition to its role as a major donor of one-carbon units. It has been established that three pathways are involved in the metabolism of l-serine: 1) that catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1); mSHMT, mitochondrial isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; cSHMT, cytosolic isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SDH, l-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13); SPT/AGT, serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51/EC 2.6.1.44); GCS, glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 1.4.4.2-1.8.1.4-2.1.2.10); THF, tetrahydrofolate; Mit-Ps, subcellular fraction containing mitochondria and peroxisomes; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1); mSHMT, mitochondrial isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; cSHMT, cytosolic isozyme of serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SDH, l-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13); SPT/AGT, serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51/EC 2.6.1.44); GCS, glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 1.4.4.2-1.8.1.4-2.1.2.10); THF, tetrahydrofolate; Mit-Ps, subcellular fraction containing mitochondria and peroxisomes; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which is responsible for the reversible conversion of l-serine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to glycine and 5,10-methylene-THF; 2) that catalyzed by serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT), leading to the formation of hydroxypyruvate; and 3) that catalyzed by l-serine dehydratase (SDH), resulting in the formation of pyruvate (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Glycine formed by the action of SHMT is thought to be metabolized mainly by the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS) (3Kikuchi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas hydroxypyruvate and pyruvate are either catabolized or converted to glucose depending on the nutritive conditions of animals (Fig. 1). SHMT exists in some eukaryotic cells, including hepatocytes, as distinct isozymes, one located in the cytosol and the other in mitochondria (referred to as cSHMT and mSHMT, respectively) (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As for their physiological functions in the liver and kidney, mSHMT has been proposed to be coupled with GCS in the conversion of glycine to serine, using 5,10-methylene-THF formed by the latter enzyme and thus regenerating THF (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4Cowin G.J. Willgoss D.A. Endre Z.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that cSHMT cooperates with mSHMT and GCS to transfer one-carbon units from mitochondria to the cytosol (5Cybulski R.L. Fisher R.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3183-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the degradation of glycine by GCS appears to be usually associated with synthesis of serine from another molecule of glycine. The SPT/AGT activity is essentially confined to the liver and shows a unique species-specific organelle distribution in mammals, based on their food habits. In carnivores such as dog, this enzyme is largely located in mitochondria, whereas in humans and herbivores such as rabbit, it is entirely peroxisomal (6Takada Y. Noguchi T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 72B: 597-604Google Scholar, 7Noguchi T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7598-7600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Danpure C.J. Guttridge K.M. Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop J. Purdue P.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 669-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rat liver, its activity is detected in both the organelles, but only the mitochondrial activity is induced by glucagon, as a result of alternative transcription initiation from two sites on a single gene and selective stimulation by cAMP of the transcription from the upstream start site (9Oda T. Funai T. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7513-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Uchida C. Funai T. Oda T. Ohbayashi K. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8849-8856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major physiological roles of peroxisomal SPT/AGT is catalysis of the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. This view is supported by the overproduction of oxalate in primary hyperoxaluria type 1, an inborn error of glyoxylate metabolism caused by a functional deficiency of peroxisomal SPT/AGT (11Danpure C.J. Purdue P.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2385-2424Google Scholar). Mitochondrial SPT/AGT has been presumed, mainly because of its induction by glucagon (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Kitagawa Y. Sugimoto E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 52: 276-282Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), to participate in gluconeogenesis, but supporting evidence is still insufficient, and whether peroxisomal SPT/AGT is involved in serine metabolism, in addition to its role in the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine, has not been studied so far. SDH is largely confined to the liver and located solely in the cytosol. The liver SDH activity is known to be inversely related to body size in higher animals (13Rowsell E.V. Carnie J.A. Wahbi S.D. Al-Tai A.H. Rowsell K.V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 63B: 543-555Google Scholar). In the rat, therefore, its activity is fairly high and induced under some gluconeogenic conditions (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, its substantial contribution to the metabolism of l-serine has been questioned, despite the high activity in rat liver, mainly because of its very highK m (50–70 mm) for l-serine, and indeed the results of experiments involving14C-serine (14Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 13: 380-392Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) argued against this possibility. Flux of the l-serine metabolism through the different pathways had been studied mainly in rat liver and in the 1970s, when the knowledge of SPT/AGT was not sufficient. It is possible from the considerations mentioned above that l-serine metabolism in different animal species shows distinct patterns, and thus investigation of this subject is necessary and intriguing. Such work was initiated focusing on the relative contributions of the three pathways, the SDH and SPT/AGT pathways and that involving SHMT and GCS (Fig. 1). This paper deals with the l-serine metabolism in rat liver in vitro and in vivo. The metabolism ofl-serine in the livers of other animal species will be described in an accompanying paper. DISCUSSIONSHMT, SDH, and SPT/AGT are known to be the three major enzymes involved in the hepatic metabolism of l-serine, but the situation of SHMT appears to be different from those of the latter two enzymes. Because both serine and glycine are physiologically important amino acids that are used in a variety of ways in the cells, their intracellular concentration should be maintained in a given range, and cSHMT and mSHMT together with GCS are thought to play crucial roles in the interconversion between serine and glycine. The equilibrium of the cSHMT-catalyzed reaction appears to lie far on the side of the glycine formation in vivo, and when glycine is to be converted to serine such as in the case of gluconeogenesis from glycine, this conversion may be accomplished mainly by mSHMT in conjugation with GCS, which supplies 5,10-methylene-THF to mSHMT at the expense of another molecule of glycine. The intracellular partitioning of the serine and glycine interconversion in the liver was suggested by the observation by Yoshida and Kikuchi (38Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 35: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that in a congenital hyperglycinemia patient deficient in GCS, the level of blood serine was in the normal range, whereas those of glycine in the blood and urine were elevated far above the normal. It was also reported that decarboxylation of [1-14C]glycine by liver mitochondrial suspensions or homogenate is accompanied by the formation of nearly an equimolar quantity of [14C]serine (3Kikuchi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Considering a role of GCS to be the disposal of glycine and serine in addition to its role in supplying C1 unit-substituted THF derivatives in mitochondria, the roles of SPT/AGT and SDH as the metabolic exits of serine and glycine are analogous to that of GCS rather than SHMT. Indeed, we observed in experiments with an SDH-depleted reconstituted cytoplasmic extract that the conversion of l-serine to glycine occurred fairly rapidly, in part owing to the lowK m of cSHMT for l-serine, followed by the GCS-catalyzed slow decarboxylation of [1-14C]glycine formed.When the flux of the serine and glycine metabolism through SDH, SPT/AGT, and GCS was compared in rat liver, the flux through SDH was shown to be the largest, contrary to the general understanding that SDH may not play a substantial role because of its very highK m for its substrate. In in vitroexperiments, the amount of l-serine metabolized through the SDH pathway, as evidenced by the pyruvate formation with the soluble fraction, far exceeded those in the cases of the SPT/AGT pathway and GCS pathway under every condition used. Under quasi-physiological conditions with 1 mml-serine and 0.25 mm pyruvate, the contribution of the SDH pathway was estimated to be 89–98% in both 24-h starved and glucagon-treated rat livers (Table III). Calculation of the contribution of individual pathways from the results of in vitro experiments alone could be misleading because of the inevitable deviation from physiological conditions. However, in this study in vivo and perfusion experiments performed withl-[3-3H,14C]serine as the substrate also indicated that gluconeogenesis from l-serine proceeds almost entirely via pyruvate in 48 h-starved rat liver. Even when the hepatic activity of SPT/AGT had been elevated 6–10-fold by glucagon administration, the flux through pyruvate was estimated to account for ∼80–90% of the gluconeogenesis (Table IV). It should be mentioned that the results obtained in this study reflect the situation after 24–48 h starvation when the SDH activity has been augmented 2–3-fold (39Sallach H.J. Sanborn T.A. Bruin W.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Beliveau G.P Freedland R.A. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Bhatia S.C. Bhatia S. Rous S. Life Sci. 1975; 17: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but because the flux through SDH measured in vitro under the quasi-physiological conditions far exceeded those through SPT/AGT and GCS (Table III), the predominant role of SDH in the disposal of serine in rat liver may be held true for non-starved conditions.It is also noteworthy that SPT/AGT was shown, in this study, to be actually involved in the metabolism of l-serine in the livers of glucagon-treated rats, although its contribution was rather small. The relative flow of serine through SDH and SPT/AGT in rat liver has been studied mainly by the use of inhibitors of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase such as quinolinate and 3-mercaptopicolinate, and a contribution of the SPT/AGT pathway has been suggested from the observations that these inhibitors had less effect on gluconeogenesis from serine than from lactate or alanine (2Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 40Beliveau G.P Freedland R.A. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Bhatia S.C.

Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although controversial results were also reported (44Chan T.M. Freedland R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Sandoval I.V. Soles A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 46Mendes-Mourauo J. Halestrap A.P. Crisp D.M. Pogson C.I. FEBS Lett. 1975; 53: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results agree with a study by Snell (47Snell K. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) on gluconeogenesis from serine in the suckling rat in that the contribution of the SPT/AGT-initiated pathway was notable under conditions in which the hepatic SPT/AGT activity increased.The predominant role of SDH in the metabolism of l-serine reported in this paper does not mean that l-serine is actively metabolized by SDH in rat liver. Aikawa et al. (48Aikawa T. Matsutaka H. Yamamoto H. Okuda T. Ishikawa E. Kawano T. Matsumura E. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 1003-1017PubMed Google Scholar,49Aikawa T. Matsutaka H. Yakezawa K. Ishikawa E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 179: 234-244Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that alanine contributes most to hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acids in starved rats in vivo, and the contribution of serine is far less. Their results are in accordance with the fact that the activity of alanine aminotransferase is six to eight times higher than that of SDH in rat liver, and in addition theK m of SDH for l-serine is as high as 50–70 mm. It appears that l-serine is relatively inert as a substrate for energy metabolism in rat liver.As for the mechanism by which ATP/Mg2+ stimulates the decarboxylation of [1-14C]pyruvate in mitochondria, we assume that when pyruvate is supplied to mitochondria in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and HCO3−, it is readily carboxylated to oxaloacetate in addition to its oxidation to acetyl-CoA. A portion of the oxaloacetate thus formed is converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase with the concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD+, and another portion is converted to citrate by citrate synthase in conjugation with the release of CoASH. The NAD+ and CoASH thus formed may then enhance the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, allowing the efficient decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which in turn activates carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. In support of this view, Pande and Parvin (50Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1565-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that the α-cyanocinnamate-sensitive uptake of pyruvate into mitochondria requires concurrent oxidation of pyruvate, and they also believe that the CoASH and NAD+ present in mitochondria are able to support the oxidation of pyruvate.

B cell-specific activator protein (BSAP), a transcription factor that silences J chaintranscription, has been identified as a nuclear target of the IL-2 signal. The levels of BSAP progressively decrease in response to IL-2 and this change correlates with the differentiation of B cells into antibody secreting plasma cells. Here we report the binding of the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) to an E-box motif immediately upstream from the BSAP site on the J chain promoter. Mutations in the USF binding motif significantly decrease J chain promoter activity in J chain expressing B cell lines. We also show that a functional relationship exists between USF and a second J chain positive-regulating factor, B-MEF2, using co-immunoprecipitation assays and transfections. Finally, we provide evidence that the binding of BSAP prevents USF and B-MEF2 from interacting with the J chain promoter during the antigen-independent stages of B cell development. It is not until the levels of BSAP decrease during the antigen-driven stages of B cell development that both USF and B-MEF2 are able to bind to their respective promoter elements and activate J chaintranscription.

During a primary immune response to foreign antigens, mature B cells become activated and differentiate into pentamer IgM-secreting plasma cells. One of the critical events in this process is the synthesis of the immunoglobulin J chain protein required for the assembly and secretion of pentamer IgM antibody (1Koshland M.E. Annu. Rev.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The factor interacting with the JA sequence has recently been identified to be a member of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) family that is expressed in the B cell lineage, denoted B-MEF2 (5Rao S. Karray S. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26123-26129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The JB element has previously been shown to interact with transcription factor PU.1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors expressed in hematopoietic lineages including monocytes, macrophages, and B lymphoid cells (6Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses in J chain positive cell lines have indicated positive regulatory roles for both PU.1 and B-MEF2; base changes that prevent either PU.1 or B-MEF2 from binding result in a 95% loss of promoter activity (5Rao S. Karray S. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26123-26129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The activity mediated by the JC motif has been shown to be due to the binding of the transcription factor B cellspecific activator protein (BSAP), or Pax-5 (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). BSAP/Pax-5 is a member of the Pax family of transcription factors, which are important regulators of embryonic cell development and differentiation. Targeted gene disruption experiments have shown that BSAP expression is essential both for B cell development as well as development of the nervous system (8Strachan T. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 9Busslinger M. Urbanek P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). BSAP is highly expressed during the early stages of B cell development, but expression ceases during the antigen-driven stages of B cell development. BSAP is considered a “master regulator” of B cell development, and at least eight B cell-specific putative target genes have been identified so far (10Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. Science. 1998; 279: 1961-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Depending on the target gene, BSAP can act either as an activator, a repressor, or a docking protein (9Busslinger M. Urbanek P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Neurath M. Stuber E.R. Strober W. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 564-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Michaelson J.S. Singh M. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2349-2351PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the J chainpromoter, BSAP acts as a repressor: base changes in the BSAP-binding site result in a relief of repression in J chain negative cell lines (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An IL-2 or IL-5 signal delivered to mature B cells has been shown to cause a progressive decrease in BSAP transcripts that extends from the presecretor immunoblast through the plasma cell stages (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression inversely correlates with J chain expression. In addition to a role in J chain repression, a BSAP repression motif has also been identified in the 3′ α enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. Although the process of BSAP repression is not well understood, a possible mechanism has been suggested by in vivo footprinting studies by Neurath and colleagues (13Neurath M. Max E.E. Strober W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5336-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This work showed that although two BSAP sites exist in the immunoglobulin 3′ α enhancer, only the most 5′ site is occupied by BSAP in mature B cells. As expected, no BSAP footprint was detected in plasma cells, due to low levels of BSAP at this cell stage. Importantly, the authors identified a second factor, NF-αP, which bound to a position 50 bp downstream of the 5′ BSAP-binding site in plasma cells, but not in mature B cells. NF-αP, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, is expressed both in mature B and plasma cells, and is necessary for maximal activity of the 3′ α enhancer. Selective blocking of BSAP binding by triplex-forming oligonucleotides resulted in an NF-αP footprint in mature B cells and an increased level of immunoglobulin gene transcription. Thus, it appears that BSAP prevents NF-αP from activating the 3′ α enhancer until the plasma cell stage. In the work described here, a new DNA binding motif JE was identified at positions −140 to −132 of the J chain promoter. This sequence resembles the μE3 element of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer and the related κE3 element of the κ light chain enhancer (14Staudt L.M. Lenardo M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We show that the helix loop helix protein upstreamstimulatory factor (USF) binds to the J chain promoter at the JE motif and positively regulates J chain transcription. Recently, it was shown that USF increases the activity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene intron enhancer, in combination with two other factors, PU.1 and Ets-1 (15Rao E. Dang W. Tian G. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6722-6732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, USF factors have been shown to interact with members of the basal initiation complex (16Kokubo T. Takada R. Yamashita S. Gong D.W. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17554-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We show here that USF may, at least in part, be mediating its positive effect on J chaintranscription through a mechanism which necessitates interaction with B-MEF2. Although these positive-acting factors are both expressed throughout B cell development, it appears that they are only able to bind weakly to the J chain promoter in the presence of BSAP. This may provide a mechanism which ensures repression of J chain transcription until the activated B cell stages. As BSAP levels decrease during that time, USF and B-MEF2 replace BSAP on theJ chain promoter and this results in activation of transcription. PD31, 38C13, K46R, BCL1, and L cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. MOPC315 and S194 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above. Large-scale extracts were prepared from 109 cells by the detergent lysis method of Peterson et al. (18Peterson C.L. Orth K. Calame K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4168-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as modified by Lansfordet al. (4Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.S. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All buffers contained the following mixture of protease inhibitors: 0.5 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmNa2S205, aprotinin (10 units/ml), leupeptin (5 mg/ml), and pepstatin A (5 mg/ml). Mini-extracts were prepared from 107 cells as described (19McFadden H.J. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11027-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Probes and DNA competitors used: J1, nt −83 to −9; J2, nt −168 to −84; JA:, −74 to −60; JB, nt −58 to −47; JC, nt −127 to −110; JE, nt −140 to −132 of the J chain promoter. For gel mobility shift assays, the specific oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding reactions with crude nuclear extracts were performed as described previously (19McFadden H.J. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11027-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using 8–10 μg of extract, 4–6 μg of poly(dI-dC) nonspecific competitor, and 104 cpm (0.1–1.0 ng) of probe. For the antibody gel shift assays, crude nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μl of a 1:10 dilution of either rabbit preimmune sera or polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse USF-2 antiserum which is specific for one of the two subunits of USF (p44) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In each case the protein-DNA complexes formed were resolved from free probe by electrophoresis through glycerol-containing 5% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) containing 0.25 × TBE buffer. Methylation protection footprinting was performed with crude nuclear extracts from the mature B cell line, K46R; 50 μg of nuclear protein was incubated 15 min at 0 °C with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 106 cpm of DNA probe. One-half microliter of dimethylsulfate was added for 45 s and quenched by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 23 mm. The remaining steps in the assay, isolation and sequencing of free and protein-bound DNA, were performed according to the standard protocol for methylation interference footprinting (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The probe J2 was an 84-bp XbaI/HindIII fragment containing the J chain sequence −168 to −84 that was end-labeled on the top or bottom strand. In the pγ42CassI vector (24Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) the CAT gene is under control of a truncated γ-fibrinogen promoter (−54 to +36) that includes a TATA box and a single Sp1-binding site. Fragments from the J chain promoter (J1, bps −83 to −9; J2, bps −168 to −84; J1-J2, bps −168 to −9) and oligonucleotides representing the JE element were synthesized withXbaI linkers and inserted either singly or in multiple copies into the polylinker upstream of the γ-fibrinogen promoter. All constructs were sequenced to determine oligomer copy number and orientation. Mutagenesis of the pγ42CassI plasmid containing the J1-J2 sequence and the XBμ plasmid was performed with the TransformerTMSite Directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECHLaboratories). The sequence 5′-CGTAAGTATGAACAATCTTCGTCTTTCCAGTGTAGC-3′ (mJE) was used to introduce a 3-bp change in the JE element (the underlined region replaces the wt sequence CATGTG, see “Results”). The selected plasmid was sequenced to verify the base substitutions. Mutations introduced into the JC motif have been described previously (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of PD31 pre-B cells were performed by the DEAE-dextran technique (22Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1985; 41: 885-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and transfections of MOPC315 myeloma cells by electroporation (23Neurath M. Strober W. Wakatsuki Y. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 730-742PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, 107 cells in logarithmic growth phase were transfected with 9 μg of supercoiled test plasmid or a combination of plasmids. Cell extracts were prepared 44–48 h after transfection and assayed for CAT activity (4Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.S. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation reactions using antibody-Sepharose, were performed according to the standard protocol (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, nuclear extract samples were boiled for 5 min, size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. After pretreatment with 5% dry milk in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, the filters were incubated for 3 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of antibody specific for BSAP, PU.1, MEF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), or USF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The filters were then washed 3 times with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After three 1 × phosphate-buffered saline washes, the filters were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham). J chain transcription has been shown to be regulated by at least two positive elements and one repressor element on its promoter (4Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.S. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Rao S. Karray S. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To investigate whether additional inducible elements are present which are necessary for regulation of J chain transcription, deletion analyses of the 5′ region of the minimal J chain promoter was performed. The constructs used for the deletion analyses have been described previously and were generated through progressive 5′ deletions of upstream J chain sequences from the hypersensitive region (4Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.S. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These fragments were tested for their ability to drive expression of the CAT gene, as shown in Fig. 1 (4Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.S. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition to J chain promoter sequences and the CAT gene, each of the constructs also contained the intronic immunoglobulin μE, inserted downstream of the CAT gene in opposite transcriptional orientation (24Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The μE sequences were included because levels of CAT expression obtained with constructs lacking a heterologous enhancer were too low to yield reliable values. The constructs were transiently transfected into the J chain-expressing and IgA-secreting myeloma MOPC315, and assayed for CAT activity (Fig. 1). Data obtained from transfection of these constructs into the J chain-silent pre-B cell line PD31 has been shown previously (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and is shown here for the purpose of comparison. First we compared the relative CAT activity of MOPC315 cells with theJ chain negative and BSAP positive pre-B cell line PD31. Transfection of the −192 construct containing the entire hypersensitive region resulted in approximately 50-fold higher CAT activity in MOPC315 cells compared with PD31 cells, in agreement with activity of the J chain promoter in plasma cell lines, but not in early B cell lines (data not shown). Deletion of base pairs from −192 to −136 led to an 85% decrease in J chain promoter activity in MOPC315 cells, as shown in Fig. 1. This suggested the presence of a positive regulatory element, denoted JE, located at the 5′ distal portion of the hypersensitive site, upstream from the previously identified JC motif (Fig. 1). Finally, we found that further deletion of the promoter element from −135 to −76 did not cause any additional change in CAT activity (Fig. 1). This is not surprising since the repressive factor BSAP that binds to the JC motif (base pairs −127 to −110), is undetectable in MOPC315 cells (13Neurath M. Max E.E. Strober W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5336-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, as had been identified previously, evidence for BSAP repression is observed in the BSAP-containing and J chain negative PD31 cells, where removal of the JC binding motif (nt −136 to −76) resulted in an increased CAT activity (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Next we examined the presence of a putative factor NF-JE that could interact with the JE element on the J chainpromoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using a DNA fragment covering bps −168 to −84 of the J chain promoter (J2) as a probe. This probe contains the JC and JE elements, but not the JA or JB elements (see Fig. 1). Distinct binding patterns were observed using nuclear extracts from the immature B cell line 38C.13, the mature B cell line K46R, the B presecretor BCL1, the plasmacytoma lines S194 and MOPC315, the fibroblast line L (Fig.2 A), and the pre-B cell line PD31 (not shown). Only S194 and MOPC315 express the J chain. The EMSA pattern showed three complexes on the gels. The fastest migrating band (complex 1) was detected only in extracts from 38C.13, K46R, BCL1 (Fig. 2 A, arrow 1), and PD31 (not shown). This suggested that this complex contained BSAP, based on the presence of a BSAP-binding site on this probe (JC) and its pattern of expression in the B cell lineage (see below). An intermediate migrating complex (complex 2) was detected in all cell lines of the B cell lineage (Fig.2 A, arrow 2), but not in L cells. The relative amounts of the two complexes varied between early and late B cell lines: early B cell lines had high levels of complex 1, but low levels of complex 2. In contrast, the two plasmacytoma lines had very low or undetectable levels of complex 1, but high levels of complex 2. All cell lines tested showed a slow migrating complex which could not be competed with excess unlabeled J2 DNA and thus represents nonspecific (NS) protein-probe complexes (Fig. 2 A, arrow NS). The complexes 1 and 2 (Fig. 2 A, arrows 1 and 2) were analyzed further using competition EMSAs and nuclear extracts from the pre-B cell line PD31. The unlabeled double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotides JB (nt −58 to −47) and JC (nt −127 to −110), were used as competitors and contain the PU.1 and BSAP-binding sites, respectively. As expected, the JB competitor was unable to compete for binding with either complex. The JC oligonucleotide was able to prevent binding of BSAP to the J2 probe (Fig. 2 B, arrow 1), but could not compete with the second, slower migrating complex (Fig.2 B, arrow 2). In contrast, this second complex was specifically competed by a second double-stranded oligonucleotide JE, which covers −140 to −132 of the J chain promoter. To analyze the JE region further, we performed copper phenanthroline and methylation protection footprinting using the J2 probe (Fig.3). The retained band corresponding to the JE region gave an extended footprint on the noncoding strand (Fig.3 A) from bp −138 through the BSAP-binding site to bp −124 (which also contained a footprint). The coding strand showed protection in the 5′ region of the noncoding strand footprint (Fig. 3 B) in the region between bp −138 through −134. These results are in agreement with a putative factor NF-JE binding to this region of theJ chain promoter. To search for possible candidates for NF-JE, known consensus DNA-binding motifs were compared with the sequence in the JE region. One motif that contained high homology to the sequence recognized by NF-JE (CATGTG) was one recognized by E-box family proteins, particularly the μE3 (CACATG) and κE3 (CATGTG) motifs present on the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain intron enhancer and κ light chain enhancer, respectively (14Staudt L.M. Lenardo M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 25Beckmann H. Su L.-K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 26Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). To test whether NF-JE represents an E-box factor, EMSAs were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against one of the two subunits of USF, namely USF-2. When tested with PD31 nuclear extracts this antiserum was able to block NF-JE binding to the JE oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 4, lane 4). Next, we tested whether mutation of the core binding sequence for E-box proteins would result in prevention of binding of the factor NF-JE, using competition EMSAs. A mutant JE oligonucleotide (mJE) was synthesized containing a 3-base pair mutation in the region corresponding to the consensus E motif CANNTG (changing CATGTG to AATCTT). We found that the NF·JE complex could not be inhibited by this mutant JE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lane 2). In Fig.2 B we already showed that a wt JE oligonucleotide could compete with this complex. DNA-protein complexes were not observed when the mJE oligonucleotide was used as a labeled probe (data not shown). Together, these findings provide evidence that NF-JE represents the helix loop helix transcription factor USF and will be referred to as such hereafter. To determine the contribution of the JE element toJ chain transcription in vivo, we performed transient transfections in the J chain-expressing plasma cell line MOPC315, using either a wild-type (wt) or mutated J chainpromoter (bp −1150 to +88) driving expression of a CAT reporter gene. The mutated J chain promoter contained a 3-bp replacement mutation of the JE sequence, mJE (see Fig. 4 and text). Comparison of relative CAT activity between wt and mutated constructs revealed a 66% reduction in CAT activity in the JE-mutated J chainpromoter, as shown in Fig. 5 A. This is in agreement with the 5′ deletion studies (Fig. 1) and indicates that JE represents a positive regulatory element on theJ chain promoter. To determine whether the JE element can act as an independent activator of transcription, the truncated rat γ-fibrinogen promoter was used to drive expression of a CAT reporter gene (pγ42CassI). This vector has basal promoter activity in J chain-expressing myeloma lines (24Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two or three copies of the wild-type JE sequence were cloned into the pγ42CassI construct, and the JE constructs transfected into MOPC315 cells. The presence of the JE sequences had no effect on the activity of the truncated rat γ-fibrinogen promoter, suggesting that the NF-JE factor needs to be in the context of other, J chain-specific regulatory factors in order to have transcriptional activity (Fig.5 B, bottom two constructs). We next examined the effect of the JE element in the context of other known J chain promoter regulatory motifs. For these analyses, the following sequences were inserted into the pγ42CassI vector upstream of the minimal γ-fibrinogen promoter: the J1-J2 fragment (bp −168 to −9, which contains all four regulatory motifs JA, JB, JC, and JE), the J1-J2 fragment with a mutant JE-binding site (J1-J2mE), J1-J2 with a mutant JC site (J1-J2mC), the J2 fragment alone (bp −168 to −84, which contains the JC and JE motif only), the J2 fragment with a mutant JE site (J2mE), and the J2 fragment with a mutant JC site. A 4-bp mutation (underlined sequences) changes CAGTGTAGCATGCAGT to CAGTGTAGGTCACAGT in the JC motif and this results in the absence of BSAP binding to this region (7Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J. Johnson K.W. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These constructs were then transfected into MOPC315 cells. The constructs containing J1 as well as both JC and JE (J1-J2 and the J1-J2mC) induced a 5- and 5.5-fold increase in the basal"
https://openalex.org/W1975939181,"Mutations activating the function of ras proto-oncogenes are often observed in human tumors. Their oncogenic potential is mainly due to permanent stimulation of cellular proliferation and dramatic changes in morphogenic reactions of the cell. To learn more on the role of ras activation in cancerogenesis we studied its effects on chromosome stability and cell cycle checkpoints. Since the ability of ras oncogenes to cause cell transformation may be dependent on activity of the p53 tumor-suppressor the cells with different p53 state were analysed. Ectopic expression of N-ras(asp12) caused in p53-deficient MDAH041 cell line an augmentation in the number of chromosome breaks in mitogenic cells, significant increase in the frequency of metaphases showing chromosome endoreduplication and accumulation of polyploid cells. Similar effects were induced by different exogenous ras genes (N-ras(asp12), H-ras(leu12), N-ras proto-oncogene) in Rat1 and Rat2 cells which have a defect in p53-upstream pathways. In contrast, in REF52 and human LIM1215 cells showing ras-induced p53 up-regulation, ras expression caused only slight increase in the number of chromosome breaks and did not enhance the frequency of endoreduplication and polyploidy. Inactivation in these cells of p53 function by transduction of dominant-negative C-terminal p53 fragment (genetic suppressor element #22, GSE22) or mutant p53s significantly increased the frequency of both spontaneous and ras-induced karyotypic changes. In concordance with these observations we have found that expression of ras oncogene caused in p53-defective cells further mitigation of ethyl-metansulphonate-induced G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest, but did not abrogate G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints in cells with normal p53 function. These data indicate that along with stimulation of cell proliferation and morphological transformation ras activation can contribute to cancerogenesis by increasing genetic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2088932718,"Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that is broadly distributed within the brain, pituitary, and gonads. Its substrate specificity includes a number of physiologically important neuropeptides such as neurotensin, bradykinin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, the principal regulatory peptide for reproduction. In studying the structure and function of EP24.15, we have employed in vitro mutagenesis and subsequent protein expression to genetically dissect the enzyme and allow us to glean insight into the mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. Comparison of the sequence of EP24.15 with bacterial homologues previously solved by x-ray crystallography and used as models for mammalian metalloendopeptidases, indicates conserved residues. The active site of EP24.15 exhibits an HEXXH motif, a common feature of zinc metalloenzymes. Mutations have confirmed the importance, for binding and catalysis, of the residues (His473, Glu474, and His477) within this motif. A third putative metal ligand, presumed to coordinate directly to the active site zinc ion in concert with His473and His477, has been identified as Glu502. Conservative alterations to these residues drastically reduces enzymatic activity against both a putative physiological substrate and a synthetic quenched fluorescent substrate as well as binding of the specific active site-directed inhibitor,N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate, the binding of which we have shown to be dependent upon the presence, and possibly coordination, of the active site zinc ion. These studies contribute to a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism of EP24.15 and will aid in rational design of inhibitors and pharmacological agents for this class of enzymes.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), EP24.15 is a predominantly soluble, 77-kDa, thiol-sensitive enzyme that preferentially cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of hydrophobic amino acid residues. A hydrophobic or bulky residue in the P2 and P3′ positions relative to the scissile P1-P1′ bond (nomenclature of Schecter and Berger (5Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar)) further contributes to substrate binding and catalytic efficiency (6Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Orlowski M. Reznik S. Ayala J. Pierotti A.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Most EP24.15 activity is known to be located in brain, pituitary, and gonads (8Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Within the central nervous system, EP24.15 exhibits a widespread distribution with high levels observed in areas rich in neuropeptide content such as anterior pituitary, cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus (8Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Healy D.P. Orlowski M. Brain Res. 1992; 571: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a potential role for EP24.15 in the metabolism of bioactive peptides. Of particular interest to this laboratory is the decapeptide substrate GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), the master regulatory peptide for reproduction. Several studies have previously documented the ability of EP24.15 to cleave GnRH at the Tyr5–Gly6 bond in vitro (consistent with its aforementioned substrate specificity) (6Orlowski M. Michaud C.

By using the competitive, specific active site-directed inhibitor, cFP-AAF-pAB (N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate) (12Orlowski M. Michaud C. Molineaux C.J.

Other physiologically active peptides such as neurotensin and bradykinin are also cleaved at sites consistent with the substrate specificity of EP24.15 (6Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Orlowski M. Reznik S. Ayala J. Pierotti A.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This enzyme has also been shown to generate Leu- and Met-enkephalin from larger proenkephalin- and prodynorphin-derived precursors such as dynorphin A1–8, α- and β-neoendorphin, metorphamide, and Leu-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu (8Chu T.G.

Neurochem. 1990; 55: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and to cleave the endogenous opioid receptor-like ligand, nociceptin/orphanin FQ, a recently identified heptadecapeptide structurally resembling dynorphin A (18Montiel J.L. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Florence N. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). EP24.15 has further been implicated in the secretase processing of the wild type and mutant forms of β-amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (19McDermott J.R. Biggins J.A. Gibson A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 185: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Papastoitsis G. Siman R. Scott R. Abraham C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Ripellino J.A. Crack P.J. Blum M. Gorevic P.D. Glucksman M.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 1998; 24: 1006Google Scholar). This latter implication is unusual given its general preference for oligopeptides. The three-dimensional structure of EP24.15, or indeed any other mammalian metalloendopeptidase of this class, is currently unknown. Conversely, the structures of three related bacterial zinc metalloendopeptidases, thermolysin (22Holmes M.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), bacterial elastase (23Thayer M.M. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2864-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and neutral protease (24Stark W. Pauptit R.A. Wilson K.S. Jansonius J.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), have previously been solved by x-ray crystallographic analysis to a resolution of greater than 2 Å. The mechanism of catalysis in these metalloenzymes centers upon an active site zinc ion coordinated to three amino acid side chains and a water molecule (1Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 25Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 26Matthews B.W. Jansonius J.N. Colman P.M. Schoenborn B.P. Dupourque D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 249: 8030-8044Google Scholar, 27Oyama K. Kihara K. Nonaka Y. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1981; 2: 356-361Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Kunugi S. Hirohara H. Ise N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A zinc-binding nucleus is typically provided by two ligands separated by a short spacer of 1–3 amino acids. A third ligand, separated from the second by 20–120 amino acids, completes the coordination sphere with a long polypeptide loop that further aligns protein residues with the active site zinc. A fourth residue, located between the first two ligands, subsequently forms hydrogen bonds with a water molecule, thereby enabling the oxygen to coordinate directly to the zinc ion. The hydrolytic efficiency of zinc metalloenzymes is critically dependent on the nucleophilicity of this activated water molecule, the lone electron pair from oxygen serving to attack an approaching substrate carbonyl carbon. Sequence comparison reveals that a number of key amino acid residues known to be involved in this catalytic mechanism in the aforementioned bacterial enzymes are conserved within a similar sequential context within the carboxyl half of EP24.15 and other mammalian homologues (Fig. 1). These include an HEXXH motif (the histidines representing the first and second ligands, respectively, and the glutamate providing the activated water molecule) in addition to a glutamate residue 20 amino acids carboxyl to this motif (possibly representing the third zinc ligand). 2M.

A similar ligand configuration is also evident in the primary structures of other mammalian zinc metalloenzymes such as EP24.11 (29Devault A. Sales V. Nault C. Beaumont A. Roques B. Crine P. Boileau G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Le Moual H. Devault A. Roques B.P. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15670-15674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EP24.16 (neurolysin) (3Dauche P. Vincent J.-P. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27266-27271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and ACE (31Williams T.A. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29430-29434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess further the functional importance of these residues in EP24.15, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding rat EP24.15 (32Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to prepare mutants in which residues comprising the HEXXH motif (His473, Glu474, and His477) and residues postulated to function as the third zinc ligand (Glu497, Glu502, and Glu537) have been genetically substituted. Alterations in the kinetic parameters of EP24.15 mutants compared with wild type were quantitated using both a physiologic substrate, GnRH1–9 (11Smith A.I. Tetaz T. Roberts J.L. Glucksman M.J. Clarke I.J. Lew R.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Lew R.A. Tetaz T.J. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a model quenched fluorescent substrate, QFS (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)). Furthermore, the competitive EP24.15-specific active site-directed inhibitor, cFP-AAY-pAB (12Orlowski M. Michaud C. Molineaux C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was employed as a probe to assess the three-dimensional integrity of the catalytic site in both wild type and mutant enzymes. These studies have been conducted in parallel with the ongoing structural determination of EP24.15 and are crucial in assessing its catalytic mechanism and role with respect to bioactive neuropeptide substrates. These are among the first such studies to address the structural organization of this enzyme and to indicate the important differences that exist within this class of peptidases. Bradford protein assay reagent and Bio-Gel HT hydroxyapatite were purchased from Bio-Rad; BSA was obtained from Pierce; QFS was obtained from Auspep (Victoria, Australia); Mca-Pro-Leu standard was from Calbiochem; DTT (dithiothreitol) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; Chameleon mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); all reaction buffers, restriction and modification enzymes, were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); T7 Sequenase was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; QIAprep spin plasmid preparation kit was from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA); unless otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Utilizing the computer algorithms, CLUSTAL (34Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) and BESTFIT (35Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11535) Google Scholar), the protein sequences of EP24.15 and the bacterial homologues, thermolysin, bacterial elastase, and neutral protease, were compared as described previously2 to obtain homology between functional domains and key conserved catalytic residues. Double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis of rat EP24.15 was performed on the EP24.15 expression vector pGEX-24.15, modified for rapid screening of mutations by addition of a unique restriction endonuclease site (EcoRI) that replaces the vectors sole ApaI restriction site (36Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 296-316Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with mismatches coding for the appropriate amino acid change (Table I) but following prokaryotic codon usage rules to obviate the use of rare codons that may hinder subsequent protein expression. Mutant and selection primers, phosphorylated at the 5′-end, were annealed to the double-stranded expression vector before being extended and ligated in a single reaction. The resulting plasmid DNA was selected for theApaI to EcoRI mutation, transformed into repair-deficient XLMutS bacterial cells, and selected for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA was subsequently purified (QIAprep spin plasmid kit) and subjected to a further round of selection for theApaI to EcoRI mutation before being transformed into XL1-Blue bacterial cells and screened for ampicillin resistance. Purified plasmid DNA (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was cleaved with EcoRI to screen for desired mutations. Putative positives were confirmed by double-stranded template dideoxy sequencing (38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52511) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the mutant proteins for biochemical characterization were as described previously (36Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 296-316Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with all enzymes stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The reproducibility of the mutagenesis procedure was also addressed in this study. To this end, EP24.15 wild type and a selection of mutants were re-prepared from bacterial glycerol stocks and assayed (as described below), yielding very similar kinetic trends.Table IOligonucleotide primers for mutagenesisMutationOligonucleotide primer (5′ to 3′)Base changeHEXXH motifH473A1402GTGGAGACCTACTTCGCCGAGTTCGGGCACG1432CA ≫ GCH473Q1404GGAGACCTACTTCCAGGAGTTCGGGCACGTC1434C ≫ GE474D1409CCTACTTCCACGACTTCGGGCACGTC1434G ≫ CE474Q1407GACCTACTTCCACCAGTTCGGGCACG1432G ≫ CH477A1413CTTCCACGAGTTCGGGGCCGTCATGCACCAGC1434CA ≫ GCH477Q1417CACGAGTTCGGGCAGGTCATGCACCAGCTCTG1448C ≫ GThird zinc ligandE497D1475GTGGGACCCACGTGGACCGGGACTTTGTGG1504G ≫ CE497Q1475GTGGGACCCACGTGCAGCGGGACTTTGTGG1504G ≫ CE502D1492CGGGACTTTGTGGACGCACCGTCACAGATG1521G ≫ CE502Q1489GAGCGGGACTTTGTGCAGGCACCGTCACAG1518G ≫ CE537Q1595CTGAGGACCTCCTGCAGAAGCTCATCA1621G ≫ CIn column one, the first letter of the mutant designation indicates the amino acid present in the wild type protein; the number is the position in the sequence, and the last letter represents the newly substituted amino acid.

Base changes (column three) were designed to obey prokaryotic codon usage rules to obviate use of rare codons which may hinder subsequent expression of the mutants. Assessment of purification to homogeneity, yield, and proper folding of expressed proteins was by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on an 8% gel under reducing conditions as described previously (39Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15945) Google Scholar). Yields of expressed protein were similar for all of the mutations. To determine if gross structural alterations occurred during mutagenesis and subsequent protein expression, selected mutants displaying a substantial decrease in catalytic and inhibitor binding capacity were examined by CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were collected in the wavelength range of 300 to 185 nm at 0.2-nm intervals with an AVIV 60DS spectropolarimeter (AVIV Instruments, Lakewood, NJ). The instrument wavelength was checked with benzene vapor. Optical rotation was calibrated by measuring the ellipticity of d10-camphorsulfonic acid at 192.5 and 290 nm. Measurements of optical ellipticity were made at 25 °C using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. At least eight reproducible scans were collected for each sample. Buffer alone was used for a control blank in these experiments. Secondary structure estimation of the proteins was performed using data in the wavelength range of 240 to 190 nm by an unconstrained linear least squares fitting procedure (40Mao D. Wachter R. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and using a reference data base from 15 water soluble proteins of known secondary structure, including thermolysin (41Chang C.R. Wu C.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Activity of EP24.15 wild type and mutants was determined in duplicate in a high pressure liquid chromatography-based single point assay using as substrate the deamidated GnRH metabolite, GnRH1–9, proposed to be a physiologic substrate for EP24.15 (11Smith A.I.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (cleaved to yield GnRH1–5 and GnRH6–9). Substrate and product peaks were previously identified by coelution with known standards. Briefly, 2–5 ng of recombinant EP24.15 was incubated at 37 °C with a GnRH1–9 concentration range of 10–100 μm(begins above the average K m of 5.1 μmobserved for this substrate with EP24.15 wild type) in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, 125 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm DTT, pH 7.5) in a final volume of 150 μl. Reactions were terminated after 15 min with the addition of 150 μl of methanol containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid. GnRH1–5 product was measured using a Waters high pressure liquid chromatography system (Milford, CT) with absorbance detection at 214 nm. Solvents were filtered and degassed before use (solvent A, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid + 70% acetonitrile). Samples were eluted at 1 ml/min from a Delta-Pak C-18 reversed-phase column (Waters) by a linear gradient from 3 to 85% solvent B over 15 min with flow being maintained at 85% solvent B for a further 2 min. Enzyme activities were determined from a GnRH1–5 standard curve prepared under identical assay conditions. Suitable negative controls were included in each assay. Total substrate hydrolysis was less than 10%. Kinetic parameters (K m,V max, k cat, andk cat/K m) were subsequently evaluated using the double-reciprocal plot method of Lineweaver and Burk (42Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7963) Google Scholar). Activity of EP24.15 wild type and mutants was determined in duplicate by continuous assay using the quenched fluorescent substrate, QFS. Briefly, 50–75 ng of recombinant EP24.15 were incubated at 37 °C with 1.1 μm QFS in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, 125 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm DTT, pH 7.5) in a final volume of 1.27 ml. By employing a starting substrate concentration substantially below the estimatedK m for QFS, substrate hydrolysis obeys a first-order process and the Michaelis-Menten equation subsequently integrates to give the expression ln[S] = −(k obs)t + ln[S0] (where k obs =V max/K m). By monitoring substrate hydrolysis continuously, a plot of ln[S] versustime will generate a straight line, the slope of which equalsk obs. When divided by the enzyme concentration, this yields the specificity constant (k cat/K m). This method provides a rapid means for direct quantitation of the specificity constant for a fluorimetric substrate by continuous assay to monitor substrate hydrolysis (43Elmoujahed A. Gutman N. Brillard M. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 62Tipton K.E. Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 1-58Google Scholar). QFS hydrolysis was continuously monitored with the aid of a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B fluorescence spectrophotometer (South Plainfield, NJ) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively. Product formation was determined from an Mca-Pro-Leu standard curve prepared under identical assay conditions. Suitable negative controls were included in each assay. Total substrate hydrolysis was less than 10%. Binding of the competitive, specific active site-directed inhibitor, cFP-AAY-pAB (12Orlowski M. Michaud C. Molineaux C.J.

Briefly, 2 μg of enzyme was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 nm cFP-AAF-pAB containing 20,000 cpm of cFP-AA-125I-Y-pAB in a final buffer volume of 200 μl (0.3 mm DTT, 5 mm Sørensen's buffer, pH 7.2). Iodinated inhibitor was prepared via the IODO-GEN method (45Salacinski P.R.P. McLean C. Sykes J.E.C. Clement-Jones V.V. Lowry P.J. Anal.

Following incubation, an equal volume of hydroxyapatite resin, prepared and equilibrated as described previously (44Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A. Tullai J.W. Margulies E.H. Roberts J.L.

Each sample was subsequently centrifuged at 6500 × gfor 5 min, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet washed in 350 μl of the above buffer. This process was repeated a further two times. Total radioactive counts were determined in both the pellet and supernatants (3 supernatants) collected for each sample using a Packard Multi-Prias 4 gamma counter (Meriden, CT). Percentage inhibitor binding was calculated as (cpmpellet/cpmpellet+supernatants) × 100. Nonspecific inhibitor binding was estimated by replacing EP24.15 in the binding assay with a molar equivalent of BSA (bovine serum albumin) and was found to be less than 2%. Protein was quantitated according to the method of Bradford (46Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. Computer-aided homology searching between functional domains of EP24.15 with those of thermolysin, bacterial elastase, and neutral protease, bacterial homologues previously solved by x-ray crystallography, reveals conserved structural and catalytic elements. These include an HEXXH motif conserved within an active site α-helix (His473, Glu474, and His477 in EP24.15, equivalent to His142, Glu143, and His146 in thermolysin), and a glutamate residue, 20 amino acids carboxyl to this motif (Glu497 in EP24.15, equivalent to Glu166 in thermolysin) (Fig.1). A C-terminal four-helix bundle is also conserved among these metalloenzymes.2Site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding rat EP24.15 (32Pierotti A. Dong K.W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M.

Two additional glutamate residues carboxyl to the HEXXH motif, Glu502 and Glu537, were also mutated. The close proximity of Glu502 to Glu497, coupled with the earlier identification of Glu537 as the third zinc ligand in EP24.11 (equivalent to Glu646 in EP24.11) (30Le Moual H. Devault A. Roques B.P.

https://openalex.org/W1884260145,"The isoprostanes are a group of biologically active arachidonic acid metabolites initially thought to be formed under conditions of oxidative stress and independently of cyclooxygenase. However, recent studies have demonstrated isoprostane production under conditions in which cyclooxygenase is intentionally activated/induced. Here we describe for the first time formation of isoprostanes by human vascular cells via independent pathways of oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase induction. We compared the release of the isoprostane with that of the traditional prostaglandin, prostaglandin E2. Cyclooxygenase-2 induction was confirmed by Western blot. When cells were stimulated with cytokines, the release of isoprostanes was inhibited by the cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 inhibitor indomethacin as well by as the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor L-745,337. However, treatment of cells with the superoxide-producing enzyme xanthine oxidase also resulted in isoprostane release, which was not affected by cyclooxygenase inhibition, unlike PGE2 release under the same condition. Thus, two independent pathways relating to oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase-2 induction form isoprostanes. These findings may have particular importance in diseases such as sepsis and ARDS in which oxidant stress occurs and cyclooxygenase is induced.—Jourdan, K. B., Evans, T.

https://openalex.org/W1911487687,"Huntington's disease (HD) is one of a number of neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeats within specific genes. Huntingtin, the protein product of the HD gene, is widely expressed in neural and nonneural human and rodent tissue. The function of the wild-type or mutated form of huntingtin is currently unknown. We have observed that relative to naive and male animals, huntingtin protein was significantly increased in the arcuate nucleus of postpartum rats. Using an oligonucleotide probe, in situ and Northern blot hybridization confirmed the expression of huntingtin mRNA. Quantification of the in situ hybridization signal in the arcuate nucleus revealed an approximate sevenfold increase in the expression of huntingtin mRNA in postpartum, lactating animals compared with naive female or male animals. Emulsion autoradiography and immunohistochemistry revealed that the cells with elevated huntingtin expression had a stellate conformation that morphologically resembled astrocytes. Dual label immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry demonstrated the colocalization of huntingtin and glial fibrillary acidic protein in these cells, confirming that they were astrocytes. Astrocytes expressing huntingtin were consistently found in close apposition to neuronal soma, suggesting interactions between these cell types. During the perinatal and postnatal period, the hypothalamus undergoes alterations in metabolic function. Our results support the idea of glia-induced metabolic changes in the hypothalamus. These results provide the first demonstration of naturally occurring changes in the expression of the Huntington's disease gene in the brain and suggest that huntingtin may play an important role in the processes that regulate neuroendocrine function."
https://openalex.org/W2046367442,"Mammalian hexokinases (HKs) I–III are composed of two highly homologous ∼50-kDa halves. Studies of HKI indicate that the C-terminal half of the molecule is active and is sensitive to inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), whereas the N-terminal half binds G6P but is devoid of catalytic activity. In contrast, both the N- and C-terminal halves of HKII (N-HKII and C-HKII, respectively) are catalytically active, and when expressed as discrete proteins both are inhibited by G6P. However, C-HKII has a significantly higherK i for G6P (K iG6P) than N-HKII. We here address the question of whether the highK iG6P of the C-terminal half (C-half) of HKII is decreased by interaction with the N-terminal half (N-half) in the context of the intact enzyme. A chimeric protein consisting of the N-half of HKI and the C-half of HKII was prepared. Because the N-half of HKI is unable to phosphorylate glucose, the catalytic activity of this chimeric enzyme depends entirely on the C-HKII component. The K iG6P of this chimeric enzyme is similar to that of HKI and is significantly lower than that of C-HKII. When a conserved amino acid (Asp209) required for glucose binding is mutated in the N-half of this chimeric protein, a significantly higher K iG6P (similar to that of C-HKII) is observed. However, mutation of a second conserved amino acid (Ser155), also involved in catalysis but not required for glucose binding, does not increase theK iG6P of the chimeric enzyme. This resembles the behavior of HKII, in which a D209A mutation results in an increase in the K iG6P of the enzyme, whereas a S155A mutation does not. These results suggest an interaction in which glucose binding by the N-half causes the activity of the C-half to be regulated by significantly lower concentrations of G6P.

Type I, II, and III isozymes of mammalian HKs are ∼100 kDa in size and are inhibited by the reaction product, G6P. Type IV HK (also known as glucokinase) is similar to yeast HK in that it has a relative mass of ∼50 kDa and is insensitive to inhibition by physiologic concentrations of G6P. The deduced amino acid sequences of HKI–III reveal internal similarities between their N- and C-terminal halves and between each of these and yeast HK and glucokinase (1Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol.

This observation supports the hypothesis that the 100-kDa mammalian HKs evolved from the duplication and fusion of an ancestral 50-kDa HK (1Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

This binding results in closure of the cleft and initiates the catalytic sequence. Asp211 is an important residue in yeast hexokinase. As the base catalyst, it binds the 6-hydroxyl group of glucose, and this receives the phosphate moiety of ATP. Mutation of the corresponding residue to alanine in glucokinase (D205A) (17Lange A.J.

In contrast, the carbonyl group of Ser158 in yeast HK interacts with the 3-hydroxyl group of glucose only in the closed conformation (1Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18259-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the N- and C-halves of HKII in the intact enzyme (S155A and S603A) reduces the V max of the enzyme to about 10% of that of the wild type (8Tsai H.J. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 2H. Ardehali, unpublished observations. 2H. Ardehali, unpublished observations. Thus, although the D209A mutation in mammalian HKs results in a loss of glucose binding and catalytic activity, the S158A mutation maintains glucose binding but reduces the V max. Because the K iG6P of HKII is similar to that of N-HKII and significantly different from that of C-HKII, we focused the present analysis on how the activity of C-HKII is regulated by G6P in the intact enzyme. Mutations that have different effects on glucose binding in the N-half of HKII result in different valves ofK iG6P. We here show that the regulation of the C-half by G6P in the intact HKII is influenced by the N-half of the molecule. The human hexokinase I cDNA was provided by Dr. Graeme Bell (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago). A DNA fragment that encodes the N-half of HKI was prepared by PCR using B2392 (5′-GCCAGCATGATCGCCGCGCA-3′) as the 5′ oligonucleotide and A2670 (5′-TTACTGCCGGTGCTGCTGGG-3′) as the 3′ oligonucleotide. A2670 contains a stop codon at position 1407, which is the putative fusion site between the N- and C-terminal halves of HKI. The pGef plasmid (7Ardehali H. Yano Y. Printz R.L. Koch S. Whitesell R.R.

The PCR product that contains the N-half of HKI was then ligated into pGef to obtain pGST·N-HKI. This plasmid encodes amino acids 1–469 of human HKI fused to the C terminus of GST. An NcoI site is conveniently located near the fusion site of the N- and C-terminal halves of both human HKI and HKII.NcoI cleaves at nucleotide 1366 in the open reading frame of both HKI and HKII. pGST·N-HKI was digested with NcoI andBssHII (a cleavage site about 1.2 kbp 5′ of the GST start codon) to produce a fragment of ∼3.2 kbp that contains the coding sequence of GST and the N-terminal half of HKI. This fragment was purified by size separation through agarose gel electrophoresis and was isolated using Spin-x tubes (Costar, Cambridge, MA). A GST·HKII expression plasmid, pGST·HKII (7Ardehali H.

These two fragments were ligated together to generate the plasmid pGST·NHKI-CHKII, which encodes the chimeric protein GST·NICII. Site-directed mutations were generated by two separate PCR reactions. The primers, templates, and PCR conditions used for the construction of the hexokinase mutants are illustrated in TableI. The PCR products were isolated by gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts (approximately 100 ng) of the two purified PCR products for each construct were mixed, denatured, annealed, and used as a template for a third PCR reaction with the outer primers, as described. By using these two primers, it was possible to selectively amplify a template that consisted of annealed PCR products 1 and 2 with the desired mutation. In the case of pGST·HKII-S155A, the final PCR product was digested withBamHI and SalI and was used to replace the wild-type BamHI-SalI restriction fragment in the pGST·HKII plasmid. For pGST·HKII-S603A, the third PCR product was digested with XhoI and ClaI and was used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment of pGST·HKII. In the case of pGST·NHKI-D209A and pGST·NHKI-S155A, the final PCR products were digested with SmaI and SalI and used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment of pGST·N-HKI. pGST·NHKI-D209A and pGST·NHKI-S155A were digested withBssHII and NcoI, and the smaller fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment of pGST·HKII to generate the plasmids pGST·NICII-D209A and pGST·NICII-S155A. These plasmids encode the chimeric proteins GST·NICII-D209A and GST·NICII-S155A.

May J.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1995; 15: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To use the glucose tracer data directly in the determination of the kinetic parameters, we modified the hexokinase rate law by dividing both sides of the equation by the concentration of glucose to correct for the specific activity of the tracer. The modified equation is as follows. v[Glc]=Vmax[ATP]KiG6P(KmATPKiG6P+KmATP[G6P]+KiG6P[ATP])([Glc]+KmGlc)Equation 1 In this equation, [Glc], [ATP], and [G6P] refer to the concentrations of Glc, ATP, and G6P, respectively, andK mGlc,K mATP, andK iG6P are the respective kinetic constants for glucose, ATP, and G6P. V max is the maximum velocity, and v is the velocity of glucose phosphorylation. Kinetic data were analyzed using a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting program called Globals UnlimitedTM (Department of Physics, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). This global analysis program was originally developed for the analysis of multiple sets of fluorescence spectroscopic data (22Beechem J.M. Brand L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar,23Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 241-305Google Scholar) and has been used to analyze other complex systems, such as coupled glucose transport and phosphorylation (24Whitesell R.R. Abumrad M.K. Powers A.C.

The practical aspects of this approach have been reviewed (25Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Global analysis was used to generate nonlinear least square fits to the kinetic parameters of the HKII enzymes based on the hexokinase rate law (see above). The kinetic parameters (i.e. K mGlc,K mATP, andK iG6P) were determined by analyzing the measured activities as a function of changes in each of the substrate and inhibitor concentrations. The kinetic parameters of HKII, its two halves (N-HKII and C-HKII), and the D209A and D657A mutant enzymes are shown in TableII. In general, these are similar to the apparent values obtained previously by simple regression analysis (7Ardehali H. Yano Y. Printz R.L. Koch S. Whitesell R.R. May J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

The exception is the K iG6P, which is 10-fold lower on average, because the current method of analysis allowed for extrapolation to very low levels of the competitive ligand ATP.Table IIComparison of the kinetic values of various enzymes with HKIIK m glucoseK mATPK i G6PmmmmμmHKII0.36 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.2445 ± 11N-HKII0.45 ± 0.060.60 ± 0.1459 ± 16C-HKII0.78 ± 0.154.1 ± 1.1aK m or K i value that is significantly different from that of HKII (p < 0.05 as determined by one-way analysis of variance and appropriatepost hoc testing).1733 ± 586aK m or K i value that is significantly different from that of HKII (p < 0.05 as determined by one-way analysis of variance and appropriatepost hoc testing).D209A0.40 ± 0.071.5 ± 0.111030 ± 82aK m or K i value that is significantly different from that of HKII (p < 0.05 as determined by one-way analysis of variance and appropriatepost hoc testing).D657A0.25 ± 0.060.66 ± 0.0617 ± 2S155A0.39 ± 0.132.1 ± 0.540 ± 7S603A0.53 ± 0.131.7 ± 0.539 ± 18Each GST·HK fusion protein was partially purified to remove any endogenous hexokinase activity as described (7Ardehali H.

The D209A mutation in HKII results in complete inactivation of the N-half of HKII (7Ardehali H. Yano Y. Printz R.L. Koch S. Whitesell R.R. May J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1849-1852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), so the activity of the D209A enzyme is entirely contributed by its C-half. As noted with C-HKII, this mutant enzyme has a 20–30-fold higher K iG6P than HKII and N-HKII. Inactivation of the C-half of HKII (D657A) results in an enzyme with a K iG6P similar to that of N-HKII. However, neither the S155A mutation, which also inactivates the N-half of the enzyme, nor the S603A mutation affect theK iG6P of the intact enzyme (Table II). The K iG6P values for HKII, S155A, and S603A are between 39 and 45 μm, which is in agreement with results reported by Tsai and Wilson (8Tsai H.J. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These data suggest that S155A and D209A have different roles in HKII, particularly with respect to the regulation of the catalytic activity of the C-half by G6P. Previous studies have shown that the D209A mutation in mammalian hexokinases results in a loss of glucose binding and catalytic activity, whereas the S155A mutation maintains glucose binding but reduces the V max (5Arora K.K. Filburn C.R. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18259-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ardehali H. Yano Y. Printz R.L. Koch S. Whitesell R.R. May J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Therefore, the N-half of the D209A enzyme may remain in an open conformation, because the glucose-Asp209 contact is thought to trigger a conformational change from an open to a closed form. In contrast, the N-half of the S155A enzyme would undergo the conformational change associated with glucose binding, because the glucose-Ser155contact occurs after the conformational change. We therefore hypothesize that a conformational change of the N-half is required for inhibition of the C-half at relatively low G6P concentrations. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the HKII enzyme, and its two halves, supports the hypothesis that the N-half influences the regulation of the C-half by G6P in the intact enzyme. TheK iG6P of the intact enzyme is almost identical to that of N-HKII, despite the fact that theK iG6P of C-HKII is ∼30-fold higher than that of the N-half. Detailed analysis of the G6P regulation of C-HKII in the intact enzyme is, however, complicated by the fact that both halves of HKII are active and both are sensitive to inhibition by G6P. We therefore constructed a chimeric enzyme in which C-HKII is the only catalytically active component and tested it for G6P inhibition. The N-half of HKI is capable of binding glucose and G6P (1Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6White T.K. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but it is catalytically inactive when expressed as a discrete protein and in the context of the intact HKI enzyme (Refs. 3White T.K.

A chimeric protein consisting of the N-half of HKI and the C-half of HKII (NICII) allowed us to test whether glucose binding to the N-half,per se, is involved in the regulation of the C-half by G6P. In this chimeric enzyme the catalytic activity is entirely due to C-HKII, which has a significantly higherK iG6P than either HKI or HKII. The chimeric enzyme has K mGlc andK mATP values similar to those of C-HKII; however, the K iG6P is significantly lower than that of C-HKII (Tables II andIII). These results indicate that the presence of the N-half of HKI causes a significant reduction in theK iG6P of the C-half of HKII in the context of a 100-kDa enzyme.Table IIIComparison of the kinetic values of various NICII chimeric enzymes with HKIIK m glucoseK mATPK i G6PmmmmμmHKII0.36 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.2445 ± 11NICII0.24 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.6425 ± 8NICII-D209A0.49 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.05293 ± 71aK m or K i value that is significantly different from that of HKII (p < 0.05 as determined by one-way analysis of variance and appropriatepost hoc testing).NICII-S155A0.38 ± 0.034.6 ± 0.3aK m or K i value that is significantly different from that of HKII (p < 0.05 as determined by one-way analysis of variance and appropriatepost hoc testing).61 ± 16Each GST · HK fusion protein was partially purified to remove any endogenous hexokinase activity as described (7Ardehali H.

The values for HKII are the same as those shown in TableII. We then asked whether the D209A or S155A mutations of this chimeric enzyme have an effect on the K iG6Psimilar to that seen when the same mutations are made in HKII. The D209A mutation was made in the N-half of NICII chimeric enzyme. This resulted in a significant increase in theK iG6P (Table III). The NICII enzyme, with the S155A mutation in the N-half, was then constructed. This mutation, which does not decrease glucose binding in other hexokinases, did not affect the K iG6P of this chimeric enzyme (Table III). In the NICII chimeric enzyme, the two halves are not independent entities, and the presence of an N-half that is capable of binding glucose causes the C-half to be regulated at lower concentrations of G6P. Therefore, an allosteric interaction that affects the function of the intact enzyme appears to occur between the two halves of HKII. This interaction may change the structure of the C-half, causing a reduction in the K iG6P of the C-half of HKII. Alternatively, G6P bound to the N-half may result in a conformation that directly inhibits the activity of the C-half in the intact enzyme. The available data do not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. Regulation of the function of the C-half of HKII, by binding events that occur in the N-half, has precedent based on observations of HKI. A functional interaction between the two halves of HKI is determined by the binding of glucose, G6P, or Pi. For example, co-operative binding of glucose to N- and C-half sites in HKI was noted (26Mehta A. Jarori G.K. Kenkare U.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15492-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an observation not expected for a monomeric enzyme, particularly in view of the fact that the N-half has no catalytic activity (3White T.K.

The binding of either G6P or Pi results in a loss of cooperative binding of glucose with a corresponding change in the conformation of HKI (26Mehta A. Jarori G.K. Kenkare U.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15492-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the binding constant for G6P is substantially reduced in the absence of glucose (26Mehta A. Jarori G.K. Kenkare U.W.

The critical role of amino acids Asp209 and Asp657 in glucose binding was confirmed (13Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), significantly reduces the relief of G6P inhibition by Pi(27Fang T.Y. Alechina O. Aleshin A.E.

Thus, the crystal structures of glucose and Pi bound to HKI support the concept of a functional interaction between the two halves of HKs and suggest that it is dependent upon bound glucose. The characteristics of HKII described in this paper may relate to the important role this enzyme plays in insulin-mediated glucose clearance of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue. The sequential transport and phosphorylation of glucose by mammalian cells ensures that the subsequent metabolic products are retained within the cell. In the basal state, the intracellular glucose concentration is typically low in muscle (28Katz A. Nyomba B.L. Bogardus C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E942-E945PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kipnis D.M.

Chem. 1965; 240: 14-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but rises as the glucose flux increases, either in response to increased extracellular glucose or as a consequence of insulin stimulation. Recent in vivostudies, using a variety of techniques, suggest that glucose phosphorylation may be defective in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). For example, when positron emission tomography is used to measure 2-deoxy-[2−18F]fluoro-d-glucose transport and phosphorylation, insulin infusion increases the rate constant for phosphorylation in normal weight and obese controls but not in NIDDM subjects (34Kelley D.E.

(35Bonadonna R.C. Del Prato S. Bonora E. Saccomani M.P. Gulli G. Natali A. Frascerra S. Pecori N. Ferrannini E. Bier D.M. Cobelli C. DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) investigated nondiabetic controls and patients with NIDDM using forearm balance techniques during euglycemic glucose clamps. They found that glucose transport is decreased about 40% but that combined transport and phosphorylation is decreased 85% in patients with NIDDM. Also, in31P NMR studies performed during hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps, the muscle content of G6P rises with insulin infusion in controls but fails to increase with insulin infusion in NIDDM subjects (36Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Cline G. Gerard D. Kahn C.R. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 983-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We conclude that these patients have defective glucose transport/phosphorylation. Finally, results from muscle biopsies in persons with NIDDM from three distinct ethnic backgrounds also led to the suggestion that the regulation of the HKII gene is abnormal in this disease (37Kruszynska Y.T. Mulford M.I. Baloga J. Yu J.G. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations are interesting with regard to the data reported in this paper. G6P levels rise as glucose utilization increases. In fact, intracellular G6P levels increase from ∼170 to ∼1300 μm in perfused working rat hearts either in the presence of 10 mm glucose or after 30 min of insulin treatment (38Kashiwaya Y. Sato K. Tsuchiya N. Thomas S. Fell D.A. Veech R.L. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25502-25514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen stores in these hearts increase 5–6-fold. If HKII is a rate-determining step in glucose metabolism and is inhibited by low concentrations of G6P (K iG6P of 45 μm), why does glucose utilization increase when G6P increases? We suggest that HKII plays a role in insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues similar to the one glucokinase exerts in the liver. Glucokinase, due to its insensitivity to physiological concentrations of G6P, continues to phosphorylate glucose at high levels of G6P, and this results in increased hepatic glucose utilization and storage. Glucokinase, when expressed in muscle cells, has a similar effect on glucose disposal (39Baqué S. Montell E. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that HKII, because of the low affinity of the C-half for G6P, may serve the same purpose in insulin-sensitive, peripheral tissues. This could be accomplished by the binding of the enzyme to mitochondria and/or by some other effector that results in allosteric modification of the enzyme that effectively uncouples the functional interaction of the N- and C-halves of the enzyme.

This element is composed of a direct repeat (DR) of the sequence PuGTTCA spaced by five nucleotides. However, the same sequence separated by three nucleotides (DR3) acts as a strong vitamin D response element. Here we show that the polarity of binding of the heterodimers to the DR3 was 5'-RXR-VDR-3', whereas on the DR5, both heterodimeric partners bind indistinctly to the 5' or 3' hemi-sites. These results suggest that the response elements can allosterically regulate the conformation of the receptors to determine positive or negative regulation of gene expression. Despite the altered polarity, the DR5-bound heterodimer was able to recruit the nuclear receptor coactivator ACTR in a vitamin D-dependent fashion. Furthermore, binding of the corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) to the RXR/VDR heterodimer on a DR5 was not observed. Binding of RXR/VDR heterodimers to DRs with different transcriptional outcomes may generate selectivity and provide a greater complexity and flexibility to the vitamin D responses."
https://openalex.org/W2007127972,"The CytR repressor fulfills dual roles as both a repressor of transcription from promoters of the Escherichia coli CytR regulon and a co-activator in some circumstances. Transcription is repressed by a three-protein complex (cAMP receptor protein (CRP)-CytR-CRP) that is stabilized by cooperative interactions between CRP and CytR. However, cooperativity also means that CytR can recruit CRP and, by doing so, can act as a co-activator. The central role of cooperativity in regulation is highlighted by the fact that binding of the inducer, cytidine, to CytR is coupled to CytR-CRP cooperativity; this underlies the mechanism for induction. Similar interactions at the different promoters of the CytR regulon coordinate expression of the transport proteins and enzymes required for nucleoside catabolism but also provide differential expression of these genes. A fundamental question in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene regulation is how combinatorial mechanisms of this sort regulate differential expression. Recently, we showed that CytR binds specifically to multiple sites in the E. coli deoPpromoter, thereby providing competition for CRP binding to CRP operator site 1 (CRP1) and CRP2 as well as cooperativity. The effect of the competition at this promoter is to negate the role of CytR in recruiting CRP. Here, we have used quantitative footprint and mobility shift analysis to investigate CRP and CytR binding to theE. coli udp promoter. Here too, we find that CytR both cooperates and competes for CRP binding. However, consistent with both the distribution of CytR recognition motifs in the sequence of the promoter and the regulation of the promoter, the competition is limited to CRP2. When cytidine binds to CytR, the effect on cooperativity is very different at the udp promoter than at thedeoP2 promoter. Cooperativity with CRP at CRP1 is nearly eliminated, but the effect on CytR-CRP2 cooperativity is negligible. These results are discussed in relation to the current structural model of CytR in which the core, inducer-binding domain is tethered to the helix-turn-helix, DNA-binding domain via flexible peptide linkers. The CytR repressor fulfills dual roles as both a repressor of transcription from promoters of the Escherichia coli CytR regulon and a co-activator in some circumstances.

When cytidine binds to CytR, the effect on cooperativity is very different at the udp promoter than at thedeoP2 promoter. Cooperativity with CRP at CRP1 is nearly eliminated, but the effect on CytR-CRP2 cooperativity is negligible. These results are discussed in relation to the current structural model of CytR in which the core, inducer-binding domain is tethered to the helix-turn-helix, DNA-binding domain via flexible peptide linkers. The Escherichia coli CytR regulon comprises at least nine unlinked transcriptional units that encode enzymes and transport proteins required for nucleoside catabolism and recycling. CRP 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; CRP1 and CRP2, CRP operator sites 1 and 2, respectively; RNAP, E. coli RNA polymerase; bp, base pair(s); bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)imino- tris(hydroxymethyl)methane. activates transcription of these units in response to intracellular cAMP levels. Transcription is repressed by CytR, a member of the LacI family of bacterial repressors, and is induced when CytR binds cytidine. These features are common to all of the unlinked transcriptional units that comprise the regulon and serve together to coordinate their regulation (1Valentin-Hansen P. Sogaard-Andersen L. Pedersen H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, a key feature of the CytR regulon is that extents of activation, repression, and induction vary substantially among the different transcription units (cf. Refs. 2Martinussen J. Mollegaard N.E. Holst B. Douthwaite S.R. Valentin-Hansen P. Gralla J.D. DNA-Protein Interactions in Transcription. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 31-41Google Scholar and 3Barbier C.S. Short S.A. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16962-16971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An intriguing question is how the interplay among these two transcriptional regulatory proteins and the various promoters yields differential regulation. Presumably, combinatorial mechanisms that rely on local features of the promoters, such as different arrangements of the control elements, are involved. Similar combinatorial mechanisms also appear to be important in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, processes that also often involve a small number of key regulatory proteins. Thus, the CytR regulon has general significance as a model for understanding gene regulatory processes. Our goal is to understand how functional, multi-protein, transcription complexes form at different promoters with different arrangements of protein binding sites. CytR has two features that are not observed in other LacI family members and that appear to be important to its role as a differential transcriptional regulator. First, CytR and CRP bind cooperatively to form a three-protein complex on the DNA. In this complex, CytR binds to an operator site (usually referred to as CytO) that is flanked by tandem CRP operators, CRP1 and CRP2, as are found in most CytR-regulated promoters. CytR forms a protein bridge between the bound CRP dimers. The importance of this cooperativity is highlighted by the fact that expression is induced because the cooperativity is lost when CytR binds cytidine; cytidine binding to CytR has no effect on the intrinsic DNA binding of CytR (4Pedersen H. Sogaard-Andersen L. Holst B. Valentin-Hansen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17804-17808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is the three-protein complex that is the functional repressor, not CytR alone. Second, CytR exhibits lower DNA binding specificity than other LacI family members and most other bacterial repressors. As a consequence, as detailed below, CytR does not bind only to CytO but also binds to additional binding sites whose number and arrangement appear to differ among the promoters. Given these facts, we wish to address two questions. First, how does binding of CytR differ in different promoters? Second, how do these differences affect cooperativity and its modulation by cytidine? A key to how CytR binds to different promoters is its relatively broad DNA sequence specificity. Like other LacI family members, the basic DNA binding unit of CytR is a homodimer (6Kristensen H.H. Valentin-Hansen P. Sogaard-Andersen L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As expected, based on this quarternary structure, CytR binding sites contain tandem recognition motifs. However, the exact recognition motif has proven difficult to define. It has been reported as both TGCAA (7Rasmussen P.B. Sogaard-Andersen L. Valentin-Hansen P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and, more recently, as GTTGCATT (8Pedersen H. Valentin-Hansen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2108-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), based on different systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment experiments conducted by the same group. Based on where CytR binds specifically to the CytR-regulated deoP1and deoP2 promoters, we proposed that TTGCAA, a symmetric variant of these sequences, is the recognition sequence (5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CytR is also unusually tolerant of variation in spacing between recognition motifs. The preferred spacing is 2–3 base pairs (7Rasmussen P.B. Sogaard-Andersen L. Valentin-Hansen P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Pedersen H. Valentin-Hansen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2108-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but CytR-mediated regulation of gene expression has been demonstrated on synthetic promoters in vivo with spacing up to three helical turns (9Jorgensen C.I. Kallipolitis B.H. Valentin-Hansen P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to note that most CytR-regulated promoters feature multiple degenerate repeats of the (T)TGCAA sequence motif with variable spacing between them. Depending upon the spacing between such repeats, additional CytR binding sites might exist at these promoters. In fact, when we investigated CytR binding to thedeoP2 promoter, we found that CytR does bind specifically to multiple sites (5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CytR and CRP bind cooperatively when CytR binds CytO. However, CytR also binds to separate, specific sites atdeoP2, one of which overlaps CRP1, and another that overlaps CRP2. In this situation, CytR competes directly for CRP binding to CRP1 and CRP2. This special mode of protein-DNA interaction in which CytR can either enhance CRP binding or compete for CRP binding affects both repression and activation. Repression by the cooperative CRP-CytR-CRP complex results from competition between CytR and RNAP, both of which are recruited by CRP to bind to the DNA sequence flanked by CRP1 and CRP2 (10Belyaeva T.A. Rhodius V.A. Webster C.L. Busby S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 789-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, competition between CytR and CRP for binding to CRP1 and CRP2 provides a second mode of CytR-mediated repression. In activation, one consequence of the competition between CytR and CRP is to facilitate configurations in which CRP is bound either to CRP1 or to CRP2, but not to both. This is significant because CRP1 and CRP2 are thought to mediate different mechanisms of activation (11Ushida C. Aiba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6325-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on their sequences (Ref. 5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; Fig. 1), we expect the different promoters to vary as to whether CytR competes for CRP binding to CRP1, to CRP2, or to both sites. The primary function of CytR may be differential modulation of CRP1-mediated versus CRP2-mediated activation. In this way, different patterns of CytR binding at different promoters might provide differential gene regulation. The broad DNA binding specificity of CytR might also result in different contributions to the stability of the three-protein repression complex at the different promoters. It has been shown recently that when CytR and CRP are used together to select DNA sequences that are preferred for formation of the three-protein complex, the sequences most commonly selected are CytR recognition motifs separated by 10–13 base pairs and almost centered between CRP1 and CRP2 (8Pedersen H. Valentin-Hansen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2108-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This result is surprising because it does not match what is found in the natural promoters, in which CytO is usually located significantly off-center, adjacent to either CRP2 (as indeoP2) or CRP1 (as in cdd, nupG, and udp) with a 2–5-bp spacing between recognition motifs. Nevertheless, a structural model has been proposed in which the DNA is wrapped smoothly around the three-protein complex, and the two CytR DNA binding domains (one per subunit) bind to DNA sequences that are arranged centrosymmetrically and are separated by 11 base pairs (13Kallipolitis B.H. Norregaard M.M. Valentin-Hansen P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For a centrosymmetric three-protein complex to form as envisioned in the model, CytR would have to dissociate from CytO and instead bind more widely spaced and symmetrically arranged DNA sequences. Alternatively, CytR, CRP, and/or the DNA would have to be distorted from the symmetric arrangement proposed in the model to accommodate off-center binding by CytR to CytO. Either of these situations would necessarily contribute unfavorably to the stability of the three-protein complex, the former as a result of a decrease in CytR-DNA binding affinity, and the latter as a result of an unfavorable conformational change. Which of these two possible accommodations a particular promoter uses may depend on what alternative, relatively high affinity, CytR-DNA binding sites are provided by the local array of CytR recognition motifs. In these ways, site-specific CytR binding, cooperativity, and competition are inextricably linked. Because cytidine is an effector of CytR-CRP cooperativity, its effect should also be linked to how CytR binds at the various promoters. This linkage might underlie the observed differences between the promoters in effectiveness of induction. To test these hypotheses and to assess how linkage might be involved in differential regulation of transcription, we have investigated cooperative and competitive CytR and CRP binding to the udppromoter. We compare these interactions to those that we investigated previously at the deoP2 promoter. We chose udpfor comparison to deoP2 because these promoters differ substantially in regulatory properties. The ranges of regulated rates of transcription in vivo are about 30-fold for theudp promoter (3Barbier C.S. Short S.A. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16962-16971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) versus only about 5- to 6-fold for the deoP2 promoter (2Martinussen J. Mollegaard N.E. Holst B. Douthwaite S.R. Valentin-Hansen P. Gralla J.D. DNA-Protein Interactions in Transcription. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 31-41Google Scholar). CRP is a more effective activator of udp than of deoP2, and CytR is a more effective repressor of udp than of deoP2. Whereas the two promoters do not differ significantly in the arrangement of CRP sites, they do differ in the arrangement of putative CytR binding sites (Fig. 1). Most prominently, the udppromoter contains no putative CytR binding site that occludes CRP1. The results we present here demonstrate that CytR binds specifically to multiple sites at the udp promoter. The results also confirm the expectation that CytR and CRP compete for binding to CRP2 but not for binding to CRP1. However, the most interesting result we found is that cytidine binding to CytR has very different effects on the pattern of CytR-CRP cooperativity at udp from those observed by us at deoP2. Whereas cytidine binding essentially eliminates all CytR-CRP cooperativity in binding to deoP2, it has a very selective effect on CytR-CRP cooperativity in binding toudp. Cytidine binding to CytR largely eliminates pairwise cooperativity between CytR and CRP bound to CRP1 of udp. In contrast, it has a negligible effect on pairwise cooperativity between CytR and CRP bound to CRP2. The net effect on cooperativity in the CRP-CytR-CRP complex is moderate. These results indicate that CytR is highly adaptable to different arrangements of CytR and CRP sites in the absence of cytidine in order to form the three-protein repression complex. However, much of this adaptability appears to be lost when CytR binds cytidine. Thus, the arrangement of the operators might have a substantial influence on induction. An interesting explanation for this behavior can be found in what is known about the structure of CytR and the allosteric mechanism of induction. Crystalline cAMP (>99% pure as free base) was purchased from Sigma. Crystalline cytidine (>99% pure as free acid) was purchased from ICN. Stock concentrations in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA were determined, and purity was assessed spectrophotometrically as described previously (5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F.

The CRP concentration was estimated based on an extinction coefficient of 18,400 m−1 at 280 nm, calculated from the average extinction coefficients for amino acid residues in a protein (17Waxman E.

Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). This calculated value is about 10% less than one reported by Takahashi et al. (Ref. 19Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. Hillen W.

Protein prepared in this manner is at least 95% CytR dimer under native conditions. However, analysis under denaturing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gels indicates variable proteolysis of the CytR by endogenous proteases (5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol.

The preparations used in these studies contained 70–90% full-length CytR (M r = 37,800).

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid has the regulatory sequence of udp starting 122 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site and through the first the 50 codons of udp (311 bp) cloned into the PstI andEcoRI sites of pUC18. A 498-bp fragment containing thisudp sequence was generated by restriction withPvuII and HindIII. Mutant promoters were generated in which site-specific CRP binding to either CRP1 (CRP1−) or CRP2 (CRP2−) was eliminated by making two bp substitutions in the mutated site. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on pCB039 using the QuikChange™ kit from Stratagene. Mutagenic oligonucleotides, 30 nucleotides in length, produced symmetric transitions of G (indicted by underline) to A in both TGTGA CRP recognition motifs of the mutated site. Sequences of the mutants (shown in Fig. 1) were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. All DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis after banding the plasmid preparations twice in CsCl gradients. DNA was protein-free, as determined from its UV spectrum (23Maniatas T.

Experiments in which CRP was present also contained 150 μm cAMP. This cAMP concentration maximizes the fraction of CRP present as the active DNA-binding species in which cAMP is bound to one but not both of the subunits (denoted by CRP(cAMP)1). Under these conditions, the active fraction is 0.64 ± 0.02 (5Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol.

The individual site binding data were first analyzed separately for each site to obtain the Gibbs free energy change corresponding tok (ΔG i = −RTln k) in Equation 1. Yi=Po+(Pmax−Po)·k·L1+k·LEquation 1 In Equation 1, Y i is the fractional saturation of binding site i at the free protein ligand concentration L, k is the association constant, and P o andP max are the baseline and maximum fractional protection for a given titration (14Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). For simple binding of either CRP or CytR alone, Equation 1 gives the intrinsic free energy change for local binding, ΔG i. For binding experiments in which both CytR and CRP are present, analysis according to Equation 1provides an accurate estimate of the individual site loading free energy change, ΔG l,i (25Ackers G.K.

Subsequently, global analysis of the individual site CRP and CytR binding data was conducted using equations that describe cooperative and competitive binding of CRP and CytR according to the model defined by the promoter configurations specified in Table II. Equations to describe the binding to each of the individual sites were derived by considering the relative probability of each promoter configuration as given by the following equation. fs=e−ΔGs/RT⋅[CRP(cAMP)1]i⋅[CytR]j∑sije−ΔGs/RT⋅[CRP(cAMP)1]i⋅[CytR]jEquation 2 ΔG is the sum of free energy contributions for configuration s (Table III); i and jare the stoichiometries of bound CRP(cAMP)1 complexes and CytR dimers in configuration s. Summation of the relative probabilities for all configurations in which protein is bound to any given site derives the binding equation for that site. For reduced valence, operators CRP1− and CRP2−, configurations in which CRP(cAMP)1 is bound to the mutated site were excluded from the summation.Table IIConfigurations and free energy states for CRP and CytR binding to the udp promoterOperator configurationFree energy contributionsFree energy stateCRP2CytR at CRP2CytRCRP11OOOOReference stateΔG s,12OOOCRPΔG 1ΔG s,23CRPOOOΔG 2ΔG s,34OOCytROΔG 3ΔG s,45OCytROOΔG 4ΔG s,56CRPOOCRPΔG 1 + ΔG 2ΔG s,67OOCytRCRPΔG 1 + ΔG 3 + ΔG 13ΔG s,78OCytROCRPΔG 1 + ΔG 4ΔG s,89CRPOCytROΔG 2 + ΔG 3 + ΔG 23ΔG s,910OCytRCytROΔG 3 + ΔG 4ΔG s,1011CRPOCtyRCRPΔG 1 + ΔG 2 + ΔG 3 + ΔG 123ΔG s,1112OCytRCytRCRPΔG 1 + ΔG 3 + ΔG 4 + ΔG 13ΔG s,12udp promoter configurations with sites denoted as filled (CRP or CytR) or empty (O).

https://openalex.org/W2087388762,"Shc and IRS-1 (and their relatives) are cytoplasmic docking proteins that possess phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, through which they bind specific activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). The subsequent phosphorylation of Shc or IRS-1 creates binding sites for the SH2 domains of multiple signaling proteins, leading to the activation of intracellular biochemical pathways. The PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 both recognize autophosphorylation sites in RTKs with the consensus sequence NPXpY, but show distinct abilities to bind stably to RTKs such as the TrkA nerve growth factor receptor and the insulin receptor. In vitro analysis has suggested that residues N-terminal to the NPXpY motif may determine the affinity with which phosphopeptide ligands are recognized by the Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains. Unlike IRS-1, the Shc PTB domain binds poorly to the insulin-receptor (IR) β subunit in vitro, owing to its low affinity for the NPXpY autophosphorylation site at Tyr 960 of the IR. As a consequence, Shc does not bind stably to the activated IR in cells. We show that substitution of Ser 955, five residues N-terminal to the Tyr 960 autophosphorylation site (the −5 position), with Ile alters the target specificity of the IR such that it stably associates with Shc in insulin-stimulated cells. A triple substitution of the −5, −8 and −9 residues relative to Tyr 960 of the IR to the corresponding amino acids found in the Shc PTB domain binding site of TrkA results in even stronger binding of the IR to Shc in vivo. The variant IRs with enhanced ability to bind Shc showed an increased ability to activate the MAPK pathway in response to insulin stimulation. These results demonstrate that subtle differences in residues N-terminal to NPXpY autophosphorylation sites determine the ability of RTKs to bind specific PTB domain proteins in vivo, and thus modify the signaling properties of activated receptors."
