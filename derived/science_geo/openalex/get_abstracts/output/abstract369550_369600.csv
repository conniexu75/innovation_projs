The intestinal flora may promote colon tumor formation. Here we explore immunologic mechanisms of colonic carcinogenesis by a human colonic bacterium, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). ETBF that secretes B. fragilis toxin (BFT) causes human inflammatory diarrhea but also asymptomatically colonizes a proportion of the human population. Our results indicate that whereas both ETBF and nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF) chronically colonize mice, only ETBF triggers colitis and strongly induces colonic tumors in multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice. ETBF induces robust, selective colonic signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) activation with colitis characterized by a selective T helper type 17 (TH17) response distributed between CD4+ T cell receptor-αβ (TCRαβ)+ and CD4–8–TCRγδ+ T cells. Antibody-mediated blockade of interleukin-17 (IL-17) as well as the receptor for IL-23, a key cytokine amplifying TH17 responses, inhibits ETBF-induced colitis, colonic hyperplasia and tumor formation. These results show a Stat3- and TH17-dependent pathway for inflammation-induced cancer by a common human commensal bacterium, providing new mechanistic insight into human colon carcinogenesis."

As acetylation is a histone mark for active transcription, HATs have been associated with active and HDACs with inactive genes. We describe here genome-wide mapping of HATs and HDACs binding on chromatin and find that both are found at active genes with acetylated histones. Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Furthermore, the majority of HDACs in the human genome function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes. Inactive genes that are primed by MLL-mediated histone H3K4 methylation are subject to a dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding, preventing Pol II from binding to these genes but poising them for future activation. Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs.

Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs. Histone acetylation plays key roles in modulating chromatin structure and function (Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Functions of site-specific histone acetylation and deacetylation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The acetylation state of a given chromatin locus is controlled by two classes of antagonizing histone modifying enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), which add or remove acetyl groups to/from target histones, respectively. Acetylation is generally associated with transcriptional activation, and several HATs have been identified as transcription coactivators, including GCN5, PCAF, CBP, p300, Tip60, and MOF (reviewed in Roth et al., 2001Roth S.Y.

Lysine acetylation and the bromodomain: a new partnership for signaling.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1076-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In contrast, histone deacetylation is generally associated with transcriptional repression, and HDACs have been identified as transcriptional corepressors (Kadosh and Struhl, 1997Kadosh D. Struhl K.

These enzymes are highly conserved from yeast to human. Based on their homology with yeast orthologs and other phylogenetic analyses, the 18 HDACs in humans can be grouped into four classes: class I (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8 with a homology to Rpd3), class II (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 with a homology to Hda1), class III (Sirt1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with a homology to Sir2), and class IV (HDAC11) (de Ruijter et al., 2003de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H.

Similar to HATs, HDACs have critical functions in many cellular pathways, and their misregulation has been linked to multiple cancers. Chemicals that inhibit HDAC activity are currently among the most promising drugs in anticancer therapies. Corepressor HDACs are traditionally considered to repress/inhibit transcription by associating with gene promoters and are replaced by stimulating coactivator HATs for subsequent activation upon signal transduction (Berger, 2007Berger S.L. The complex language of chromatin regulation during transcription.Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 1999Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Coactivator and corepressor complexes in nuclear receptor function.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has been suggested to play roles in both transcriptional initiation and elongation. Acetylation of nucleosomes surrounding transcription start sites (TSSs) may stabilize the binding of other chromatin remodeling factors at promoter regions (Hassan et al., 2001Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Histone acetyltransferase complexes stabilize swi/snf binding to promoter nucleosomes.Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and/or destabilize nucleosome structure (Boeger et al., 2003Boeger H.

Dynamic regulation of nucleosome positioning in the human genome.Cell. 2008; 132: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes also present formidable barriers to the passage of Pol II during transcriptional elongation (Orphanides et al., 1998Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. FACT, a factor that facilitates transcript elongation through nucleosomes.Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Global acetylation in transcribed regions is required for increased levels of basal transcription in yeast (Govind et al., 2007Govind C.K. Zhang F. Qiu H. Hofmeyer K. Hinnebusch A.G.

Global histone acetylation and deacetylation in yeast.Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Consistent with these genetic and biochemical results, genome-wide location analysis in yeast found that HAT binding is correlated with transcriptional activation (reviewed by Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Functions of site-specific histone acetylation and deacetylation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). However, the mode of association of the transcriptional corepressors, HDACs, with gene expression in yeast has been a topic of debate. Some studies suggested they are associated with gene repression (Kadosh and Struhl, 1997Kadosh D. Struhl K.

Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast.Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the genome-wide profiles of HDACs in higher eukaryotic organisms. While genome-wide profiling of HATs in mammalian systems has been performed, the data are limited. Genome-wide analysis of TAF1 binding confirmed its promoter localization (Kim et al., 2005Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. A high-resolution map of active promoters in the human genome.Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar); another HAT, p300, may be associated with both promoters and enhancers (Heintzman et al., 2007Heintzman N.D.

Chen F. et al.ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers.Nature. 2009; 457: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Our previous genome-wide mapping has revealed numerous combinatorial patterns of histone modifications in human CD4+ T cells (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K.

Genet. 2008; 40: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) and suggested that modification patterns can indicate differentiation potential of cells (Cui et al., 2009Cui K. Zang C. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Childs R.W. Peng W. Zhao K.

Schones D.E. Zhao K. Characterization of human epigenomes.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms of pattern establishment and the specificity of various HATs and HDACs, we decided to systematically determine the genomic locations of these enzymes in human CD4+ T cells. Surprisingly, we found that the binding for all HATs (CBP, p300, PCAF, Tip60, MOF) and HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6) analyzed is positively correlated with gene expression, Pol II binding, and acetylation levels. The p300 and CBP HATs are associated with enhancers and promoters, whereas MOF, PCAF, and Tip60 are elevated in transcribed regions in addition to promoters of active genes. Our data suggest that HDAC6, previously believed to function mainly in the cytoplasm, is targeted to chromatin of active genes. Interestingly, HDAC6 and Tip60 may be recruited to active genes, possibly through direct interaction with phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Inhibition of HDAC activities revealed two major roles of HDACs: (1) removal of acetyl groups at active genes added by HATs during transcriptional initiation and elongation to maintain an adequate level of acetylation that may support specific transcriptional elongation but inhibit promiscuous initiation, and (2) removal of acetyl groups added by transient binding of HATs at inactive gene promoters to maintain a reduced level of acetylation and to prevent Pol II from binding. Knockdown of WDR5, an essential subunit of the MLL complexes, indicated that H3K4 methylation primes the chromatin of a subset of silent genes and facilitates histone acetylation, thus providing large-scale support for the crosstalk between histone modifications. Our results suggest that the dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by the transient binding of HATs and HDACs, together with prior H3K4 methylation, may poise the primed genes for future activation. We have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiments for five HATs (p300, CBP, MOF, PCAF, and Tip60) and four HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6) using chromatin prepared from human primary resting CD4+ T cells as described previously (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K. High-resolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome.Cell. 2007; 129: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4698) Google Scholar). These HATs and HDACs were chosen because they are expressed in human T cells and specific antibodies are available for them. To stabilize HATs/HDACs on chromatin, we first treated cells with bifunctional membrane-permeating crosslinker, disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), to preserve the protein-protein association (Tian et al., 2005Tian B. Nowak D.E. Jamaluddin M. Wang S. Brasier A.R. Identification of direct genomic targets downstream of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor mediating tumor necrosis factor signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17435-17448Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) before formaldehyde crosslinking. All the antibodies were validated using immunoblotting assays (Figure S1 and Table S1 available online) and the ChIP DNA samples resulting from these antibodies were confirmed with qPCR assays. To gain further confidence in our ChIP-Seq data for these modifying enzymes, we compared our data with published binding sites for p300 in the literature (Table S2) and confirmed selected sites with qPCR assays (Figures S2 and S3). CBP and p300 are structurally highly homologous and functionally redundant (Roth et al., 2001Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Histone acetyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are tumor suppressors and function as integrators for many signal transduction pathways through interaction with numerous critical transcription factors and other functional proteins. Our data indicate that p300 is highly enriched in promoters (Figure 1A) and potential enhancers identified by intergenic DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites (Figure 1B). The latter is consistent with recent reports that acetylation islands (Roh et al., 2007Roh T.Y. Wei G. Farrell C.M. Zhao K. Genome-wide prediction of conserved and nonconserved enhancers by histone acetylation patterns.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and p300 binding sites (Visel et al., 2009Visel A. Blow M.J. Li Z. Zhang T. Akiyama J.A. Holt A. Plajzer-Frick I. Shoukry M. Wright C. Chen F. et al.ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers.Nature. 2009; 457: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) can be used to predict functional enhancers. As expected, CBP demonstrated a global distribution pattern very similar to p300 in promoters and enhancers (Figures 1A and 1B). These data are consistent with a role for these enzymes in transcriptional initiation (Cho et al., 1998Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. A human RNA polymerase II complex containing factors that modify chromatin structure.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We found that 8707 promoters are associated with one or both of these enzymes. Although p300 and CBP are highly homologous, 222 promoters were associated with only p300 and 2747 were associated with only CBP, whereas 5738 promoters associated with both (Figure S4A). The differential target genes of p300 and CBP may explain their functional differences. PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor) and GCN5 are another pair of highly homologous HATs in mammals (reviewed by Yang, 2004bYang X.J. The diverse superfamily of lysine acetyltransferases and their roles in leukemia and other diseases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In addition to histone acetylation activity, the bromodomains of GCN5 and PCAF can bind acetylated N-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4 (Dhalluin et al., 1999Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Structure and ligand of a histone acetyltransferase bromodomain.Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Thus, they act as both acetylation “producers” and “effectors.” Similar to p300 and CBP, PCAF was highly enriched in promoters of active genes (Figure 1A). PCAF appears to be relatively more enriched in gene body regions as compared to CBP and p300 (Figure 1A), which is consistent with the proposed function of PCAF in transcriptional elongation (Cho et al., 1998Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. A human RNA polymerase II complex containing factors that modify chromatin structure.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The binding of PCAF was also elevated in intergenic DNase HS sites (Figure 1B), suggesting that it may also be involved in enhancer activities. Interestingly, 76.4% and 92.9% of genes associated with PCAF in promoter regions were also bound by p300 and CBP, respectively, in the promoter regions (Figures S4B and S4C). MOF and Tip60 belong to the MYST family of HATs that are less characterized and more diverse than the CBP/p300 and GCN5/PCAF HAT families (Yang, 2004bYang X.J. The diverse superfamily of lysine acetyltransferases and their roles in leukemia and other diseases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Tip60 is the catalytic subunit of an evolutionarily conserved complex, which contains at least 12 subunits, including TRRAP (Doyon et al., 2004Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Structural and functional conservation of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex from yeast to humans.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in multiple roles in transcription, DNA damage repair, and cell-cycle regulation, as well as being linked to many diseases. MOF is the catalytic subunit of an evolutionarily conserved MSL complex that is involved in dosage compensation and gene expression in Drosophila, though the functional role of the human MSL complex remains to be determined (Rea et al., 2007Rea S. Xouri G. Akhtar A. Males absent on the first (MOF): from flies to humans.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5385-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Tip60 can acetylate H2AK5, H3K14, and H4K5, K8, K12, K16 (Ikura et al., 2000Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Involvement of the TIP60 histone acetylase complex in DNA repair and apoptosis.Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), whereas both Drosophila and human MOF are specific for H4K16 acetylation (Dou et al., 2005Dou Y. Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Physical association and coordinate function of the H3 K4 methyltransferase MLL1 and the H4 K16 acetyltransferase MOF.Cell. 2005; 121: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We found that MOF was detected at high levels at the promoter region and was also relatively more enriched in gene body region as compared to CBP and p300 (Figure 1A), which is different from the Drosophila MOF that shows a bimodal binding at promoters and 3′ ends of genes (Kind et al., 2008Kind J. Vaquerizas J.M. Gebhardt P. Gentzel M. Luscombe N.M. Bertone P. Akhtar A. Genome-wide analysis reveals MOF as a key regulator of dosage compensation and gene expression in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 813-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, Tip60 exhibits strong binding at both the promoter and within the gene body of active genes (Figure 1A). These data are consistent with the elevated H4K16 acetylation along gene bodies of active genes (Wang et al., 2008Wang Z. Zang C. Rosenfeld J.A. Schones D.E. Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Peng W. Zhang M.Q. Zhao K. Combinatorial patterns of histone acetylations and methylations in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) and with a role for Tip60 in transcriptional elongation. MOF and Tip60 were detected at 8025 and 6797 genes, respectively, with an overlap of 5462 genes between them (Figure S4D). MOF and Tip60 also showed similar binding patterns at both the promoters and intergenic DNase HS sites (Figure 1B). The higher levels of HATs in active genes suggest that they may be positively correlated with gene activity. This was indeed confirmed by the analysis of average gene expression and average HAT ChIP-Seq read counts at promoters (Figure 1C). Interestingly, our data indicate that all the HATs are positively correlated with RNA Pol II binding (Figure 1D). As expected, we also observed positive correlation between HAT binding and histone acetylation levels (Figure 1E). In summary, our data indicate that p300 and CBP are mainly targeted to promoters and enhancers, whereas PCAF, MOF, and Tip60 are also associated with transcribed regions of active genes in addition to promoters. These data are consistent with the notion that p300 and CBP are involved in transcriptional initiation, while PCAF, MOF, and Tip60 may also be involved in transcriptional elongation. We also find that even though homologous HATs can bind to distinct sets of genes, many genes are associated with multiple HATs (for example in the NFκB and CD69 genes shown in Figures S2 and S3), suggesting that they may function collaboratively, sequentially, or independently at the same target genes. HDACs are generally believed to act as transcriptional corepressors (Berger, 2007Berger S.L. The complex language of chromatin regulation during transcription.Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2007Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. The role of chromatin during transcription.Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). It has been traditionally believed that HDACs are bound to repressed genes and are replaced by HATs upon gene activation (Xu et al., 1999Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Coactivator and corepressor complexes in nuclear receptor function.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). However, little is known about their target gene specificity in the human genome. Our data revealed that all the HDACs analyzed, including class I HDACs HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 and class II HDAC HDAC6, were enriched in active genes but not silent genes (Figure 2A). HDAC1 and HDAC3 were mainly detected in promoter regions, whereas HDAC2 and HDAC6 were elevated in both the promoter and gene body regions of active genes. We also examined their presence at potential enhancers and found that HDAC1, 3, and 6 were mainly enriched in promoter DNase HS sites, whereas HDAC2 was highly elevated in both the intergenic and promoter DNase HS sites (Figure 2B). Our observation of the association of HDAC6 with chromatin was unexpected because it is believed to be predominantly cytoplasmic (reviewed in Boyault et al., 2007Boyault C. Sadoul K. Pabion M. Khochbin S. HDAC6, at the crossroads between cytoskeleton and cell signaling by acetylation and ubiquitination.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5468-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The in vivo histone deacetylase activity of HDAC6 has not been demonstrated, though it has strong activity in vitro. Our data that HDAC6 was detected in nuclear extracts (Figure S1) and highly enriched in chromatin of 4706 active genes (Figure 2) strongly suggest that it functions to deacetylate histones in vivo. The enrichment of these HDACs in active genes suggests that they may be positively associated with gene expression. Indeed, we found that all HDACs tested were positively correlated with messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels (Figure 2C) and Pol II levels (Figure 2D). Interestingly, HDAC levels also appeared to positively correlate with histone acetylation levels (Figure 2E). In summary, our data confirmed the expectation that HATs, as transcription coactivators, are highly enriched in active genes (Figures 1 and S5). Surprisingly, we found that HDACs are also highly enriched in active genes (Figure 2). The majority of HDACs in the human genome are associated with active genes, and only a minor fraction are detected in silent genes (Figure S5). This observation suggests that one major function of HDACs is to remove the acetyl group added by HATs in active genes and to reset chromatin modification after gene activation, as suggested previously for Hos2 (Wang et al., 2002Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast.Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We noticed that both Tip60 and HDAC6 are highly elevated in the transcribed regions of active genes (Figure S3). The targeting of the yeast Rpd3 deacetylase complexes to the transcribed gene body regions has been suggested to be mediated by H3K36 methylation through the chromodomain of the Eaf3 subunit (Carrozza et al., 2005Carrozza M.J.

However, one human homolog of Eaf3, the MORF4 protein, lacks the chromodomain (Carrozza et al., 2005Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J.

Indeed, our data indicate that the distribution profiles of both Tip60 and HDAC6 in the gene body region appeared to parallel the signals of Pol II more than the signals of H3K36me3 (Figure 3A). Therefore, we hypothesized that Tip60 and HDAC6 may physically interact with Pol II, thus being recruited to transcribed regions in the human genome. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether they can be coimmunoprecipitated with Pol II. However, the antibodies against Tip60 failed to pull down Pol II (data not shown). We reasoned that the antibody binding might inhibit the interaction between Tip60 and Pol II. Therefore, we examined the reciprocal interaction of Pol II with TRRAP, which is a core subunit of the Tip60 complex (Ikura et al., 2000Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J.

https://openalex.org/W1966672647,"Members of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family of enzymes, which catalyze the reduction of O(2) to reactive oxygen species, have increased in number during eukaryotic evolution. Seven isoforms of the NOX gene family have been identified in mammals; however, specific roles of NOX enzymes in mammalian physiology and pathophysiology have not been fully elucidated. The best established physiological role of NOX enzymes is in host defense against pathogen invasion in diverse species, including plants. The prototypical member of this family, NOX-2 (gp91(phox)), is expressed in phagocytic cells and mediates microbicidal activities. Here we report a role for the NOX4 isoform in tissue repair functions of myofibroblasts and fibrogenesis. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) induces NOX-4 expression in lung mesenchymal cells via SMAD-3, a receptor-regulated protein that modulates gene transcription. NOX-4-dependent generation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is required for TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblast differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production and contractility. NOX-4 is upregulated in lungs of mice subjected to noninfectious injury and in cases of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of NOX-4 abrogates fibrogenesis in two murine models of lung injury. These studies support a function for NOX4 in tissue fibrogenesis and provide proof of concept for therapeutic targeting of NOX-4 in recalcitrant fibrotic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2041534255,"This study shows that adult neurogenesis requires canonical Wnt signaling to trigger transcription of pro-neural NeuroD1. Wnt signaling activates β-catenin, which in complex with TCF/LEF displaces the repressor Sox2 from a previously unknown combined Sox/LEF element in the Neurod1 promoter. Similar Sox/LEF elements activated by Wnt signaling were found in LINE-1 retrotransposons. In adult hippocampus, new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem cells (NSCs), but the molecular mechanisms regulating adult neurogenesis remain elusive. We found that Wnt signaling, together with the removal of Sox2, triggered the expression of NeuroD1 in mice. This transcriptional regulatory mechanism was dependent on a DNA element containing overlapping Sox2 and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF)-binding sites (Sox/LEF) in the promoter. Notably, Sox/LEF sites were also found in long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) elements, consistent with their critical roles in the transition of NSCs to proliferating neuronal progenitors. Our results describe a previously unknown Wnt-mediated regulatory mechanism that simultaneously coordinates activation of NeuroD1 and LINE-1, which is important for adult neurogenesis and survival of neuronal progenitors. Moreover, the discovery that LINE-1 retro-elements embedded in the mammalian genome can function as bi-directional promoters suggests that Sox/LEF regulatory sites may represent a general mechanism, at least in part, for relaying environmental signals to other nearby loci to promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis."

Clinical translation of this approach will require chimeras that are effective when administered systemically and are amenable to chemical synthesis. To these ends, we enhanced the silencing activity and specificity of aptamer-siRNA chimeras by incorporating modifications that enable more efficient processing of the siRNA by the cellular machinery. These included adding 2-nucleotide 3'-overhangs and optimizing the thermodynamic profile and structure of the duplex to favor processing of the siRNA guide strand. We also truncated the aptamer portion of the chimeras to facilitate large-scale chemical synthesis. The optimized chimeras resulted in pronounced regression of PSMA-expressing tumors in athymic mice after systemic administration. Anti-tumor activity was further enhanced by appending a polyethylene glycol moiety, which increased the chimeras' circulating half-life."
https://openalex.org/W2082817154,"Cell signaling mediated by the G protein-coupled parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTHR) is fundamental to bone and kidney physiology. It has been unclear how the two ligand systems--PTH, endocrine and homeostatic, and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), paracrine--can effectively operate with only one receptor and trigger different durations of the cAMP responses. Here we analyze the ligand response by measuring the kinetics of activation and deactivation for each individual reaction step along the PTHR signaling cascade. We found that during the time frame of G protein coupling and cAMP production, PTHrP(1-36) action was restricted to the cell surface, whereas PTH(1-34) had moved to internalized compartments where it remained associated with the PTHR and Galpha(s), potentially as a persistent and active ternary complex. Such marked differences suggest a mechanism by which PTH and PTHrP induce differential responses, and these results indicate that the central tenet that cAMP production originates exclusively at the cell membrane must be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2066480724,"Primary cilia are present on most mammalian cells and are implicated in transducing Hedgehog (Hh) signals during development; however, the prevalence of cilia on human tumors remains unclear, and the role of cilia in cancer has not been examined. Here we show that human basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are frequently ciliated, and we test the role of cilia in BCC by conditionally deleting Kif3a (encoding kinesin family member 3A) or Ift88 (encoding intraflagellar transport protein 88), genes required for ciliogenesis, in two Hh pathway-dependent mouse tumor models. Ciliary ablation strongly inhibited BCC-like tumors induced by an activated form of Smoothened. In contrast, removal of cilia accelerated tumors induced by activated Gli2, a transcriptional effector of Hh signaling. These seemingly paradoxical effects are consistent with a dual role for cilia in mediating both the activation and the repression of the Hh signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that cilia function as unique signaling organelles that can either mediate or suppress tumorigenesis depending on the nature of the oncogenic initiating event."

https://openalex.org/W2141640690,"Recent work has shown that primary cilia are essential for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling during mammalian development. It is also known that aberrant Hh signaling can lead to cancer, but the role of primary cilia in oncogenesis is not known. Cerebellar granule neuron precursors (GNPs) can give rise to medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. The primary cilium and Hh signaling are required for GNP proliferation. We asked whether primary cilia in GNPs have a role in medulloblastoma growth in mice. Genetic ablation of primary cilia blocked medulloblastoma formation when this tumor was driven by a constitutively active Smoothened protein (Smo), an upstream activator of Hh signaling. In contrast, removal of cilia was required for medulloblastoma growth by a constitutively active glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-2 (GLI2), a downstream transcription factor. Thus, primary cilia are either required for or inhibit medulloblastoma formation, depending on the initiating oncogenic event. Remarkably, the presence or absence of cilia was associated with specific variants of human medulloblastomas; primary cilia were found in medulloblastomas with activation in HH or WNT signaling but not in most medulloblastomas in other distinct molecular subgroups. Primary cilia could serve as a diagnostic tool and provide new insights into the mechanism of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2058499120,"Constitutive expression of telomerase in human cells prevents the onset of senescence and crisis by maintaining telomere homeostasis. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) contributes to cell physiology independently of its ability to elongate telomeres. Here we show that TERT interacts with the RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (RMRP), a gene that is mutated in the inherited pleiotropic syndrome cartilage–hair hypoplasia. Human TERT and RMRP form a distinct ribonucleoprotein complex that has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity and produces double-stranded RNAs that can be processed into small interfering RNA in a Dicer (also known as DICER1)-dependent manner. These observations identify a mammalian RdRP composed of TERT in complex with RMRP. Some types of RNA-mediated silencing involve the production of secondary siRNAs, made by converting single-stranded RNA into double-stranded RNA. This is done by the action of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Maida et al. now show that TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can generate dsRNA from the RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (RMRP), previously shown to be mutated in cartilage–hair hypoplasia, an inherited form of dwarfism. The resulting dsRNA can be processed into siRNAs by the endoribonuclease Dicer. This is the first report of a mammalian RdRP activity. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that TERT contributes to cell physiology independently of its ability to elongate telomeres, and this new work points to one of the mechanisms involved. Accumulating evidence suggests that the human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) has a role in cell physiology independent to that of elongating telomeres. Here it is shown to interact with RMRP, a gene that is mutated in the syndrome cartilage–hair hypoplasia, to form a distinct ribonucleoprotein complex that has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity and produces double-stranded RNAs that can be processed into small interfering RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2165661567,"Brain dopamine is implicated in the regulation of movement, attention, reward and learning and plays an important role in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug addiction. Animal experiments have demonstrated that brain stimulation is able to induce significant dopaminergic changes in extrastriatal areas. Given the up-growing interest of non-invasive brain stimulation as potential tool for treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, it would be critical to investigate dopaminergic functional interactions in the prefrontal cortex and more in particular the effect of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (areas 9/46) stimulation on prefrontal dopamine (DA).Healthy volunteers were studied with a high-affinity DA D2-receptor radioligand, [(11)C]FLB 457-PET following 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left and right DLPFC. rTMS on the left DLPFC induced a significant reduction in [(11)C]FLB 457 binding potential (BP) in the ipsilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (BA 25/12), pregenual ACC (BA 32) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11). There were no significant changes in [(11)C]FLB 457 BP following right DLPFC rTMS.To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of extrastriatal DA modulation following acute rTMS of DLPFC with its effect limited to the specific areas of medial prefrontal cortex.

https://openalex.org/W2034774838,"The rates of RNA decay and transcription determine the steady-state levels of all messenger RNA and both can be subject to regulation. Although the details of transcriptional regulation are becoming increasingly understood, the mechanism(s) controlling mRNA decay remain unclear. In yeast, a major pathway of mRNA decay begins with deadenylation followed by decapping and 5'-3' exonuclease digestion. Importantly, it is hypothesized that ribosomes must be removed from mRNA before transcripts are destroyed. Contrary to this prediction, here we show that decay takes place while mRNAs are associated with actively translating ribosomes. The data indicate that dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA is not a prerequisite for decay and we suggest that the 5'-3' polarity of mRNA degradation has evolved to ensure that the last translocating ribosome can complete translation."
https://openalex.org/W2107444074,"The RNA-binding protein Zcchc11 regulates cytokine expression in response to inflammation, although it was unclear how. Zcchc11 is shown to be an uridyltransferase that acts on mature cytokine-targeting miR-26b to influence interleukin-6 expression. Mounting an effective host immune response without incurring inflammatory injury requires the precise regulation of cytokine expression1,2. To achieve this, cytokine mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated by diverse RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting their 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs)3,4. Zcchc11 (zinc-finger, CCHC domain-containing protein 11) contains RNA-interacting motifs5, and has been implicated in signalling pathways involved in cytokine expression6. The nature of the Zcchc11 protein and how it influences cytokine expression are unknown. Here we show that Zcchc11 directs cytokine expression by uridylating cytokine-targeting miRNAs. Zcchc11 is a ribonucleotidyltransferase with a preference for uridine and is essential for maintaining the poly(A) tail length and stability of transcripts for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other specific cytokines. The miR-26 family of miRNAs targets IL-6, and the addition of terminal uridines to the miR-26 3′ end abrogates IL-6 repression. Whereas 78% of miR-26a sequences in control cells contained 1–3 uridines on their 3′ ends, less than 0.1% did so in Zcchc11-knockdown cells. Thus, Zcchc11 fine tunes IL-6 production by uridylating miR-26a, which we propose is an enzymatic modification of the terminal nucleotide sequence of mature miRNA as a means to regulate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1524571013,"The finite proliferative potential of normal human cells leads to replicative cellular senescence, which is a critical barrier to tumour progression in vivo. We show that the human p53 isoforms Delta133p53 and p53beta function in an endogenous regulatory mechanism for p53-mediated replicative senescence. Induced p53beta and diminished Delta133p53 were associated with replicative senescence, but not oncogene-induced senescence, in normal human fibroblasts. The replicatively senescent fibroblasts also expressed increased levels of miR-34a, a p53-induced microRNA, the antisense inhibition of which delayed the onset of replicative senescence. The siRNA (short interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of endogenous Delta133p53 induced cellular senescence, which was attributed to the regulation of p21(WAF1) and other p53 transcriptional target genes. In overexpression experiments, whereas p53beta cooperated with full-length p53 to accelerate cellular senescence, Delta133p53 repressed miR-34a expression and extended the cellular replicative lifespan, providing a functional connection of this microRNA to the p53 isoform-mediated regulation of senescence. The senescence-associated signature of p53 isoform expression (that is, elevated p53beta and reduced Delta133p53) was observed in vivo in colon adenomas with senescent phenotypes. The increased Delta133p53 and decreased p53beta isoform expression found in colon carcinoma may signal an escape from the senescence barrier during the progression from adenoma to carcinoma."

We confirm our strongest gene-phenotype correlation at the RNA level by allele-specific expression (ASE). We also define key parameters for the design and implementation of post-GWAS gene-phenotype investigations and demonstrate the usefulness of a large bioresource of genotype-selectable normal donors from whom fresh, primary cells can be analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2062556331,"Radial centrosomal microtubules have a role in Golgi positioning. Golgi-derived microtubules organized by CLASP are now shown to be required for the unique ribbon-like morphology of the Golgi by bringing together individual Golgi stacks. Disrupting Golgi-derived microtubules leads to defects in polarized secretion and directional cell-migration. Microtubules are indispensable for Golgi complex assembly and maintenance, which are integral parts of cytoplasm organization during interphase in mammalian cells. Here, we show that two discrete microtubule subsets drive two distinct, yet simultaneous, stages of Golgi assembly. In addition to the radial centrosomal microtubule array, which positions the Golgi in the centre of the cell, we have identified a role for microtubules that form at the Golgi membranes in a manner dependent on the microtubule regulators CLASPs. These Golgi-derived microtubules draw Golgi ministacks together in tangential fashion and are crucial for establishing continuity and proper morphology of the Golgi complex. We propose that specialized functions of these two microtubule arrays arise from their specific geometries. Further, we demonstrate that directional post-Golgi trafficking and cell migration depend on Golgi-associated CLASPs, suggesting that correct organization of the Golgi complex by microtubules is essential for cell polarization and motility."

https://openalex.org/W2138272954,"Tumor-associated macrophages mediate the link between inflammation and cancer progression. Here, we showed that macrophage-derived soluble factors induce canonical Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells and promote their growth. Tumor cells induced the release of interleukin (IL)-1beta from macrophages, which induced phosphorylation of GSK3beta, stabilized beta-catenin, enhanced T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent gene activation and induced the expression of Wnt target genes in tumor cells. Neutralization experiments using anti-IL-1beta-specific antibodies, or silencing of IL-1beta in THP1 macrophages, showed that IL-1beta was required for macrophages to induce Wnt signaling and to support the growth of tumor cells. Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 in THP1 macrophages was essential for the induction of IL-1beta and thus for the activation of beta-catenin signaling in tumor cells. Vitamin D3, an effective chemopreventive agent, interrupted this crosstalk by blocking the constitutive activation of STAT1 and the production of IL-1beta in macrophages, and therefore-in a vitamin D receptor-dependent manner-inhibited the ability of macrophages to activate Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells. Our data therefore established that vitamin D3 exerts its chemopreventive activity by interrupting a crosstalk between tumor epithelial cells and the tumor microenvironment."

Interestingly, expression analysis during early mouse development indicated that at embryonic day (E) 8.5, Gata3 expression is only detectable at the ectoplacental cone and trophoblast cells surrounding the embryonic cavity (16George K.M. Leonard M.W. Roth M.E. Lieuw K.H. Kioussis D. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Development. 1994; 120: 2673-2686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is also shown that in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells toward trophoblast cell lineage is associated with GATA3 up-regulation (17Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). These results strongly indicate that GATA3 is involved in the transcription factor networks that drive trophoblast cell linage development. Although expression of several trophoblast cell-specific genes is impaired in Gata3 mutant mice (18Ma G.T. Roth M.E. Groskopf J.C. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I.

Blood. 1997; 89: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is predicted that redundant function of another GATA factor, GATA2 might be the cause for this lack of early developmental phenotype in Gata3 mutant mice (18Ma G.T.

Our observation that GATA3 negatively regulates Gata2 expression in TS cell population, and loss of GATA3 induces GATA2 expression (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in a rat trophoblast stem cell line, further supports this prediction. However, trophoblast cell-specific GATA3 expression during early mouse development as well as its abundant expression in mouse TS cells led us to hypothesize that GATA3 might be an important regulator in TE lineage-specific gene expression. To test this hypothesis, in this study, we tested the expression pattern of GATA3 during early mouse development, and using TS cells as a model system, we tested its function on the regulation of key genes that are important for TE lineage development. Herein, we demonstrate that, at the blastocyst stage, GATA3 expression is selectively restricted in the TE lineage. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that GATA3 directly regulates Cdx2 transcription by occupying the intron 1 region of the Cdx2 chromatin domain. Our results indicate that GATA3 is an important transcription factor for gene expression in TE lineage during early mammalian development. Mouse TS cells were initially cultured on a feeder layer of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in the presence of 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4, Sigma-Aldrich) and heparin (1 μg/ml) in TS cell medium as mentioned earlier (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For experiments, mouse TS cells were expanded in a proliferative state without MEF feeders by culturing in the presence of MEF-conditioned medium. E14 mouse ES cells were cultured as mentioned earlier (25Dutta D. Ray S. Vivian J.L. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25404-25413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 3–4-week-old CD-1 females were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 5 international units P.G. 600 (Intervet, Millsboro, DE), followed by 5 international units hCG (Sigma) 48 h later. Females were mated with C57BL/6 males and euthanized the following morning (d 0.5). Oviducts were removed, 1-cell embryos were harvested in M2 medium (Millipore, Billerica, MA) after treatment with hyaluronidase (300 μg/ml M2, Sigma) and cultured in KSOM (Millipore) at 37 °C in a humidified chamber at 5% CO2. Embryos were visualized daily, photographed, and sampled at each cell stage for RNA extraction. For mRNA expression analyses in MEF, TS cells, and ES cells, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For expression analysis in different stages of pre-implantation embryos, total RNA was isolated from embryos at different developmental stages using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (MDS Analytical Technology, Sunnyvale, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. In each individual experiment, RNA was extracted from seventy 1-cell, thirty-five 2-cell, eighteen 4-cell, and nine 8-cell embryos. For the morula (≥16 cells) and blastocyst stages, five embryos at each stage were used for RNA extraction. cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA with a 5:1 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers. This was followed by incubation with moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (50 units) (Invitrogen) combined with 10 mm dithiothreitol, RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h. Reactions, lacking reverse transcriptase, were used as control. Using gene-specific primers, amplified cDNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR as mentioned earlier (12Ray S. Dutta D.

Western blot analysis was performed as mentioned earlier (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Anti-GATA3 (sc268) and anti-Eomes (sc98555) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-CDX2 (catalogue 2475-1) was obtained from Epitomics Inc. (Burlingame, CA), anti-TEAD4 (ab58310) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and anti-β-actin was obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used as secondary antibodies. Immunosurgery of mouse blastocysts was performed according to the method developed by Solter and Knowles (26Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 5099-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Zonae pellucidae were removed from blastocysts (15 blastocysts for each experiment) using 0.5% Pronase (Sigma) for 5 min. The zona-free blastocysts were then treated with rabbit anti-mouse serum (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with guinea pig complement (Innovative Research, Novi, MI) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 30 min. After washing, ICMs were collected for RNA preparation by the PicoPure RNA isolation kit, and subsequent RT-PCR analysis was performed as mentioned earlier. For immunostaining, early blastocysts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (30 min), permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (15 min), and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Embryos were incubated with anti-GATA3 antibody (1:50 dilution) in blocking solution for overnight at 4 °C, and washed three times in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Blastocysts were incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated, (Invitrogen) at 1:400 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times, and mounted using anti-fade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and viewed in LSM 510 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Maple Grove, MN). Lentiviral vectors containing short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting mouse Gata3 mRNA were cloned in pLKO.1 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Lentiviral supernatants were produced in HEK-293T cells as described earlier (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Dutta D. Ray S. Vivian J.L. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25404-25413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lentiviral supernatants were collected after 24 and 48 h of transfection. Undifferentiated mouse TS cells were grown at ∼70% confluence without MEF feeder layer and infected with lentiviral supernatants. After 48 h, infected TS cells were selected by addition of puromycin (Sigma). After 3 days, samples were prepared for mRNA and protein analysis. The Gata3 target sequence 5′-AAGAGTGCCTCAAGTATCAGG-3′ successfully knocked down expression of the target gene. For control experiments, cells were infected with viral vectors expressing shRNA against the Gata3 target sequence 5′-CCCGAAACCGGAAGATGTCTAGCAAATCGA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTACTACAAGCTTCATAA-3′, which did not knockdown GATA3 expression. To knockdown GATA3 in pre-implantation embryos, GATA3 shRNA was cloned in pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Addgene). The vector was linearized with BamHI so that the shRNA expression cassette remains intact. pLKO.3G (Addgene), which contains an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, was also linearized with BamHI and used as control. The linearized vectors were suspended in EmbryoMax Injection Buffer (Millipore) at a concentration of 1 ng/μl. 2-cell embryos were subjected to pronuclear injection in both the nucleus with 1–2 pl of suspended vectors. The embryos were grown in KSOM (Millipore) at 37 °C in a humidified chamber at 5% CO2. The cells were visualized and photographed daily under a fluorescent and phase contrast microscope for 3 days. 25 embryos were used for each set of vector, while 25 embryos, not subjected to pronuclear injection, were also cultured as an unmanipulated control. After day 3, the embryos were used to prepare total RNA using the Picopure RNA isolation kit. Quantitative ChIP analysis with mouse TS cells was performed as described earlier (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For micro-ChIP analysis with blastocysts, for each experiment, 200 blastocysts were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and ChIP analysis was performed following a protocol described earlier (27Acevedo L.G. Iniguez A.L. Holster H.L. Zhang X. Green R. Farnham P.J. BioTechniques. 2007; 43: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In short, sonicated, cross-linked chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA3 antibody. Mouse IgG1 was used as control antibody. Immunoprecipitated chromatins were reverse-cross-linked, digested with proteinase K, and purified. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were amplified using the whole genome amplification procedure (WGA2 kit from Sigma), and were analyzed by quantitative PCR for GATA3 occupancy. Primers are mentioned in the supplemental information. For transient transfection analysis, RP23–355P12 BAC DNA was used to amplify regulatory elements of mouse Cdx2 locus. Promoter region (−663 bp to −18 bp) of mouse Cdx2 gene was cloned into BglII/HindIII sites in pGL3 Basic vector (Promega). A region of Cdx2 intron 1 (2601–3469 bp) containing the conserved element was cloned into MluI/BglII sites upstream of the Cdx2 promoter in the pGL3 Basic-Cdx2 promoter (Cdx2(pro)Luc) construct. To delete the conserved WGATAR motif, upstream of the WGATAR motif was cloned into MluI/XhoI sites of Cdx2(pro)Luc construct and downstream of WGATAR motif was cloned into XhoI/BglII sites of the new construct. Thus, conserved GATA binding WGATAR motif was deleted and replaced by an XhoI restriction site. For transient transfection analysis, TS cells were transfected with an equal amount of each plasmid (3 μg). Plasmids were added to 150 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) reduced serum medium, incubated with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. After 3 h of incubation, the transfection mixture was replaced with culture medium. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured in a Veritas Microplate Luminometer using the luciferase assay buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of the lysate. At least three independent preparations of each plasmid were analyzed. Earlier, we found that GATA3 is abundantly expressed in mouse TS cells (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether GATA3 is selectively expressed in TS cells versus ES cells, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR analysis to measure Gata3 mRNA. It has been reported that Gata3 can be transcribed from two distinct promoters, distal and proximal (28Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4268-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Scheinman E.J. Avni O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3037-3048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), thereby generating two transcripts with alternative untranslated first exons, exon-1a and exon-1b, respectively. The activity of these two promoters selectively drives Gata3 expression in a tissue-specific manner (29Scheinman E.J. Avni O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3037-3048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). So, to determine whether these two Gata3 transcripts are selectively expressed in TS versus ES cells, we performed an exon-specific quantitative PCR analysis. We found that in TS cells, only exon-1b-containing transcripts are expressed (Fig. 1A), indicating that, in TS cells, the proximal promoter drives Gata3 expression. In contrast to TS cells, and similar to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF, negative control for GATA3 expression), very low levels (basal transcriptional level) of both exon-1a and exon-1b containing transcripts are present in ES cells. Quantitative RT-PCR using primers specific for Gata3 exon 3/4 also showed Gata3 mRNA expression in TS cells but not in the MEF and ES cells (data not shown). Similar to the RT-PCR analysis, Western blot analysis also detected GATA3 expression only in TS cells (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that Gata3 is expressed in the TE-derived stem cells but is absent in ICM-derived stem cells. To obtain definitive information regarding the Gata3 mRNA expression at different developmental stages of the pre-implantation mouse embryo, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 1C). In our analyses, we detected very low levels of Gata3 transcripts in 1-cell and 2-cell embryos. However, Gata3 mRNA is highly induced beginning from 4-cell embryo and is consistently present up to the blastocyst stage. This result indicates that during pre-implantation development Gata3 is transcriptionally up-regulated at the 4-cell stage. Although Gata3 transcription is induced as early as the 4-cell stage, as mentioned earlier, GATA3 is expressed selectively in TE-derived TS cells but not in the ICM-derived ES cells. So, we hypothesized that, at the blastocyst stage, GATA3 expression is restricted in the TE lineage cells. To test that, we performed two different experiments. In the first experiment, we selectively isolated mRNA from the ICM after separating the TE by immunosurgery and compared Gata3 mRNA expression with respect to the whole blastocyst. In the second experiment, we performed a whole-mount immunofluorescence microscopy to determine GATA3 protein expression in the blastocyst. For both of these experiments, we used embryos that are at the early blastocyst stage to eliminate the probability of signals coming from the primitive endoderm layer. We found that, after immunosurgery, mRNA isolated only from the ICM contains significantly less Gata3 mRNA compared with that isolated from whole blastocysts (Fig. 1D). So, at the blastocyst stage, Gata3 mRNA expression is selectively induced in the TE lineage but not in the ICM lineage. Finally, to determine the localization of GATA3 protein in the blastocyst, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy. We detected GATA3 protein expression specifically in the outer TE lineage cells but not in the ICM lineage cells (Fig. 1E). These results confirmed that at the blastocyst stage, GATA3 protein expression is restricted at the TE lineage. As GATA3 is selectively expressed in TE lineage cells and TE-derived TS cells, we next asked whether GATA3 regulates expression of key genes that are implicated in TE development. For this, we utilized an RNAi approach to knockdown GATA3 expression in TS cells and asked whether depletion of GATA3 affects expression of CDX2, Eomes, and TEAD4. We took an approach of expressing shRNA-utilizing lentiviral vectors to knockdown GATA3 and selected a shRNA (shRNA2, Fig. 2A) molecule that depleted Gata3 mRNA expression by ∼90% in TS cells. The efficient knockdown was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Under conditions when GATA3 was efficiently knocked down, we determined the mRNA expression of Cdx2, Eomes, and Tead4. We found that depletion of GATA3 selectively down-regulates Cdx2 mRNA expression by ∼68% (Fig. 2C). The Eomes mRNA expression did not change, and Tead4 mRNA expression was increased by ∼32%. Analyses of protein expression also validated the mRNA expression pattern. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D) confirmed that CDX2 expression was significantly down-regulated, TEAD4 expression was slightly up-regulated, and Eomes expression did not change with GATA3 depletion. These results indicate that, in TS cells, GATA3 positively regulates expression of CDX2, a key regulator of the TE lineage. To test the hypothesis that GATA3 directly regulates Cdx2 transcription in TS cells, we tested GATA3 chromatin occupancy at the Cdx2 locus. Sequence analysis of ∼10 kb ((−) 2 kb to (+)8 kb region from the transcription start site) segment of mouse Cdx2 locus revealed the presence of 14 canonical GATA binding (W(A/T)GATAR(A/G)) (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) motifs (Fig. 3, A and B). Among those 14 motifs, only one GATA motif, which is located at (+)2882 bp within the intron 1 of the Cdx2 locus is conserved in multiple mammalian species (Fig. 3, A and B). Two other GATA motifs, located at (+)5908 and (+)6333 bp within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of mouse Cdx2 locus, are conserved between mouse and human only (Fig. 3B). The conserved GATA motif within intron 1 is located within a ∼500-bp evolutionary conserved region (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, earlier analysis in transgenic mice from two different laboratories revealed that the conserved region of intron 1 is an important regulatory element for Cdx2 expression in multiple tissues (30Wang W.C. Shashikant C.S. J. Exp. Zoolog B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2007; 308: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Benahmed F. Gross I. Gaunt S.J. Beck F. Jehan F. Domon-Dell C. Martin E. Kedinger M. Freund J.N. Duluc I. Gastroenterology. 2008; 135 (1247.e1–3): 1238-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). So, we tested whether GATA3 occupies the conserved GATA motif within the intron 1 of the Cdx2 locus. In addition, as non- or less-conserved GATA motifs might also serve as GATA binding sites, we analyzed GATA3 occupancy at all GATA motifs that are located within ∼10 kb of the mouse Cdx2 locus. However, quantitative ChIP analyses in TS cells revealed that, at the endogenous Cdx2 locus, GATA3 occupies only the conserved (+)2882 bp GATA motif of intron 1 (Fig. 3C) but not at other regions that lack conserved GATA motifs. As TS cells are derived from the TE, and GATA3 is selectively expressed in the TE of the peri-implantation mouse embryo, we wanted to determine GATA3 chromatin occupancy at the Cdx2 intron 1 within blastocysts. Our analysis showed that, similar to TS cells, GATA3 is occupied at the intron 1 of the Cdx2 locus in blastocysts (Fig. 3D, left panel). Gata2(+) 9.5-kb region, a GATA3 binding region in TS cells (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4978-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is also occupied by GATA3 in blastocysts (Fig. 3D, right panel). However, similar to TS cells, the (+)5908 bp GATA motif within the 3′-UTR of Cdx2 locus did not show any GATA3 occupancy (Fig. 3D, middle panel). Collectively, these results along with the ChIP analysis and knockdown studies in TS cells indicate that GATA3 directly regulates Cdx2 expression in TE lineage. To assess the functional importance of the intron 1 conserved GATA motif in trophoblast cells, we performed transient transfection assays. We found that when fused to the Cdx2 promoter in front of a luciferase reporter gene, the conserved intron 1 element of the mouse Cdx2 locus enhanced the promoter activity by ∼3-fold (Fig. 3E) in TS cells. However, mutation of the conserved WGATAR motif alone significantly reduced the enhancer activity of the intronic element. These data strongly implicate the WGATAR motif as being critical for Cdx2 intron 1 enhancer activity. Our results show that GATA3 expression is induced as early as 4-cell stage in pre-implantation embryos and is restricted at the trophectoderm in peri-implantation embryos. In addition, ChIP analysis indicates that GATA3 directly regulates the Cdx2 gene in TS cells and blastocysts. However, GATA3 function and GATA3-mediated control of Cdx2 expression might be important at later rather than the early stage of trophectoderm development. The apparent lack of defect during pre-implantation development in GATA3 knockout mice further supports this possibility. However, to our knowledge, the role of GATA3 during the early stage of trophectoderm development has not been studied in a systematic way with GATA3 knockout mice. Thus, in an additional set of experiments, we attempted to determine the effects of GATA3 down-regulation in pre-implantation embryos on Cdx2 expression and on the pre-implantation development. For this experiment, we injected the GATA3 shRNA-expressing lentiviral DNA in two cell mouse embryos and monitored pre-implantation development by culturing them in vitro. To confirm that the lentiviral vector can induce shRNA expression during the course of pre-implantation development, we injected an EGFP-expressing lentiviral vector in two cell embryos and tested expression of EGFP at the blastocyst stage (Fig. 4A). This control experiment also revealed that the injection of EGFP-expressing lentiviral vectors does not significantly inhibit pre-implantation development of mouse embryos when they are cultured in vitro for 3 more days to form matured blastocysts (Fig. 4B, top and middle rows). When injected with GATA3 shRNA-expressing vectors, two cell embryos develop normally to form morulas within 2 days, and like the untreated and EGFP-expressing morulas, the GATA3 shRNA-injected morulas showed no sign of noticeable degeneration. However, intriguingly, on day 3, ∼65% of the GATA3 shRNA-expressing morulas did not mature to form blastocysts (Fig. 4, B, bottom rows and C). A few additional morulas (∼15%) matured to the blastocyst stage when cultured for one additional day (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis on day 3 with shRNA-injected embryos confirmed that Gata3 mRNA expression was inhibited by ∼85% (Fig. 4D, left panel). In addition, quantitative RT-PCR analyses also showed that in GATA3-knocked down morulas/blastocysts, Cdx2 mRNA expression was inhibited by ∼55%. However, no significant loss in Tead4 mRNA levels was observed in GATA3-knocked down morulas/blastocysts. In addition, mRNA expression of Oct-4, another important transcription factor involved in lineage specification and development of ICM lineage in early embryos (6Niwa H. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Strumpf D. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Rossant J. Cell. 2005; 123: 917-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), was not altered in GATA3-knocked down embryos (Fig. 4D, right panel). These results strongly implicate that GATA3 regulates Cdx2 expression during early trophectoderm development, and GATA3 function is required for efficient maturation of blastocysts from the morula stage. The intricate transcriptional networks that dictate cellular and molecular events leading to the establishment and proper function of the TE and ICM lineages are still poorly understood. One of the strategies to understand these molecular mechanisms is to find out potential transcriptional regulators that are selectively expressed in TE versus ICM lineages followed by testing their functions. Although multiple studies indicated that GATA3 is highly expressed in trophoblast cell lineages (12Ray S. Dutta D. Rumi M.A. Kent L.N. Soares M.J. Paul S. J. Biol.

Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I. Development. 1997; 124: 907-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), major efforts have not been taken to determine its expression during early embryonic development. The lack of early developmental phenotype in Gata3 mutant mice might be one of the causes behind this lack of study. In this study (i) we have delineated the expression pattern of transcription factor GATA3 in pre-implantation embryos showing that it is selectively induced at the TE lineage at the blastocyst stage, and (ii) we have shown that down-regulation of GATA3 inhibits maturation of blastocyst from the morula stage (Fig. 4B). We have also demonstrated here that GATA3 directly regulates Cdx2 expression in TS cells and in blastocysts (Figs. 3D and 4D). As CDX2 function is important for TE development, we speculate that GATA3 is an important regulator of molecular events that contributes to the early lineage commitment and TE development and/or TS cell self-renewal. In this respect GATA3 might have a role resembling transcription factors Elf5 and ETS2. It has been shown that during early lineage commitment Elf5 functions downstream of initial lineage determination, to reinforce commitment to the trophoblast lineage or to abort this pathway in epiblast cells (33Ng R.K.

Like GATA3, both Elf5 and ETS2 regulate Cdx2 expression but Elf5- and Ets2-null mutations do not mimic Cdx2-null mutation (35Donnison M. Beaton A. Davey H.W. Broadhurst R. L'Huillier P. Pfeffer P.L. Development. 2005; 132: 2299-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto H. Flannery M.L. Kupriyanov S. Pearce J. McKercher S.R. Henkel G.W. Maki R.A. Werb Z. Oshima R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, the functional redundancy of GATA2 and GATA3 might rescue the lack of an early developmental or overt placental phenotype in Gata3−/− mice (18Ma G.T. Roth M.E. Groskopf J.C. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I. Development. 1997; 124: 907-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that GATA2 and GATA3 might function redundantly in certain contexts is evident from a recent study (37Ferreira R. Wai A. Shimizu R. Gillemans N. Rottier R. von Lindern M. Ohneda K. Grosveld F. Yamamoto M. Philipsen S. Blood. 2007; 109: 5481-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in which both Gata2 and Gata3 transgenes, when expressed in the appropriate spatiotemporal pattern under the control of Gata1 regulatory elements, rescued the erythroid defect of Gata1-null mice. However, experiments have not been done in a context where both GATA2 and GATA3 are limiting to test their functional redundancy during early embryonic development. GATA transcription factors regulate gene expression in multiple modes; (i) by activation of a repressed gene; (ii) by modulating the level of transcription; (iii) by maintaining transcriptionally active state; and (iv) by repressing an active gene. Our finding that GATA3 directly regulates Cdx2 transcription in a positive fashion raises the question via which mode GATA3 regulates Cdx2 expression in TE lineage. It is shown that, transcription factor TEAD4 regulates initial Cdx2 expression during pre-implantation mouse development (10Yagi R. Kohn M.J. Karavanova I. Kaneko K.J. Vullhorst D. DePamphilis M.L. Buonanno A. Development. 2007; 134: 3827-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Nishioka N. Yamamoto S. Kiyonari H. Sato H. Sawada A. Ota M. Nakao K. Sasaki H. Mech. Dev. 2008; 125: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Expression analysis in pre-implantation embryos indicated that initial expression of Cdx2 could be detected as early as 8-cell stage. However, later Cdx2 levels are differentially regulated across the inside/outside axis of the embryo, with progressively higher levels in outside cells, and low levels in inside cells (8Ralston A. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As GATA3 expression is also induced at the outside cells at the blastocyst stage (Fig. 1, D and E), we predict that GATA3 positively induces and maintains higher levels of Cdx2 transcription in outer cells after initial induction of Cdx2 expression by a TEAD4-dependent mechanism or other pathways. However, other possibilities like GATA3 and TEAD4 might coordinately regulate Cdx2 and other TE-specific gene expression cannot be ruled out. Our findings also raise two other questions; (i) what are the molecular mechanisms that induce GATA3 expression during peri-implantation development and restricts its expression in the TE lineage at blastocyst stage? and (ii) does GATA3 activate parallel downstream pathways, independent of CDX2, to specify TE fate and development of trophoblast cell lineages? Regarding GATA3 expression, it is possible that TEAD4 might directly or indirectly regulate GATA3 expression in pre-implantation embryos. Our curious analysis revealed the presence of multiple conserved canonical TEAD binding sites within the Gata3 regulatory regions. The fact that TEAD4 expression is induced in GATA3-knocked down TS cells (Fig. 2, C and D) further indicates a possibility in which GATA3 might negatively regulate TEAD4 to properly orchestrate TE-specific gene expression. Regarding the GATA3 downstream pathways, it is important to take new experimental approaches like determining global gene expression patterns after knocking down GATA3 expression in pre-and peri-implantation embryos. Along with this approach, performing a global analysis of GATA3 target genes within blastocysts will provide important insights regarding GATA3 function during early embryonic development.

https://openalex.org/W2051240384,"A subset of central glutamatergic synapses are coordinately pruned and matured by unresolved mechanisms during postnatal development. We report that the human epilepsy gene LGI1, encoding leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated protein-1 and mutated in autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE), mediates this process in hippocampus. We created transgenic mice either expressing a truncated mutant LGI1 (835delC) found in ADLTE or overexpressing a wild-type LGI1. We discovered that the normal postnatal maturation of presynaptic and postsynaptic functions was arrested by the 835delC mutant LGI1, and contrastingly, was magnified by excess wild-type LGI1. Concurrently, mutant LGI1 inhibited dendritic pruning and increased the spine density to markedly increase excitatory synaptic transmission. Inhibitory transmission, by contrast, was unaffected. Furthermore, mutant LGI1 promoted epileptiform discharge in vitro and kindling epileptogenesis in vivo with partial gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor blockade. Thus, LGI1 represents a human gene mutated to promote epilepsy through impaired postnatal development of glutamatergic circuits."

Utilizing CT26 colon cancer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages as a model cellular system, we demonstrate that treatment of CT26 cells with RAW 264.7 conditioned medium induces cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Inflammatory gene microarray analysis indicated CT26-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages upregulate SDF-1α and VEGF, and that these cytokines contribute to CT26 migration in vitro. RAW 264.7 macrophages also showed a robust chemotactic response towards CT26-derived chemokines. In particular, microarray analysis and functional testing revealed CSF-1 as the major chemoattractant for RAW 264.7 macrophages. Interestingly, in the chick CAM model of cancer progression, RAW 264.7 macrophages localized specifically to the tumor periphery where they were found to increase CT26 tumor growth, microvascular density, vascular disruption, and lung metastasis, suggesting these cells home to actively invading areas of the tumor, but not the hypoxic core of the tumor mass. In support of these findings, hypoxic conditions down regulated CSF-1 production in several tumor cell lines and decreased RAW 264.7 macrophage migration in vitro. Together our findings suggest a model where normoxic tumor cells release CSF-1 to recruit macrophages to the tumor periphery where they secrete motility and angiogenic factors that facilitate tumor cell invasion and metastasis."

Both translocation of Akt to cell membranes and phosphorylation of Thr308/Ser473 are required for full enzyme activity. PI3K is an upstream regulator of Akt (21.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

Convulxin (CVX), a snake venom protein belonging to the heterodimeric C-type lectin family, is a selective GPVI agonist that mediates platelet activation by collagen (28.Polgár J. Clemetson J.M.

Although it has been shown that CVX activates Akt in platelets, the signaling events involved in Akt activation mediated by GPVI signaling are not well established in platelets. Our study reveals that GPVI-mediated Akt phosphorylation is regulated in a dual way: (a) dependent on secreted ADP and Gi signaling and (b) secretion-independent downstream of GPVI. We have found that PI3Kβ isoform plays an essential role in secretion-independent Akt activation as well as aggregation, secretion, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4186-4195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in PI3K p110γ or PI3K p110δ were from sources previously described (34.Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Goncalves I. Nesbitt W.S. Yap C.L. Wright C.E. Kenche V. Anderson K.E. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Sturgeon S.A. Prabaharan H. Thompson P.E. Smith G.D. Shepherd P.R. Daniele N.

P2Y12-deficient mice were from Dr. Xiaoping Du (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Human blood was collected from a pool of healthy volunteers in a one-sixth volume of acid-citrate-dextrose (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g of glucose in 100 ml of H2O). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation of citrated blood at 230 × g for 20 min at room temperature. Acetylsalicylic acid was added to PRP to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the preparation was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 980 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing 0.1 unit/ml apyrase. This low concentration of apyrase is not enough to block responses to ADP but will prolong the responsiveness of platelets to ADP by preventing desensitization of the P2Y receptors. These conditions have been standardized in the laboratory. The platelet count was adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml. Blood was collected from the vena cava of anesthetized mice into syringes containing 1/10th blood volume of 3.8% sodium citrate as anticoagulant. Red blood cells were removed by centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min at room temperature. PRP was recovered, and platelets were pelleted at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.05 units/ml apyrase to a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml. Platelets were stimulated with agonists under non-stirring condition for the appropriate time, and the Akt phosphorylation was measured as previously described (23.Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4186-4195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In some experiments, GF 109203X (10 μm), a PKC inhibitor, dimethyl-BAPTA (10 μm), a calcium chelator, and PP2 (10 μm), a Src family kinase inhibitor, were added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C without stirring before agonist stimulation. Convulxin-induced platelet aggregation was measured using a lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA) at 37 °C with stirring (900 rpm). A 0.5-ml sample of aspirin-treated washed platelets was stimulated with CVX in the presence of ADP receptor antagonists MRS-2179 and AR-C69931MX, and the change in light transmission was measured. Platelets were preincubated with different PI3K inhibitors before agonist stimulation. The chart recorder (Kipp and Zonen, Bohemia, NY) was set for 0.2 mm/s. Platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of ATP by adding luciferin-luciferase reagent. Platelet ATP release and aggregation were performed in a lumi-aggregometer at 37 °C with stirring at 900 rpm simultaneously. Platelet secretion was also independently determined by measuring the release of [3H]5-HT. PRP was incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]5-HT, and 1 μm imipramine was added to the Tyrode buffer during resuspension of the washed platelets to prevent re-uptake of secreted 5-HT. Secretion experiments were stopped after 2 min with the addition of formaldehyde/EDTA. Samples were then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 1 min, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was measured using a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter (Gaithersburg, MD). Platelet secretion was expressed as the percentage of total [3H]5-HT present in platelets without activation. Platelet Ca2+ mobilization was also measured. PRP was incubated with 5 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester and 1 mm aspirin. Fluorescence was measured, and the Ca2+ concentration was calculated as previously described (43.Quinter P.G. Dangelmaier C.A. Quinton T.M. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). OG488-fibrinogen binding to washed mouse platelets was quantified by flow cytometry (44.Maxwell M.J. Yuan Y. Anderson K.E. Hibbs M.L. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32196-32204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed murine platelets (5 × 107/ml) were stimulated with CRP (10 μg/ml) at room temperature in the presence of Oregon Green-fibrinogen (OG-FGN, 20 μg/ml), mixed and at predetermined time-points fixed with 2% (final) paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The fluorescent intensity of each platelet sample was analyzed using a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences), with OG-FGN absorbing at 498 ± 5 nm and emitting a maximum wavelength of 524 ± 5 nm. The extent of integrin αIIbβ3 activation was represented by the level of OG-FGN binding of 10,000 platelets, expressed numerically as the geometric mean (arbitrary fluorescence units, CellQuest software). Nonspecific fluorescence, as measured in resting platelets, was subtracted from all data points. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance. All statistical tests were carried out using Prism software (Version 3.0). Data are presented as means ± S.E. It has been shown that Akt is phosphorylated in platelets in response to a selective agonist for the platelet collagen receptor GPVI (25.Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12874-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation, Ser473 phosphorylation was monitored over a time range of 0.5–20 min. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Akt is phosphorylated on Ser473 (supplemental Fig. S1) in response to CVX in both time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. An increase in Ser473 phosphorylation was detectable within 30 s of 100 ng/ml CVX stimulation. The level of phosphorylation peaked at around 5 min of stimulation and gradually decreased. These results are consistent with a previous study in which an increase in Ser473 phosphorylation was detectable within 20 s, and the level of phosphorylation peaked at around 5 min (25.Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12874-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We exposed platelets to different concentrations of CVX, and Ser473 phosphorylation was measured at 3 min after the addition of agonist. An increase in Ser473 phosphorylation was detectable at concentrations above 10 ng/ml CVX, and maximal phosphorylation was achieved at concentrations above 50 ng/ml CVX. To elucidate downstream pathways involved in GPVI-mediated Akt phosphorylation in platelets, we first focused on the role of secreted ADP. As seen in Fig. 1, treatment of platelets with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (45.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) significantly, but not completely, inhibited both Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation. We then used the selective antagonists of the platelet ADP receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. P2Y12 receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX (46.Ingall A.H. Dixon J. Bailey A. Coombs M.E. Cox D. McInally J.I. Hunt S.F. Kindon N.D. Teobald B.J. Willis P.A. Humphries R.G. Leff P. Clegg J.A. Smith J.A. Tomlinson W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) drastically reduced the Akt phosphorylation to the same extent obtained by GF109203X, but P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS-2179 (47.Baurand A. Raboisson P. Freund M. Léon C. Cazenave J.P. Bourguignon J.J. Gachet C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 412: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) had no effect on CVX-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that secreted ADP and subsequent P2Y12 receptor-mediated Gi stimulation plays a major role in GPVI-mediated Akt phosphorylation. However, they also indicate that there is residual Akt phosphorylation induced by CVX in the absence of secretion, which is due to a P2Y12-independent component. To further identify the additional signaling molecules involved in P2Y12-independent pathways facilitating GPVI-mediated Akt phosphorylation, we looked at the contribution of GPVI-induced intracellular calcium mobilization in Akt phosphorylation. When we used the high affinity calcium chelator dimethyl-BAPTA, CVX-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly inhibited, suggesting that intracellular calcium is prerequisite of Akt phosphorylation. Because of the involvement of Src-family kinases to GPVI signaling in platelets, we used the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 (48.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) to evaluate whether Src-family kinase activation is required for Akt activation mediated by CVX in platelets. Fig. 1 shows that PP2 completely blocked Akt phosphorylation induced by CVX, suggesting the essential role of Src-family kinases in GPVI-mediated Akt activation. PI3K activation through the collagen receptor is downstream of Src-family kinases, and PI3K is the main upstream regulator of Akt (21.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (29.Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M. Hechler B. Viala C. Presek P. Martinson E.A. Cazenave J.P. Chap H. Gachet C. Blood. 1999; 94: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) completely inhibited CVX-induced Akt phosphorylation confirming the essential role of PI3K in Akt phosphorylation. Thus, these results demonstrate that Src-family kinases and PI3K are the major contributor to the P2Y12-independent pathways in addition to the P2Y12-dependent pathways. To further confirm the importance of secreted ADP and Gi stimulation in mouse as well as human platelets, we used platelets from P2Y1- and P2Y12-deficient mice or mice dosed with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel blocks activation of platelets by selectively targeting the P2Y12 receptor (49.Geiger J. Brich J. Hönig-Liedl P. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbächer P. Herbert J.M. Walter U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Consistent with the activation profile seen in human platelets, wild-type murine platelets exhibited an increased Akt phosphorylation in response to CVX, which was significantly inhibited in the presence of AR-C69931MX and GF109203X (Fig. 2). Similar Akt phosphorylation profile in response to CVX was observed in platelets from the P2Y1-deficient mice. However, Akt phosphorylation was significantly diminished in response to CVX in both P2Y12-deficient platelets and clopidogrel-dosed murine platelets further indicating the important role of P2Y12-dependent pathways in CVX-mediated Akt phosphorylation. This residual phosphorylation of Akt was not affected in the presence of AR-C69931MX and GF109203X confirming the contribution of P2Y12-independent pathways to GPVI-mediated Akt phosphorylation. The remaining Akt phosphorylation was eliminated by PP2 and LY294002, demonstrating that Src family kinases and PI3K are required for the P2Y12-independent pathways. In addition, Akt was phosphorylated in response to CVX in a conce"

Definition of useful markers is crucial for the identification of HFK stem cells. Because wilms' tumor, a pediatric renal cancer, initiates from retention of renal stem cells, we hypothesized that surface antigens previously up-regulated in microarrays of both HFK and blastema-enriched stem-like wilms' tumor xenografts (NCAM, ACVRIIB, DLK1/PREF, GPR39, FZD7, FZD2, NTRK2) are likely to be relevant markers. Comprehensive profiling of these putative and of additional stem cell markers (CD34, CD133, c-Kit, CD90, CD105, CD24) in mid-gestation HFK was performed using immunostaining and FACS in conjunction with EpCAM, an epithelial surface marker that is absent from the MM and increases along nephron differentiation and hence can be separated into negative, dim or bright fractions. No marker was specifically localized to the MM. Nevertheless, FZD7 and NTRK2 were preferentially localized to the MM and emerging tubules (<10% of HFK cells) and were mostly present within the EpCAMneg and EpCAMdim fractions, indicating putative stem/progenitor markers. In contrast, single markers such as CD24 and CD133 as well as double-positive CD24+CD133+ cells comprise >50% of HFK cells and predominantly co-express EpCAMbright, indicating they are mostly markers of differentiation. Furthermore, localization of NCAM exclusively in the MM and in its nephron progenitor derivatives but also in stroma and the expression pattern of significantly elevated renal stem/progenitor genes Six2, Wt1, Cited1, and Sall1 in NCAM+EpCAM- and to a lesser extent in NCAM+EpCAM+ fractions confirmed regional identity of cells and assisted us in pinpointing the presence of subpopulations that are putative MM-derived progenitor cells (NCAM+EpCAM+FZD7+), MM stem cells (NCAM+EpCAM-FZD7+) or both (NCAM+FZD7+). These results and concepts provide a framework for developing cell selection strategies for human renal cell-based therapies."

Both cell-free methemoglobin and ferryl hemoglobin are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of hemolytic disorders. We show hereby that ferryl hemoglobin, but not hemoglobin or methemoglobin, acts as a potent proinflammatory agonist that induces vascular endothelial cells in vitro to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton, forming intercellular gaps and disrupting the integrity of the endothelial cell monolayer. Furthermore, ferryl hemoglobin induces the expression of proinflammatory genes in endothelial cells in vitro, e.g. E-selectin, Icam-1, and Vcam-1, through the activation of the nuclear factor κB family of transcription factors. This proinflammatory effect, which requires actin polymerization, involves the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways.

Hemoglobin (Hb) is a tetrameric (α2β2) hemoprotein that accounts for 97% of the total dry content of red blood cells in mammals, where it acts essentially as a gas sensor/carrier (for review, see Ref. 1Schechter A.N.

Under inflammatory conditions EC become activated, promoting vasoconstriction and thrombosis as well as leukocyte chemotaxis, adhesion, and transmigration (for review, see Ref. 12Pober J.S. Sessa W.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). This proinflammatory response results from the expression of immediate-early responsive genes encoding vasoconstrictive (e.g. endothelin 1/2), pro-thrombotic (e.g. tissue factor), proinflammatory (e.g. interleukin-1 and -6), and chemotactic (e.g. interleukin-8) as well as adhesive (e.g. intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1/CD54), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1/CD106), E-selectin/CD62E, and P-selectin/CD62P molecules (for review, see Ref. 12Pober J.S. Sessa W.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Expression of these genes is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level via activation of the nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors (13Wrighton C.J. Hofer-Warbinek R.

NF-κB comprises five family members, i.e. NF-κB1/p105, NF-κB2/p100, RelA/p65, RelB, and c-Rel that can form active homo- or heterodimers (for review, see Ref. 15Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Under homeostasis, these NF-κB dimers are kept in an inactive form based on their constitutive sequestration by cytoplasmic inhibitors of NF-κB molecules, namely IκBα (16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

This allows for rapid nuclear translocation and binding of the NF-κB dimers to DNA “κB motifs” in the promoter of NF-κB-dependent genes (for review, see Ref. 15Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Some NF-κB family members, such as p65/RelA, must be further phosphorylated (21Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. J. Biol.

As reported hereby, ferrylHb acts as a proinflammatory agonist in EC through activation of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling transduction pathways. Based on this observation we propose that oxidized cell-free Hb might contribute to the pathologic outcome of hemolytic disorders. Wild type and Tlr2−/−, 4−/−, and 9−/− C57BL/6 mice were maintained at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with guidelines from the Animal User and Institutional Ethical Committees of this institute.

Bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages (Mø) were obtained from naive BALB/c mice by flushing the marrow from femurs and tibias. The marrow plugs were disrupted into a single cell suspension and cultured in RPMI (20% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30% supernatant from L929 cells) for 6 days. On day 6 of culture cells were cultured in complete RPMI (10% FCS) and used on day 7 in the experimental assays. Hb at different redox states, i.e. (Fe(II)) Hb, (Fe(III)) MtHb, and ferrylHb, were prepared as described (3Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hb was isolated from fresh blood drawn from healthy volunteers using ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (Sigma-Aldrich). MtHb was generated by incubation (30 min, 25 °C) of purified Hb with a 1.5-fold molar excess of K3Fe(CN)6 (Sigma-Aldrich) over heme. FerrylHb was obtained by incubation (1 h, 37 °C) of Hb with a 10-fold H2O2 molar excess (Sigma-Aldrich) over heme. After oxidation, both MtHb and ferrylHb were dialyzed (3×, 3 h, 100× saline volume, 4 °C) to remove K3Fe(CN)6 and H2O2, separated into aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used. Purity of each Hb preparation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Hb polymerization was detected by Western blot using a chicken anti-human polyclonal Hb antibody (ab17542, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Hb redox state was assessed by UV-visible spectra recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Duisburg, Germany) with 1-cm quartz cells (Hellma, Jena, Germany). Hb dityrosine content was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection as described (10Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24129-24136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 nmol of Hb was precipitated with 20% of trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (5 min, 1500 × g) the pellet was hydrolyzed overnight (100 °C in 6 mol/liter hydrochloric acid), the liquid was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in methanol and injected to HPLC using a reverse phase C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5-mm particle size) and fluorescence detection (λEx = 280 nm, λEm = 410 nm, Merck). The mobile phase consisted of 20% methanol and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. All reagents were HPLC grade (Merck). Dityrosine standard was prepared as described (10Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24129-24136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 mmol/liter l-tyrosine was reacted with 1 mmol/liter H2O2 in the presence of 1 μmol/liter horseradish peroxidase at pH 9.5 for 18 h at 37 °C. The enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration, and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in ethanol and chromatographed on a silica thin layer plate (20 × 20 cm) with an eluent of butanol:acetic acid:water (4:2:1 v/v%). The fluorescent band with an RF = 0.25 was excised and extracted with methanol and used as a dityrosine standard. Protein concentration in Hb preparations was determined spectrophotometrically, as described (4Winterbourn C. Reactions of Superoxide with Hemoglobin. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1985Google Scholar). Endotoxin content was analyzed by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Bio Whittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD). To measure H2O2 concentration, ferrylHb was filtered (Microcon YM-3 column; Millipore) (60 min at 14 °C, 21,000 × g) to remove proteins (molecular mass > 3 kDa), and the H2O2 in flow-through was measured using a fluorometric detection kit (Assaydesign; Stressgen) in three different preparations of ferrylHb in triplicate. Polymyxin B sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed (15–30 μg/ml) with vehicle, ferrylHb (20 μm), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) (30 min, 37 °C). LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen). Catalase (Calbiochem, Merck) was incubated with ferrylHb or vehicle (30 min, 37 °C). Hemin (iron protoporphyrin IX) (Frontier Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) was prepared as described (23Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M. Soares M.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor 1 (l-stereoisomer, Alexis Biochemicals, Lausanne, Switzerland) and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the culture medium 30 min before further treatment and left until the end of the experiments. Cytochalasin D and latrunculin B (LatB) (Calbiochem) were dissolved in DMSO and added to the culture medium 30 min before ferrylHb or LPS and left until the end of the experiments. Jasplakinolide (Calbiochem) was dissolved in DMSO. Actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS (100 μg/ml) and added to culture medium 30 min before the addition of ferrylHb or LPS and left until the end of the assay. Cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol (100 μg/ml) and added to culture medium at 10 μg/ml. Human recombinant TNF (Research and Development, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Pervanadate (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as described (24Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVEC grown in gelatinized glass coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (20 min, 25 °C), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). F-actin and DNA were stained with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (50 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (20 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRA2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Fluorescence was detected at λEx = 535/50 nm and λEm = 610/75 nm for TRITC, λEx = 480/50 nm and λEm = 527/30 nm for ferrylHb, and λEx = 360/40 nm and λEm = 470/40 nm for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were acquired using Metamorph v4.6r5 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA) and analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH; Bethesda, MD). p38 siRNA (sc-29433) and control siRNA (sc-36869, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), JNK1, and JNK2 siRNAs (l-003514-00 and l-003505-00, Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used at 50 pmol/well of a 12-well plate. HUVEC were transfected at 75–85% confluence according to the Invitrogen siRNA protocol for HUVEC. Briefly, 50 pmol of siRNA were mixed with 4 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of serum free EBM-2 and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. During this period the growth medium from HUVEC was removed, and cells were placed in 400 μl of serum free EBM-2. Then 100 μl of Oligofectamine/siRNA transfection mixture was added per well (3 h), and transfection was stopped (250 μl of complete EBM-2 containing 6% FCS). Transfection efficiency (typically 90–100%) was monitored 24 h thereafter, and medium was replaced by complete EBM-2, 2% FCS. All experiments were carried out 72 h after siRNA transfections. HUVEC at 80–90% confluence were co-transduced with recombinant adenovirus encoding a NF-κB luciferase reporter (Photinus pyralis luciferase gene under the control of a synthetic promoter containing five binding motifs for NF-κB (5′-GGGGACTTTCC-3′; NF-κB-luc), IκBα dominant negative mutant (IκBα-S32A/S36A; IκBα DNM)(Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA) plus a recombinant adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (LacZ) (a kind gift from Dr. R. Gerard; University of Texas Southwest Medical Center, Dallas, TX) essentially as described (14Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhäuslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 3553-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 48 h after adenovirus transduction. Luciferase expression was quantified using a single (firefly) luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase expression was quantified using Galacto-Light Plus β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Both luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured using a Microlumat Plus luminometer (LB96V, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Assays were performed in triplicate, and luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase. Normalized luciferase activity is shown in arbitrary units. VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin protein expression were measured by cellular ELISA, as described elsewhere (25Soares M.P. Seldon M.P. Gregoire I.P. Vassilevskaia T. Berberat P.O. Yu J. Tsui T.Y. Bach F.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3553-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). IL-8 was detected using human IL-8 ELISA (BD Biosciences). Murine IL-6 and TNF were detected with mouse IL-6 and TNF ELISA sets, respectively (BD Biosciences). Intracellular free radical content was measured by flow cytometry using 5 μm 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes) as described (26Seldon M.P. Silva G. Pejanovic N. Larsen R. Gregoire I.P. Filipe J. Anrather J. Soares M.P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7840-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cellular thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (OXI-TEC, Alexis, Nottingham, UK). HUVEC were lysed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich)), and proteins were resolved (8–12% SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blotted with antibodies directed against human E-selectin (sc-14011, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), VCAM-1 (sc-8304, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ICAM-1 (BBA3, R&D Systems), p65/RelA (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-p65-Ser-536 (#3031, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), IκBα (sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-IκBα-Ser-32/36 (#9246, Cell Signaling), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK (#9252, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK-Thr-183/Tyr-185 (#9251, Cell Signaling), p38 (#9212, Cell Signaling), phospho-p38-Thr-180/Tyr-182 (#9211, Cell Signaling), or anti-IκBα-phospho-Tyr-42 antibody (ab24783, Abcam). To ascertain equivalent protein loading, membranes were stripped and re-probed with a mouse anti-human α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich). Lamin A/C monoclonal antibody (sc-7292, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a loading control in nuclear extracts. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Pierce). Peroxidase activity was visualized using the SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Digital images were obtained using Kodak Image Station 440CF apparatus (Eastman Kodak Co.). Images were captured using Adobe Photoshop® software, and relative levels of protein expression were quantified using ImageJ® 1.29 software (National Institutes of Health). cDNA was obtained from total RNA isolated from HUVEC or mouse livers, as described (26Seldon M.P.

Seldon M.P. Soares M.P. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1894-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The relative number of mRNA transcripts was assessed using Light Cycler real-time quantitative PCR (Roche Applied Science) using FastStart DNA SYBR Green I mix (Roche Applied Science). Transcript number was calculated using a 2−ΔΔCT method (relative number) or quantified as an absolute value using standard cDNA plasmids encoding the same sequences as those amplified by PCR. Results were normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt). PCR primers used to quantify human mRNA transcripts were: 5′-GGAGAACCCAGATAGACAG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCACATAAATAAACCCC-3′ for Vcam-1, 5′-TCACCTATGGCAACGACTC-3′ and 5′-GATGGGCAGTGGGAAAGTG-3′ for Icam-1, 5′-ATGTGGAATGATGAGAGGTG-3′ and 5′-AACTGGGATTTGCTGTGTC-3′ for E-selectin, and 5′-GGCGTCGTGATTAGTGATG-3′ and 5′-ACTTCGTGGGGTCCTTTTC-3′ for Hprt. PCR primers used to quantify murine mRNA transcripts were described elsewhere (26Seldon M.P. Silva G. Pejanovic N. Larsen R. Gregoire I.P. Filipe J. Anrather J. Soares M.P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7840-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two days post-confluent HUVEC were exposed to ferrylHb (20 μm; 6 h), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (14Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhäuslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Anrather J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4572-4582PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with the IgκB probe (sense 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). The oligonucleotide was labeled by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP. Mobility shift was visualized in the form of autoradiographs. HUVEC were treated with ferrylHb (20 μm) or cycloheximide plus TNF (8 h), a potent pro-apoptotic stimulus to EC (27Silva G. Cunha A. Grégoire I.P. Seldon M.P. Soares M.P. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1894-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in PBS and detached (37 °C, 5 min) with 0.125% trypsin, 0.05% EDTA solution (Invitrogen). Digestion was stopped (PBS, 10% FCS), and cells were pelleted (200 × g, 4 °C, 3 min), washed (PBS, 3% FCS), and co-stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated annexin V (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) plus propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml, P-4170, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Annexin V and propidium iodide fluorescence were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc. Ashland, OR). Alternatively, viability was assessed by a crystal violet assay as described (14Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhäuslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Anrather J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4572-4582PubMed Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice (female, 6–8 weeks of age) were injected intraperitoneally with 2 μmol/kg Hb, MtHb, or ferrylHb in 200 μl of apyrogen PBS. Control mice received PBS only. After 16 h mice were sacrificed by CO2 exposure, and murine peritoneal leukocytes were harvested by peritoneal lavage using ice-cold apyrogen calcium and magnesium-free PBS containing 2% FCS (v/v) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The total number of cells was assessed using a fixed number of latex beads (Beckman Coulter, Paris, France) and co-acquired with a pre-established volume of the cellular suspensions. The number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells was evaluated using R-phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ly-6G (Gr1; CD11b) (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and biotin anti-mouse neutrophils monoclonal antibody (CL8993B, Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Cells were co-stained with propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) to exclude dead cells. Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. or S.E. of independent in vitro or in vivo experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test when the data follow Gaussian distributions, an assumption tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. When the data do not follow Gaussian distributions, the Mann-Whitney U test was used instead. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test were used for comparison between values from more than two different groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cell-free ferrous Hb was purified from human blood of healthy donors and used to generate MtHb and ferrylHb (4Winterbourn C. Reactions of Superoxide with Hemoglobin. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1985Google Scholar). Relative purity of each Hb preparation was higher than 95%, as determined by silver staining after SDS/PAGE separation (Fig. 1A). Contrary to Hb and MtHb, ferrylHb polymerized, as detected by silver staining (Fig. 1A) and Western blot (Fig. 1B), whic"
https://openalex.org/W1965526605,"Mechanosensitive channels protect bacteria from osmotic shock by allowing ions to flow across the membrane in response to changes in membrane tension. MscL is one such channel with large conductance, which exhibits several intermediate states between its closed and open forms. The 3.8-Å crystal structure of the Staphylococcus aureus MscL has now been determined in a nonconductive, partially expanded and tetrameric form. Mechanosensitive channels protect bacteria from osmotic shock by allowing ions to flow across the membrane in response to changes in membrane tension. MscL is one such channel with a large conductance. Although understanding of its closed and open states has been increasing, little is known about the structures of the important intermediate states. Here, the 3.8 Å crystal structure of MscL in what is probably a non-conductive, partially expanded intermediate state, is presented. The ability of cells to sense and respond to mechanical force underlies diverse processes such as touch and hearing in animals, gravitropism in plants, and bacterial osmoregulation1,2. In bacteria, mechanosensation is mediated by the mechanosensitive channels of large (MscL), small (MscS), potassium-dependent (MscK) and mini (MscM) conductances. These channels act as ‘emergency relief valves’ protecting bacteria from lysis upon acute osmotic down-shock3. Among them, MscL has been intensively studied since the original identification and characterization 15 years ago4. MscL is reversibly and directly gated by changes in membrane tension. In the open state, MscL forms a non-selective 3 nS conductance channel which gates at tensions close to the lytic limit of the bacterial membrane. An earlier crystal structure at 3.5 Å resolution of a pentameric MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents a closed-state or non-conducting conformation5,6. MscL has a complex gating behaviour; it exhibits several intermediates between the closed and open states, including one putative non-conductive expanded state and at least three sub-conducting states7. Although our understanding of the closed5,6 and open8,9,10 states of MscL has been increasing, little is known about the structures of the intermediate states despite their importance in elucidating the complete gating process of MscL. Here we present the crystal structure of a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant (Δ95–120) of MscL from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL(CΔ26)) at 3.8 Å resolution. Notably, SaMscL(CΔ26) forms a tetrameric channel with both transmembrane helices tilted away from the membrane normal at angles close to that inferred for the open state9, probably corresponding to a non-conductive but partially expanded intermediate state."
https://openalex.org/W2017520829,"The adult Drosophila hindgut was recently reported to contain active, tissue-replenishing stem cells, like those of the midgut, but located within an anterior ring so as to comprise a single giant crypt. In contrast to this view, we observed no active stem cells and little cell turnover in adult hindgut tissue based on clonal marking and BrdU incorporation studies. Again contradicting the previous proposal, we showed that the adult hindgut is not generated by anterior stem cells during larval/pupal development. However, severe tissue damage within the hindgut elicits cell proliferation within a ring of putative quiescent stem cells at the anterior of the pylorus. Thus, the hindgut does not provide a model of tissue maintenance by constitutively active stem cells, but has great potential to illuminate mechanisms of stress-induced tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2058177228,"Carotenoids have been demonstrated to possess antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is no report that the effects of carotenoids on degranulation of mast cell is critical for type I allergy. In this study, we focused on the effect of carotenoids on antigen-induced degranulation of mast cells. Fucoxanthin, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene significantly inhibited the antigen-induced release of beta-hexosaminidase in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. Those carotenoids also inhibited antigen-induced aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilonRI), which is the most upstream of the degranulating signals of mast cells. Furthermore, carotenoids inhibited Fc epsilonRI-mediated intracellular signaling, such as phosphorylation of Lyn kinase and Fyn kinase. It suggests that the inhibitory effect of carotenoids on the degranulation of mast cells were mainly due to suppressing the aggregation of Fc epsilonRI followed by intracellular signaling. In addition, those carotenoids inhibited antigen-induced translocation of Fc epsilonRI to lipid rafts, which are known as platforms of the aggregation of Fc epsilonRI. We assume that carotenoids may modulate the function of lipid rafts and inhibit the translocation of Fc epsilonRI to lipid rafts. This is the first report that focused on the aggregation of Fc epsilonRI to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory effects on the degranulation of mast cells and evaluated the functional activity of carotenoids associated with lipid rafts."
https://openalex.org/W1999711808,"Intracellular labels such as dextran coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) are frequently used to study the fate of transplanted cells by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging or fluorescent microscopy. Bystander uptake of labeled cells by resident tissue macrophages (TM) can confound the interpretation of the presence of intracellular labels especially during direct implantation of cells, which can result in more than 70% cell death. In this study we determined the percentages of TM that took up SPION, BrdU or GFP from labeled bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that were placed into areas of angiogenesis and inflammation in a mouse model known as Matrigel plaque perfusion assay. Cells recovered from digested plaques at various time points were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The analysis of harvested plaques revealed 5% of BrdU(+), 5-10% of GFP(+) and 5-15% of dextran(+) macrophages. The transfer of the label was not dependent on cell dose or viability. Collectively, this study suggests that care should be taken to validate donor origin of cells using an independent marker by histology and to assess transplanted cells for TM markers prior to drawing conclusions about the in vivo behavior of transplanted cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083943004,"Mice homozygous for mutations in Dact1 (also called Dapper or Frodo) phenocopy human malformations involving the spine, genitourinary system and distal digestive tract. We traced this phenotype to disrupted germ-layer morphogenesis at the primitive streak. Notably, heterozygous mutation of Vangl2, a transmembrane component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, rescued recessive Dact1 phenotypes, whereas loss of Dact1 reciprocally rescued semidominant Vangl2 phenotypes. We show that Dact1, an intracellular protein, forms a complex with Vangl2. In Dact1 mutants, Vangl2 was increased at the primitive streak, where cells ordinarily undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This is associated with abnormal E-cadherin distribution and changes in biochemical measures of the PCP pathway. We conclude that Dact1 contributes to morphogenesis at the primitive streak by regulating Vangl2 upstream of cell adhesion and the PCP pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2054781228,"A number of human diseases are associated with the conversion of proteins from their native state into well defined fibrillar aggregates, depositing in the extracellular space and generally termed amyloid fibrils. Heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan normally present in the extracellular matrix, has been found to be universally associated with amyloid deposits and to promote amyloid fibril formation by all studied protein systems. We have studied the impact of HS on the amyloidogenesis of human muscle acylphosphatase, monitoring the process with an array of techniques, such as normal and stopped-flow far-UV circular dichroism, thioflavin T fluorescence, static and dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that HS accelerates the conversion of the studied protein from the native state into the amyloidogenic, yet monomeric, partially folded state. They also indicate that HS does not simply accelerate the conversion of the resulting partially folded state into amyloid species but splits the process into two distinct pathways occurring in parallel: a very fast phase in which HS interacts with a fraction of protein molecules, causing their rapid aggregation into ThT-positive and beta-sheet containing oligomers, and a slow phase resulting from the normal aggregation of partially folded molecules that cannot interact with HS. The HS-mediated aggregation pathway is severalfold faster than that observed in the absence of HS. Two aggregation phases are generally observed when proteins aggregate in the presence of HS, underlying the importance of a detailed kinetic analysis to fully understand the effect of this glycosaminoglycan on amyloidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2065331286,"CP24 is a minor antenna complex of Photosystem II, which is specific for land plants. It has been proposed that this complex is involved in the process of excess energy dissipation, which protects plants from photodamage in high light conditions. Here, we have investigated the functional architecture of the complex, integrating mutation analysis with time-resolved spectroscopy. A comprehensive picture is obtained about the nature, the spectroscopic properties, and the role in the quenching in solution of the pigments in the individual binding sites. The lowest energy absorption band in the chlorophyll a region corresponds to chlorophylls 611/612, and it is not the site of quenching in CP24. Chlorophylls 613 and 614, which are present in the major light-harvesting complex of Photosystem appear to be absent in CP24. In contrast to all other light-harvesting complexes, CP24 is stable when the L1 carotenoid binding site is empty and upon mutations in the third helix, whereas mutations in the first helix strongly affect the folding/stability of the pigment-protein complex. The absence of lutein in L1 site does not have any effect on the quenching, whereas substitution of violaxanthin in the L2 site with lutein or zeaxanthin results in a complex with enhanced quenched fluorescence. Triplet-minus-singlet measurements indicate that zeaxanthin and lutein in site L2 are located closer to chlorophylls than violaxanthin, thus suggesting that they can act as direct quenchers via a strong interaction with a neighboring chlorophyll. The results provide the molecular basis for the zeaxanthin-dependent quenching in isolated CP24."
https://openalex.org/W2046169909,"The tafazzin gene encodes a phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase involved in cardiolipin metabolism, but it is not known why it forms multiple transcripts as a result of alternative splicing. Here we studied the intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, and metabolic function of four isoforms of human tafazzin and three isoforms of Drosophila tafazzin upon expression in different mammalian and insect systems. When expressed in HeLa cells, all isoforms were localized in mitochondria except for the B-form of Drosophila tafazzin, which was associated with multiple intracellular membranes. Among the human isoforms, only full-length tafazzin (FL) and tafazzin lacking exon 5 (Δ5) had transacylase activity, and only these two isoforms were able to restore a normal cardiolipin pattern, normal respiratory activity of mitochondria, and male fertility in tafazzin-deficient flies. Both FL and Δ5 were associated with large protein complexes in 293T cell mitochondria, but treatment with alkali and proteinase K suggested that the Δ5 isoform was more integrated into the hydrophobic core of the membrane than the FL isoform. Although all Drosophila isoforms showed transacylase activity in vitro, only the A-form supported cardiolipin remodeling in flies. The data suggest that humans express two mitochondrial isoenzymes of tafazzin that have similar transacylase activities but different membrane topologies. Furthermore, the data show that the expression of human tafazzin in flies creates cardiolipin with a Drosophila pattern, suggesting that the characteristic fatty acid profile of cardiolipin is not determined by the substrate specificity of tafazzin. The tafazzin gene encodes a phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase involved in cardiolipin metabolism, but it is not known why it forms multiple transcripts as a result of alternative splicing. Here we studied the intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, and metabolic function of four isoforms of human tafazzin and three isoforms of Drosophila tafazzin upon expression in different mammalian and insect systems. When expressed in HeLa cells, all isoforms were localized in mitochondria except for the B-form of Drosophila tafazzin, which was associated with multiple intracellular membranes. Among the human isoforms, only full-length tafazzin (FL) and tafazzin lacking exon 5 (Δ5) had transacylase activity, and only these two isoforms were able to restore a normal cardiolipin pattern, normal respiratory activity of mitochondria, and male fertility in tafazzin-deficient flies. Both FL and Δ5 were associated with large protein complexes in 293T cell mitochondria, but treatment with alkali and proteinase K suggested that the Δ5 isoform was more integrated into the hydrophobic core of the membrane than the FL isoform. Although all Drosophila isoforms showed transacylase activity in vitro, only the A-form supported cardiolipin remodeling in flies. The data suggest that humans express two mitochondrial isoenzymes of tafazzin that have similar transacylase activities but different membrane topologies. Furthermore, the data show that the expression of human tafazzin in flies creates cardiolipin with a Drosophila pattern, suggesting that the characteristic fatty acid profile of cardiolipin is not determined by the substrate specificity of tafazzin. Alternative mRNA splicing can potentially increase the number of proteins expressed by a single gene and may thus raise the complexity of the translated information. Although alternative splicing is common among human genes, evidence for the presence of multiple functionally active splice products has rarely been presented (1Tress M.L. Martelli P.L. Frankish A.

Tafazzin is one example in which alternative splicing could, in theory, lead to a number of related proteins and where reasons for such diversification may exist. Tafazzin is a phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase (2Xu Y. Malhotra A. Ren M. Schlame M. J. Biol.

The initial study of the human tafazzin gene suggested that it produces 10 different mRNAs as a result of alternative initiation and splicing (5Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), but only four were confirmed by later studies (9Gonzalez I.L. Am. J. Med.

Sequence alignment analysis demonstrated that hTAZ-Δ5, the splice variant that skips the fifth exon, shows the highest degree of homology to tafazzins from other organisms and thus likely represents the principal isoform (11Vaz F.M.

This idea was supported by the fact that hTAZ-Δ5 forms the dominant band in reverse transcription-PCR (9Gonzalez I.L. Am. J. Med. Gen. 2005; 134A: 409-414Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Lu B.

Other isoforms of human tafazzin include hTAZ-FL (full-length), hTAZ-Δ7 (skips seventh exon), and hTAZ-Δ5Δ7 (skips fifth and seventh exons); i.e. in comparison with the principal isoform, the modifications include (i) the insertion of an additional 31-residue peptide (hTAZ-FL), (ii) the deletion of exon 7 (hTAZ-Δ5Δ7), and (iii) the two modifications combined (hTAZ-Δ7) (Fig. 1). cardiolipin blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis hemagglutinin epitope YPYDVPDYA matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight phosphatidylcholine form A of Drosophila tafazzin form B of Drosophila tafazzin form C of Drosophila tafazzin full-length form of human tafazzin human tafazzin without exon 5 human tafazzin without exon 7 human tafazzin without exons 5 and 7 phosphate-buffered saline polyvinylidene difluoride N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine upstream activator sequence voltage-dependent anion channel. The presence of four tafazzin transcripts raises the question whether structural modifications of tafazzin may cause variations in its targeting or its substrate specificity, both of which could have significant functional implications. The question whether tafazzin may have various functions is the more relevant as multiple tafazzin transcripts exist not only in humans but also in Drosophila, where the isoforms dTAZ-A, dTAZ-B, and dTAZ-C vary by the length of the N-terminal sequence preceding the hydrophobic anchor region (Fig. 1). In this study, we investigated the intracellular localization and enzymatic function of tafazzin isoforms from humans and Drosophila, and we studied their phenotypic effect upon transgenic expression in tafazzin-deficient flies. The purpose of the study was to elucidate the function of alternative splicing in tafazzin expression. Tafazzin-deficient mutant flies (ΔTAZ) were created as described (12Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Transgenic fly strains containing UAS-controlled transgenes dTAZ-A, dTAZ-B, dTAZ-C, hTAZ-FL, hTAZ-Δ5, hTAZ-Δ7, and hTAZ-Δ5Δ7, respectively, were generated by recombination-mediated cassette exchange, which inserts transgenes into precise genomic “landing sites,” thus eliminating potential “position effects” from nearby endogenous regulatory elements and making precise comparisons between multiple constructs possible (13Oberstein A. Pare A. Kaplan L. Small S. Nature Methods. 2005; 2: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs encoding various tafazzin isoforms were subcloned individually into the multiple cloning site of the donor plasmid vector pBS-loxP-w-UAST-lox2272 (a gift from Dr. Hyung Don Ryoo, New York University School of Medicine), which was modified from pBS-loxP-w-lox2272 (13Oberstein A. Pare A. Kaplan L. Small S. Nature Methods. 2005; 2: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by inserting into the unique BamHI site a UAS-MCS-SV40 cassette (BamHI fragment) of pUAST (14Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The donor plasmids were then injected along with the Cre recombinase helper plasmid into early embryos homozygous for the landing site loxP-y-lox2272 on the third chromosome at 3L:68A. Surviving flies were crossed to y−w− flies, and offspring were screened for exchange events by scoring for the loss of body pigment (y−) and the gain of eye pigment (w+). For transgenic rescue of the tafazzin mutant phenotype, both UAS-tafazzin transgenic lines and the third chromosome daughterless-GAL4 driver line were further crossed into the tafazzin mutant background, respectively, by using standard Drosophila genetic techniques and appropriate fly strains. Male fertility was assessed by placing five males with five virgin w1118 females in a culture vial for 6 days at 20 °C, followed by counting the F1 progeny. At least three vials were set up and scored for each genotype tested. Climbing activity was measured as described (12Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To isolate total fly membranes, 100 flies were Dounce-homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The total fly homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove large debris; the supernatant was then sonicated (15 s), and the total membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Fly mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described previously (2Xu Y. Malhotra A. Ren M. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39217-39224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Their respiratory activity was measured with the BD Oxygen Biosensor System (BD Biosciences) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The medium contained 250 mm sucrose, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KH2PO4, 7 mm succinate, 2 mm ADP, and 1.5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein (pH 7.4). The cDNAs encoding various tafazzin isoforms were subcloned individually into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), downstream of a hemagglutinin epitope (HA) tag. HeLa cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 plasmids containing various tafazzin cDNAs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Forty h after transfection, cells were harvested and broken by sonication, and sedimentable membrane and cytosolic supernatant fractions were obtained by centrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g). Sf9 insect cells were cultured at 27 °C in TNM-FH insect medium (BD Biosciences) and passaged every 3 days. cDNAs of tafazzin isoforms (TAZ) were subcloned individually in NcoI-KpnI sites of the baculovirus shuttle vector pAc-XL, which we modified from pAc-GHLT-C DNA (BD Biosciences) by eliminating the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. Using calcium precipitation, 5 μg of pAc-XL-TAZ DNA and 0.5 μg of BD BaculoGoldTM linearized baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) were co-transfected with 2 million Sf9 cells cultured in TNM-FH medium. Transfected cells were kept at 27 °C for 4 h, after which the transfection medium was removed and replaced by fresh TNM-FH medium. Amplification of recombinant TAZ baculoviruses in Sf9 cells was carried out to increase the virus titer. Recombinant baculovirus released into the cell medium was harvested and kept at 4 °C as stock solution. For the expression experiments, Sf9 cells were infected with the TAZ baculovirus stocks and then cultured at 27 °C for 3–4 days. For the isolation of subcellular membranes, cells were harvested and homogenized with a tight-fitting Teflon glass homogenizer in isolation buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) at 4 °C. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min. Mitochondria were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min. Microsomes were collected from the post-mitochondrial supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Protein concentrations of the subcellular fractions were determined by the method of Lowry (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293 T cells were grown to 60% confluency in T-75 flasks and transfected with pcDNA3 vector encoding HA-tagged hTAZ- Δ5 or hTAZ-FL. Briefly, 24 μl of FuGENE transfection reagent was added to 776 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in an autoclaved Eppendorf tube. After incubation for 5 min, 8 μg of the appropriate vector DNA was added, and the tubes were incubated for 30 min with occasional mixing. Subsequently, the mixture was added to the T-75 flasks and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Mitochondria were isolated from 293 T cells following the method of Magalhaes et al. (16Magalhães P.J. Andreu A.L. Schon E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and swollen in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) at 4 °C) on ice for 15 min. Subsequently, they were homogenized on ice by 30 up- and-down strokes in a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Immediately, the tonicity was restored by the addition of an aliquot of 2 m sucrose. Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and mitochondria were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondria were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged tafazzin were grown on coverslips and then incubated for 30 min with medium containing MitoTracker CMXROS Red (GE Healthcare). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed again with PBS, and free aldehyde groups were quenched with 0.05 m NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized and blocked by incubation for 30 min with 0.02% Triton-X100 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Primary mouse anti- HA monoclonal antibodies, diluted 1:1000 in the blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS), were added to the cells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After several washes with the blocking buffer, the cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:200 in the blocking buffer. The coverslips were washed with the blocking buffer, mounted in Prolong Gold Anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes), and examined with a Zeiss confocal microscope. For double labeling with the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin or the Golgi marker giantin, cells expressing HA-tagged tafazzin were fixed directly without incubation with MitoTracker and then processed similarly to the manner described above, except that the cells were incubated with two primary antibodies (mouse anti-HA together with rabbit anti-calnexin or goat anti-giantin) and two secondary antibodies (Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG together with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG). Limited protease digestion of mitochondria (50 μg protein/sample, protein concentration 0.5 mg/ml) was performed in the presence of proteinase K at a final concentration of 20 or 200 ng/ml (protein-to-proteinase K ratio of 25,000:1 or 2,500:1) in the absence or presence of detergents (digitonin 1 g/g protein or 0.1% Triton X-100). The digestion was carried out on ice for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were immediately boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 10 min. Alkali treatment of mitochondria (50 μg protein/sample) was carried out in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 10–12.5) on ice for 20 min. The treated mitochondria were immediately centrifuged to separate released proteins from bound proteins. BN-PAGE analysis was carried out as described by Wittig et al. (17Wittig I. Braun H.-P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mitochondria from 293T cells (800 μg of protein) were solubilized in digitonin (8 g/g protein) for 9 min at room temperature under constant stirring. Solubilized proteins were collected in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation for 15 min at 100,000 × g. Five μl of 50% glycerol and 12 μl of 5% Coomassie Blue G-250 were added to 60 μl of supernatant, and the mixture was loaded on a 4–13% gradient polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 96 V for 3 h. Following the run, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 for 10 min and then destained in water for 1 day. For Western blotting, proteins were electrotransferred from the gel to a methanol-soaked PVDF membrane for 3 h at 30 V in Tricine buffer (50 mm Tricine, 7.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0). The PVDF membrane was further fixed and destained by a 10-min wash in water-methanol-glacial acetic acid (85-10-5) followed by a 10-min wash in 1% SDS in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), then two 3-min rinses in 75% methanol, and finally a 1-min rinse in 100% methanol. Then, the PVDF was incubated in TBST buffer (0.88% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.3% Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) overnight. The following day, regular immunoblotting was performed using primary HA mouse-monoclonal antibody (1:1,000) and secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000). For Western blot analysis of tafazzins, samples were denatured by boiling in SDS loading buffer and then applied to 10% gels for SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in a solution containing 20% methanol in Tris-glycine-SDS (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C either with 1 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against Drosophila tafazzin (12Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or with 1 μg/ml affinity-purified chicken polyclonal immunoglobulin Y raised against human tafazzin. The hTAZ antibody was purified by the same technique as employed previously for the dTAZ antibody (12Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Incubation with primary antibodies was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. SuperSignal (Pierce) was used as the peroxidase substrate. For Western blot analysis of HA tag, respiratory complex I, and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), all primary antibodies were utilized in a concentration of 1 μg/ml in 5% nonfat milk-TBST and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. HA antibody was purchased from Sigma, and monoclonal antibodies to mitochondrial membrane markers were purchased from MitoScience. Densitometry analysis of Western blots was performed with Bio-Rad software. Transacylation reactions were measured with different combinations of acyl donors and acyl acceptors in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.3) (2Xu Y. Malhotra A. Ren M. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39217-39224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Substrate combinations included 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PC (0.1 μCi, 2 nmol) and monolyso-CL (10 nmol), CL (bovine heart, 10 nmol) and 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC (0.05 μCi, 1 nmol), PC (10 nmol) and 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC (0.05 μCi, 1 nmol), or 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (10 nmol) and 1-[3H]oleoyl-2-lyso- phosphatidic acid (1 μCi). The reactions were started by the addition of Sf9 mitochondria (10 μg of protein for PC/lyso-PC assay and 80 μg of protein for all other assays), and they were stopped after 5 min by the addition of 2 ml of methanol and 1 ml of chloroform. Phospholipids were extracted (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42842) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60 (Merck) with chloroform/methanol/water (65-25-4, v/v/v). For the PC/monolyso-CL combination, reaction products were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography using chloroform-methanol-water (65-25-4, v/v/v) in the first dimension and chloroform-acetone-methanol-acetic acid- water (50-20-10-10-5 by vol.) in the second dimension. Tracer lipids were included before thin-layer chromatography. Phospholipids were visualized by brief exposure to iodine and marked. Subsequently, iodine was removed by evaporation, and the lipid spots were scraped off for measurement of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. For the analysis of fatty acid patterns, lipids were extracted from Sf9 cell pellets (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42842) Google Scholar) and separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60 using chloroform/methanol/20% ammonia (65–30-5, v/v/v) in the first dimension and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50-20-10-10-5 by vol.) in the second dimension. Lipids were visualized by brief exposure to iodine. Silica spots corresponding to CL, PC, and phosphatidylethanolamine were scraped into long-neck glass vials and transmethylated overnight in methanol/0.5 m HCl at 90 °C. Then, the reaction mixtures were neutralized, and fatty acid methyl esters were extracted into n-hexane. Samples were concentrated by evaporation of solvent and then analyzed by capillary gas chromatography using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph equipped with an SP-2330 column (0.32 mm × 30 m, 0.2-μm column film) and a flame ionization detector. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated isothermically at 185 °C. Mitochondria were isolated from fly strains, and lipids were extracted (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42842) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 6 nmol of internal standard ((14:0)4-CL)/mg of protein. Aliquots of the lipid extracts, corresponding to 0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein, were dried and redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Mass spectrometry was performed according to Sun et al. (19Sun G. Yang K. Zhao Z. Guan S. Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 7576-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. An aliquot of 5 μl of the lipid extract was mixed with 50 μl of matrix solution (10 g/liter 9-aminoacridine in 2-propanol/acetonitrile, 6:4, v/v). A 1-μl aliquot of this mixture was spotted on the sample plate in a draft-free environment. The matrix solution was cooled to −20 °C to increase viscosity, which prevented migration of the droplets on the plate. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed with a Bruker Autoflex I instrument equipped with a nitrogen laser and operated in reflectron mode. A minimum of 400 laser shots (8 cycles of 50 shots each) were averaged per spectrum. Spectra were read and analyzed with the software MOVERZ (Proteometrics Inc.). Molecular species were quantified from peak integrals after correction for type I and type II 13C isotope effects (20Han X. Gross R.W. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 367-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Bar graphs show the means of triplicate measurements with S.E. For climbing assays, two independent populations of 30–50 flies were analyzed for each group. Previous experiments had suggested that tafazzin is localized in mitochondria (21Ma L. Vaz F.M. Gu Z. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44394-44399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of alternative splicing on intracellular targeting, we expressed HA-tagged constructs of the four isoforms of human tafazzin in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis with HA antibodies confirmed that the constructs produced membrane-bound proteins of the expected size (supplemental Fig. S1), and confocal analysis demonstrated that all four human tafazzins were localized in mitochondria (Fig. 2). Similar experiments with Drosophila tafazzins showed that only dTAZ-A and dTAZ-C were unequivocally localized in mitochondria (Fig. 2), whereas dTAZ-B displayed a more complex intracellular distribution, co-localizing with markers of mitochondria (Fig. 3A), the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3B), and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3C). A polyclonal antibody raised against Drosophila tafazzin detected two bands in immunoblot of total fly membranes (Fig. 3D), one of which was assigned to dTAZ-A, the dominant isoform, and the other one to dTAZ-B because it co-migrated with the corresponding band in transgenic dTAZ-B- overexpressing flies (not shown). Thus, two out of three tafazzin isoforms were present in sufficient amounts to be detectable by Western blot in Drosophila membranes. Consistent with reverse transcription-PCR data (12Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), only dTAZ-A was deleted from ΔTAZ flies (Fig. 3D). Unfortunately, endogenous levels of tafazzins were not detectable in human tissues with the currently available antibodies. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that all tafazzin isoforms from humans and Drosophila are expressed in mitochondria except for dTAZ-B, which is associated with multiple intracellular compartments.FIGURE 3Intracellular localization of dTAZ-B. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged dTAZ-B and subsequently analyzed by confocal microscopy. The intracellular distribution of dTAZ-B was compared with the distribution of mitochondria (A), the endoplasmic reticulum (B), and the Golgi apparatus (C). Polyclonal antibody raised against Drosophila tafazzin detected two bands in purified Drosophila membranes. The band that corresponds to dTAZ-B remains present in the ΔTAZ mutant (D)."
https://openalex.org/W2053634335,"Background Proteinuria is a major marker of the decline of renal function and an important risk factor of coronary heart disease. Elevated proteinuria is associated to the disruption of slit-diaphragm and loss of podocyte foot processes, structural alterations that are considered irreversible. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether proteinuria can be reversed and to identify the structural modifications and the gene/protein regulation associated to this reversal. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a novel transgenic strain of mouse (RenTg) that overexpresses renin at a constant high level. At the age of 12-month, RenTg mice showed established lesions typical of chronic renal disease such as peri-vascular and periglomerular inflammation, glomerular ischemia, glomerulosclerosis, mesangial expansion and tubular dilation. Ultrastructural analysis indicated abnormal heterogeneity of basement membrane thickness and disappearance of podocyte foot processes. These structural alterations were accompanied by decreased expressions of proteins specific of podocyte (nephrin, podocin), or tubular epithelial cell (E-cadherin and megalin) integrity. In addition, since TGFβ is considered the major pro-fibrotic agent in renal disease and since exogenous administration of BMP7 is reported to antagonize the TGFβ-induced phenotype changes in kidney, we have screened the expressions of several genes belonging in the TGFβ/BMP superfamily. We found that the endogenous inhibitors of BMPs such as noggin and Usag-1 were several-fold activated inhibiting the action of BMPs and thus reinforcing the deleterious action of TGFβ.Treatment with an AT1 receptor antagonist, at dose that did not decrease arterial pressure, gradually reduced albuminuria. This decrease was accompanied by re-expression of podocin, nephrin, E-cadherin and megalin, and reappearance of podocyte foot processes. In addition, expressions of noggin and Usag-1 were markedly decreased, permitting thus activation of the beneficial action of BMPs. Conclusions/Significance These findings show that proteinuria and alterations in the expression of proteins involved in the integrity and function of glomerular and renal epithelial phenotype are reversible events when the local action of angiotensin II is blocked, and provide hope that chronic renal disease can be efficiently treated."
https://openalex.org/W2072766298,"Ovol2 belongs to the Ovo family of evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factors that act downstream of key developmental signaling pathways including Wg/Wnt and BMP/TGF-β. We previously reported Ovol2 expression in the basal layer of epidermis, where epidermal stem/progenitor cells reside. In this work, we use HaCaT human keratinocytes to investigate the cellular and molecular functions of Ovol2. We show that depletion of Ovol2 leads to transient cell expansion but a loss of cells with long term proliferation potential. Mathematical modeling and experimental findings suggest that both faster cycling and precocious withdrawal from the cell cycle underlie this phenotype. Ovol2 depletion also accelerates extracellular signal-induced terminal differentiation in two- and three-dimensional culture models. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter, and functional rescue assays, we demonstrate that Ovol2 directly represses two critical downstream targets, c-Myc and Notch1, thereby suppressing keratinocyte transient proliferation and terminal differentiation, respectively. These findings shed light on how an epidermal cell maintains a proliferation-competent and differentiation-resistant state.

The Ovo gene family encodes evolutionarily conserved proteins including members from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, Zebrafish, chick, and mammals. Ovo proteins contain four DNA-binding C2H2 zinc fingers at the C termini and possess transcriptional regulatory activities (1Andrews J. Garcia-Estefania D. Delon I. Lü J. Mével-Ninio M. Spierer A.

Drosophila ovo, the founding member of the family, acts genetically downstream of Wg (fly Wnt homolog) and DER (fly epidermal growth factor receptor homolog) signaling pathways and is required for epidermal denticle formation and oogenesis (6Mével-Ninio M.

We and others have identified mammalian Ovol (Ovo-like) genes, including Ovol1 (movo1), Ovol2 (movo2), and Ovol3 (movo3) in mice and OVOL1, OVOL2, and OVOL3 in humans (9Chidambaram A. Allikmets R.

Mammalian Ovol/OVOL (referred to as Ovol from here on) genes also appear to reside downstream of key developmental signaling pathways. For instance, Ovol1 is activated by the β-catenin-LEF1 complex, downstream effectors of Wnt signaling (13Li B. Mackay D.R. Dai Q. Li T.W. Nair M. Fallahi M. Schonbaum C.P. Fantes J. Mahowald A.P.

A functional Ovol1 gene is required for multiple developmental processes, including that of epidermis, hair follicles, kidney, and male germ cell differentiation (2Li B. Nair M. Mackay D.R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3452-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In both epidermis and testis, Ovol1 restricts the boundary of late progenitor cells during development by promoting cell cycle exit (2Li B. Nair M. Mackay D.R. Bilanchone V. Hu M. Fallahi M. Song H. Dai Q. Cohen P.E. Dai X. Development. 2005; 132: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Nair M. Teng A. Bilanchone V. Agrawal A. Li B. Dai X. J. Cell. Biol. 2006; 173: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Less is known about the biological function of Ovol2 and Ovol3. Ovol2 is expressed in myriad embryonic and postnatal tissues (11Li B. Dai Q. Li L. Nair M. Mackay D.R. Dai X. Genomics. 2002; 80: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with a widespread expression pattern, ablation of the Ovol2 gene results in early embryonic lethality (16Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which precludes a comprehensive analysis of its later developmental roles. Interestingly, Ovol2 expression appears to correlate with a proliferative stem/progenitor cell state (16Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Teng A. Nair M. Wells J. Segre J.A. Dai X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1772: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For instance, Ovol2 protein is detected in the basal layer of skin epidermis (17Teng A. Nair M. Wells J. Segre J.A. Dai X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1772: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), where proliferative epidermal stem/progenitor cells reside. Moreover, Ovol2 is strongly expressed in inner cell mass as well as its in vitro equivalent, embryonic stem cells (16Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The functional significance of Ovol2 expression in proliferating stem/progenitor cells remains to be established. Mammalian epidermis is an excellent model system to study the molecular circuits that control proliferation and differentiation. Using cultured keratinocytes and mouse models, important regulators of epidermal proliferation and differentiation have been uncovered (18Watt F.M. Lo Celso C. Silva-Vargas V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Among these, c-Myc is the most intriguing because of its multiple and seemingly opposing roles (19Watt F.M. Frye M. Benitah S.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although c-Myc is expressed in basal cells and clearly important for keratinocyte proliferation, its constitutive overexpression in cultured keratinocytes causes progressively reduced growth, precocious terminal differentiation, and loss of cells that express a high level of β1 integrin, a putative epidermal stem cell marker (20Gandarillas A. Watt F.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2869-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The latter finding has been interpreted to indicate a c-Myc-stimulated premature exit from the stem cell compartment, a notion that is apparently supported by the observation of decreased β1high or label-retaining cells in mice that overexpress c-Myc in the epidermal basal layer (20Gandarillas A. Watt F.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2869-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21Arnold I. Watt F.M. Curr.

Notch signaling, which is initiated by ligand binding to the Notch receptor followed by cleavage and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain that in turn binds to RBP-J to generate a transactivation complex, is critical for terminal differentiation of keratinocytes (19Watt F.M.

Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Notch receptors (Notch1, 2, and 3) are not normally expressed in proliferating epidermal basal cells, and overexpression of the intracellular domain in these cells promotes a differentiating, spinous cell fate (23Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3022-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that fine-tuning c-Myc expression and suppressing Notch expression/signaling in the basal layer might be important for maintaining a differentiation-refractory progenitor cell state. To date, little is known about molecular mechanisms that directly repress c-Myc and Notch expression in epidermal progenitor cells. In this work, we use HaCaT keratinocytes to explore the function of Ovol2. We show that Ovol2 regulates independent yet related aspects of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, namely suppressing rapid amplification and terminal differentiation but maintaining long term proliferation potential in culture. We present evidence that Ovol2 does so, at least in part, by regulating downstream targets c-Myc and Notch1. 293T cells (a human kidney epithelial cell line) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. UG1 mouse keratinocytes were cultured as previously described (13Li B. Mackay D.R. Dai Q. Li T.W. Nair M. Fallahi M. Schonbaum C.P. Fantes J. Mahowald A.P. Waterman M.L. Fuchs E. Dai X. Proc. Natl.

Nuclear extracts were made as previously described (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were quantified (Bio-Rad protein assay reagent), and equal amounts of protein were run on 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and probing with antibodies. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Ovol2 (1:250) (16Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); mouse anti-Rad50 and mouse anti-p84 (1:2000; gift from P. L. Chen, University of California, Irvine); mouse anti-c-Myc (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-HDAC1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-K1, rabbit anti-loricrin, and rabbit anti-K14 (1:2000; gift from J. Segre, National Institute of Health); and mouse anti-β-actin (1:4000, Abcam). The proteins were detected using chemiluminescence (Pierce). For cell count experiments, HaCaT cells were seeded in triplicate in a 12-well plate and transfected at 20–30% confluence with 60 nm siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. At 24-h intervals spanning 72 h post-transfection, the cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemacytometer. Clonal assays were performed as previously described (28Wan H. Yuan M. Simpson C. Allen K. Gavins F.N. Ikram M.S. Basu S. Baksh N. O'Toole E.A. Hart I.R. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For first generation clonal assays, HaCaT cells were seeded at 8 × 104 cells/well of a 6-well plate and transfected 24 h later with siRNA. The cells were trypsinized 24 h after transfection (day 2), replated at a density of 500 cells/well in 6-well plates, and retransfected with siRNA on day 8. After 14 days, three of the six wells/sample were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed with 1× PBS, and stained with a solution of 1% Rhodamine B, 1% Nile Blue before washing and air drying. The number and size of colonies were then scored. The remaining three wells were trypsinized, counted, and replated as second generation at a density of 500 cells/well in a 6-well plate. HaCaT cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and 24 h later transfected with siRNA. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with PBS. Following permeabilization with cold 90% methanol for 5 min at room temperature and PBS washes, the cells were blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with mouse anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Asp214) (1:10; BD Pharmingen) and rat anti-phospho histone H3 (pS28) (1:20; BD Pharmingen) in 1% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS, and the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The plates were run on an In-Cell Plate Reader, and the fluorescence was measured using InCell Developer Software. HaCaT cells were seeded in duplicate at 2.5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish and after 24 h were transfected with siRNA. The cells were collected 72 h after transfection. For propidium iodide staining, the cells were washed once with cold PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol for 24 h at −20 °C, followed by two PBS washes. After being stained with a propidium iodide staining solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml RNase A, PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were then washed once with PBS. For α6 integrin staining, the cells were washed once with 2% fetal bovine serum with PBS and stained on ice for 30 min with a phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-CD49f (α6 integrin) antibody (1:40; BD Pharmingen) and the appropriate isotype control. The cells were washed two times with cold PBS, run on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD), and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Cyclic amplification of selected targets was carried out as previously described (3Nair M. Bilanchone V. Ortt K. Sinha S. Dai X.

Forty Ovol2-selected clones were sequenced to derive an Ovol2 consensus sequence. Assays were performed in 293T and HaCaT cells. The 293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate as described (29Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured in whole cell extracts using the luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as previously described (31Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). HaCaT cells were seeded in 10-cm plates, and each plate was transfected at ∼90% confluency with 24 μg of pCB6-Ovol2A using Lipofectamine 2000. The plates were cross-linked 24 h after transfection with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and chromatin immunoprecipitates were isolated using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and anti-Ovol2 antibody (16Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using human c-Myc primers (4Nair M. Teng A. Bilanchone V. Agrawal A. Li B. Dai X. J. Cell. Biol. 2006; 173: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and human Notch1 primers containing the following sequences: forward, 5′-ACCAGGAGCAGAGGACGTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CTTTCCTGGCACACCTCTTG-3′. The following PCR program was used: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 31–38 cycles (within the linear range of the primers) of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript III RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the primers used for quantitative real time PCR were designed to span exon-exon borders to minimize the possibility of nonspecific amplification of genomic DNA. The following primers were used for quantitative real time PCR: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-GGCATCCTGGGCTACACTGAG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, 5′-TGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTTG-3′; c-Myc forward, 5′-TCTCTCCGTCCTCGGATTCTC-3′; c-Myc reverse, 5′-GGAGCCTGCCTCTTTTCCAC-3′; Notch1 forward, 5′-AATGTGGATGCCGCAGTTG-3′; and Notch1 reverse, 5′- CGGTCCATATGATCCGTGATG-3′. Quantitative real time PCRs were performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions on an iCycler real time quantitative PCR system (Bio-Rad). The thermal profile included 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s and annealing at 63 °C for 1 min with the optics on for fluorescence monitoring. The reactions were run in triplicate and always included a standard curve and no template sample for each primer set as a control for the linear range and nonspecific PCR products, respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to normalize the data. The mean threshold cycle (Ct) for individual reactions was identified using the iCycler IQ sequence analysis software (Bio-Rad). Skin equivalents were prepared in 12-well tissue culture inserts (3-μm pore Thinsert; Greiner Bio One) as previously described (32Margulis A. Zhang W. Garlick J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 289: 61-70PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gels (400 μl/insert) were prepared from collagen type I (BD Biosciences) at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml and seeded with 3T3 cells at 2.5 × 104 cells/ml. The gels were submerged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C in a humidified, 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 48 h, the gels were released from the side of the insert using a pipette tip and allowed to contract for 5 days. The medium was replaced every 2 or 3 days. 2 × 105 HaCaT cells (either negative control or Ovol2-depleted)/insert were added and allowed to grow for 2 days before being air-lifted and cultured in medium containing 2.8 mm calcium for 10 days. The medium was changed every other day. A cell population model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations was considered (33Lander A.D. Gokoffski K.K. Wan F.Y. Nie Q. Calof A.L. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 34Lo W.C. Chou C.S. Gokoffski K.K. Wan F.Y. Lander A.D. Calof A.L. Nie Q. Math Biosci. Eng. 2009; 6: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (see supplemental text for equations and details of the model). In the system, after each stem cell (N0 in total) division, the daughter cells have the probability (p0) to remain a stem cell, or (1 − p0) to become a progenitor (N1) cell that can undergo a maximum of M divisions before becoming growth arrested (NM+1) cells. For a smaller M, the solution of the system could be explicitly and analytically expressed. For a large M, the system was solved using NDSolve function in Mathematica. The parameter fitting was based on FindFit function of Mathematica. In both mice and humans, a single Ovol2 gene encodes different protein isoforms with presumably opposing transcriptional regulatory activities (5Unezaki S. Nishizawa M. Okuda-Ashitaka E. Masu Y.

Genomics. 2002; 80: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore first determined which isoform of Ovol2 is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes. By Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from mouse and human keratinocytes and mouse skin, we found that based on the sizes of the proteins seen in each of these samples, Ovol2A repressor is the dominant isoform expressed in epidermis in vivo and cultured keratinocytes in vitro (Fig. 1A). The other isoforms, namely Ovol2B and Ovol2C, were not detected under our experimental conditions. Next we turned to use siRNAs to knockdown Ovol2 in HaCaT human keratinocytes, an immortalized cell line that displays epidermal progenitor cell activity, i.e. forming a stratified epidermis under organotypic culture conditions (28Wan H.

A number of different differentiation-specific markers are expressed in HaCaT cells under organotypic conditions, although stratification is incomplete and imperfect (37Ryle C.M. Breitkreutz D.

These cells were chosen for our study because in culture they contain a small subset of quiescent stem/progenitor-like cells (28Wan H. Yuan M. Simpson C. Allen K. Gavins F.N. Ikram M.S. Basu S. Baksh N. O'Toole E.A. Hart I.R. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), mimicking epidermal homeostasis in vivo. When compared with cells transfected with a negative control siRNA that does not target any known gene, Ovol2 proteins were effectively depleted with Ovol2-specific siRNAs, and knockdown persisted in culture for at least 6 days for the most effective siRNA (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A). A growth curve analysis revealed a significantly higher number of cells in Ovol2-depleted high density culture, particularly at 72 h after siRNA transfection (1.7-fold ± 0.12) (Fig. 1C). Consistently, the Ovol2 knockdown plates appeared more confluent, and the cells were more tightly packed on the plate than the negative control plates (Fig. 1D). Three different siRNA oligonucleotides (Ovol2 #1 targets exons 3 and 4, Ovol2 #2 targets the 3′-untranslated region, and Ovol2 #3 targets exon 2) produced a similar trend, albeit to a lesser extent for the less effective siRNAs #2 and #3 (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). This finding suggests that the increase in cell number is not an off target effect. Knockdown was also performed in mouse keratinocytes using adenoviral small hairpin RNA against Ovol2, and a similar increase in cell number was observed (data not shown). Subsequent experiments focused on the most effective siRNA (#1) and HaCaT cells. Because cultured keratinocytes are a heterogeneous population of cells with different proliferation potentials (28Wan H. Yuan M. Simpson C. Allen K. Gavins F.N. Ikram M.S. Basu S. Baksh N.

Specifically, we transfected HaCaT cells with either control or Ovol2 siRNA at days 1 and 8 to efficiently knockdown Ovol2 during the first 14 days of clonal assay (this we term first generation). We then assessed the proliferation potential of the cells harvested from the first generation by replating a portion of them at a clonal density, but this time with no additional siRNA knockdown (this we term second generation). Consistent with an increased cell number in short term high density cultures described above, we observed a reproducible increase in the number of large (> 2 mm) colonies in Ovol2-depleted first generation cultures when compared with negative control (Fig. 1, E, top panels, and F, and supplemental Fig. S2, top panel). Trypan blue staining showed that Ovol2 depletion did not affect the viability of the first generation cells (data not shown). Interestingly, after replating an equal number of first generation cells, we now observed a reduction in both colony size and number in the second generation culture derived fr"
https://openalex.org/W2063482034,"The small leucine-rich repeat proteins, fibromodulin and osteoadherin, have N-terminal extensions with a variable number of O-sulfated tyrosine residues. This modification combined with a number of aspartic and glutamic acid residues results in a highly negatively charged domain of less than 30 amino acids. We hypothesized that this domain shares functional properties with heparin regarding binding to proteins and polypeptides containing clusters of basic amino acids. Two other family members, PRELP and chondroadherin, have distinctly different clusters of basic amino acids in their N and C termini, respectively, and PRELP is known to bind to heparin via this domain. Another heparin-binding protein is the cytokine Oncostatin M, with a different cluster of basic amino acids in its C terminus. We used polypeptides representing these basic domains in solid phase assays and demonstrate interactions with the negatively charged N-terminal domain of fibromodulin and full-length osteoadherin. The tyrosine sulfate domains also bound heparin-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor-2, thrombospondin I, MMP13, the NC4 domain of collagen IX, and interleukin-10. Fibronectin with large heparin-binding domains did not bind, neither did CILP containing a heparin-binding thrombospondin type I motif without clustered basic amino acids. Affinity depends on the number and position of the sulfated tyrosine residues shown by different binding properties of 10-kDa fragments subfractionated by ion-exchange chromatography. These interactions may sequester growth factors, cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases in the extracellular matrix as well as contribute to its organization."
https://openalex.org/W2067767317,"Phenylalkylamines (PAAs), a major class of L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers, have two aromatic rings connected by a flexible chain with a nitrile substituent. Structural aspects of ligand-channel interactions remain unclear. We have built a KvAP-based model of LTCC and used Monte Carlo energy minimizations to dock devapamil, verapamil, gallopamil, and other PAAs. The PAA-LTCC models have the following common features: (i) the meta-methoxy group in ring A, which is proximal to the nitrile group, accepts an H-bond from a PAA-sensing Tyr_IIIS6; (ii) the meta-methoxy group in ring B accepts an H-bond from a PAA-sensing Tyr_IVS6; (iii) the ammonium group is stabilized at the focus of P-helices; and (iv) the nitrile group binds to a Ca(2+) ion coordinated by the selectivity filter glutamates in repeats III and IV. The latter feature can explain Ca(2+) potentiation of PAA action and the presence of an electronegative atom at a similar position of potent PAA analogs. Tyr substitution of a Thr in IIIS5 is known to enhance action of devapamil and verapamil. Our models predict that the para-methoxy group in ring A of devapamil and verapamil accepts an H-bond from this engineered Tyr. The model explains structure-activity relationships of PAAs, effects of LTCC mutations on PAA potency, data on PAA access to LTCC, and Ca(2+) potentiation of PAA action. Common and class-specific aspects of action of PAAs, dihydropyridines, and benzothiazepines are discussed in view of the repeat interface concept."
https://openalex.org/W2022549277,"Calcium is a messenger ion that controls all aspects of cone photoreceptor function, including synaptic release. The dynamic range of the cone output extends beyond the activation threshold for voltage-operated calcium entry, suggesting another calcium influx mechanism operates in cones hyperpolarized by light. We have used optical imaging and whole-cell voltage clamp to measure the contribution of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) to Ca2+ homeostasis and its role in regulation of neurotransmission at cone synapses. Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 revealed sustained divalent cation entry in hyperpolarized cones. Ca2+ influx into cone inner segments was potentiated by hyperpolarization, facilitated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, unaffected by pharmacological manipulation of voltage-operated or cyclic nucleotide-gated Ca2+ channels and suppressed by lanthanides, 2-APB, MRS 1845 and SKF 96365. However, cation influx through store-operated channels crossed the threshold for activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ entry in a subset of cones, indicating that the operating range of inner segment signals is set by interactions between store- and voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Exposure to MRS 1845 resulted in ∼40% reduction of light-evoked postsynaptic currents in photopic horizontal cells without affecting the light responses or voltage-operated Ca2+ currents in simultaneously recorded cones. The spatial pattern of store-operated calcium entry in cones matched immunolocalization of the store-operated sensor STIM1. These findings show that store-operated channels regulate spatial and temporal properties of Ca2+ homeostasis in vertebrate cones and demonstrate their role in generation of sustained excitatory signals across the first retinal synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2089025540,"The chemopreventative effects of dithiolethione compounds are attributed to their activation of antioxidant response elements (AREs) by reacting with the Nrf2/Keap1 protein complex. In this study, we show antiproliferative effects of the dithiolethione compound ACS-1 in human cancer cell lines (A549 and MDA-MB-231) by increasing the activity of the tumor suppressor protein phoshatase 2A (PP2A). ACS-1 inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cellular proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Akt activation, as determined by serine-473 phosphorylation, was inhibited by ACS-1 in cells stimulated with either EGF or fibronectin. Furthermore, ACS-1 inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and decreased c-myc protein levels. ACS-1 did not proximally alter EGF receptor or integrin signaling, but caused a concentration-dependent increase in PP2A activity. The effect of ACS-1 on Akt activation was not observed in the presence of the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid. ACS-1 effects on PP2A activity were independent of ARE activation and cAMP formation. In addition to ACS-1, other dithiolethione compounds showed similar effects in reducing Akt activation, suggesting that this class of compounds may have other effects beyond chemoprevention."
https://openalex.org/W1994684130,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) are metabolic disorders characterized by accumulation of undegraded material. The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are LSDs defined by the storage of glycosaminoglycans. Previously, we hypothesized that cells affected with LSD have increased energy expenditure for biosynthesis because of deficiencies of raw materials sequestered within the lysosome. Thus, LSDs can be characterized as diseases of deficiency as well as overabundance (lysosomal storage). In this study, metabolite analysis identified deficiencies in simple sugars, nucleotides, and lipids in the livers of MPSI mice. In contrast, most amino acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, and urea were elevated. These data suggest that protein catabolism, perhaps because of increased autophagy, is at least partially fulfilling intermediary metabolism. Thus, maintaining glycosaminoglycan synthesis in the absence of recycled precursors results in major shifts in the energy utilization of the cells. A high fat diet increased simple sugars and some fats and lowered the apparent protein catabolism. Interestingly, autophagy, which is increased in several LSDs, is responsive to dietary intervention and is reduced in MPSVII and MPSI mice fed a high fat diet. Although long term dietary treatment improved body weight in MPSVII mice, it failed to improve life span or retinal function. In addition, the ventricular hypertrophy and proximal aorta dilation observed in MPSVII mice were unchanged by a high fat, simple sugar diet. As the mechanism of this energy imbalance is better understood, a more targeted nutrient approach may yet prove beneficial as an adjunct therapy to traditional approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2164727898,"A fundamental goal of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping is to determine the sharing of alleles between individuals across genomic loci. Such analyses have diverse applications in defining the relatedness of individuals (including unexpected relationships in nominally unrelated individuals, or consanguinity within pedigrees), analyzing meiotic crossovers, and identifying a broad range of chromosomal anomalies such as hemizygous deletions and uniparental disomy, and analyzing population structure.We present SNPduo, a command-line and web accessible tool for analyzing and visualizing the relatedness of any two individuals using identity by state. Using identity by state does not require prior knowledge of allele frequencies or pedigree information, and is more computationally tractable and is less affected by population stratification than calculating identity by descent probabilities. The web implementation visualizes shared genomic regions, and generates UCSC viewable tracks. The command-line version requires pedigree information for compatibility with existing software and determining specified relationships even though pedigrees are not required for IBS calculation, generates no visual output, is written in portable C++, and is well-suited to analyzing large datasets. We demonstrate how the SNPduo web tool identifies meiotic crossover positions in siblings, and confirm our findings by visualizing meiotic recombination in synthetic three-generation pedigrees. We applied SNPduo to 210 nominally unrelated Phase I / II HapMap samples and, consistent with previous findings, identified six undeclared pairs of related individuals. We further analyzed identity by state in 2,883 individuals from multiplex families with autism and identified a series of anomalies including related parents, an individual with mosaic loss of chromosome 18, an individual with maternal heterodisomy of chromosome 16, and unexplained replicate samples.SNPduo provides the ability to explore and visualize SNP data to characterize the relatedness between individuals. It is compatible with, but distinct from, other established analysis software such as PLINK, and performs favorably in benchmarking studies for the analyses of genetic relatedness."
https://openalex.org/W2025895613,"We describe a role for diacylglycerol in the activation of Ras and Rap1 at the phagosomal membrane. During phagocytosis, Ras density was similar on the surface and invaginating areas of the membrane, but activation was detectable only in the latter and in sealed phagosomes. Ras activation was associated with the recruitment of RasGRP3, a diacylglycerol-dependent Ras/Rap1 exchange factor. Recruitment to phagosomes of RasGRP3, which contains a C1 domain, parallels and appears to be due to the formation of diacylglycerol. Accordingly, Ras and Rap1 activation was precluded by antagonists of phospholipase C and of diacylglycerol binding. Ras is dispensable for phagocytosis but controls activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is partially impeded by diacylglycerol inhibitors. By contrast, cross-activation of complement receptors by stimulation of Fcgamma receptors requires Rap1 and involves diacylglycerol. We suggest a role for diacylglycerol-dependent exchange factors in the activation of Ras and Rap1, which govern distinct processes induced by Fcgamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis to enhance the innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2067809317,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have attracted enormous attention due to their vast potential in regenerative medicine, pharmaceutical screening and basic research. Most prior established iPS cell lines were derived and maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells supplemented with exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Drawbacks of MEF cells impede optimization as well as dissection of reprogramming events and limit the usage of iPS cell derivatives in therapeutic applications. In this study, we develop a reproducible protocol for efficient reprogramming mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells via retroviral transfer of human transcriptional factors OCT4/SOX2/KLF4/C-MYC. Two independent iPS cell lines are derived without exogenous LIF. They display typical undifferentiated morphology and express pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox2. Transgenes are inactivated and the endogenous Oct4 promoter is completely demethylated in the established iPS cell lines, indicating a fully reprogrammed state. Moreover, the iPS cells can spontaneously differentiate or be induced into various cell types of three embryonic germ layers in vitro and in vivo when they are injected into immunodeficient mice for teratoma formation. Importantly, iPS cells extensively integrate with various host tissues and contribute to the germline when injected into the blastocysts. Interestingly, these two iPS cell lines, while both pluripotent, exhibit distinctive differentiation tendencies towards different lineages. Taken together, the data describe the first genuine mouse iPS cell lines generated on human feeder cells without exogenous LIF, providing a reliable tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming."

T4 bacteriophage is one of the major model systems for acquiring information on DNA replication and repair processes.

The experimental results give convincing evidence that gp59 forms a hexameric complex on the forked DNA because of a protein-DNA interaction. A simple model was used to analyze the part played by other primosome proteins (gp32 and gp41) in the gp59-forked DNA interaction. Primosome proteins gp41 (11Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J.

Mutant gp59 proteins were labeled by cysteine modification. In brief, the protein was dialyzed in labeling buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) for 8 h and incubated with a 5-fold excess of Alexa 555 (Alexa Fluor 555 C2 maleimide, Invitrogen) for ∼4 h. The unreacted dye was removed by chromatography using a cation-exchange resin and a salt gradient. Dithiothreitol (∼2 mm) was added to the gp59-Alexa 555 proteins and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, and the extent of labeling was calculated by using absorbance of the fluorescent dye as described previously (25Zhang Z. Spiering M.M. Trakselis M.A. Ishmael F.T. Xi J. Benkovic S.J. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). gp59 mutants with one accessible cysteine were found to have 1 Alexa 555/protein, which implies that protein is 100% labeled. An ATPase assay was carried out to check the activity of the gp59-Alexa 555 proteins in the presence of gp32 and gp41. The labeled proteins were found to be as active as the wild-type protein. Various high pressure liquid chromatography-purified DNA primers were bought from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) for smPB (with biotin and Cy5 dye attachments). The structures of the forked DNAs are shown in Fig. 1. The sequences of the primers are given in Table 1. These primers were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in complex buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 150 mm potassium acetate, and 10 mm magnesium acetate (pH 7.8)) to a final concentration of 5 μm. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature.TABLE 1Primer sequences of forked DNA substrates used in this studyNameSequenceFkD-U5′-Biotin-ACACAGACGTACTATCATGAGGTGAGGGAGGGTGGGTGGT-3′ (40-mer)5′-TGTGTCTGCATGATAGTACGGGTGAGGGAGGGTGGGTGGT-3′ (40-mer)5′-ACCCCCACCC-3′ (10-mer)FkD-Cy55′-TATGAATCAGAGTGTAAGTTCCGAGTGATACAATGATAGTACGTCTGTGT-biotin-3′ (50-mer)5′-ACACAGACGTACTATCATGACGCATCAGACAACGTGCGTCAAAAATTACGTGCGGAAGGAGT-3′ (62-mer)5′-Cy5-ACTCCTTCCGCACGTAATTTTTGACGCACGTTGT-3′ (34-mer) Open table in a new tab Quartz microscope slides and glass coverslips were prepared according to a published protocol (26Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A flow cell with channels was constructed from a quartz slide and glass coverslip. Each channel was washed with buffer and then with a solution of bovine serum albumin as a surface blocker, followed by streptavidin solution. The biotinylated forked DNA substrate was attached on the quartz slide through streptavidin-biotin linkage. The protein solution (either gp59(C42A)-Alexa 555 or gp59(C215A)-Alexa 555) was filtered using a 0.1-μm syringe filter, introduced into the channel containing forked DNA, allowed to equilibrate for 1 min, and then washed with complex buffer. For the smPB experiment with two dyes, the slide was coated with forked DNA containing Cy5 through a streptavidin-biotin linkage, and then the protein solution was introduced, equilibrated, and washed as described above. The smPB experiments were done using a homebuilt prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence microscope and imaging system. The sample was excited using a green laser (532 nm, 300 milliwatts; Ventus, Laser Quantum). The fluorescence from the sample was collected by a 1.2-numerical aperture/×60 water immersion objective (Plan Apo, Nikon, Tokyo) on a Nikon microscope (inverted TE-2000U) with a 550-nm long-pass filter (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) and a 640-nm dichroic mirror (Chroma) and imaged onto an EMCCD camera (Cascade 512B, Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) with 3 × 3-pixel binning at a 100-ms exposure time. For experiments with Alexa 555 and Cy5, a low intensity red diode laser (645 nm, 25 milliwatts; Coherent Inc.) was used to excite Cy5. An automated shutter was used to switch between the red and green lasers after seven frames of the movie. The movies were collected until the bright fluorescent spots completely photobleached or disappeared. The fluorescence images were converted into fluorescence traces using mathematical codes written in IDL (Interface Definition Language software, ITT Visual Information Solutions, Inc.). Traces with very high photon intensities (>105) were discarded, and others were counted manually. Histograms were built from the number of photobleaching events, and the data were fit to a described model with Equation 4 (see below) employing code written in MATLAB. The smPB data were fit using a simple monomer-binding model to study the relative binding and affinity of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, respectively. In this case, we assumed a hexameric complex (A6) was formed from stepwise interaction of monomers (A) in a sequential manner. The overall pathway of the hexamer formation is written as in Equation 1. A⇀AA2⇀AA3⇀AA4⇀AA5⇀AA6(Eq. 1) The total concentration of various oligomer species formed from an initial concentration of monomer ([A0]) is written as in Equation 2. [A]+2[A2]+3[A3]+4[A4]+5[A5]+6[A6]=[A]0(Eq. 2) The steady-state equilibrium relation at each oligomerization step could be written as follows. A+A↔A2;K1=[A2][A]2;[A2]=K1[A]2A+A2↔A3;K2=[A3][A][A2];[A3]=K2[A][A2]A+A3↔A4;K3=[A4][A][A3];[A4]=K3[A][A3]A+A4↔A5;K4=[A5][A][A4];[A5]=K4[A][A4]A+A5↔A6;K5=[A6][A][A5];[A6]=K5[A][A5]Now, substituting the concentration of each species ([A2] to [A6]) in terms of [A] into Equation 2 and introducing an affinity parameter (σ) associated with higher order oligomerization (e.g. Kn = σKn−1 where n = 2∼6 and K1 = K), we get the following equations for normalization (Equation 3) and the oligomer concentration distribution as a function of n, [A], K, and σ (Equation 4). ∑n=16[An]=[A]+2K[A]2+3σK2[A]3+4σ2K3[A]4+5σ3K4[A]5+6σ4K5[A]6=[A]0=1(Eq. 3) [An]=nσn-2Kn-1[A]n;(n≥2)(Eq. 4) The dimerization of gp59 is the first step in complex formation. This has only a single binding parameter associated with the process (i.e. K1 = K). As the oligomer becomes bigger (for example, n > 2), the tendency for initiating or inhibiting a protein-protein interaction increases; this warrants the need for affinity parameter σ in the binding equilibrium. A histogram is constructed by analyzing the time traces of the fluorescent spots from the recorded sequence of video frames. The number of photobleaching steps indicates the number of monomers in the complex. The events are grouped and normalized so that their number represents the population of the respective species. The experimental data were fit to Equation 4. The discrete nature of photobleaching steps requires the equation to be valid only for integer values of n (from 1 to 6). The normalized number of events and their corresponding photobleaching steps were provided as the input, whereas [A], K, and σ were used as fitting parameters. We employed a nonlinear least-square fitting method based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm using MATLAB. After several rounds of iterations, the values of K and σ, as well as the residuals and a measure of the goodness of fit, were obtained. The experiments involving gp59, forked DNA, and other proteins were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” The fluorescence traces were also extracted from the recorded video frames as mentioned above. The time traces of the fluorescence signal were analyzed, and the photobleaching steps were counted manually by visual inspection. A representative view of the traces with various photobleaching steps is given in Fig. 2 (a–c). After analyzing the traces, a histogram was built as shown in Fig. 3. The numbers of events observed are normalized with respect to the total number of frames counted.FIGURE 3Histogram plot of smPB events. The histogram represents the smPB experiment done with Cy5-labeled forked DNA (FkD-Cy5) with gp59-Alexa 555 and other proteins. Histograms show the normalized events versus number of photobleaching steps. Similar histograms were built for smPB experiments with unlabeled forked DNA with the same proteins (data not shown). The experiments were done in triplicate, and the errors assigned. The population of the hexamer seen is indicated by the circle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A compilation of histograms obtained upon addition of various proteins that are bound to forked DNA is given in Fig. 3. The data were fit to a monomer model using Equation 4 in MATLAB. Initially, a model was applied such that the constant Keq was involved in the formation of all the species (i.e. monomer, trimer, etc.) with the same affinity, but the experimental data did not fit properly for such an assumption. Hence, we introduced the affinity parameter σ to account for higher order oligomerization. The value of σ could vary depending on the nature of the binding event. Thus, the resulting value of K does not give an absolute value of the binding association constant in terms of molar concentration but represents a relative parameter for the magnitude and strength of the actual binding equilibrium constant (Keq). The obtained K and σ values are given in Table 2. The root mean square error obtained for values of K and σ was less than ±0.02. smPB experiments were also performed with gp59 in the presence of forked DNA, gp32, and gp41. All data obtained were analyzed as described above and are shown in Fig. 4 (A–D), and the obtained values of the parameters K and σ are provided in Table 2 (Nos. 1–4).TABLE 2smPB data resultsNo.SystemKσ1FkD-U + gp59*0.900.862FkD-U + gp59* + gp320.380.783FkD-U + gp59* + gp410.640.974FkD-U + gp59* + gp32 +gp410.681.25gp59*0.430.066gp59* + gp320.270.037gp59* + gp410.400.078gp59* + gp32 + gp410.430.069FkD-Cy5 + gp59*0.710.7310FkD-Cy5 + gp59* + gp320.320.3911FkD-Cy5 + gp59* + gp410.930.87 Open table in a new tab The control experiments were performed in the absence of forked DNA. After introduction of the protein followed by repeated washing, some fluorescent spots remained on the slide. Hence, we performed similar experiments in the absence of forked DNA. The recorded data were analyzed as described above and are shown in Fig. 4 (E–H), and values of the fit parameters are given in Table 2 (Nos. 5–8). The values of K and σ were significantly different in the presence and absence of forked DNA. Co-localization experiments were performed using Cy5-labeled forked DNA and gp59-Alexa 555 as described above. These co-localization experiments helped us to consider only the protein-DNA interaction and to eliminate any nonspecific adsorption at the surface. For this purpose, we designed a forked DNA substrate with a Cy5 dye such that any fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Alexa 555 (on gp59) and Cy5 (on forked DNA) would be minimal. The experiments were performed with a red and a green laser as described under “Materials and Methods.” Traces were picked in which both dyes were seen, indicating that the protein was bound to the forked DNA. As expected, the Cy5 dye on the forked DNA photobleached in a single step. Multiple photobleaching steps of Alexa 555 were observed in the presence of various combinations of primosome proteins (gp59, gp32, and gp41). The data analysis was performed as discussed above, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 (I–L) and Table 2 (Nos. 9–12). The results of co-localization experiments are consistent with the experiments performed in the presence of the forked DNA without label. The control experiment inferred that proteins can interact off the DNA. The most important observation is the hexamer seen in the presence of forked DNA. The population of the hexameric complex varied depending on the presence of other proteins. Because the labeling efficiency is ∼1, we did not need to carry out any statistical analysis based on a binomial distribution of the gp59 oligomers. We did not see higher oligomers (n > 7), which led us to frame a model of depicting monomer interacting stepwise to form a hexameric complex. The smPB results unambiguously demonstrate the formation of a hexameric gp59 complex on the forked DNA. A pictorial view of gp59 hexamer is given in Fig. 5a. We observed a distribution of smaller complexes (n = 1–6) seen by counting the number of photobleaching steps. It is known from the ensemble experiments that the value of Kd obtained for gp59 dissociation is in the order of nm. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments are usually performed at very low protein concentrations, in the range of about pm to sub-nm. Thus, the data obtained from single-molecule studies include a condition in which the protein complexes would be partially dissociated (27van Oijen A.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our smPB experiments, we observed ∼3% of the population to be hexameric; this lower yield is most likely the consequence of the gp59 complex being partially dissociated into oligomers. Also the intermediate oligomers observed could be due to the linear binding of gp59 on the single-strand and forked junction of the DNA, as shown in Fig. 5b. The data analysis done by fitting to a simple model involving stepwise monomer association provided a reasonable estimate of the interaction of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. However, we cannot rule out other pathways for the formation of the hexamer, i.e. association of three dimers, two trimers, or their combinations. The results of 12 sets of smPB experiments involving gp59 are tabulated in Table 2. The values of K and σ given in Table 2 measure the magnitude of the association constant and relative strength of the binding events. The experiments can be grouped into three sections. The three sections are (a) experiments in which unlabeled forked DNA was used (Table 2, Nos. 1–4), (b) studies involving protein-protein interactions without forked DNA (Nos. 5–8), and (c) experiments using Cy5-labeled forked DNA and gp59-Alexa 555 interactions along with other proteins (Nos. 9–12). To rule out contributions from any nonspecific binding of proteins to the surface, we performed co-localization experiments. Only Cy5-labeled forked DNA whose fluorescence co-localized with gp59-Alexa 555 spots was used for analysis. All experiments using unlabeled forked DNA (Table 2, Nos. 1–4) were also repeated with co-localization experiments, and the results are tabulated in Table 2 (Nos. 9–12). At the onset, it is evident from Fig. 4 (E–H) that, in experiments involving only proteins, no oligomeric complexes higher than n > 4 were found. The comparison of K, the association values, observed in protein interaction experiments involving unlabeled forked DNA is in the order gp59 > gp59 + gp32 + gp41 > gp59 + gp41 > gp59 + gp32; their binding affinity (σ) is in the order gp59 + gp32 + gp41 > gp59 + gp41 > gp59 > gp59 + gp32. The K value in the case of Cy5-labeled forked DNA is in the order gp59 + gp41 > gp59 + gp32 + gp41 > gp59 > gp59 + gp32; their binding affinity (σ) in the order gp59 + gp32 + gp41 > gp59 + gp41 > gp59 > gp59 + gp32. The trend observed for the K values for forked DNA with and without the label varies to a slight extent; however, the trends in σ are the same. Because co-localization results are restricted to the protein-forked DNA interaction and not any spurious nonspecific binding, those values are considered to reflect the interactions of interest. To understand the actual protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, we need to consider both the binding parameter K and the affinity parameter σ. Detailed comparison among these sets of experiments and the numerical values of these parameters allow us to draw a complete picture of the nature of the protein-DNA interaction for the primosome proteins. First, considering the experiment with gp59 in the absence of DNA (Table 2, No. 5), the protein gp59 seems to interact with a weak association (K = 0.43). The formations of small oligomeric complexes arise from this weak protein-protein interaction and are reflected in the low affinity binding parameter (σ = 0.06). This possibly means that, in the absence of DNA, gp59 forms small oligomers that may not have defined stoichiometry or functional significance. Now, comparing these results with the experiment in which the gp59 protein was added to both labeled and unlabeled forked DNAs (Table 2, Nos. 1 and 9), we see a significant increase in the value of K = 0.90 and 0.71. This ∼2-fold increase in the presence of forked DNA is undoubtedly due to the protein-DNA interaction. This is also accompanied by a 15-fold increase in the affinity binding parameter (σ = 0.86). This is an indication that formation of higher oligomeric complexes is favored in the presence of forked DNA. It is evident from the results of smPB studies that gp59 exists in oligomers up to a hexamer only in the presence of forked DNA (Fig. 4, A, E, and I). Considering these observations, binding of one monomer to the DNA facilitates the binding of other monomers to form a hexameric ring, which is reflected in the higher K and σ values. Table 2 (No. 10) shows the results when gp32 is added in addition to gp59 on the forked DNA. The marked decrease in the value of K (0.32) in this case relative to No. 9 is an indication that, in the presence of gp32, gp59 prefers to co-localize with gp32 and not with the forked DNA, as shown in Fig. 5c. The K value is very similar to the result in the absence of forked DNA (K = 0.27) (Table 2, No. 6). In the presence of DNA, a significant increase of ∼ 13-fold in the binding affinity parameter was observed (Table 2, No. 10). This implies that the higher oligomerization of gp59 is facilitated by the presence of a forked DNA + gp32 combination. Upon adding the gp41 helicase to the above-mentioned proteins (gp59 and gp32) in the presence of forked DNA, we noted an abrupt increase in the value of the binding parameter from K = 0.32 to K = 0.83 (Table 2, No. 12). This >2-fold increase indicates that binding of gp59 to the forked DNA is further stabilized by gp41 in the presence of gp32. Likewise, the affinity parameter increases by ∼2-fold to a maximum value (σ = 0.93). This is consistent with the higher stability of the ternary complex of forked DNA -gp59-gp32-gp41 in the replisome assembly as modeled in Fig. 5d. These results provide evidence for gp59 forming a hexameric complex on the replication fork and loading the gp41 hexamer at a 1:1 stoichiometry (16Raney K.D. Carver T.E. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14074-14081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17San Martin C. Radermacher M. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. Structure. 1998; 6: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The case in which we have all necessary proteins (gp59 + gp32 + gp41) with forked DNA (Table 2, No. 12) can be compared with that without forked DNA (No. 8). The results show a significant decrease in the value of K from 0.83 to ∼0.43. It is known that gp59 interacts with gp32 via the N terminus and that the C terminus is involved in binding to gp41 (11Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Lefebvre S.D. Wong M.L. Morrical S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22830-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the value of σ decreases by ∼15-fold in the absence of forked DNA. This clearly indicates that the proteins interact off the forked DNA but do not favor higher oligomerization. From these collective results, we can conclude that hexameric complexes of gp59 are favored in the presence of forked DNA and that the complex is stabilized by gp32 and gp41. Further comparison of the experimental sets (Table 2, No. 7 versus 8 and No. 11 versus 12) allows us to deduce that the presence of gp32 is, however, not a major contributor to either the equilibrium association constant or the affinity parameter. In summary, our results strongly support the formation of a gp59 hexameric complex in the T4 replisome. This is the first unambiguous experimental observation of the hexameric form of gp59 in the presence of forked DNA, gp32, and gp41. With this result, the understanding of the stoichiometry of a functional pre-primosome complex is more complete. The smPB experiments provide a significant distinction between protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions centered on gp59. The observation of a gp59 hexamer supports the hypothesis that this functional form assists in loading the hexameric helicase gp41 and has a strong interaction with the forked DNA arm and gp32. Our results also support the initiation of replication at a D-loop, where gp59 first binds and then recruits gp32 and gp41 so that the fork arm becomes a lagging strand template (18Jones C.E.

Bioinformatics analyses revealed the clustering of these six stimuli into two categories, suggesting separate gene/pathway dependence. Treatment with specific inhibitors demonstrated the requirement of both Janus kinase and microtubule-associated protein kinase activation to trigger differentiation with nerve growth factor (NGF) and dibutyryl cAMP. Conversely, activation of protein kinase A, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase α, and mammalian target of rapamycin, although required for dibutyryl cAMP-induced differentiation, exerted a negative feedback on NGF-induced differentiation. We identified Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) and poliovirus receptor (PVR) as indispensable for NGF-driven neuronal differentiation and αB-crystallin (Cryab) as an inhibitor of this process. Silencing of Plk2 or PVR blocked NGF-triggered differentiation and Cryab down-regulation, while silencing of Cryab enhanced NGF-induced differentiation.

Steinman L. Neuron. 2003; 38: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). MS was originally considered only as an inflammatory disease. However, as a consequence of increasing evidence on the contribution of neurodegenerative processes to the pathology of MS, axonal loss is nowadays considered as an early and persistent event mainly responsible for the neurological deficits (2.Dutta R. Trapp B.D. Neurology. 2007; 68 (43–54): 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Despite this, current therapies for MS consist only of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs, which show minimal or no clinical benefit in preventing the progression of neurological disability that characterizes this disease (2.Dutta R. Trapp B.D. Neurology. 2007; 68 (43–54): 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Consequently, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms leading to axonal degeneration as well as of those promoting axonal survival, regeneration, and remyelination is essential for the development of novel therapies based on neuroprotection and/or neuronal regeneration. Moreover, this new class of therapeutics would constitute a breakthrough also for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among others. Complex cellular programs, such as those leading to neuronal differentiation require global gene expression changes. The pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line provides a representative model system for studying gene expression and signaling pathways mediating neuronal differentiation (3.Dijkmans T.F. van Hooijdonk L.W.

Although signal transduction pathways leading to neuronal differentiation have been extensively studied, especially for NGF, the induced gene expression changes are far from complete.

Mechanisms leading to neuronal differentiation have been proven difficult to sort out by studying differentiation induced with a single stimulus and/or after a unique length of time. Although several lists of genes associated to the acquisition of a neuronal phenotype in PC12 cells have been published, elucidation of a common minimal pattern of global gene changes required for differentiation remains incomplete. multiple sclerosis basic FGF αB-crystallin dibutyryl cAMP false discovery rate interleukin-6 neurite outgrowth Neuroscreen-1 PC12 cell line pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 38 pheochromocytoma cell line principal component analysis Polo-like kinase 2 poliovirus receptor quantitative PCR superior cervical ganglion nerve growth factor small interfering RNA mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase Janus kinase microtubule-associated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase αB-crystallin extracellular signal-regulated kinase mammalian target of rapamycin. In the present study we sought to investigate this complex process by a more comprehensive systems biology approach. On one side, we analyzed the global transcriptional changes involved in neuronal differentiation using whole-genome microarray hybridization upon differentiation of Neuroscreen-1 (NS1) PC12 cells (3.Dijkmans T.F. van Hooijdonk L.W. Schouten T.G. Kamphorst J.T. Vellinga A.C. Meerman J.H. Fitzsimons C.P. de Kloet E.R. Vreugdenhil E. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 2388-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with NGF, IL-6, bFGF, PACAP38, dbcAMP, and forskolin at 3, 24, and 72 h after each treatment. On the other side, we investigated how the common transcriptional machinery identified was affected by inhibition or enhancement of neuronal differentiation using several small molecule, target-specific inhibitors. We identified 31 genes whose expression was regulated in common by all stimuli during differentiation. Among them, Plk2 and PVR, two genes up-regulated by all the stimuli leading to neuronal differentiation, were proven to be essential for neurite outgrowth. Silencing of Plk2 and PVR with specific small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibited this process, deregulated the expression of markers for differentiation, and more interestingly, greatly influenced the overall gene expression machinery identified in the present whole-genome array hybridization study. Moreover, inhibition of neuronal differentiation upon treatments with MEK1/2- or JAK1/2/3-specific inhibitors significantly decreased the up-regulation of Plk2 and PVR observed during differentiation. Several studies suggest that Cryab plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. However, whether the specific role of Cryab is beneficial or, rather, detrimental to this pathology is still a matter of debate (22.van Noort J.M. van Sechel A.C. Bajramovic J.J. el Ouagmiri M.

Hauk T.G. Müller A. Thanos S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2008; 37: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28.Liedtke T. Schwamborn J.C. Schröer U. Thanos S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 895-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study we uncovered a novel function for Cryab as an inhibitor of neuronal differentiation. Indeed, Cryab was found to be down-regulated by all the stimuli inducing differentiation in NS1 cells as well as by NGF in superior cervical ganglia (SCG) neurons. In addition, transfection of Cryab siRNA resulted in significant enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, and inhibition of neurite extension upon silencing of Plk2 or PVR resulted in the up-regulation of Cryab. Taken together, these results identify PVR and Plk2 as two genes essential for the neuronal differentiation process, working upstream of the negative regulator Cryab and regulated in response to MEK and JAK activation, two pathways required for NGF-induced differentiation.

RNeasy mini and micro kits, DNase I and quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits (Quantitect and QuantiFast SYBR green), and the reverse transcription-PCR advantage kit was from Clontech (Takara Bio/Clontech, Saint Germain en Laye, FR). qPCRs were performed using the 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, CH). Affymetrix (Bucks, UK) GeneChip Technology used rat Genome 230 2.0 Array, Test3 Array, Hybridization Oven 640, Fluidics Station 450, One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, Scanner 3000 7G System, and Operating Software (GCOS) Version 1.1.1. RNA and cRNA quantification was performed in Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Witec AG, Luttau-Luzern, CH). RNA and cRNA quality was checked by RNA6000 Nano Reagents kit and Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Basel, CH). Streptavidin phycoerythrin conjugated for the fluorescent labeling were from Invitrogen. Prism 3.0 was from GraphPad (San Diego, CA). NS1 cells were chosen because they display several advantages over PC12 cells, including 50–80% faster growth, no tendency toward cell aggregation, and accelerated responsiveness to NGF. NS1 cells were maintained in T75 flasks in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were induced to differentiate by the addition of NGF (50 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml for siRNA transfection experiments) for 3 days unless differently specified. To study the concentration-response effects on NOG of extracellular stimuli and inhibitors, cells were plated in 96-well plates (1500 cells/well) 24 h before treatment. For RNA extraction for qPCR analysis, cells were plated in 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well) 24 h before treatment with 10 μm AS-702789, JAK inhibitor I, H-89, AS-702630, or rapamycin or with 10 nm concentrations of non-selective serine/threonine inhibitor staurosporine for 20 min followed by treatment with either NGF or dbcAMP for 3, 24, or 72 h. For the microarray experiments cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at a concentration of 600,000 cells/dish 24 h before treatment with NGF, IL-6, or bFGF or at a concentration of 1,000,000 cells/dish 24 h before treatment with dbcAMP, forskolin, or PACAP38. SCG cells were dissected from postnatal day 1 rat pups and dissociated in 2% dispase for 30 min at 37 °C. Neurons were then mechanically dissociated and plated in 12-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride, and 50 ng/ml NGF for 3 days in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 106 cells were electroporated using Amaxa nucleofectorTM II system (program A-033 and nucleofector kit V) and plated in a 6-well plate. 3 days after electroporation cells were detached, and 106 cells were re-transfected with the same siRNA using the same protocol. Double-transfected cells were plated at a concentration of 250,000 per well and allowed to attach before treatment with 100 ng/ml NGF for 3 additional days. To quantify neurite outgrowth (NOG), phase contrast photographs (10× objective) were taken using a Nikon digital camera CoolPix 4500. For each set of electroporated cells, neurites from a minimum of 100 cells for each of 3 randomly chosen optical fields were measured using the image processing and analysis software ImageJ from JAVA (rsb.info.nih.gov). Neurite length (μm) was analyzed for statistical significance using Prism 3.0. For quantification of NOG by immunocytochemistry, NS1 cells plated in 96-well plates were treated with either increasing concentrations of the different stimuli, as indicated, for 3 days or with increasing concentrations of inhibitors for 20 min followed by a 3-day treatment with a single concentration of NGF or dbcAMP. After fixing the cells with 3.7% formaldehyde and staining with HitKitTM according to the manufacturer's instructions, NOG was visualized by the Cellomics Array Scan HCS system using a 5× objective. Images acquired were analyzed using the NOG BioApplication algorithm and quantified with the automated imaging instrumentation from Cellomics. NOG index represents the percentage of neurons for which the summed length of all neurites is higher than 20 μm. Total RNA extraction and DNase digestion were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Nucleic acid concentrations of the samples were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Equal amounts of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis, and qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate using 2.5 ng of the total cDNA. Values obtained were normalized against those for actin performed in parallel in the same samples. NS1 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml), bFGF (10 μg/ml), IL-6 (5 μg/ml), dbcAMP (500 μm), forskolin (25 μm), or PACAP38 (5 μg/ml) for 3, 24, or 72 h. Total RNA was extracted as described above, and contaminating DNA was removed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sample concentration and quality were confirmed by Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) before hybridization. 5 μg of total RNA was used for target synthesis according to the one-cycle target labeling protocol. cRNAs were quantified and qualitatively checked, as described above, before, and after fragmentation. 15 μg of fragmented cRNA was used for GeneChip hybridization (16 h, 45 °C). Chips were washed and labeled in the fluidics station using the protocol EuKGE-WS2v_450. After scanning, CEL files were analyzed using GCOS software to check poly(A) and hybridization controls. Analysis of microarray data were carried out using R/Bioconductor. Quality control was performed using the Simpleaffy package and principal component analysis (PCA). One outlier was identified and excluded from the rest of the analysis. Normalization was carried out with the gcrma algorithm. Differentially expressed genes for each treatment and time point versus the respective time-matched untreated samples were detected using a modified t test (eBayes method of the Bioconductor Limma package) followed by Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction. For each time point and treatment, gene selection was performed using a FDR cut-off of 0.05 and absolute -fold change larger than 2, except for bFGF, for which a lower -fold change threshold (1.7) was chosen. The final list was obtained by selecting the genes that changed applying the above-mentioned criteria for at least one time point for each extracellular stimulus. Hierarchical cluster analyses were carried out with the SpotFire software using average linkage (UPGMA) with correlation distance. Based on published works on PC12 cells, we selected NGF (3.Dijkmans T.F. van Hooijdonk L.W. Schouten T.G. Kamphorst J.T. Vellinga A.C. Meerman J.H. Fitzsimons C.P. de Kloet E.R. Vreugdenhil E. J.

Thereafter, we pursued a comprehensive systems biology approach by which we analyzed the process of neuronal differentiation in NS1 cells from several different aspects to shed light on this complex process. The systems biology approach included, first, a characterization of the neuritogenic capacities of six different stimuli, second, a genome-wide microarray study aimed at the identification of sets of genes relevant to neuronal differentiation, third, the pharmacological treatment with several inhibitors of known targets to dissect the signaling pathways involved in the process, and finally, gene silencing studies to validate some of the genes identified by the microarray analysis. The scheme of this systems biology multiparty approach is shown in Fig. 1. We experimentally determined EC50 concentrations for each stimulus to induce differentiation of NS1 cells by performing concentration curves for each of them. We assessed differentiation by morphological evaluation under light microscopy and quantification of NOG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the stimuli selected were capable of inducing neuronal differentiation although to a different extent, with NGF and dbcAMP the most potent inducers. Except for bFGF, all the stimuli induced NS1 cell neurite extension in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown in supplemental Fig. 1a. bFGF, although clearly inducing NS1 cells to extend neurites (supplemental Fig. 1a, right panel, d′), did not show concentration dependence when NOG was quantified (data not shown). Remarkably, the shape of the cell bodies and neurites was clearly different in cells treated with the different stimuli. Indeed, differentiation mediated by dbcAMP, forskolin, and PACAP38 was characterized by round-shaped larger cell bodies and shorter and thinner neurites (supplemental Fig. 1a, right panel, e′-g′) when compared with the morphology acquired upon differentiation with NGF, bFGF and IL-6 (supplemental Fig. 1a, right panel, b′–d′). Indeed, NGF-, bFGF-, and IL-6-treated cells showed angular-shaped cell bodies and longer and thicker neurites characteristic of NGF-driven differentiation (3.Dijkmans T.F. van Hooijdonk L.W.

https://openalex.org/W2092600280,"Microfabricated devices have great potential in cell-level studies, but are not easily accessible for the broad biology community. This paper introduces the Microscale Oil-Covered Cell Array (MOCCA) as a low-cost device for high throughput single-cell analysis that can be easily produced by researchers without microengineering knowledge. Instead of using microfabricated structures to capture cells, MOCCA isolates cells in discrete aqueous droplets that are separated by oil on patterned hydrophilic areas across a relatively more hydrophobic substrate. The number of randomly seeded Escherichia coli bacteria in each discrete droplet approaches single-cell levels. The cell distribution on MOCCA is well-fit with Poisson distribution. In this pioneer study, we created an array of 900-picoliter droplets. The total time needed to seed cells in ∼3000 droplets was less than 10 minutes. Compared to traditional microfabrication techniques, MOCCA dramatically lowers the cost of microscale cell arrays, yet enhances the fabrication and operational efficiency for single-cell analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2005914574,"The core domain of the tumor suppressor p53 has low thermodynamic stability, and many oncogenic mutations cause it to denature rapidly at body temperature. We made a series of core domain mutants that are significantly less or more stable than wild type to investigate effects of stability on the transcriptional activity and levels of native full-length p53 in H1299 mammalian cells. The levels of transcriptionally inactive native protein with inactivating mutations in the N-terminal transactivation domain correlated strongly with stability. The levels of transcriptionally active proteins, however, depended on both their stability and the transcriptional activity that leads to the feedback loop of proteolytic degradation via transcription of E3 ligases. A very highly stabilized quadruple mutant and an even more stable hexamutant were more active than wild-type p53 in terms of Bax transcription and apoptotic activity, and reached higher levels than wild type in cells. The increased activity did not result from increased overall stability but was due to a single known suppressor mutation, N239Y. It is possible that the low intrinsic stability of p53 is a means of keeping its level low in the cell by spontaneous denaturation, by a route additional to that of proteolytic degradation via E3 ligase pathways. Denatured p53 does accumulate in cells, and there are pathways for the proteolysis of denatured proteins."

In this study we show that LPXN enhanced the progression of existing PCa in vivo by breeding transgenic mice with prostate-specific LPXN expression and TRAMP mice (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate). Double transgenic LPXN/TRAMP mice showed a significant increase in poorly differentiated PCa and distant metastases as compared with control TRAMP mice. Additional studies on primary PCa cells generated from both transgenic backgrounds confirmed the connection regarding LPXN overexpression and increased motility and invasiveness of PCa cells. One mediator of LPXN-induced invasion was found to be the cell-cell adhesion protein p120catenin (p120CTN). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that p120CTN expression negatively correlates with LPXN expression, followed by a redistribution of beta-catenin. Downregulation of LPXN using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in a membranous localization of beta-catenin, whereas strong nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was observed in p120CTN knockdown cells leading to enhanced transcription of the beta-catenin target gene matrix metalloprotease-7. In conclusion, the present results indicate that LPXN enhances the progression of PCa through downregulation of p120CTN expression and that LPXN could function as a marker for aggressive PCa in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2065964419,"An ""environmental phosphatase"" controls bacterial transcriptional responses through alternative sigma factor subunits of RNA polymerase and a partner switching mechanism has been proposed to mediate phosphatase regulation. In many bacteria, the environmental phosphatase and multiple regulators are encoded in separate genes whose products form transient complexes. In contrast, in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis homolog, Rv1364c, the phosphatase is fused to two characteristic regulatory modules with sequence similarities to anti-sigma factor kinases and anti-anti-sigma factor proteins. Here we exploit this fusion to explore interactions between the phosphatase and the regulatory domains. We show quantitatively that the anti-sigma factor kinase domain activates the phosphatase domain, the kinase-phosphatase fusion protein autophosphorylates in Escherichia coli, and phosphorylation is antagonized by the phosphatase activity. Small angle x-ray scattering defines solution structures consistent with the interdomain communication observed biochemically. Taken together, these data indicate that Rv1364c provides a single chain framework to understand the structure, function, and regulation of environmental phosphatases throughout the bacterial kingdom."
