Taking advantages of the distinctive enzymatic properties of CRISPR enzymes, Gootenberg et al. developed an improved nucleic acid detection technology for multiplexed quantitative and highly sensitive detection, combined with lateral flow for visual readout. Myhrvold et al. added a sample preparation protocol to create a field-deployable viral diagnostic platform for rapid detection of specific strains of pathogens in clinical samples. Cas12a (also known as Cpf1), a type V CRISPR protein, cleaves double-stranded DNA and has been adapted for genome editing.

https://openalex.org/W2785942661,"A guide for catalyst choice in the forest Chemists often discover reactions by applying catalysts to a series of simple compounds. Tweaking those reactions to tolerate more structural complexity in pharmaceutical research is time-consuming. Ahneman et al. report that machine learning can help. Using a high-throughput data set, they trained a random forest algorithm to predict which specific palladium catalysts would best tolerate isoxazoles (cyclic structures with an N–O bond) during C–N bond formation. The predictions also helped to guide analysis of the catalyst inhibition mechanism. Science , this issue p. 186"

Mills et al. mapped global patterns of seasonal coat color change across eight species including hares, weasels, and foxes. They found regions where individuals molt to white, brown, and both white and brown winter coats. Greater proportions of the populations molted to white in higher latitudes. Regions where seasonal coat changes are the most variable (molting to both brown and white) may provide resilience against the warming climate. Science , this issue p. 1033"
https://openalex.org/W2792908157,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), glioma oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), and truncated GLI1 (tGLI1) are oncogenic transcription factors playing important roles in breast cancer. tGLI1 is a gain-of-function GLI1 isoform. Whether STAT3 physically and/or functionally interacts with GLI1/tGLI1 has not been explored. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 47 node-positive breast cancer specimens using immunohistochemical staining and found that phosphorylated-STAT3 (Y705), GLI1, and tGLI1 are co-overexpressed in the majority of triple-negative breast carcinomas (64%) and HER2-enriched (68%) breast carcinomas, and in lymph node metastases (65%). Using gene set enrichment analysis, we analyzed 710 breast tumors and found that STAT3 activation and GLI1/tGLI1 activation signatures are co-enriched in triple-negative subtypes of breast cancers and HER2-enriched subtypes of breast cancers, but not in luminal subtypes of breast cancers. Patients with high levels of STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1 co-activation in their breast tumors had worse metastasis-free survival compared to those with low levels. Since these proteins co-overexpress in breast tumors, we examined whether they form complexes and observed that STAT3 interacted with both GLI1 and tGLI1. We further found that the STAT3-GLI1 and STAT3-tGLI1 complexes bind to both consensus GLI1-binding and STAT3-binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and that the co-overexpression markedly activated a promoter controlled by GLI1-binding sites. To identify genes that can be directly co-activated by STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1, we analyzed three ChIP-seq datasets and identified 34 potential target genes. Following validations using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and survival analysis, we identified three genes as novel transcriptional targets of STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1, R-Ras2, Cep70, and UPF3A. Finally, we observed that co-overexpression of STAT3 with GLI1/tGLI1 promoted the ability of breast cancer cells to form mammospheres and that STAT3 only cooperates with tGLI1 in immortalized mammary epithelial cells. In summary, our study identified novel physical and functional cooperation between two families of oncogenic transcription factors, and the interaction contributes to aggressiveness of breast cancer cells and poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancers and HER2-enriched breast cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2790393719,"The Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, functions as a transcriptional regulator and has an important role in cellular control of organ size and tumor growth. Elevated oncogenic activity of YAP1 has been clarified in different types of human cancers, which contributes to cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. However, the molecular mechanism of YAP1 overexpression in cancer is still not clear. Here we demonstrate that the deubiquitination enzyme USP9X deubiquitinates and stabilizes YAP1, thereby promoting cancer cell survival. Increased USP9X expression correlates with increased YAP1 protein in human breast cancer cell lines and patient samples. Moreover, depletion of USP9X increases YAP1 polyubiquitination, which in turn elevates YAP1 turnover and cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Overall, our study establishes the USP9X-YAP1 axis as an important regulatory mechanism of breast cancer and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of breast cancer."

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) promotes self-renewal and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) induces differentiation of GSCs. BMP7 induces the transcription factor Snail to promote astrocytic differentiation in GSCs and suppress tumor growth in vivo. We demonstrate that Snail represses stemness in GSCs. Snail interacts with SMAD signaling mediators, generates a positive feedback loop of BMP signaling and transcriptionally represses the TGFB1 gene, decreasing TGFβ1 signaling activity. Exogenous TGFβ1 counteracts Snail function in vitro, and in vivo promotes proliferation and re-expression of Nestin, confirming the importance of TGFB1 gene repression by Snail. In conclusion, novel insight highlights mechanisms whereby Snail differentially regulates the activity of the opposing BMP and TGFβ pathways, thus promoting an astrocytic fate switch and repressing stemness in GSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2789999172,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens, rarely in normal tissues except testis, are expressed in many tumor types. In recent years, DDX43 has been shown to be expressed in several malignancies. However, the role of DDX43 during tumorigenesis is not well established. In the present study, we explored the function of DDX43 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We found that DDX43 overexpression in CML cell lines enhanced survival and colony formation, inhibited cell apoptosis, promoted tumorigenesis, and CML progression. In contrast, silencing of DDX43 inhibited cell survival and tumorigenesis. Upregulated H19 and downregulated miR-186 were identified in DDX43-transfected cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-186 targeted DDX43, and overexpressed miR-186 increased apoptosis and decreased cell survival. We also showed that DDX43 regulated the expression of H19 through demethylation and silencing H19 inhibited cell survival. Taken together, these results indicate that DDX43 provides critical support to the progression of CML by enhancing cell survival, colony formation, and inhibiting cell apoptosis, thereby implicating DDX43 as a potential therapeutic target in CML."
