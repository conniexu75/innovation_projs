https://openalex.org/W2010467161,"A strain of type 2 human rotavirus (Wa) was grown to relatively high titer through 14 passages in primary cultures of African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells. This passage series was initiated with virus that had been passaged 11 times serially in newborn gnotobiotic piglets. In contrast, virus present in the stool of patient Wa as well as virus from the first, second, or third passage in piglets could not be propagated successfully in African green monkey kidney cells. Prior to each passage in cell culture, the virus was treated with trypsin and the inoculated cultures were centrifuged at low speed. Cultivation of a type 2 human rotavirus should aid attempts to characterize this virus and to develop a means of immunoprophylaxis for a serious diarrheal disease of human infants."

https://openalex.org/W1484881742,"Purified RNA guanylyltransferase . RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase complex from vaccinia virus contains RNA triphosphatase activity. The latter activity, which removes the gamma-phosphate from triphosphate-ended polyribonucleotides, co-chromatographed with the capping and methylating enzyme complex on seven different ion exchange or affinity columns and co-sedimented with the complex on a glycerol gradient. On a molar basis, the RNA triphosphatase was about 100 times more active than the associated RNA guanylyl-transferase. When the purified enzyme complex was incubated with poly(A) containing a 5'-triphosphate, removal of the gamma-phosphate preceded capping. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the rate or extent of capping 5'-diphosphate- or 5'-triphosphate-ended poly(A). Physical association of the three enzymatic activities appears to be an efficient mechanism for carrying out the following successive steps in cap formation: (formula: see text)."
https://openalex.org/W1598053850,"The ability of adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), ADP, and PPi to dissociate the actin.myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) complex was studied using an analytical ultracentrifuge with UV optics, which enabled the direct determination of the dissociated S-1. At mu = 0.22 M, pH 7.0, 22 degrees C, with saturating nucleotide present, ADP weakens the binding of S-1 to actin about 40-fold (K congruent to 10(5) M-1), while both AMP-PNP and PPi weakens the binding about 400-fold (K congruent to 10(4) M-1). This 10-fold stronger dissociating effect of AMP-PNP and PPi compared to ADP correlates with our data showing that the binding of AMP-PNP and PPi to S-1 is about 10-fold stronger than the binding of ADP. In contrast, the binding constants of ADP, AMP-PNP, and PPi to acto.S-1 are nearly identical (K congruent to 5 x 10(3) M-1). At 4 degrees C, AMP-PNP has only a 3-fold stronger dissociating effect than ADP and, similarly, our data suggest that the binding of AMP-PNP and ADP to S-1 is quite similar at 4 degrees C. AMP-PNP and PPi are, therefore, somewhat better dissociating agents than ADP, but the difference among these three ligands is quite small. These data also show that actin and nucleotide bind to separate but interacting sites on S-1 and that the S-1 molecules bind independently along the F-actin filament with a binding constant of about 1 x 10(7) M-1 at 22 degrees C and physiological ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1650772472,"Highly purified tryptic peptides of calmodulin have been obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tryptic cleavage of calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ results in two main fragments which have been identified by analysis of the amino acid composition as 1-77 and 78-148. In the absence of Ca2+, trypsin cleavage yields fragments 1-106, 1-90, and 107-148. Only fragments 78-148 and 1-106 are still able to stimulate the purified Ca2+-ATPase of erythrocytes, albeit much less efficiently on a molar basis, than intact calmodulin. On the other hand, the same fragments were unable to stimulate the calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, even at 1000-fold molar excess (shown also by Newton, D.L., Oldewurtel, M.D., Krinks, M.H., Shiloach, J., and Klee, C.B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4419-4426). This points to the importance of the carboxyl-terminal half of calmodulin and especially of Ca2+-binding region III in the interaction of calmodulin with the Ca2+-ATPase and provides clear evidence that calmodulin interacts differently with different targets. Oxidation of methionine(s) of fragment 78-148 with N-chlorosuccinimide removes the ability of this fragment to stimulate the ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1498488471,"An ATP diphosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.5) from the pancreas of the pig has been characterized and purified. The enzyme which has an optimum pH between 8 and 9 is specific for diphospho- and triphosphonucleosides. The Km values for ADP and ATP are 7.4 and 7.3 x 10(-4) M, respectively, and the purified enzyme has specific activities of 13 and 15.2 mumol of Pi/min/m of protein, respectively. It requires calcium or magnesium ions and it is insensitive to ATPase inhibitors, namely oligomycin, ouabain, and ruthenium red, and to levamisole, an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase. Denaturation experiments, by heat and trypsin treatments, indicated that only one enzyme is involved. This is confirmed by the solubilization and purification process and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 270-fold purification was obtained by centrifugation and successive column chromatography on Sepharose 4B and Affi-Gel blue. It is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 65,000 as estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1624531326,"Several changes were noted in the characteristics of the turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor and in the kinetic properties of adenylate cyclase following pretreatment of erythrocyte membranes with isoproterenol and GMP, and thorough washing to remove these agents. The changes include modifications in the binding of agonist (isoproterenol) and in revelation of marked effects of GTP on agonist binding; reduction in the lag in Gpp(NH)p activation of adenylate cyclase; short lived activation by GTP which is lengthened by treatment with cholera toxin and NAD prior to pretreatment with isoproterenol and GMP. Treatment with cholera toxin also shortened the lag in activation by Gpp(NH)p and increased the steady state levels of activation by both Gpp(NH)p and GTP. The following conclusions can be drawn: (i) catecholamines, in the presence of a guanine nucleotide, stimulate the exchange of bound and exogenous nucleotide; (ii) the exchange reaction is involved in both the activation of adenylate cyclase and in the reciprocal effects of hormone and guanine nucleotides on each other's binding: (iii) the beta-adrenergic receptor and nucleotide regulatory components are linked in turkey erythrocyte membranes; (iv) both cholera toxin and catecholamines, although by different mechanisms, stimulate the exchange reaction at the nucleotide regulatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1604601733,"A putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase substrate associated with the cAMP stimulation of bovine sperm motility has been identified. Optimum conditions for a linear, concentration-dependent incorporation of [32P]ATP into phosphoproteins of an epididymal sperm sonicate by cAMP-dependent protein kinase are described. The motility state of the sperm was reduced by incubation at 37 degrees C and reactivated with theophylline. Endogenous levels of cAMP correlated with the motility state of the sperm. The phosphorylation state of phosphoproteins was frozen by addition of NaF (100 mM final concentration). After sonication and removal of endogenous nucleotides, 32P incorporation into phosphoprotein varied inversely with motility. The inverse relationship results from the procedure monitoring the capacity for incorporation of 32P into dephosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase substrates. Over 70% of the cAMP-dependent label was in the soluble fraction. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one cAMP-dependent phosphoprotein from the soluble fraction which had an inverse correlation with motility. This 55,000-dalton protein did not bind [3H]cholchicine (tubulin) or [3H]cAMP (REGULATORY SUBUNIT OF PROTEIN KINASE). These data indicate the existence of a cytosolic phosphorylated motility protein."

https://openalex.org/W1485282237,"Poliovirus increases phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in HeLa cells by stimulation of the reaction catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (Vance, D.E., Trip, E.M., and Paddon, H.B. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1064-1069). The mechanism for the virus effect has been investigated. An assay for the cytidylyltransferase which mimics the physiological conditions within the cell was developed. The enzyme activity was not changed at 3 h but was stimulated more than 2-fold at 4 and 5 h after infection with poliovirus. Enzyme activity was stimulated by addition of CTP to the assay. At 0.10 mM CTP the difference in activities from poliovirus- and mock-infected cells was abolished. Mg2+ inhibited the cytidylyltransferase activities and eliminated the differences between the two activities at a concentration of 0.05 mM. However, the endogenous amount of Mg2+ in the postmitochondrial supernatants was the same for infected and mock-infected cells. The addition of CDP-choline or PPi inhibited the cytidylyltransferase activity but had no effect on the relative differences in activities from infected and mock-infected cells. Measurement of CTP in the postmitochondrial fraction showed no differences at 3 h but was elevated 2- to 3-fold in poliovirus-infected cells at 4 and 5 h. It appears that the cytidylyltransferase reaction is faster in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells because of an increase of CTP in the cytoplasmic compartment. Moreover, it appears that the concentration of CTP in the cytoplasm can determine the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in HeLa cells."

https://openalex.org/W1487601077,"Initiation of poly(ADP-ribosyl) histone synthesis was achieved in vitro using an apparently homogeneous preparation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. When poly(ADP-ribose) was synthesized in the presence of DNA and increase amounts of histone H1, increasing portions (up to about 55%) of the product were found associated with the histone, judging from solubility in 5% HClO4 and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Most of the polymers were directly attached to the histone protein and not produced by elongation from pre-existing ADP-ribose; the cohesive end of poly(ADP-ribose), isolated as ribose 5-phosphate with snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion, was labeled almost quantitatively with [ribose (NMN)-14C]NAD. The poly(ADP-ribose) . histone linkage was labile in mild alkali and neutral NH2OH, suggesting that the same bond, probably ester, was formed in this system as in crude chromatin or isolated nuclei. Elongation of a histone-bound monomer into a polymer by this enzyme was previously demonstrated (Ueda, K., Kawaichi, M., Okayama, H., and Hayaishi, O. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 679-687), but initiation of ADP-ribose chains on histone has never been shown with a purified enzyme. This appeared to be due to the low concentrations of histone so far used. These findings indicated that a single enzyme catalyzes two different types of reaction, i.e. an attachment of ADP-ribose to histone and its elongation into a polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1503578612,Enzymatic activities which dephosphorylate dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) and dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) have been observed in membranes from cultured human lymphocytes. Neither activity requires divalent metals. Dol-P phosphatase is inhibited by inorganic phosphate but not by other phosphate-containing compounds. Dol-P-P phosphatase is inhibited by bacitracin but not by phosphate-containing compounds including the methylene analogue of pyrophosphate. These reactions are similar to those previously found in the cycle of bacterial wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis. A chemical synthesis of [32P]Dol-P and [32P]Dol-P-P is reported.
https://openalex.org/W1607359602,"The regulatory subunit of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Rt) serves as a substrate for the phosphotransferase reaction catalyzed by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (Km = 2.2 microM). The reaction is stimulated by cGMP when RI . cAMP is the substrate, but not when nucleotide-free RI is used. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of RI dimer in the presence of cAMP and a self-phosphorylation reaction to the extent of 4 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme dimer. In the absence of cAMP, RI is a competitive inhibitor of the phosphorylation of histone H2B (Ki = 0.25 microM) and of the synthetic peptide substrate Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Ki = 0.15 microM) by the cGMP-dependent enzyme. Nucleotide-free RI also inhibits the intramolecular self-phosphorylation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The inhibition of the phosphorylation reactions are reversed by cAMP. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase does not catalyze the phosphorylation of RIand does not significantly alter the ability of RI to serve as a substrate or an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. These observations are consistent with the concept that the cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases are closely related proteins whose functional domains may interact."
https://openalex.org/W1513523543,"Lutropin-sensitive adenylate cyclase ((EC 4.6.1.1) ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing)) in purified rat ovarian plasma membranes is stimulated by lutropin 2- to 3-fold in the absence, but 15- to 20-fold in the presence of GTP or p(NH)ppG. Following 10 to 15 min of incubation at 30 degrees C in the presence of lutropin, enzyme activity declined (50%) in the presence of GTP but not in the presence of p(NH)ppG. This desensitizing process induced by lutropin and GTP is not seen if NaF is also included in the incubation medium. The desensitized state of the enzyme persists at 4 degrees C in membranes washed free of the incubation medium. In this state the enzyme is characterized by: (i) a reduced response to lutropin even in the presence of p(NH)ppG; (ii) its response to NaF is not different from that of untreated enzyme; (iii) it reconverts to a fully responsive state following incubation (10 min, 30 degrees C) in GTP-free medium, a process accelerated by p(NH)ppG; (iv) the receptor content as well as the stability of the receptor.hormone complex does not differ from that of untreated fully responsive enzyme. It is proposed that desensitization results from a GTP-dependent, hormone-stimulated reaction that leads to impaired coupling of the enzyme system. The desensitized state induced is transient and may revert to a responsive one under specified conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1516816002,"The interactions of the iron-molybdenum cofactor, FeMoco, isolated from acid-treated Azotobacter vinelandii molybdenum-iron protein (Av1) with EDTA and thiophenol in N-methylformamide solution have been reinvestigated. Our studies show that EDTA alone is sufficient to eliminate the EPR signal of dithionite-reduced FeMoco. Neither light/5-deazaflavin nor carbon monoxide are required, which implies that this EPR-silent form of FeMoco does not correspond to the EPR-silent, substrate-reducing state of Av1. As EDTA-treated FeMoco does not regain EPR activity on addition of sodium dithionite or thiophenol, it is apparently distinct from the EPR-silent form of either dye-oxidized FeMoco or dye-oxidized Av1. Thiophenol sharpens the EPR signal of dithionite-reduced FeMoco and shifts the g = 3.3 feature to g = 3.6. This shift is complete at 1:1 ratio of thiophenol/Mo atom, while the EDTA effect requires about 40 molecules/Mo atom. Thiophenol and EDTA probably affect different sites of FeMoco. The binding of either reactant does not affect the activity of FeMoco as measured by its ability to reconstitute extracts of A. vinelandii mutant UW45."
https://openalex.org/W1631700912,"Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and its potent analog [D-Ser(tBu)6]des-Gly10-GnRH N-ethylamide elevate pituitary cyclic GMP levels while stimulating gonadotropin release in cultured pituitary cells. Addition of mycophenolic acid to pituitary cell cultures decreased basal and GnRH-induced cGMP production to undetectable levels, but did not reduce basal or GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Elevation of endogenous cGMP levels by sodium nitroprusside, or addition of cGMP or its potent derivatives, was also without effect on basal or GnRH-stimulated LH release. These findings demonstrate that the elevation of intracellular cGMP during GnRH action does not mediate the release of LH by pituitary cells."

Stereotaxically guided administration of antibodies to cerebroside sulfate into the periaqueductal gray region, the most sensitive brain region in which to demonstrate inhibition of this response, antagonizes the effect of morphine and β-endorphin. These results suggest that cerebroside sulfate may be an integral component of an opiate receptor in rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W1549075386,"Mature Simian virus 40 (SV40) chromosomes were isolated from infected CV-1 monkey cells by a hypotonic extraction method that not only allowed replicating viral chromosomes to faithfully continue DNA replication in vitro, but also was found to assemble nascent DNA into nucleosomes with a structure and arrangement typical of native viral chromosomes. Detailed analysis of the DNA and nucleoprotein products from micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion of mature viral chromosomes assembled in intact cells showed that the structure of SV40 and CV-1 cellular nucleosomes was the same. Furthermore, the histone composition of viral chromosome was indistinguishable from that of its host. In contrast to the identity in nucleosome structure, nucleosome spacing on isolated SV40 chromosomes was not as regular as on cellular chromatin. When 1% of the DNA was solubilized by micrococcal nuclease, as many as 20 cellular DNA bands were clearly resolved by gel electrophoresis, but only 6 to 7 viral DNA bands were observed and they were broader and less well resolved. In addition, micrococcal nuclease digested SV40 chromosomes at a faster initial rate and to a greater extent than CV-1 chromatin present in the same tube. Either BglI or EcoRI restriction endonuclease cut a single site in 30% of the SV40 chromosomes which suggested that viral nucleosomes were not located in a unique phase with respect to DNA sequence, but appeared to be randomly spaced around the genome. Viral chromosome structure was basically unaltered in hypotonically extracted chromosomes exposed to 200 or 600 mM NaCl and in isotonically extracted chromosomes prepared in the presence of Triton X-100 and EDTA. These results confirm and extend our previous data on the arrangement of SV40 nucleosomes inside isolated nuclei and demonstrate that the structure of viral chromosomes was not altered by the isolation procedures employed. The data are consistent with a model in which an average of 22 nucleosomes, randomly distributed around the SV40 genome, are separated by non-nucleosomal spacer regions which account for about 20% of the total DNA."

The reaction catalyzed by this adenylate cyclase proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus, indicating that the cyclization reaction is direct and does not involve formation of an adenylated enzyme intermediate."

The enzyme is unique among the phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes due to its high affinity for ribosomes in crude extracts. We report here investigations which define the nature of this in vitro affinity for ribosomes. Phosphatidylserine synthase can be dissociated from ribosomes in the presence of various inorganic salts at high ionic strength. Dissociation was also brought about by cellular levels of the polyamine spermidine. These results suggest the interaction of the enzyme with ribosomes in vitro is primarily ionic in nature, and polyamines may prevent this interaction in vivo. In the presence of nonionic detergent-lipid substrate mixed micelles under assay conditions the enzyme is also dissociated from ribosomes. Dissociation does not occur in the presence of detergent alone or in the presence of lipids which are not substrates or products of the enzyme. This dissociation by lipid substrate indicates the enzyme is not associated with ribosomes during catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1509531019,"Abstract Spin labels attached to rabbit muscle actin became more immobilized upon conversion of actin from the state to the F state with 50 mM KCl. Titration of G-actin with MgCl2 produced F-actin-like EPR spectra between 2 and 5 mM-actin filaments by electron microscopy. Higher concentrations of MgCl2 produced bundles of actin and eventually paracrystals, accompanied by further immobilization of spin labels. The effects of MgCl2 and KCl were competitive: addition of MgCl2 to 50 mM could convert F-actin (50 mM KCl) to paracrystalline (P) actin; the reverse titration (0 to 200 mM KCl in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2) was less complete. Addition of DNase I to G- or F-actin gave the expected amorphous electron micrographic pattern, and the actin was not sedimentable at (400,000 x g x h). EPR showed that the actin was in the conformation. Addition of DNase I to paracrystalline actin gave the F conformation (EPR) but the actin was G by electron microscopy. Phalloidin converted G-actin to F-actin, had no effect on F-actin, and converted P-actin to the F state by electron microscopy but maintained the P conformation by EPR. Cytochalasin B produced no effects observable by EPR or centrifugation but untwisted paracrystals into nets. Since actin retained its P conformation by EPR in two states which were morphologically not P, we conclude that the P state is a distinct conformation of the actin molecule and that actin filaments aggregate to form bundles (and eventually paracrystals) when actin monomers are able to enter the P conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1605422079,"An enzyme fraction containing phosphatase activity for phosphorylated eukaryotic peptide initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) has been isolated from rabbit reticulocytes and partially characterized. The enzyme efficiently catalyzes release of phosphate from the small subunit of eIF-2 (eIF-2 alpha) that has been phosphorylated by the hemin-controlled repressor. It is shown to restore activity of this phosphorylated eIF-2 for binding of methionyl-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits in a partial reaction of peptide initiation. The enzyme fraction also has phosphatase activity for eIF-2 phosphorylated in its largest subunit and for the 100,000-dalton peptide associated with the eIF-2 alpha kinase activity of the hemin-controlled repressor. The phosphoprotein phosphatase has been isolated by a procedure involving precipitation with ethanol at room temperature and has an apparent molecular weight in the order of 76,000. Its phosphatase activity for eIF-2 alpha is stimulated about 3-fold by optimal concentrations of Mn2+, but is not stimulated by Ca2+ or Mg2+. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by Fe2+ and by purine nucleoside diphosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1517082924,"The vicinity of nucleotide binding sites and the mechanism of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis have been studied with the bifunctional photosensitive ATP analog 3'-arylazido-8-azido-ATP. 3'-Arylazido-8-azido-ATP is hydrolyzed by the F1-ATPase from Micrococcus luteus in the absence of ultraviolet light. Irradiation, by ultraviolet light, of F1-ATPase in the presence of 3'-arylazido-8-azido-ATP results in the specific formation of cross-links between alpha and beta subunits. The results suggest that a hydrolytic nucleotide binding site is located on a beta subunit at or near an alpha subunit, probably at the interface between these subunits. Such a constellation would permit direct subunit-subunit interactions during ATP synthesis/hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1505381647,"When Mg2+ was used as the activating cation, the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.6.1) of Salmonella typhimurium showed absolute specificity for the A(S) enantiomer of adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate), which gave a Km of 72 +/- 10 microM and a Vmax of 111 +/- 5 mumol/min/mg. The corresponding values for ATP were 46 +/- 3 microM and approximately 107 mumol/min/mg. Under the same conditions the B(R) isomer was a linearly competitive inhibitor (Ki = 54 +/- 11 microM) with respect to ATP. When Cd2+ replaced Mg2+, the two isomers reacted at comparable rates (Vmax (A)/Vmax (B) approximately equal to 0.8). This change in specificity suggests that the alpha-phosphate of ATP is liganded to a divalent cation during catalysis. Adenosine 5'-O-thiomonophosphate was 34-fold more effective as a product inhibitor when Cd2+ replaced Mg2+, while the effectiveness of AMP was not altered. This result suggests a divalent cation bridge between the enzyme and the alpha-phosphate of nucleotides. The results of these and previously published experiments enable us to propose a structure and stereochemical configuration for the divalent cation.ATP complex at the active site of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1640097718,"Abstract Purified beef heart cytochrome c oxidase is inactivated to the extent of 35 to 50% by the nonpolar mercurial reagents mercuric chloride and ethylmercuric chloride. The inactivation is complete within 5 min. In titrations of activity, the plateau level of inactivation is attained at added ethylmercuric chloride:heme a ratios of about 1:1. Up to 3 mercury atoms/heme a are bound to the oxidase, although only the first of these affects its enzymatic activity. Incubation of the ethylmercury-modified oxidase with sulfhydryl compounds reverses the inactivation, with 2,3-dimercaptopropanol being most effective of the reagents tested. Spectrophotometric and polarographic assays of enzymatic activity show that Km values for the native and the ethylmercury-modified enzymes are practically indistinguishable, and that the partial inactivation observed for the latter is reflected exclusively in a lower value of Vmax compared to that of the native enzyme. Based on these results, we propose that ethylmercuric chloride reacts with a single crucial--SH group per heme a, and that electron transfer processes in the modified product are partially inhibited."
