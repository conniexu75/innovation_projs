https://openalex.org/W2015031047,"An image of an unusual luminous electrical discharge over a thunderstorm 250 kilometers from the observing site has been obtained with a low-light-level television camera. The discharge began at the cloud tops at 14 kilometers and extended into the clear air 20 kilometers higher. The image, which had a duration of less than 30 milliseconds,resembled two jets or fountains and was probably caused by two localizd electric charge concentrations at the cloud tops. Large upward discharges may create a hazard for aircraft and rocket launches and, by penetrating into the ionosphere, may initiate whistler waves and other effects on a magnetospheric scale. Such upward electrical discharges may account for unexplained photometric observations of distant lightning events that showed a low rise rate of the luminous pulse and no electromagnetic sferic pulse of the type that accompanies cloud-to-earth lightning strokes. An unusually high rate of such photometric events was recorded during the night of 22 to 23 September 1989 during a storm associated with hurricane Hugo."

A transition temperature (Tc) of about 85 K is found for (Tl0.5Pb0.5) Sr2CaCu2O7 whereas (Tl0.5Pb0.5)Sr2Ca2Cu3O9 has a Tc of about 120 K. Both materials possess tetragonal symmetry with a = 3.80 Å, c = 12.05 Å for (Tl0.5Pb0.5)Sr2CaCu2O7, and a = 3.81 Å, c = 15.23 Å for (Tl0.5Pb0.5)Sr2Ca2Cu3O9. A structure refinement of the latter phase has been carried out with single-crystal x-ray diffraction data."

Some emerging developments of this new instrumentation are reviewed.
https://openalex.org/W2054938727,"Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are now believed to be major contributors to the seasonal ozone depletion over the Antarctic continent. However, because they are so important to many aspects of Modern society, it would be irresponsible to immediately cease their production. The identification of suitable substitutes is difficult when issues such as toxicity, flammability, cost, environmental impact, and physical properties are considered. Several candidates that meet these criteria have been selected by the industry and significant research and development programs are under way to commercialize them. Unlike the simple, fully halogenated CFCs, which can only be made in the single step, there are many potentially viable routes to the alternatives, but these will require significant improvements in catalysis. Many other important issues such as materials compatibility, energy efficiency, the needs of developing countries, and the product life cycle of the alternatives need to be resolved before a timely transition to substitutes can be accomplished."
https://openalex.org/W2039991526,Measurements of marine carbonate samples indicate that during the past 2.5 million years the (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio of seawater has increased by 14 x 10(-5). The high average rate of increase of (87)Sr/(86)Sr indicates that continental weathering rates were exceptionally high. Nonuniformity in the rate of increase suggests that weathering rates fluctuated by as much as +/-30 percent of present-day values. Some of the observed shifts in weathering rates are contemporaneous with climatic changes inferred from records of oxygen isotopes and carbonate preservation in deep sea sediments.
https://openalex.org/W1989316838,"In the field the chirps of neighboring Mecopoda sp. (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae, and Mecopodinae) males are normally synchronized, but between more distant individuals the chirps are either synchronous or regularly alternating. The phase response to single-stimulus chirps depends on both the phase and the intensity of the stimulus. Iteration of the Poincaré map of the phase response predicts a variety of phase-locked synchronization regimes, including period-doubling bifurcations, in close agreement with experimental observations. The versatile acoustic behavior of Mecopoda encompasses most of the phenomena found in other synchronizing insects and thus provides a general model of insect synchronization behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2023037692,"DC and RF Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) fabricated from low transition temperature (T(c)) superconductors and operated at liquid (4)He temperatures are routinely used as ultrasensitive detectors in many applications, for example, as magnetometers, magnetic gradiometers, voltmeters, and motion detectors. SQUIDs fabricated from high T(c) superconductors such as YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) and operated in liquid nitrogen at 77 K offer a greater convenience in operation at the expense of a poorer noise performance, particularly at low frequencies. The resolution of SQUID-based magnetometers is compared with that of other types of magnetometers operatng at ambient temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2007253834,Paleomagnetic data from 89 equatorial deep-sea sediment cores indicate that the configuration of the time-averaged geomagnetic field depends strongly on polarity state but that it remains within 1 degree of axial symmetry throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene (last 5 million years). The relative magnitude of the nondipole field was greater by almost a factor of 2 during reverse than during normal polarity intervals. These results thus support earlier suggestions that there may be a standing (nonreversing) component of the geomagnetic dynamo.

https://openalex.org/W2001041833,"The discovery of the Z boson 7 years ago verified a key prediction of the unified theory of electromagnetic and weak forces. Today an experimental program is beginning at two electron-positron colliders to study the properties of the Z particle in great detail. The data accumulated will subject the unified theory to more rigorous tests and will probe with great sensitivity for new physics not encompassed by the existing standard model of the elementary particles and forces. Questions under study include the number of quark and lepton families, the mass of the still undiscovered top quark, and the search for the still unknown fifth force of nature required by the theory to generate the masses of the elementary particles."
