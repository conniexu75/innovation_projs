https://openalex.org/W3032345781,"Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and often persistent musculoskeletal disorder affecting both athletic and non-athletic populations. Despite the relatively high incidence there is little insight into the impact and perceptions of tendinopathy from the individual's perspective. Increased awareness of the impact and perceptions around individuals' experiences with Achilles tendinopathy may provide crucial insights for the management of what is often a complex, persistent, and disabling MSK disorder.To qualitatively explore the lived experiences of individuals with AT.A qualitative, interpretive description design was performed using semi-structured telephone interviews.Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 15 participants (8 male and 7 female) with AT. Thematic analysis was performed using the guidelines laid out by Braun and Clarke. The study has been reported in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist.Four main themes were identified from the data: 1) beliefs and perceptions surrounding AT: ""If I'm over training or something, I don't really know"", 2) the biopsychosocial impact of AT: ""I think it restricts me in a lot of things that I would be able to do"", 3) individuals' experiences with the management process: ""You want it to happen now. You're doing all this stuff and it's just very slow progress"", and 4) future prognosis and outlook in individuals with AT: ""I see myself better"".This study offers a unique insight into the profound impact and consequences of Achilles tendinopathy in a mixed sample of both athletic and non-athletic individuals. The findings of this study have important clinical implications. Specifically, it highlights the need for clinicians to recognize and adopt treatment approaches to embrace a more biopsychosocial approach for the management of tendinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3032726692,"Insulin resistance (IR) disrupts ovarian functions in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The contributing factors remains elusive. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, has been shown to be related to IR and autophagy, respectively, in peripheral tissues. Here, we investigated whether increased HMGB1 contributes to IR in granulosa cells of PCOS patients via induction of aberrant autophagy. Results showed that HMGB1 abundance in the follicular fluid was significantly increased with enhanced autophagy in granulosa cells in PCOS patients with IR. HMGB1 exacerbated autophagy in granulosa cells as evinced by increased LC3B II/I ratio and ATG7 as well as decreased p62, the markers for autophagy. Concurrently, HMGB1 impaired insulin sensitivities by attenuating the abundance of insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake in granulosa cells, which were reversed by blocking autophagy pathways with siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7 or with chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, the lysosome inhibitors. In conclusion, our results indicate that increased HMGB1 contributes to IR development in granulosa cells of PCOS patients, which is associated with exacerbation of autophagy by HMGB1. Control of HMGB1 production may be benefical for the improvement of insulin sensitivity in granulosa cells in PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W3029427039,"Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology precedes symptoms and its detection can identify at-risk individuals who may benefit from early treatment. Since the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) is depleted in established AD, we tested whether its thickness can predict whether cognitively healthy (CH) individuals have a normal or pathological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß42 (A) and tau (T) ratio. Methods As part of an ongoing longitudinal study, we enrolled CH individuals, excluding those with cognitive impairment and significant ocular pathology. We classified the CH group into two sub-groups, normal (CH-NAT, n = 16) or pathological (CH-PAT, n = 27), using a logistic regression model from the CSF AT ratio that identified >85% of patients with a clinically probable AD diagnosis. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) was acquired for RNFL, ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL), and macular thickness. Group differences were tested using mixed model repeated measures and a classification model derived using multiple logistic regression. Results Mean age (± standard deviation) in the CH-PAT group (n = 27; 75.2 ± 8.4 years) was similar (p = 0.50) to the CH-NAT group (n = 16; 74.1 ± 7.9 years). Mean RNFL (standard error) was thinner in the CH-PAT group by 9.8 (2.7) μm; p < 0.001. RNFL thickness classified CH-NAT vs. CH-PAT with 87% sensitivity and 56.3% specificity. Conclusions Our retinal data predict which individuals have CSF biomarkers of AD pathology before cognitive deficits are detectable with 87% sensitivity. Such results from easy-to-acquire, objective and non-invasive measurements of the RNFL merit further study of OCT technology to monitor or screen for early AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3029123495,"Health literacy (HL) and patient activation (PA) are necessary foundations to engage patients in self-management intervention. Each concept plays a unique role in improving access to the effective self-management of chronic disease. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the levels and determinants of HL and PA among the multi-morbid COPD patients in Nepal.We conducted interviews with a simple random sample of 238 multi-morbid COPD people from July 2018 to January 2019. The questionnaire included sociodemographic profiles, five domains of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM) and patient's illness perception by Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations.Most people with COPD had low health levels across each of the five domains of the HLQ. The proportion of people with low literacy level across each of the domains was: (i) feeling understood and supported by healthcare providers (79.0%), (ii) having sufficient information to manage my own health (76.5%), (iii) social support for health (77.3%), (iv) ability to find the good health information (75.2%), and (v) understand the health information well enough to know what to do (74.8%), respectively. The majority of patients also reported low levels of patient activation (level 1: 81.5%; level 2: 11.8%), with only 6.7% (level 3: 5%; level 4: 1.7%) reported higher patient activation level. We found significant associations between poor HL levels in the HLQ domains and having no education, being female or from Indigenous and Dalits communities, and having a monthly family income of less than USD176. Having no education and poor illness perception were significantly associated with poor activation level on PAM scale.A high proportion of multi-morbid COPD peoples had low levels of HL and were less activated than what would be required to self-manage COPD. These were in turn associated with socioeconomic factors and poor illness perception. The findings from this study are being used to design a COPD self-management program tailored to the low health literate population."
https://openalex.org/W3031018248,"Businesses in the smart home sector are actively promoting the benefits of smart home technologies for consumers, such as convenience, economy and home security. To better understand meanings of and trust in the smart home, we carried out a nationally representative survey of UK consumers designed to measure adoption and acceptability, focusing on awareness, ownership, experience, trust, satisfaction and intention to use. We analysed the results using theories of meanings and acceptability of technologies including semiotics, social construction of technology (SCOT) and sociotechnical affordance. Our findings suggest that the meaning and value proposition of the smart home have not yet achieved closure for consumers, but is already foregrounding risks to privacy and security amongst the other meaning-making possibilities it could afford. Anxiety about the likelihood of a security incident emerges as a prominent factor influencing adoption of smart home technology. This factor negatively impacts adoption. These findings underline how businesses and policymakers will need to work together to act on the sociotechnical affordances of smart home technology in order to increase consumers’ trust. This intervention is necessary if barriers to adoption and acceptability of the smart home are to be addressed now and in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3031503105,"Traumatic injuries affect approximately 978 million people worldwide with 56.2 million requiring inpatient care. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) can be useful in predicting outcome following trauma, however the reliability of multiple QST including temporal summation (TS), heat and cold pain thresholds (HPT, CPT) and pressure pain thresholds (PPT) is unknown. We assessed intra (between day) and inter-rater (within day) reliability of QST in asymptomatic participants (n = 21), and inter-rater (within day) reliability in participants presenting with acute musculoskeletal trauma (n = 25). Intra-class correlations with 95% confidence intervals (ICC 3,2), standard error of measurement (SEM) and Bland Altman Plots for limits of agreement were calculated. For asymptomatic participants, reliability was good to excellent for HPT (ICC range 0.76–0.95), moderate to good for PPT (ICC range 0.52–0.93), with one site rated poor (ICC 0.41), and poor to excellent for TS scores (ICC range 0.20–0.91). For musculoskeletal trauma participants reliability was good to excellent for HPT and PPT (ICC range 0.76–0.86), and moderate to good reliability for TS (ICC range 0.69–0.91). SEM for HPT for both sets of participants was ~1°C and an average of 7N for asymptomatic participants and less than 8N for acute musculoskeletal trauma participants for PPT. This study demonstrates moderate to excellent intra and inter-rater reliability for HPT and PPT in asymptomatic participants and good to excellent inter-rater reliability for acute musculoskeletal trauma participants, with TS showing more variability for both sets of participants. This study provides foundations for future work evaluating the sensory function over time following acute musculoskeletal trauma."
https://openalex.org/W3028830395,"For many pathological states, microparticles are supposed to be one of the causes of hypercoagulation. Although there are some indirect data about microparticles participation in coagulation activation and propagation, the integral hemostasis test Thrombodynamics allows to measure micropaticles participation in these two coagulation phases directly. Demonstrates microparticles participation in coagulation activation by influence on the appearance of coagulation centres in the plasma volume and the rate of clot growth from the surface with immobilized tissue factor.Methods: Microparticles were obtained from platelets and erythrocytes by stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (SFLLRN) and calcium ionophore (A23187), respectively, from monocytes, endothelial HUVEC culture and monocytic THP cell culture by stimulation with lipopolysaccharides. Microparticles were counted by flow cytometry and titrated in microparticle-depleted normal plasma in the Thrombodynamics test.Monocyte microparticles induced the appearance of clotting centres through the TF pathway at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than platelet and erythrocyte microparticles, which activated plasma by the contact pathway. For endothelial microparticles, both activation pathways were essential, and their activity was intermediate. Monocyte microparticles induced plasma clotting by the appearance of hundreds of clots with an extremely slow growth rate, while erythrocyte microparticles induced the appearance of a few clots with a growth rate similar to that from surface covered with high-density tissue factor. Patterns of clotting induced by platelet and endothelial microparticles were intermediate. Platelet, erythrocyte and endothelial microparticles impacts on the rate of clot growth from the surface with tissue factor did not differ significantly within the 0-200·103/ul range of microparticles concentrations. However, at concentrations greater than 500·103/ul, erythrocyte microparticles increased the stationary clot growth rate to significantly higher levels than do platelet microparticles or artificial phospholipid vesicles consisting of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine.Microparticles of different origins demonstrated qualitatively different characteristics related to coagulation activation and propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3029475285,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive glial tumor with poor prognosis. Importantly, effective treatment options for glioblastoma are unmet needs. Obesity and low physical activity have been linked with a high risk of cancer, and exercise is related to delayed cancer development and progression. Epidemiological studies have revealed a correlation between exercise and the survival rate of patients with glioblastoma. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its anticancer effects in glioblastoma remain unclear. Here, we found that irisin, an exercise-induced myokine, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased p21 levels in glioblastoma cells, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation. In addition, irisin inhibited glioblastoma cell invasion by upregulating TFPI-2 and even reversed the aggressive tumor phenotype promoted by co-cultivation with cancer-associated adipocytes. Furthermore, irisin retarded xenograft glioblastoma tumor growth, and radiolabeled irisin demonstrated specific tumor-targeting capability in vivo. Therefore, this study identified one potential molecular mechanism by which exercise prevents cancer progression via irisin. Intriguingly, irisin has the potential to be developed as a molecular imaging and therapeutic anticancer agent."
https://openalex.org/W3031843298,"Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) techniques have gained popularity over the last two decades, where data is embedded in an image in such a way that the original image can be restored. Earlier works on RDH was based on the Image Histogram Modification that uses the peak point to embed data in the image. More recent works focus on the Difference Image Histogram Modification that exploits the fact that the neighbouring pixels of an image are highly correlated and therefore the difference of image makes more space to embed large amount of data. In this paper we propose a framework to increase the embedding capacity of reversible data hiding techniques that use a difference of image to embed data. The main idea is that, instead of taking the difference of the neighboring pixels, we rearrange the columns (or rows) of the image in a way that enhances the smooth regions of an image. Any difference based technique to embed data can then be used in the transformed image. The proposed method is applied on different types of images including textures, patterns and publicly available images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only increases the message embedding capacity of a given image by more than 50% but also the visual quality of the marked image containing the message is more than the visual quality obtained by existing state-of-the-art reversible data hiding technique. The proposed technique is also verified by Pixel Difference Histogram (PDH) Stegoanalysis and results demonstrate that marked images generated by proposed method is undetectable by PDH analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3029487906,"Excess evaporation within the Persian (also referred as the Arabian) Gulf induces an inverse-estuary circulation. Surface waters are imported, via the Strait of Hormuz, while saltier waters are exported in the deeper layers. Using output of a 1/12-Degree horizontal resolution ocean general circulation model, the spatial structure and time variability of the circulation and the exchanges of volume and salt through the Strait of Hormuz are investigated in detail. The model’s circulation pattern in the Gulf is found to be in good agreement with observations and other studies based on numerical models. The mean export of salty waters in the bottom layer is of 0.26±0.05Sv (Sverdrup = 1.0 × 106 m3 s−1). The net freshwater import, the equivalent of the salt export divided by a reference salinity, done by the baroclinic circulation across that vertical section is decomposed in an overturning and a horizontal components, with mean values of 7.2±2.1 × 10−3 Sv and 5.0±1.7 × 10−3 Sv respectively. An important, novel finding of this work is that the horizontal component is confined to the deeper layers, mainly in the winter. It is also described for the first time that both components are correlated at the same level with the basin averaged evaporation minus precipitation (E-P) over the Persian Gulf. The highest correlation (r2 = 0.59) of the total freshwater transport across 26°N with E-P over the Gulf is found with a one-month time lag, with E-P leading. The time series of freshwater import does not show any significant trend in the period from 1980 to 2015. Power spectra analysis shows that most of the energy is concentrated in the seasonal cycle. Some intraseasonal variability, likely related to the Shamal wind phenomenon, and possible impacts of El-Nino are also detected. These results suggest that the overturning and the horizontal components of freshwater exchange across the Strait of Hormuz are both driven by dynamic and thermodynamic processes inside the Persian Gulf."
https://openalex.org/W3030226019,"A wide range of anthropogenic structures exist in the marine environment with the extent of these set to increase as the global offshore renewable energy industry grows. Many of these pose acute risks to marine wildlife; for example, tidal energy generators have the potential to injure or kill seals and small cetaceans through collisions with moving turbine parts. Information on fine scale behaviour of animals close to operational turbines is required to understand the likely impact of these new technologies. There are inherent challenges associated with measuring the underwater movements of marine animals which have, so far, limited data collection. Here, we describe the development and application of a system for monitoring the three-dimensional movements of cetaceans in the immediate vicinity of a subsea structure. The system comprises twelve hydrophones and software for the detection and localisation of vocal marine mammals. We present data demonstrating the systems practical performance during a deployment on an operational tidal turbine between October 2017 and October 2019. Three-dimensional locations of cetaceans were derived from the passive acoustic data using time of arrival differences on each hydrophone. Localisation accuracy was assessed with an artificial sound source at known locations and a refined method of error estimation is presented. Calibration trials show that the system can accurately localise sounds to 2m accuracy within 20m of the turbine but that localisations become highly inaccurate at distances greater than 35m. The system is currently being used to provide data on rates of encounters between cetaceans and the turbine and to provide high resolution tracking data for animals close to the turbine. These data can be used to inform stakeholders and regulators on the likely impact of tidal turbines on cetaceans."
https://openalex.org/W3029102984,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by two aggregates, namely, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (tau-p), which are released into the blood in a very small amount and cannot be easily detected. An increasing number of recent studies have suggested that S-glutathionylated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is highly correlated with Aβ in patients with AD and that S-glutathionylated GAPDH plays a role as a proapoptotic factor in AD. We found that S-glutathionylated GAPDH is abundant in the blood of AD patients, which is unusual because S-glutathionylated GAPDH cannot exist in the blood under normal conditions. The aim of this study was to further explore the correlation between the S-glutathionylated GAPDH levels in blood plasma and AD progression. As controls, we recruited 191 people without AD, which included 111 healthy individuals and 37 patients with depression and insomnia, in the psychosomatic clinic. Moreover, 47 patients with AD (aged 40–89 years) were recruited at the neurology clinic. The blood S-glutathionylated GAPDH levels in the AD patients were significantly (p < 0.001) higher (752.7 ± 301.7 ng/dL) than those in the controls (59.92 ± 122.4 ng/dL), irrespective of gender and age. For AD diagnosis, the criterion blood S-glutathionylated GAPDH level > 251.62 ng/dL exhibited 95.74% sensitivity and 92.67% specificity. In fact, the individuals aged 70–89 years, namely, 37 patients from the psychosomatic clinic and 42 healthy individuals, showed significant blood S-glutathionylated GAPDH levels (230.5 ± 79.3 and 8.05 ± 20.51 ng/dL, respectively). This finding might indicate neurodegenerative AD progression in psychosomatic patients and suggests that the degree of neuronal apoptosis during AD progression might be sensitively evaluated based on the level of S-glutathionylated GAPDH in blood."
https://openalex.org/W3029348599,"Follicular atresia is a cell death event that occurs in the great majority of follicles before ovulation in the mature mammalian ovary. Germ cell loss has been mainly associated to apoptosis although autophagy also seems to be at play. Aimed to increase our understanding on the possible cooperating role of autophagy and apoptosis in follicular atresia and/or follicular survival, we analyzed both programmed cell death mechanisms in a rodent model, the South American plains vizcacha, Lagostomus maximus. Female vizcacha shows highly suppressed apoptosis-dependent follicular atresia in the adult ovary, with continuous folliculogenesis and massive polyovulation. This strategy of massive ovulation requires a permanent remodeling of the ovarian architecture to maintain the availability of quiescent primordial follicles throughout the individual's reproductive lifespan. We report here our analysis of autophagy (BECN1, LAMP1 and LC3B-I/II) and apoptosis (BCL2 and ACTIVE CASPASE-3) markers which revealed interactive behaviors between both processes, with autophagy promoting survival or cell death depending on the ovarian structure. Strong BECN1, LC3B-II and LAMP1 staining was observed in atretic follicles and degenerating corpora lutea that also expressed nuclear ACTIVE CASPASE-3. Healthy follicles showed a slight expression of autophagy proteins but a strong expression of BCL2 and no detectable ACTIVE CASPASE-3. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a high formation of autophagosomes, autolysosomes and lysosomes in atretic follicles and degenerating corpora lutea and a low number of autophagic vesicles in normal follicles. The co-expression of LC3B-BECN1, LC3B-LAMP1 and LC3B-ACTIVE CASPASE-3 was only detected in atretic follicles and degenerating corpora lutea, while co-expression of BCL2-BECN1 was only observed in normal follicles. We propose that autophagy could act as a mechanism to eliminate altered follicles and remnant corpora lutea providing the necessary space for maturation of primordial follicles that continuously enter the growing follicular pool to sustain massive ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W3031052759,"Low temperature is one of the abiotic factors limiting germination, growth and distribution of the plant in current plant-products industry, especially for the tropical vegetables in non-tropical area or other fields under cold temperature. Screening the plant with ability against cold temperature captured worldwide attention and exerted great importance. In our previous work, the anti-cold specie of Momordica Charantia L. seedlings was screened out. Yet, the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying this adaptive process still remain unknown. This study was aimed to investigate adaption mechanism of anti-cold species of Momordica Charantia L. seedlings in genetical and metabolomics levels. Two species, cold-susceptible group (Y17) and cold-resistant group (Y54), were evaluated containing the indexes of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), proline content, activities of antioxidant enzymes, metabolites changes and genes differentiation in plant tissues after cold treatment. It found that low temperature stress resulted in increased accumulation of MDA, H2O2 and proline content in two species, but less expressions in cold-resistant species Y54. As compared to Y17, cold-resistant species Y54 presented significantly enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities of POD (peroxidase), CAT (cataalase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase). Meanwhile, higher expressed genes encoded antioxidant enzymes and transcription factors when exposure to the low temperature were found in cold-resistant species Y54, and core genes were explored by Q-PCR validation, including McSOD1, McPDC1 and McCHS1. Moreover, plant metabolites containing amino acid, sugar, fatty acid and organic acid in Y54 were higher than Y17, indicating their important roles in cold acclimation. Meanwhile, initial metabolites, including amimo acids, polypeptides, sugars, organic acids and nucleobases, were apparently increased in cold resistant species Y54 than cold susceptible species Y17. Our results demonstrated that the Momordica Charantia L. seedlings achieved cold tolerance might be went through mobilization of antioxidant systems, adjustment of the transcription factors and accumulation of osmoregulation substance. This work presented meaning information for revealing the anti-cold mechanism of the Momordica Charantia L. seedlings and newsight for further screening of anti-cold species in other plant."
https://openalex.org/W3031068760,"In Ghana, the care needs of older adults in the later years has become a critical issue given population ageing and increased proportions of older adults with difficulties with functional abilities. However, factors related to caregiver availability is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine how the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) framework relates to caregiver availability for community-dwelling older adults in Ghana. This evidence will strengthen our understanding of the perceived unmet care needs of older adults in Ghana in Africa.A hospital-based survey was conducted among 400 consecutively recruited older adult in-patients using a questionnaire at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in southern Ghana. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between caregiver availability and other factors as related to the WHO-ICF conceptual framework.Eighty-six per cent of the participants reported having an available caregiver. In the final parsimonious model, the environmental factors were highly related to caregiver availability, seconded by personal factors, and then health conditions. Body function and structure, activity, and participation variables were not statistically significant. Overall, the variables that were associated with caregiver availability were age, being a widow, having a single chronic condition, being hardly understood by friends and family, receiving no neighbourhood support, and having 2-4 children. Interaction existed between being a widow and living as a couple in relation to caregiver availability.Caregiver availability is associated with variables under the personal, health and environmental components of the WHO-ICF. Increased effort to strengthen the current and future welfare programs, including the health of older adults and their caregivers is relevant."
https://openalex.org/W3031659829,"Objectives Little is known about the 12-month prevalence of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and to what extent the type of PTE is a risk factor for post-event lack of social support. In addition, it is largely unknown if pre-event mental health problems and loneliness, and demographics are risk factors for a lack of support. Aim of the present prospective study is to fill these gaps in evidence-based knowledge. Methods A survey was conducted among a large random sample of the Dutch adult population (i.e. the longitudinal LISS panel) in March-April 2018, and linked with pre-event mental health and loneliness data from surveys conducted in 2016 (n = 5,879). We distinguished four forms of perceived social support: emotional and esteem support, and social recognition and general disapproval. Results Loss of a significant other and/or colleague (28%) was the most prevalent 12-month PTE. The 12-month prevalence of violence, accidents and/or, and theft-related events was 13%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed no differences in lack of emotional and esteem support, or in lack of recognition across non-death PTEs and death-related PTEs. However, victims of threat and physical (sexual) violence more often faced disapproval than those affected by burglary and accidents. Results furthermore showed that pre-event mental health problems, pre-event loneliness and stress during the PTE were important independent predictors of forms of support and acknowledgment. Affected individuals with a non-Western background more often lacked support and acknowledgment. Conclusions Many adults are confronted with a PTE during a year. In general, pre-event factors and stress during the event are better predictors of a perceived lack of support and acknowledgment than type of event. Early screening programs should especially assess pre-event mental health and loneliness, besides levels of stress during the event, to identify affected people who are at risk for a lack of social support and acknowledgment."
https://openalex.org/W3031176929,"Obtaining a nutrient-rich diet during pregnancy is a challenge for pregnant women living in low-income countries. This randomized, controlled trial was designed to determine if a freshly prepared food supplement from local animal-source foods and dark-green leafy vegetables given prior to and/or during pregnancy improved birth outcomes in rural Vietnamese women. Primiparous women, 18 to 30 years of age, who participated in the study were assigned to one of three groups: PC-T women received the supplement from pre-conception to term, MG-T women received the supplement from mid-gestation to term, and the RPC women received routine prenatal care. Supplement intake was observed and quantified. Infant anthropometry was measured at birth and/or within seven days of delivery. The effect of the intervention on maternal and birth outcomes was determined using linear regression modeling. Of the 460 women enrolled in the study, 317 women completed the study. Those not completing the study had either moved from the area, did not conceive within 12 months of study enrollment, or miscarried. The food-based supplement increased protein, iron, zinc, folate, vitamin A and B12 intakes in the PC-T and the MG-T groups. However, it failed to alter infant anthropometric measurements at birth. In the entire cohort, maternal gestational weight gain was greater in women with a low pre-pregnancy BMI (<18.5) and in women with a higher educational attainment. Working as a farmer reduced gestational weight gain but it did not affect birth weight or length. In summary, a nutrient-rich, food-based supplement given to rural Vietnamese women from pre-conception to term or mid-gestation to term did not affect maternal or infant outcomes. The low weight gains, possibly due to demanding farm work done throughout the reproductive cycle, may have obviated any effects of the low energy, nutrient-rich food supplement on birth outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W3031717840,"The general objective of this study is to analyze student satisfaction with the use of virtual campuses in university teaching in order to discover the main variables influencing the overall online teaching-learning process that give quality to the virtual educational process. To this end, an ex-post-facto research methodology was applied to 1084 university students, who completed an ad hoc designed questionnaire, which allowed us to carry out descriptive analysis, classification trees and fuzzy inference systems using SPSS and Matlab software. The results suggest that four variables predominantly influence the quality of the teaching-learning processes in virtual campuses: satisfactory teacher responses to student questions and observations, the positive attitude of teachers towards the use of information and communication technologies, students having appropriate digital skills, and activities that encourage ideas and debate."
https://openalex.org/W3031739360,"Evolutionary studies have been conducted that have investigated the chromosomal variance in the genus of Chlamydia. However, no all-encompassing genus-wide comparison has been performed on the plasmid. Therefore, there is a gap in the current knowledge on Chlamydia plasmid diversity.This project is aimed to investigate and establish the nature and extent of diversity across the entire genus of Chlamydia, by comparing the sequences of all currently available plasmid carrying strains.The PUBMED database was used to identify plasmid sequences from all available strains that met the set quality criteria for their inclusion in the study. Alignments were performed on the 51 strains that fulfilled the criteria using MEGA X software. Following that Maximum Likelihood estimation was used to construct 11 phylogenetic trees of the whole plasmid sequence, the individual 8 coding sequences, the iteron and a chromosomal gene ompA as a comparator.The genus-wide plasmid phylogeny produced three distinct lineages labelled as alpha, beta and gamma. Nineteen genotypes were found in the initial whole plasmid analysis. Their distribution was allocated as six C. pecorum, two C. pneumoniae, one C. gallinacea, one C. avium, one C. caviae, one C. felis, two C. psittaci, one C. trachomatis, one C. muridarum, and two C. suis. The chromosomal comparative gene ompA supported this distribution, with the same number of primary clades with the same species distribution. However, ompA sequence comparison resulted in fewer genotypes due to a reduced amount of available sequences (33 out of 51). All results were statistically significant.The results of this study indicate that the common bacterial ancestor of all the species had a plasmid, which has diverged over time. Moreover, it suggests that there is a strong evolutionary selection towards these species retaining their plasmids due to its high level of conservation across the genus, with the notable exception of C. pneumoniae. Furthermore, the evolutionary analysis showed that the plasmid and the chromosome have co-evolved."
https://openalex.org/W3028896591,"The genus Rubus L. (Rosaceae) not been investigated satisfactorily in terms of palynology. This genus is taxonomically very difficult due to the large number of species and problems with their delimitation, as well as very different distribution areas of particular species. The aim of this study was to investigate pollen morphology and for the first time the ranges of intrageneric and interspecific variability of Rubus species, as well as verify the taxonomic usefulness of these traits in distinguishing studied taxa from this genus. The selected species of the genus Rubus were analysed for 11 quantitative pollen characteristics and the following qualitative ones: exine ornamentation, pollen outline and shape, as well as bridge structure. Analyses were conducted on a total of 1740 pollen grains, which represent 58 blackberry species belonging to a majority of subgenera and all the sections and series found in Poland. The most important characters included exine ornamentation (exine ornamentation type, width and direction of grooves and striae, number and diameter of perforations) and length of the polar axis (P). The arrangement of the examined species on the dendrogram does not corroborate division of the genus Rubus into subgenera, sections and series currently adopted in taxonomy. This fact is not surprising because the taxonomy of the genus was not based on pollen characters. Pollen features should be treated in taxonomy as auxiliary, because they fail to differentiate several (10) individual species, while the other ones create groups with similar pollen traits."

Bacterial isolates analyzed in this study were 42 multidrug resistant E. coli isolated from stool samples from both humans (n = 30) and cattle (n = 12) in pastoralist communities collected between January 2018-March 2019. Most of the isolates (41/42) were resistant to three or more antibiotics (multi-drug resistant) and 21/42 isolates were ESBL producers; 13/30 from human and 8/12 from cattle. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was carried out at the facilities of Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome trust, Kilifi, to determine the phylogenomic changes, virulence and resistant genes. Results At household level, the genomes from both human and animals clustered away from one another except for one instance where two human isolates from the same household clustered together. However, 67% of the E. coli isolated from cattle were closely related to those found in humans. The E. coli isolates were assigned to eight different phylogroups: A, B1, B2, Cladel, D, E, F and G, with a majority being assigned to phylogroup A; while most of the animal isolates were assigned to phylogroup B1. The carriage of multiple AMR genes was higher from the E. coli population from humans than those from cattle. Among these were Beta-lactamase; blaOXA-1: Class D beta-lactamases; blaTEM-1, blaTEM-235: Beta-lactamase; catA1: chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; cmlA1: chloramphenicol efflux transporter; dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA14, dfrA15, dfrA17, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA8: macrolide phosphotransferase; oqxB11: RND efflux pump conferring resistance to fluoroquinolone; qacL, qacEdelta1: quinolone efflux pump; qnrS1: quinolone resistance gene; sul1, sul2, sul3: sulfonamide resistant; tet(A), tet(B): tetracycline efflux pump. A high variation of virulence genes was registered among the E. coli genomes from humans than those of cattle origin. Conclusion From the analysis of the core genome and phenotypic resistance, this study has demonstrated that the E. coli of human origin and those of cattle origin may have a common ancestry. Limited sharing of virulence genes presents a challenge to the notion that AMR in humans is as a result of antibiotic use in the farm and distorts the picture of the directionality of transmission of AMR at a human-animal interface and presents a task of exploring alternative routes of transmission of AMR."
https://openalex.org/W3031786348,"The importance of dietary lipids in male reproduction are not as well understood as in females, in which dietary lipids, such as phospholipids (PL) and associated fatty acids (FA), are important structural components of the eggs and provide energy for their offspring. In mammals, lipids are suggested to be important for spermatogenesis and to structural components of the spermatozoa that could improve fertilization rates. New knowledge of how lipids affect sexual maturation in male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), an important global aquaculture species, could provide tools to delay maturation and/or improve reproductive success. Therefore, changes in testicular composition of lipids and gene transcripts associated with spermatogenesis and lipid metabolism were studied in sexually maturing male salmon compared to immature males and females. An increase in total testis content of FA and PL, and a shift to higher PL composition was observed in maturing males, concomitant with increases in mRNA levels for genes involved in spermatogenesis, FA uptake and synthesis, and production of long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and PL. A particularly interesting finding was elevated testis expression of acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (acsl4), and acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (acot2), critical enzymes that regulate intra-mitochondrial levels of 20:4n-6 FA (arachidonic acid), which have been associated with improved cholesterol transport during steroidogenesis. This suggested that FA may have direct effects on sex steroid production in salmon. Furthermore, we observed increased testis expression of genes for endogenous synthesis of 16:0 and elongation/desaturation to 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid) in sexually maturing males relative to immature fish. Both of these FA are important structural components of the PL, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and were elevated concomitant with increases in the content of phosphatidic acid, an important precursor for PC, in maturing males compared to immature fish. Overall, this study suggests that, similar to mammals, lipids are important to spermatogenesis and serve as structural components during testicular growth and maturation in Atlantic salmon."
https://openalex.org/W3029860241,"The surge in the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria in poultry is a global concern as it may pose an extended threat to humans and animal health. The present study aimed to investigate the colonization proportion of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE and CPE, respectively) in the gut of healthy poultry, Gallus gallus domesticus in Kaski district of Western Nepal. Total, 113 pooled rectal swab specimens from 66 private household farms and 47 commercial poultry farms were collected by systematic random sampling from the Kaski district in western Nepal. Out of 113 pooled samples, 19 (28.8%) samples from 66 backyard farms, and 15 (31.9%) from 47 commercial broiler farms were positive for EPE. Of the 38 EPE strains isolated from 34 ESBL positive rectal swabs, 31(81.6%) were identified as Escherichia coli, five as Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), and one each isolate of Enterobacter species and Citrobacter species (2.6%). Based on genotyping, 35/38 examined EPE strains (92.1%) were phylogroup-1 positive, and all these 35 strains (100%) had the CTX-M-15 gene and strains from phylogroup-2, and 9 were of CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-14, respectively. Among 38 ESBL positive isolates, 9 (23.7%) were Ambler class C (Amp C) co-producers, predominant were of DHA, followed by CIT genes. Two (6.5%) E. coli strains of ST131 belonged to clade C, rest 29/31 (93.5%) were non-ST131 E. coli. None of the isolates produced carbapenemase. Twenty isolates (52.6%) were in-vitro biofilm producers. Univariate analysis showed that the odd of ESBL carriage among commercial broilers were 1.160 times (95% CI 0.515, 2.613) higher than organically fed backyard flocks. This is the first study in Nepal, demonstrating the EPE colonization proportion, genotypes, and prevalence of high-risk clone E. coli ST131 among gut flora of healthy poultry. Our data indicated that CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL enzyme, mainly associated with E. coli belonging to non-ST131clones and the absence of carbapenemases."
https://openalex.org/W2948346099,"Studies on improving the adaptability of upper limb rehabilitation training do not often consider the implications of muscle fatigue sufficiently. In this study, electromyogram features were used as fatigue indicators in the context of human-robot interaction. They were utilised for auto-adaptation of the task difficulty, which resulted in a prolonged training interaction. The electromyogram data was collected from three gross-muscles of the upper limb in 30 healthy participants. The experiment followed a protocol for increasing the muscle strength by progressive strength training, that was an implementation of a known method in sports science for muscle training, in a new domain of robotic adaptation in muscle training. The study also compared how the participants in three experimental conditions perceived the change in task difficulty levels. One task benefitted from robotic adaptation (Intervention group) where the robot adjusted the task difficulty. The other two tasks were control groups 1 and 2. There was no difficulty adjustment at all in Control 1 group and the difficulty was adjusted manually in Control 2 group. The results indicated that the participants could perform a prolonged progressive strength training exercise with more repetitions with the help of a fatigue-based robotic adaptation, compared to the training interactions, which were based on manual/no adaptation. This study showed that it is possible to alter the level of the challenge using fatigue indicators, and thus, increase the interaction time. The results of the study are expected to be extended to stroke patients in the future by utilising the potential for adapting the training difficulty according to the patient’s muscular state, and also to have a large number repetitions in a robot-assisted training environment."
https://openalex.org/W3029013940,"Vector-borne diseases are a public health problem in Colombia, where dengue virus infection is hyperendemic. The introduction of other arboviruses, such as chikungunya and Zika in the last three years, has aggravated the situation. Mobile health (mHealth) offers new strategies for strengthening health care and surveillance systems promoting the collection, delivery, and access of health information to professionals, researchers, and patients. Assessing mobile application performance has been a challenge in low- and middle-income countries due to the difficulty of implementing these technologies in different clinical settings. In this study, we evaluate the usability and acceptability of a mobile application, FeverDX, as a support tool in the management of patients with febrile syndrome and suspected arboviruses infection by general practitioners from Colombia.A pilot implementation study was conducted to evaluate the usability and acceptability of FeverDX using the modified version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). The evaluation form included 25 questions regarding quantity and quality of information, engagement, functionality, aesthetics, impact, and acceptability by healthcare workers. Each item uses a 5-point scale (1-Inadequate, 2-Poor, 3-Acceptable, 4-Good, 5-Excellent). A global score was obtained for the evaluation form test by determining the median scores of each subsection. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data obtained was performed.Between December 2016 and January 2017, a total of 20 general practitioners from the Emergency room and hospitalization areas evaluated FeverDX. Less than half (9/20) of the evaluators had a comprehensive knowledge of the Colombian Ministry of Health's guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arboviruses, and evaluators partially (4/9) or completely (5/9) agreed that the content of the application follows the management guidelines. On uMARS scale, FeverDX excelled regarding impact (median 5; IQR = 5-5), functionality (median 5; IQR = 4.8-5), and information and scientific basis (median 4; IQR = 4-4). FeverDX scored well regarding user feedback (median 4; IQR = 4-4.5), design and aesthetics (median 4; IQR = 4-4.3), and subjective assessment of quality (median 4.5; IQR = 4.3-4.8).FeverDX, a mobile application, is a novel mHealth strategy to strengthen care processes and facilitate the detection and reporting of notifiable surveillance diseases. It could improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines for the management and prevention of prevalent diseases as arboviruses in healthcare settings. Although this pilot study used a small sample size, FeverDx performed adequately in a simulated emergency consultation. Further implementation studies are needed to increase the reliability of mHealth technologies in different scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3030277519,"The LiDAR technology is a means of urban 3D modeling in recent years, and the extraction of buildings is a key step in urban 3D modeling. In view of the complexity of most airborne LiDAR building point cloud extraction algorithms that need to combine multiple feature parameters, this study proposes a building point cloud extraction method based on the combination of the Point Cloud Library (PCL) region growth segmentation and the histogram. The filtered LiDAR point cloud is segmented by using the PCL region growth method, and then the local normal vector and direction cosine are calculated for each cluster after segmentation. Finally, the histogram is generated to effectively separate the building point cloud from the non-building.Two sets of airborne LiDAR data in the south and west parts of Tokushima, Japan, are used to test the feasibility of the proposed method. The results are compared with those of the commercial software TerraSolid and the K-means algorithm. Results show that the proposed extraction algorithm has lower type I and II errors and better extraction effect than that of the TerraSolid and the K-means algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3030368974,"MicroRNAs have been reported to play a role in adipogenesis and obesity. This study was performed to investigate the role of miR-196b-5p in adipogenesis and the mechanism involved. The data revealed that miR-196b-5p expression increased in primary or established marrow stromal progenitor cells after adipogenic treatment. Supplementing miR-196b-5p in the progenitor cells stimulated adipogenic differentiation and lipogenesis, along with the induction of adipogenic and lipogenic factors. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-196b-5p blocked adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) and transforming growth factor-β receptor 1 (TGFBR1) were demonstrated to be the direct target genes of miR-196b-5p. Supplementing miR-196b-5p activity in progenitor cells reduced the protein level of TSC1 and activated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. We further demonstrated that the perturbation of TSC1 in progenitor cells altered the trend of adipogenic differentiation and lipogenesis. Overexpression of Tsc1 or inactivation of mTORC1 signaling attenuated the stimulation of adipogenic differentiation and lipogenesis by miR-196b-5p. Overexpression of Tgfbr1 also partially blocked the adipogenic effect of miR-196b-5p. Further investigations demonstrated that zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcriptionally upregulated miR-196b-5p expression. The current study suggests that miR-196b-5p promotes adipogenic differentiation and lipogenesis in progenitor cells through targeting TSC1 and TGFBR1 and therefore regulating mTORC1 and TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3030666147,"Background Kenya’s guidelines for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) recommend routine viral load (VL) monitoring for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Method We assessed PMTCT VL monitoring and clinical action occurring between last menstrual period (LMP) and 6 months postpartum at 4 Kenyan government hospitals. Pregnant women enrolled in the HIV Infant Tracking System from May 2016-March 2018 were included. We computed proportions who received VL testing within recommended timeframes and who received clinical action after unsuppressed VL result. Results Of 424 participants, any VL testing was documented for 305 (72%) women and repeat VL testing was documented for 79 (19%). Only 115 women (27%) received a guideline-adherent baseline VL test and 27 (6%) received a guideline-adherent baseline and repeat VL test sequence. Return of baseline and repeat VL test results to the facility was high (average 96%), but patient notification of VL results was low (36% baseline and 49% repeat). Clinical action for unsuppressed VL results was even lower: 11 of 38 (29%) unsuppressed baseline results and 2 of 14 (14%) unsuppressed repeat results triggered clinical action. Discussion Guideline-adherent VL testing and clinical intervention during PMTCT must be prioritized to improve maternal care and reduce the risk of HIV transmission to infants."
https://openalex.org/W3030888518,"Objective The aim of this project was to determine revenues and costs over time to assess the sustainability of the Baby Bridge program. Methods The Baby Bridge program was developed to promote timely, consistent and high quality early therapy services for high-risk infants following neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge. Key features of the Baby Bridge program were defined as: 1) having the therapist establish rapport with the family while in the NICU, 2) scheduling the first home visit within one week of discharge and continuing weekly visits until other services commence, 3) conducting comprehensive assessments to inform targeted interventions by a skilled, single provider, and 4) using a comprehensive therapeutic approach while collaborating with the NICU medical team and community therapy providers. The Baby Bridge program was implemented with infants hospitalized in an urban Level IV NICU from January 2016 to January 2018. The number of infants enrolled increased gradually over the first several months to reach the case-load capacity associated with one full-time therapist by mid-2017. Costs of the therapists delivering Baby Bridge services, travel, and equipment were tracked and compared with claim records of participants. The operational cost of Baby Bridge programming at capacity was estimated based on the completed and anticipated claims and reimbursement of therapy services as a means to inform possible scale-ups of the program. Results In 2016, the first year of programming, the Baby Bridge program experienced a loss of $26,460, with revenue to the program totaling $11,138 and expenses totaling $37,598. In 2017, the Baby Bridge program experienced a net positive income of $2,969, with revenues to the program totaling $53,989 and expenses totaling $51,020. By Spring 2017, 16 months after initiating Baby Bridge programming, program revenue began to exceed cost. It is projected that cumulative revenue would have exceeded cumulative costs by January 2019, 3 years following implementation. Net annual program income, once scaled up to capacity, would be approximately $16,308. Discussion There were initial losses during phase-in of Baby Bridge programming associated with operating far below capacity, yet the program achieved sustainability within 16 months of implementation. These costs related to implementation do not consider the potential cost reduction due to mitigated health burden for the community and families, particularly due to earlier receipt of therapy services, which is an important area for further inquiry."
https://openalex.org/W3031085132,"Previous studies have indicated that the amino acid at position 333 in the glycoprotein (G) is closely related to rabies virus (RABV) pathogenicity. However, whether there are other amino acid residues in G that relate to pathogenicity remain unclear. The aim of this study is to find new amino acid residues in G that could strongly reduce RABV pathogenicity. The present study found that the pathogenicity of a virulent strain was strongly attenuated when the amino acid glycine (Gly) replaced the aspartic acid (Asp) at position 255 in G (D255G) as intracranial (i.c.) infection with this D255G mutant virus did not cause death in adult mice. The indexes of neurotropism of the D255G mutant strain and the parent GD-SH-01 are 0.72 and 10.0, respectively, which indicate that the D255G mutation decreased the neurotropism of RABV. In addition, the D255G mutation significantly decreased RABV replication in the mouse brain. Furthermore, the D255G mutation enhanced the immune response in mice, which contributed to the clearance of RABV after infection. The Asp255 → Gly255 mutation was genetically stable in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we describe a new referenced amino acid site in G that relates to the pathogenicity of RABV."

Our aim was to assess whether second trimester serum inhibin A was associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods We investigated the serum levels of Inhibin A during the second trimester in pregnancy, and analyzed associations between the Inhibin A and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. 12,124 pregnant women were enrolled in this study between January 2017 and July 2019 at the Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the relative risk between Inhibin A and adverse pregnancy outcome. Results Compared with the group without adverse pregnancy outcome, during the second trimester of pregnancy, age and Inhibin A were risk factors for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus and preterm delivery; Inhibin A was risk factors for low birth weight. Gravidity and Inhibin A were risk factors for macrosomia; while parity was a protective factor against pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension and low birth weight. Conclusion Elevated Inhibin A levels in pregnancy are significantly associated with pre-eclampsia, GDM, macrosomia, low birth weight and preterm delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3031772600,"Organ temperature and variation therein plays a key role in plant functioning and its responses to e.g. climate change. There is a strong feedback between organ, especially leaf, temperature and the climate within the canopy (canopy climate), which in turn interacts with the climate outside the canopy (ambient climate). For greenhouses, the determinants of this interplay and how they drive differences between canopy and ambient climate are poorly understood. Yet, as many experiments on both regular greenhouse crops and field crops are done in greenhouses, this is crucial to know. Therefore, we designed an experiment to quantify the differences between ambient and canopy climate and leaf temperature. A path analysis was performed to quantify the interactions between components of the greenhouse canopy-climate system. We found that with high radiation the canopy climate can be up to 5°C cooler than the ambient climate, while for cloudy days this was only 2°C. Canopy relative humidity (RH) was up to 25% higher compared to ambient RH. We showed that radiation is very important for these climate differences, but that this effect could be partly counteracted by turning off supplementary light (i.e. due to its indirect effects e.g. changing light distribution). Leaf temperature was substantially different, both higher and lower, from the canopy air temperature. This difference was determined by leaf area index (LAI), temperature of the heating pipe and the use of supplementary light, which all strongly influence radiation, either shortwave or thermal radiation. The difference between leaf and ambient air temperature could be decreased by decreasing the LAI or increasing the temperature of the heating pipe."
https://openalex.org/W3031964052,"To determine own upright body orientation the brain creates a sense of verticality by a combination of multisensory inputs. To test whether this process is affected by aging, we placed younger and older adults on a motion platform and systematically tilted the orientation of their visual surroundings by using an augmented reality setup. In a series of trials, participants adjusted the orientation of the platform until they perceived themselves to be upright. Tilting the visual scene around the roll axis induced a bias in subjective postural vertical determination in the direction of scene tilt in both groups. In the group of older participants, however, the observed peak bias was larger and occurred at larger visual tilt angles. This indicates that the susceptibility to visually induced biases increases with age, possibly caused by a reduced reliability of sensory information."
https://openalex.org/W3032192552,"The PTPN22 gene encoding the Lyp/Pep protein tyrosine phosphatase is a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of end-binding protein 1 (EB1) is associated with the TCR activation. In this study, using 2-hybrid and mass spectrometry analyses, we identified EB1 as a protein associated with PTPN22. Furthermore, we discovered that EB1 specifically bound to the P1 domain of PTPN22 by competing with CSK, and the variant PTPN22-R620W does not affect the association with EB1, which is instrumental with respect to the regulation of TCR signaling. In addition, PTPN22 dephosphorylates EB1 at tyrosine-247 (Y247), which decreases the expression of the T-cell activation markers CD25 and CD69 and the phosphorylation levels of the TCR molecules ZAP-70, LAT, and Erk, leading to the eventual downregulation of the transcription factor NFAT and reduced the levels of secreted IL-2. The findings of this study provide new insights into the TCR signaling and the T-cell immune response, which are important for clarifying the mechanism of PTPN22-related autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3032520735,"Introduction It is increasingly considered important that people make an autonomous and informed decision concerning colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. However, the realisation of autonomy within the concept of informed decision-making might be interpreted too narrowly. Additionally, relatively little is known about what the eligible population believes to be a ‘good’ screening decision. Therefore, we aimed to explore how the concepts of autonomous and informed decision-making relate to how the eligible CRC screening population makes their decision and when they believe to have made a ‘good’ screening decision. Methods We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with the eligible CRC screening population (eighteen CRC screening participants and nine non-participants). The general topics discussed concerned how people made their CRC screening decision, how they experienced making this decision and when they considered they had made a ‘good’ decision. Results Most interviewees viewed a ‘good’ CRC screening decision as one based on both reasoning and feeling/intuition, and that is made freely. However, many CRC screening non-participants experienced a certain social pressure to participate. All CRC screening non-participants viewed making an informed decision as essential. This appeared to be the case to a lesser extent for CRC screening participants. For most, experiences and values were involved in their decision-making. Conclusion Our sample of the eligible CRC screening population viewed aspects related to the concepts of autonomous and informed decision-making as important for making a ‘good’ CRC screening decision. However, in particular the existence of a social norm may be affecting a true autonomous decision-making process. Additionally, the present concept of informed decision-making with its strong emphasis on making a fully informed and well-considered decision does not appear to be entirely reflective of the process in practice. More efforts could be made to attune to the diverse values and factors that are involved in deciding about CRC screening participation."
https://openalex.org/W3029115673,"Elsinoë fawcettii, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, causes citrus scab on numerous citrus varieties around the world. Known pathotypes of E. fawcettii are based on host range; additionally, cryptic pathotypes have been reported and more novel pathotypes are thought to exist. E. fawcettii produces elsinochrome, a non-host selective toxin which contributes to virulence. However, the mechanisms involved in potential pathogen-host interactions occurring prior to the production of elsinochrome are unknown, yet the host-specificity observed among pathotypes suggests a reliance upon such mechanisms. In this study we have generated a whole genome sequencing project for E. fawcettii, producing an annotated draft assembly 26.01 Mb in size, with 10,080 predicted gene models and low (0.37%) coverage of transposable elements. A small proportion of the assembly showed evidence of AT-rich regions, potentially indicating genomic regions with increased plasticity. Using a variety of computational tools, we mined the E. fawcettii genome for potential virulence genes as candidates for future investigation. A total of 1,280 secreted proteins and 276 candidate effectors were predicted and compared to those of other necrotrophic (Botrytis cinerea, Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Zymoseptoria tritici), hemibiotrophic (Leptosphaeria maculans, Magnaporthe oryzae, Rhynchosporium commune and Verticillium dahliae) and biotrophic (Ustilago maydis) plant pathogens. Genomic and proteomic features of known fungal effectors were analysed and used to guide the prioritisation of 120 candidate effectors of E. fawcettii. Additionally, 378 carbohydrate-active enzymes were predicted and analysed for likely secretion and sequence similarity with known virulence genes. Furthermore, secondary metabolite prediction indicated nine additional genes potentially involved in the elsinochrome biosynthesis gene cluster than previously described. A further 21 secondary metabolite clusters were predicted, some with similarity to known toxin producing gene clusters. The candidate virulence genes predicted in this study provide a comprehensive resource for future experimental investigation into the pathogenesis of E. fawcettii."
https://openalex.org/W3029523575,"The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of a training intervention in overall improvement in students' (santris) knowledge, behavior, and outcome.A mixed-methods exploratory sequential design was applied. First, qualitative data were collected from three focus group discussions with 20 supervisors and one in-depth interview with school principal to explore current hygiene practices. The information was then used to develop training intervention using either video, poster, and leaflet. To measure the effect, a stepped wedge cluster design with pre- and post-test analyses was conducted. A total of 452 junior high school santris in one Islamic boarding school were non-randomly allocated to either three intervention groups. Outcome measures were knowledge, personal behavior, and room hygiene. Codes and categories were produced in the qualitative analysis, while paired t-tests and Wilcoxon rank tests test were used in the quantitative analysis.The qualitative study identified poor practices on personal and room hygiene among the santris and proposed a training intervention. Overall, there was a significant increase in knowledge and personal behavior after the intervention (7.22 ± 1.34 pre-intervention to 7.70 ± 0.74 post-intervention and 9.75 ± 2.98 pre-intervention to 12.16 ± 2.12 post-intervention, respectively, p < 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W3032289384,"Introduction Intramuscular electroporation (IM/EP) is a vaccine delivery technique that improves the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. We evaluated the acceptability and tolerability of electroporation among healthy African study participants. Methods Forty-five participants were administered a DNA vaccine (HIV-MAG) or placebo by electroporation at three visits occurring at four week-intervals. At the end of each visit, participants were asked to rate pain at four times: (1) when the device was placed on the skin and vaccine injected, before the electrical stimulation, (2) at the time of electrical stimulation and muscle contraction, and (3) at 10 minutes and (4) 30 minutes after the procedure was completed. For analyses, pain level was dichotomized as either “acceptable” (none/slight/uncomfortable) or “too much” (Intense, severe, and very severe) and examined over time using repeated measures models. Optional brief comments made by participants were summarized anecdotally. Results All 45 participants completed all three vaccination visits; none withdrew from the study due to the electroporation procedure. Most (76%) reported pain levels as acceptable at every time point across all vaccination visits. The majority of “unacceptable” pain was reported at the time of electrical stimulation. The majority of the participants (97%) commented that they preferred electroporation to standard injection. Conclusion Repeated intramuscular electroporation for vaccine delivery was found to be acceptable and feasible among healthy African HIV vaccine trial participants. The majority of participants reported an acceptable pain level at all vaccination time points. Further investigation may be warranted into the value of EP to improve immunization outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W3030021269,"Distal radius fractures are common fractures and the cornerstone of treatment remains immobilization of the wrist in a cast. At present, there is a scarcity of studies that compare different cast immobilization methods. The objective of the study was therefore to compare volar-flexion and ulnar deviation cast to functional cast position in the treatment of dorsally displaced distal radius fracture among elderly patients.We performed a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial in three emergency centers in Finland. After closed reduction of the fracture, the wrist was placed in either volar-flexion and ulnar deviation cast or functional cast position. The follow-up was 12 months. The primary outcome was patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) score at 12 months. The secondary outcomes were Quick-DASH score, grip strength, health-related quality of life (15D), and pain catastrophizing scale. The number of complications was also recorded. In total, 105 participants were included in the study. Of these, 88% were female and the mean age was 73.5 (range 65-94) years. In the primary analysis, the mean difference in patient-rated wrist evaluation measure between groups was -4.9 (95% CI: -13.1.- 3.4., p = .24) in favor of the functional cast position. Operative treatment due to loss of reduction of fracture was performed for four patients (8%) in the FC group and for seven patients (13%) in the volar-flexion and ulnar deviation cast group (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.16-2.1).In this study, the data were consistent with a wide range of treatment effects when comparing two different cast positions in the treatment of distal radius fracture among elderly patients at 12-month follow-up. However, the functional cast is more likely to be superior when compared to volar-flexion and ulnar deviation cast.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02894983 Accessible: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02894983."
https://openalex.org/W3030504276,"In this paper, we study the effect of verbalizing affective pictures on affective state and language production. Individuals describe (Study I: Spoken Descriptions of Pictures) or passively view (Study II: Passively Viewing Pictures) 40 pictures for the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) that gradually increase from neutral to either positive or negative content. We expected that both methods would result in successful affect induction, and that the effect would be stronger for verbally describing pictures than for passively viewing them. Results indicate that speakers indeed felt more negative after describing negative pictures, but that describing positive (compared to neutral) pictures did not result in a more positive state. Contrary to our hypothesis, no differences were found between describing and passively viewing the pictures. Furthermore, we analysed the verbal picture descriptions produced by participants on various dimensions. Results indicate that positive and negative pictures were indeed described with increasingly more affective language in the expected directions. In addition to informing our understanding of the relationship between (spoken) language production and affect, these results also potentially pave the way for a new method of affect induction that uses free expression."
https://openalex.org/W3031587836,"A cross-sectional hypothesis generating study was performed to investigate modifiable exposures such as whether feeding pattern (a non-processed meat based diet, NPMD, or an ultra-processed carbohydrate based diet, UPCD), certain environmental factors and their timing of exposure might be associated with the development of canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). Also, genetic and demographic factors were tested for associations with CAD. The data was collected from the validated internet-based DogRisk food frequency questionnaire in Finland. A total of 2236 dogs were eligible for the study (the owners reported 406 cases and 1830 controls). Our main interest was to analyze modifiable early risk factors of CAD, focusing on nutritional and environmental factors. We tested four early life periods; prenatal, neonatal, early postnatal and late postnatal periods. Twenty-two variables were tested for associations with CAD using logistic regression analysis. From the final models we identified novel dietary associations with CAD: the NPMD during the prenatal and early postnatal periods had a significant negative association with the incidence of CAD in adult dogs (age above 1 year). Oppositely, UPCD was associated with a significantly higher risk for CAD incidence. Other variables that were associated with a significantly lower risk for CAD were maternal deworming during pregnancy, sunlight exposure during early postnatal period, normal body condition score during the early postnatal period, the puppy being born within the same family that it would stay in, and spending time on a dirt or grass surface from 2 to 6 months. Also, the genetic factors regarding maternal history of CAD, allergy-prone breeds and more than 50% white-colored coat all showed a significant positive association with CAD incidence in agreement with previous findings. Although no causality can be established, feeding NPMD early in life seemed to be protective against CAD, while UPCD could be considered a risk factor. Prospective intervention studies are needed to establish the causal effects of the protective role of NPMD on prevalence of CAD during the fetal and early postnatal life."
https://openalex.org/W3032457176,"Links between crystalline methamphetamine (CM) use and criminal offending are often drawn in the media; however, there has been little scientific research into this relationship. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence and correlates of lifetime CM use among a sample of young people in detention in Australia and to examine whether an association exists between lifetime CM use and recidivism in this population.The sample included 202 young people (164 males) in youth detention in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were administered questionnaires related to lifetime substance use and socio-environmental experiences. Lifetime mental health data and offending data were obtained for each participant from public mental health and policing databases. More than one third (38%) of the sample reported lifetime CM use. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age, male gender, polysubstance use, and high levels of community disorganisation were associated with CM use. The presence of a psychiatric diagnosis over the lifetime was not significantly associated with CM use. CM use was also not significantly associated with violent recidivism. Efforts to address CM use and related harm in detained youth should include community-based strategies to reduce CM use among this vulnerable population following their release from detention. However, the findings suggest that CM use on its own is unlikely to be an important consideration for professionals concerned with determining which young people should be selected for treatment designed to reduce the risk of violent recidivism."
https://openalex.org/W3032380532,"Introduction Pressure ulcer is a frequent complication in patients hospitalized in nursing homes and has a serious impact on quality of life and overall health. Moreover, ulcer treatment is highly expensive. Several studies have shown that pressure ulcer prevention is cost-effective. Audit and feedback programmes can help improve professional practices in pressure ulcer prevention and thus reduce their occurrence. The aim of this study was to analyze, with a prospective longitudinal study, the effectiveness of an audit and feedback programme at 1- and 2-year follow-up for reducing pressure ulcer prevalence and enhancing adherence to preventive practices in nursing homes. Methods Pressure ulcer point prevalence and preventive practices were measured in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in nursing homes of the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland). Oral and written feedback was provided 2 months after every survey to nursing home reference nurses. Results A total of 27 nursing homes participated in the programme in 2015 and 2016 (4607 patients) and 15 continued in 2017 (1357 patients). Patients were mostly females, with mean age > 86 years and median length of stay about 2 years. The programme significantly improved two preventive measures: patient repositioning and anti-decubitus bed or mattress. It also reduced acquired pressure ulcers prevalence in nursing homes that participated during all 3 years (from 4.5% in 2015 to 2.9% in 2017, p 0.035), especially in those with more patients with pressure ulcers. Conclusion Audit and feedback is relatively easy to implement at the regional level in nursing homes and can enhance adherence to preventive measures and reduce pressure ulcers prevalence in the homes."
https://openalex.org/W3029252556,"Introduction Simulation is a powerful tool for training and evaluating clinicians. However, few studies have examined the consistency of actor performances during simulation based medical education (SBME). The Simulated Communication with ICU Proxies trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02721810) used simulation to evaluate the effect of a behavioral intervention on physician communication. The purpose of this secondary analysis of data generated by the quality assurance team during the trial was to assess how quality assurance monitoring procedures impacted rates of actor errors during simulations. Methods The trial used rigorous quality assurance to train actors, evaluate performances, and ensure the intervention was delivered within a standardized environment. The quality assurance team evaluated video recordings and documented errors. Actors received both timely, formative feedback and participated in group feedback sessions. Results Error rates varied significantly across three actors (H(2) = 8.22, p = 0.02). In adjusted analyses, there was a decrease in the incidence of actor error over time, and errors decreased sharply after the first group feedback session (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.14–0.42). Conclusions Rigorous quality assurance procedures may help ensure consistent actor performances during SBME."
https://openalex.org/W3031133367,"ClinicalTrials.gov was started with the intention to create a consumer-friendly database for patients and others in search of information on clinical trials. However, there is no research on whether the content of ClinicalTrials.gov aligns with patient preferences. The TransCelerate Clinical Research Access & Information Exchange Initiative convened patient advisory boards and conducted a global online survey (N = 1070) to determine patient preferences when searching for clinical trials for participation. Patient feedback and ClinicalTrials.gov guidance documents were used to construct instruments to assess patient focus and guidance adherence of the Brief Title (a short lay title of the clinical trial) and Brief Summary (a high-level summary of study features) data fields in a representative sample (N = 346) of ClinicalTrials.gov records of interventional trials. When searching for clinical trials, survey participants rated condition (66.4%), trial location (57.0%), trial dates (52.9%), age and gender (48.6%), and health measurements (i.e., what the study measures) (45.5%) as the most important items. When presented with a list of trials from an initial search, participants saw condition, brief summary, study drug name, and brief title as the most helpful items. In a Brief Title, they wanted condition, health measurements, participant age, and study drug name. For Brief Summaries, participants preferred additional information on treatment duration, condition, study goal, health measurements, and frequency of visits. The assessment of patient focus in a representative sample of current ClinicalTrials.gov records showed that patient focus was underdeveloped as study records achieved only 52% (brief titles) and 50% (brief summaries) of the best possible score. The analysis of adherence to ClinicalTrials.gov guidance showed better scores (brief titles 69%, brief summaries 66%). We identified key information elements for registry users when evaluating clinical trials for participation. We found that aspects of patient focus are not common in current ClinicalTrials.gov entries. To support more user-friendly study records, we developed a tool to assess the quality of the plain language fields in study records prior to submission."
https://openalex.org/W3029537220,"Leukocyte migration is controlled by a membrane-based chemosensory pathway on the leading edge pseudopod that guides cell movement up attractant gradients during the innate immune and inflammatory responses. This study employed single cell and population imaging to investigate drug-induced perturbations of leading edge pseudopod morphology in cultured, polarized RAW macrophages. The drugs tested included representative therapeutics (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) as well as control drugs (PDGF, Gö6976, wortmannin). Notably, slow addition of any of the four therapeutics to cultured macrophages, mimicking the slowly increasing plasma concentration reported for standard oral dosage in patients, yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology. This finding is consistent with the well established clinical safety of these drugs. However, rapid drug addition to cultured macrophages revealed four distinct classes of effects on the leading edge pseudopod: (i) non-perturbing drug exposures yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac); (ii) adaptive exposures yielded temporary collapse of the extended pseudopod and its signature PI(3,4,5)P3 lipid signal followed by slow recovery of extended pseudopod morphology (ibuprofen, acetaminophen); (iii) disruptive exposures yielded long-term pseudopod collapse (Gö6976, wortmannin); and (iv) activating exposures yielded pseudopod expansion (PDGF). The novel observation of adaptive exposures leads us to hypothesize that rapid addition of an adaptive drug overwhelms an intrinsic or extrinsic adaptation system yielding temporary collapse followed by adaptive recovery, while slow addition enables gradual adaptation to counteract the drug perturbation in real time. Overall, the results illustrate an approach that may help identify therapeutic drugs that temporarily inhibit the leading edge pseudopod during extreme inflammation events, and toxic drugs that yield long term inhibition of the pseudopod with negative consequences for innate immunity. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of drug-induced pseudopod collapse, as well as the mechanisms of adaptation and recovery following some inhibitory drug exposures."
https://openalex.org/W3030235992,"Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are both vectors of Zika virus and both are endemic to the New Orleans Metropolitan area. Fortunately, to date there has been no known autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in New Orleans. No studies of the vector competence of local populations of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for Zika virus transmission have been conducted. To determine if New Orleans Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are competent for Zika virus, mosquitoes were reared to generation F3 from eggs collected in New Orleans during the 2018 mosquito season. Adults were fed an infectious blood meal and kept for 15 days in an environmental chamber. Transmission assays were conducted at 4, 10, and 15 days post exposure and RT-PCR was run on bodies and saliva to detect the presence of Zika virus RNA. We observed remarkably low susceptibility of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from New Orleans to a Zika strain from Panama after oral challenge. These results suggest a limited risk of Zika virus transmission should it be introduced to the New Orleans area, and may partially explain why no transmission was detected in Louisiana during the 2016 epidemic in the Americas, despite multiple known travel associated introductions to New Orleans. Despite these results these mosquito populations are known to be competent vectors for some other mosquito-borne viruses and control measures should not be relaxed."
https://openalex.org/W3031037522,"This study proposes to use cross-interface quantitative acoustics (ci-qA) and load self-referencing (LSR) to assess implant stability in a radiation-free, inexpensive, rapid, and quantitative manner. Eight bone analog specimens, made from polyurethane foam, were implanted with a cementless stemless shoulder implant-first in a fixed and later in a loose configuration-and measured using ci-qA under two load conditions. The loose implants exhibited higher micromotion and lower pull-out strength than their stable counterparts, with all values falling within the range of reported reference values. All acoustic characteristics differentiated between loose and fixed implants (maximum area-under-curve AUC = 1.0 for mean total signal energy, AUC = 1.0 for mean total signal energy ratio, AUC = 0.8 for harmonic ratio, and AUC = 0.92 for load self-referencing coefficient). While these results on bone substitute material will need to be confirmed on real bone specimen, ci-qA could ultimately facilitate the assessment of primary stability during implantation surgery and avoid unnecessary revision through quantitative evaluation of secondary stability during follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3032179163,"Oligomeric amyloid β (Aβ) is currently considered the most neurotoxic form of the Aβ peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The molecular structures of the oligomers have remained mostly unknown due to their transient nature. As a result, the molecular mechanisms of interactions between conformation-specific antibodies and their Aβ oligomer (AβO) cognates are not well understood. A monoclonal conformation-specific antibody, m5E3, was raised against a structural epitope of Aβ oligomers. m5E3 binds to AβOs with high affinity, but not to Aβ monomers or fibrils. In this study, a computational model of the variable fragment (Fv) of the m5E3 antibody (Fv5E3) is introduced. We further employ docking and molecular dynamics simulations to determine the molecular details of the antibody-oligomer interactions, and to classify the AβOs as Fv5E3-positives and negatives, and to provide a rationale for the low affinity of Fv5E3 for fibrils. This information will help us to perform site-directed mutagenesis on the m5E3 antibody to improve its specificity and affinity toward oligomeric Aβ species. We also provide evidence for the possible capability of the m5E3 antibody to disaggregate AβOs and to fragment protofilaments."
