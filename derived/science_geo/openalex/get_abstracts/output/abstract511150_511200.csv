https://openalex.org/W2011350333,"Magnetic order emerging in otherwise non-magnetic materials as carbon is a paradigmatic example of a novel type of s-p electron magnetism predicted to be of exceptional high-temperature stability. It has been demonstrated that atomic scale structural defects of graphene can host unpaired spins. However, it is still unclear under which conditions long-range magnetic order can emerge from such defect-bound magnetic moments. Here we propose that in contrast to random defect distributions, atomic scale engineering of graphene edges with specific crystallographic orientation, comprising edge atoms only from one sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene lattice, can give rise to a robust magnetic order. We employ a nanofabrication technique based on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy to define graphene nanoribbons with nanometer precision and well-defined crystallographic edge orientations. While armchair ribbons display quantum confinement gap, zigzag ribbons narrower than 7 nm reveal a bandgap of about 0.2 - 0.3 eV, which can be identified as a signature of interaction induced spin ordering along their edges. Moreover, a semiconductor to metal transition is revealed upon increasing the ribbon width, indicating the switching of the magnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic configuration. We found that the magnetic order on graphene edges of controlled zigzag orientation can be stable even at room temperature, raising hope for graphene-based spintronic devices operating under ambient conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2045174330,"The Polycomb group of epigenetic enzymes represses expression of developmentally regulated genes in many eukaryotes. This group includes the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which ubiquitylates nucleosomal histone H2A Lys 119 using its E3 ubiquitin ligase subunits, Ring1B and Bmi1, together with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5c. However, the molecular mechanism of nucleosome substrate recognition by PRC1 or other chromatin enzymes is unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of the human Ring1B-Bmi1-UbcH5c E3-E2 complex (the PRC1 ubiquitylation module) bound to its nucleosome core particle substrate. The structure shows how a chromatin enzyme achieves substrate specificity by interacting with several nucleosome surfaces spatially distinct from the site of catalysis. Our structure further reveals an unexpected role for the ubiquitin E2 enzyme in substrate recognition, and provides insight into how the related histone H2A E3 ligase, BRCA1, interacts with and ubiquitylates the nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W1969203866,"The complete knowledge of a quantum state allows the prediction of the probability of all possible measurement outcomes, a crucial step in quantum mechanics. It can be provided by tomographic methods which have been applied to atomic, molecular, spin and photonic states. For optical or microwave photons, standard tomography is obtained by mixing the unknown state with a large-amplitude coherent photon field. However, for fermions such as electrons in condensed matter, this approach is not applicable because fermionic fields are limited to small amplitudes (at most one particle per state), and so far no determination of an electron wavefunction has been made. Recent proposals involving quantum conductors suggest that the wavefunction can be obtained by measuring the time-dependent current of electronic wave interferometers or the current noise of electronic Hanbury-Brown/Twiss interferometers. Here we show that such measurements are possible despite the extreme noise sensitivity required, and present the reconstructed wavefunction quasi-probability, or Wigner distribution function, of single electrons injected into a ballistic conductor. Many identical electrons are prepared in well-controlled quantum states called levitons by repeatedly applying Lorentzian voltage pulses to a contact on the conductor. After passing through an electron beam splitter, the levitons are mixed with a weak-amplitude fermionic field formed by a coherent superposition of electron-hole pairs generated by a small alternating current with a frequency that is a multiple of the voltage pulse frequency. Antibunching of the electrons and holes with the levitons at the beam splitter changes the leviton partition statistics, and the noise variations provide the energy density matrix elements of the levitons. This demonstration of quantum tomography makes the developing field of electron quantum optics with ballistic conductors a new test-bed for quantum information with fermions. These results may find direct application in probing the entanglement of electron flying quantum bits, electron decoherence and electron interactions. They could also be applied to cold fermionic (or spin-1/2) atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2035144476,"One main function of telomeres is to maintain chromosome and genome stability. The rate of telomere shortening can be accelerated significantly by chemical and physical environmental agents. Reactive oxygen species are a source of oxidative stress and can produce modified bases (mainly 8-oxoG) and single strand breaks anywhere in the genome. The high incidence of guanine residues in telomeric DNA sequences makes the telomere a preferred target for oxidative damage. Our aim in this work is to evaluate whether chromosome instability induced by oxidative stress is related specifically to telomeric damage. We treated human primary fibroblasts (MRC-5) in vitro with hydrogen peroxide (100 and 200 µM) for 1 hr and collected data at several time points. To evaluate the persistence of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage up to 24 hrs after treatment, we analysed telomeric and genomic oxidative damage by qPCR and a modified comet assay, respectively. The results demonstrate that the genomic damage is completely repaired, while the telomeric oxidative damage persists. The analysis of telomere length reveals a significant telomere shortening 48 hrs after treatment, leading us to hypothesise that residual telomere damage could be responsible for the telomere shortening observed. Considering the influence of telomere length modulation on genomic stability, we quantified abnormal nuclear morphologies (Nucleoplasmic Bridges, Nuclear Buds and Micronuclei) and observed an increase of chromosome instability in the same time frame as telomere shortening. At subsequent times (72 and 96 hrs), we observed a restoration of telomere length and a reduction of chromosome instability, leaving us to conjecture a correlation between telomere shortening/dysfunction and chromosome instability. We can conclude that oxidative base damage leads to abnormal nuclear morphologies and that telomere dysfunction is an important contributor to this effect."

We reasoned that epigenetic regulators might modulate the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, a main driver of cell proliferation in various cancers including medulloblastoma. To test this hypothesis, we performed an unbiased small-molecule screen utilizing an HH-dependent reporter cell line (Light2 cells). We incubated Light2 cells with small molecules targeting different epigenetic modulators and identified four histone deacetylase inhibitors and a bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) protein inhibitor (I-BET151) that attenuate HH activity. I-BET151 was also able to inhibit the expression of HH target genes in Sufu−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, in which constitutive Gli activity is activated in a Smoothened (Smo)-independent fashion, consistent with it acting downstream of Smo. Knockdown of Brd4 (which encodes one of the BET proteins) phenocopies I-BET151 treatment, suggesting that Brd4 is a regulator of the HH signaling pathway. Consistent with this suggestion, Brd4 associates with the proximal promoter region of the Gli1 locus, and does so in a manner that can be reversed by I-BET151. Importantly, I-BET151 also suppressed the HH activity-dependent growth of medulloblastoma cells, in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that BET protein modulation may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for attenuating the growth of HH-dependent cancers, such as medulloblastoma.

https://openalex.org/W2055863493,"Sponges are simple animals with few cell types, but their genomes paradoxically contain a wide variety of developmental transcription factors, including homeobox genes belonging to the Antennapedia (ANTP) class, which in bilaterians encompass Hox, ParaHox and NK genes. In the genome of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, no Hox or ParaHox genes are present, but NK genes are linked in a tight cluster similar to the NK clusters of bilaterians. It has been proposed that Hox and ParaHox genes originated from NK cluster genes after divergence of sponges from the lineage leading to cnidarians and bilaterians. On the other hand, synteny analysis lends support to the notion that the absence of Hox and ParaHox genes in Amphimedon is a result of secondary loss (the ghost locus hypothesis). Here we analysed complete suites of ANTP-class homeoboxes in two calcareous sponges, Sycon ciliatum and Leucosolenia complicata. Our phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that these calcisponges possess orthologues of bilaterian NK genes (Hex, Hmx and Msx), a varying number of additional NK genes and one ParaHox gene, Cdx. Despite the generation of scaffolds spanning multiple genes, we find no evidence of clustering of Sycon NK genes. All Sycon ANTP-class genes are developmentally expressed, with patterns suggesting their involvement in cell type specification in embryos and adults, metamorphosis and body plan patterning. These results demonstrate that ParaHox genes predate the origin of sponges, thus confirming the ghost locus hypothesis, and highlight the need to analyse the genomes of multiple sponge lineages to obtain a complete picture of the ancestral composition of the first animal genome."

https://openalex.org/W1989521184,"Camera traps are electrical instruments that emit sounds and light. In recent decades they have become a tool of choice in wildlife research and monitoring. The variability between camera trap models and the methods used are considerable, and little is known about how animals respond to camera trap emissions. It has been reported that some animals show a response to camera traps, and in research this is often undesirable so it is important to understand why the animals are disturbed. We conducted laboratory based investigations to test the audio and infrared optical outputs of 12 camera trap models. Camera traps were measured for audio outputs in an anechoic chamber; we also measured ultrasonic (n = 5) and infrared illumination outputs (n = 7) of a subset of the camera trap models. We then compared the perceptive hearing range (n = 21) and assessed the vision ranges (n = 3) of mammals species (where data existed) to determine if animals can see and hear camera traps. We report that camera traps produce sounds that are well within the perceptive range of most mammals' hearing and produce illumination that can be seen by many species."
https://openalex.org/W2004369973,"Neuroscience research on sex difference is currently a controversial field, frequently accused of purveying a 'neurosexism' that functions to naturalise gender inequalities. However, there has been little empirical investigation of how information about neurobiological sex difference is interpreted within wider society. This paper presents a case study that tracks the journey of one high-profile study of neurobiological sex differences from its scientific publication through various layers of the public domain. A content analysis was performed to ascertain how the study was represented in five domains of communication: the original scientific article, a press release, the traditional news media, online reader comments and blog entries. Analysis suggested that scientific research on sex difference offers an opportunity to rehearse abiding cultural understandings of gender. In both scientific and popular contexts, traditional gender stereotypes were projected onto the novel scientific information, which was harnessed to demonstrate the factual truth and normative legitimacy of these beliefs. Though strains of misogyny were evident within the readers' comments, most discussion of the study took pains to portray the sexes' unique abilities as equal and 'complementary'. However, this content often resembled a form of benevolent sexism, in which praise of women's social-emotional skills compensated for their relegation from more esteemed trait-domains, such as rationality and productivity. The paper suggests that embedding these stereotype patterns in neuroscience may intensify their rhetorical potency by lending them the epistemic authority of science. It argues that the neuroscience of sex difference does not merely reflect, but can actively shape the gender norms of contemporary society."
https://openalex.org/W2072663690,"Depletion of the central metabolite NAD in cells results in broad metabolic defects leading to cell death and is a proposed novel therapeutic strategy in oncology. There is, however, a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms that connect disruption of this central metabolite with cell death. Here we utilize GNE-617, a small molecule inhibitor of NAMPT, a rate-limiting enzyme required for NAD generation, to probe the pathways leading to cell death following NAD depletion. In all cell lines examined, NAD was rapidly depleted (average t½ of 8.1 h) following NAMPT inhibition. Concurrent with NAD depletion, there was a decrease in both cell proliferation and motility, which we attribute to reduced activity of NAD-dependent deacetylases because cells fail to deacetylate α-tubulin-K40 and histone H3-K9. Following depletion of NAD by >95%, cells lose the ability to regenerate ATP. Cell lines with a slower rate of ATP depletion (average t½ of 45 h) activate caspase-3 and show evidence of apoptosis and autophagy, whereas cell lines with rapid depletion ATP (average t½ of 32 h) do not activate caspase-3 or show signs of apoptosis or autophagy. However, the predominant form of cell death in all lines is oncosis, which is driven by the loss of plasma membrane homeostasis once ATP levels are depleted by >20-fold. Thus, our work illustrates the sequence of events that occurs in cells following depletion of a key metabolite and reveals that cell death caused by a loss of NAD is primarily driven by the inability of cells to regenerate ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2087879226,"The formation of planets around binary stars may be more difficult than around single stars. In a close binary star (with a separation of less than a hundred astronomical units), theory predicts the presence of circumstellar disks around each star, and an outer circumbinary disk surrounding a gravitationally cleared inner cavity around the stars. Given that the inner disks are depleted by accretion onto the stars on timescales of a few thousand years, any replenishing material must be transferred from the outer reservoir to fuel planet formation (which occurs on timescales of about one million years). Gas flowing through disk cavities has been detected in single star systems. A circumbinary disk was discovered around the young low-mass binary system GG Tau A (ref. 7), which has recently been shown to be a hierarchical triple system. It has one large inner disk around the single star, GG Tau Aa, and shows small amounts of shocked hydrogen gas residing within the central cavity, but other than a single weak detection, the distribution of cold gas in this cavity or in any other binary or multiple star system has not hitherto been determined. Here we report imaging of gas fragments emitting radiation characteristic of carbon monoxide within the GG Tau A cavity. From the kinematics we conclude that the flow appears capable of sustaining the inner disk (around GG Tau Aa) beyond the accretion lifetime, leaving time for planet formation to occur there. These results show the complexity of planet formation around multiple stars and confirm the general picture predicted by numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W1985932355,"As a large double-stranded DNA virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) assembles capsids in the nucleus where the viral particles exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. Although a number of viral and host proteins are involved, the machinery of viral egress is not well understood. In a search for host interacting proteins of ICP34.5, which is a virulence factor of HSV-1, we identified a cellular protein, p32 (gC1qR/HABP1), by mass spectrophotometer analysis. When expressed, ICP34.5 associated with p32 in mammalian cells. Upon HSV-1 infection, p32 was recruited to the inner nuclear membrane by ICP34.5, which paralleled the phosphorylation and rearrangement of nuclear lamina. Knockdown of p32 in HSV-1-infected cells significantly reduced the production of cell-free viruses, suggesting that p32 is a mediator of HSV-1 nuclear egress. These observations suggest that the interaction between HSV-1 ICP34.5 and p32 leads to the disintegration of nuclear lamina and facilitates the nuclear egress of HSV-1 particles."
https://openalex.org/W2084492307,"The terpenoid compositions of the Late Cretaceous Xixia amber from Central China and the middle Miocene Zhangpu amber from Southeast China were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to elucidate their botanical origins. The Xixia amber is characterized by sesquiterpenoids, abietane and phyllocladane type diterpenoids, but lacks phenolic abietanes and labdane derivatives. The molecular compositions indicate that the Xixia amber is most likely contributed by the conifer family Araucariaceae, which is today distributed primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, but widely occurred in the Northern Hemisphere during the Mesozoic according to paleobotanical evidence. The middle Miocene Zhangpu amber is characterized by amyrin and amyrone-based triterpenoids and cadalene-based sesquiterpenoids. It is considered derived from the tropical angiosperm family Dipterocarpaceae based on these compounds and the co-occurring fossil winged fruits of the family in Zhangpu. This provides new evidence for the occurrence of a dipterocarp forest in the middle Miocene of Southeast China. It is the first detailed biomarker study for amber from East Asia."

Familial form shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable clinical expression. Three genes have been identified causing familial CCM: KRIT1/CCM1, MGC4607/CCM2, and PDCD10/CCM3. Aim of this study is to report additional PDCD10/CCM3 families poorly described so far which account for 10-15% of hereditary cerebral cavernous malformations. Our group investigated 87 consecutive Italian affected individuals (i.e. positive Magnetic Resonance Imaging) with multiple/familial CCM through direct sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis. We identified mutations in over 97.7% of cases, and PDCD10/CCM3 accounts for 13.1%. PDCD10/CCM3 molecular screening revealed four already known mutations and four novel ones. The mutated patients show an earlier onset of clinical manifestations as compared to CCM1/CCM2 mutated patients. The study of further families carrying mutations in PDCD10/CCM3 may help define a possible correlation between genotype and phenotype; an accurate clinical follow up of the subjects would help define more precisely whether mutations in PDCD10/CCM3 lead to a characteristic phenotype."

We performed transcriptome analysis of all known genes of peptidases also called proteases and their endogenous inhibitors in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is one of the most aggressive and deadly types of brain cancers, where unbalanced proteolysis is associated with tumor progression.Comparisons were performed between the transcriptomics of primary GBM tumors and unmatched non-malignant brain tissue, and between GBM cell lines (U87-MG and U373) and a control human astrocyte cell line (NHA). Publicly-available data sets and our own datasets were integrated and normalized using bioinformatics tools to reveal protease and protease inhibitor genes with deregulated expression in both malignant versus non-malignant tissues and cells.Of the 311 protease genes identified to be differentially expressed in both GBM tissues and cells, 5 genes were highly overexpressed, 2 genes coding for non-peptidase homologues transferrin receptor (TFRC) and G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56), as well as 3 genes coding for the proteases endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2) and cathepsin K (CTSK), whereas one gene, that of the serine protease carboxypeptidase E (CPE) was strongly reduced in expression. Seventy five protease inhibitor genes were differentially expressed, of which 3 genes were highly overexpressed, the genes coding for stefin B (CSTB), peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3 also named elafin) and CD74. Seven out of 8 genes (except CSTB) were validated using RT-qPCR in GBM cell lines. CTSK overexpression was validated using RT-qPCR in GBM tissues as well. Cathepsin K immunohistochemical staining and western blotting showed that only proteolytically inactive proforms of cathepsin K were overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells.The presence of high levels of inactive proforms of cathepsin K in GBM tissues and cells indicate that in GBM the proteolytic/collagenolytic role is not its primary function but it plays rather a different yet unknown role."

https://openalex.org/W2145499535,"Teeth constitute a promising source of stem cells that can be used for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine purposes. Bone loss in the craniofacial complex due to pathological conditions and severe injuries could be treated with new materials combined with human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) that have the same embryonic origin as craniofacial bones. Optimising combinations of scaffolds, cells, growth factors and culture conditions still remains a great challenge. In the present study, we evaluate the mineralisation potential of hDPSCs seeded on porous silk fibroin scaffolds in a mechanically dynamic environment provided by spinner flask bioreactors. Cell-seeded scaffolds were cultured in either standard or osteogenic media in both static and dynamic conditions for 47 days. Histological analysis and micro-computed tomography of the samples showed low levels of mineralisation when samples were cultured in static conditions (0.16±0.1 BV/TV%), while their culture in a dynamic environment with osteogenic medium and weekly µCT scans (4.9±1.6 BV/TV%) significantly increased the formation of homogeneously mineralised structures, which was also confirmed by the elevated calcium levels (4.5±1.0 vs. 8.8±1.7 mg/mL). Molecular analysis of the samples showed that the expression of tooth correlated genes such as Dentin Sialophosphoprotein and Nestin were downregulated by a factor of 6.7 and 7.4, respectively, in hDPSCs when cultured in presence of osteogenic medium. This finding indicates that hDPSCs are able to adopt a non-dental identity by changing the culture conditions only. Also an increased expression of Osteocalcin (1.4x) and Collagen type I (1.7x) was found after culture under mechanically dynamic conditions in control medium. In conclusion, the combination of hDPSCs and silk scaffolds cultured under mechanical loading in spinner flask bioreactors could offer a novel and promising approach for bone tissue engineering where appropriate and rapid bone regeneration in mechanically loaded tissues is required."
https://openalex.org/W2036126376,"Background and Aim Hyponatremia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease and is associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. However, few studies have addressed this issue in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods This prospective observational study included a total of 441 incident patients who started PD between January 2000 and December 2005. Using time-averaged serum sodium (TA-Na) levels, we aimed to investigate whether hyponatremia can predict mortality in these patients. Results Among the baseline parameters, serum sodium level was positively associated with serum albumin (β = 0.145; p = 0.003) and residual renal function (RRF) (β = 0.130; p = 0.018) and inversely associated with PD ultrafiltration (β = −0.114; p = 0.024) in a multivariable linear regression analysis. During a median follow-up of 34.8 months, 149 deaths were recorded. All-cause death occurred in 81 (55.9%) patients in the lowest tertile compared to 37 (25.0%) and 31 (20.9%) patients in the middle and highest tertiles, respectively. After adjusting for multiple potentially confounding covariates, increased TA-Na level was associated with a significantly decreased risk of all-cause (HR per 1 mEq/L increase, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73–0.86; p<0.001) and infection-related (HR per 1 mEq/L increase, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70–0.85; p<0.001) deaths. Conclusions This study showed that hyponatremia is an independent predictor of mortality in PD patients. Nevertheless, whether correcting hyponatremia improves patient survival is unknown. Future interventional studies should address this question more appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W2057337427,"It has been suggested that low-level viremia or blips in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral treatment are related to assay variation and/or increased sensitivity of new commercial assays. The 50-copy cut-off for virologic failure is, therefore, under debate.Treated patients with low-level viremia (persistent viral loads (VL) of 50-1000 copies/mL, group A, N = 16) or a blip (single detectable VL, group B, N = 77) were compared to a control group (consistently suppressed viremia since start therapy (<50 copies/mL), N = 79). Residual viremia (detectable viral RNA <50 copies/ml) in the year preceding the first VL above 50 copies/mL (T0) was determined using Roche Cobas-Amplicor v1.5 or CAP-CTM v2.0. Subsequent virologic failure (2 consecutive VLs>500 or 1 VL>1000 copies/mL that was not followed by a VL<50 copies/mL; median follow up 34 months) was assessed.Significantly more patients in groups A and B had residual viremia in the year preceding T0 compared to controls (50% and 19% vs 3% respectively; p<0.001). Residual viremia was associated with development of low-level viremia or blips (OR 10.9 (95% CI 2.9-40.6)). Subsequent virologic failure was seen more often in group A (3/16) and B (2/77) than in the control group (0/79).Residual viremia is associated with development of blips and low-level viremia. Virologic failure occurred more often in patients with low-level viremia. These results suggest that low-level viremia results from viral production/replication rather than only assay variation."

In Brassica napus (canola), each of these subunits forms a multimember subfamily. Plant NF-Ys were reported to be involved in several abiotic stresses. In this study, we demonstrated that multiple members of thirty three BnNF-Ys responded rapidly to salinity, drought, or ABA treatments. Transcripts of five BnNF-YAs, seven BnNF-YBs, and two BnNF-YCs were up-regulated by salinity stress, whereas the expression of thirteen BnNF-YAs, ten BnNF-YBs, and four BnNF-YCs were induced by drought stress. Under NaCl treatments, the expression of one BnNF-YA10 and four NF-YBs (BnNF-YB3, BnNF-YB7, BnNF-YB10, and BnNF-YB14) were greatly increased. Under PEG treatments, the expression levels of four NF-YAs (BnNF-YA9, BnNF-YA10, BnNF-YA11, and BnNF-YA12) and five NF-YBs (BnNF-YB1, BnNF-YB8, BnNF-YB10, BnNF-YB13, and BnNF-YB14) were greatly induced. The expression profiles of 20 of the 27 salinity- or drought-induced BnNF-Ys were also affected by ABA treatment. The expression levels of six NF-YAs (BnNF-YA1, BnNF-YA7, BnNF-YA8, BnNF-YA9, BnNF-YA10, and BnNF-YA12) and seven BnNF-YB members (BnNF-YB2, BnNF-YB3, BnNF-YB7, BnNF-YB10, BnNF-YB11, BnNF-YB13, and BnNF-YB14) and two NF-YC members (BnNF-YC2 and BnNF-YC3) were greatly up-regulated by ABA treatments. Only a few BnNF-Ys were inhibited by the above three treatments. Several NF-Y subfamily members exhibited collinear expression patterns. The promoters of all stress-responsive BnNF-Ys harbored at least two types of stress-related cis-elements, such as ABRE, DRE, MYB, or MYC. The cis-element organization of BnNF-Ys was similar to that of Arabidopsis thaliana, and the promoter regions exhibited higher levels of nucleotide sequence identity with Brassica rapa than with Brassica oleracea. This work represents an entry point for investigating the roles of canola NF-Y proteins during abiotic stress responses and provides insight into the genetic evolution of Brassica NF-Ys."

Depending on the fit of our growth models, carrying capacity and growth rate parameters were extracted and modeled using historical, geographical, land cover and climatic predictors. Model averaging and individual variable importance weights were used to assess the strength of these predictors. The specific variables with the greatest support in our models differed between data sets, which may be the result of temporal and spatial differences between the BBS and CBC. However, our results indicate that both carrying capacity and population growth rates are related to developed land cover and temperature, while growth rates may also be influenced by dispersal patterns along the invasion front. Model averaged multivariate models explained 35-48% and 41-46% of the variation in carrying capacities and population growth rates, respectively. Our results suggest that widespread species invasions can be evaluated within a predictable population ecology framework. Land cover and climate both have important effects on population growth rates and carrying capacities of Collared-Dove populations. Efforts to model aspects of population growth of this invasive species were more successful than attempts to model static abundance patterns, pointing to a potentially fruitful avenue for the development of improved invasive distribution models."

Six to 8 AQP genes have been identified in many insect species, but presently only three aquaporins have been characterized in phloem feeding insects. The objective of this study was to identify candidate AQPs in the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli. Herein, we identified four candidate aquaporin cDNAs in B. cockerelli transcriptome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that candidate BcAQP2-like had high similarity to PRIP aquaporins; while candidates BcAQP4-like, BcAQP5-like and BcAQP9-like clustered within clade B. In particular, candidates BcAQP4-like and BcAQP5-like clustered with functionally validated insect aquaglyceroporin proteins. Expression analyses using RT-qPCR showed that all candidates were expressed in all life stages and tissues. Candidates BcAQP4-like and BcAQP5-like were highly expressed in bacteriocytes, while BcAQP9-like appeared to be expressed at high levels in whole body but not in the assayed tissues. This study is the first global attempt to identify putative aquaporins in a phloem feeding insect."

A severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) surveillance and sero-epidemiological investigation was conducted in the districts with outbreaks. During the study period of 2011–2014, a total of 51 SFTSV infection cases were identified and the case fatality rate was 12% (6/51). Ninety two percent of the patients (47/51) were over 50 years of age, and 63% (32/51) of laboratory confirmed cases occurred from May to July. Nine percent (11/120) of the serum samples from local healthy people without symptoms were found to be positive for antibodies to the SFTS virus. SFTSV strains were isolated by culture using Vero, and the whole genomic sequences of two SFTSV strains (01 and Zhao) were sequenced and submitted to the GenBank. Homology analysis showed that the similarity of the target nucleocapsid gene from the SFTSV strains from different geographic areas was 94.2–100%. From the constructed phylogenetic tree, it was found that all the SFTSV strains diverged into two main clusters. Only the SFTSV strains from the Zhejiang (Daishan) region of China and the Yamaguchi, Miyazakj regions of Japan, were clustered into lineage II, consistent with both of these regions being isolated areas with similar geographic features. Two out of eight predicted linear B cell epitopes from the nucleocapsid protein showed mutations between the SFTSV strains of different clusters, but did not contribute to the binding ability of the specific SFTSV antibodies. This study confirmed that SFTSV has been circulating naturally and can cause a seasonal prevalence in Daishan, China. The results also suggest that the molecular characteristics of SFTSV are associated with the geographic region and all SFTSV strains can be divided into two genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2039114038,"Objective Little is known about long-term outcomes among patients who receive percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) for peripheral artery disease (PAD) then undergo below-knee or above-knee amputations. We sought to determine clinical outcomes associated with below-knee or above-knee amputation, along with possible explanatory factors and treatment strategies. Methods Using data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010, 7,568 adult patients were divided into three groups: lower extremity preserved (LE), below-knee amputation (BK) and above-knee amputation (AK). We assessed outcomes including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and associated risk factors. Results Overall MACE was significantly higher in the AK group compared to the LE and BK groups, over a mean follow-up of 2.45 years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50–2.18 for AK vs. LE; HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.36–2.06 for AK vs. BK). However MACE were similar for the BK and LE groups (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.98–1.20). Overall mortality was highest in the AK group (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.34–2.04 for AK vs. BK). As for patient characteristics, atrial fibrillation was more prevalent in the AK group than in the BK group (17% vs. 7%). Independent risk factors associated with death after above- or below-knee amputation included advanced age, heart failure, dialysis, male gender and high patient volume. Conclusion The MACE rate was highest in the AK group, whereas the LE and BK groups were similar in this regard. Furthermore, overall mortality increased with larger area of amputation."
https://openalex.org/W2060068254,"To study the changes in the outer retinal microstructures during a six month period after the onset of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR)-complex by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).Seventeen eyes of 17 patients with the AZOOR-complex were studied. The integrity of the external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ; also called the inner/outer segment junction), and interdigitation zone (IDZ; also called the cone outer segment tips) were evaluated in the SD-OCT images obtained at the initial visit and at six months. The three highly reflective bands were divided into three types; continuous, discontinuous, and absent. The integrity of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) was also assessed.Among the three highly reflective bands, the IDZ was most altered at the initial visit and least recovered at six months. Fifteen of 17 eyes (88%) had a recovery of at least one of the three bands at six months in the retinal area where the ONL was intact, and these areas showed an improvement of visual field. Three eyes (18%) had retinal areas where the ONL was absent at the initial visit, and there was no recovery in both the retinal structures and visual fields in these areas.Our results indicate that more than 85% eyes with AZOOR-complex show some recovery in the microstructures of the outer retina during a six month period if the ONL is intact. We conclude that SD-OCT is a useful method to monitor the changes of the outer retinal microstructure in eyes with the AZOOR-complex."
https://openalex.org/W2092506155,"A substantial and stable increase of the current density Jsc of ruthenium (Ru) dye sensitized solar cells (DSC) of up to 16.18% and of the power efficiency of up to 25.5% is demonstrated in this article via plasmonic enhancement. The key aspect of this work is the use of a tailored bimodal size distribution of functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that have been chemically immobilized onto the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer via short, stable dithiodibutyric acid linkers. The size distribution of the AuNPs is a result of theoretical calculations that aimed at the perfection of the absorption characteristics of the complete solar cell system over a wide range of wavelengths. The functionalization of the AuNPs serves to bind them at a close but defined distance to TiO2-particles and additionally to chemically protect them against potential corrosion by the electrolyte. Simulations of near field (enhanced absorption) and far field (scattering) contributions have been used to tailor a complex AuNPs bimodal size distribution that had subsequently demonstrated experimentally a close to optimum improvement of the absorbance over a wide wavelength range (500–675 nm) and therefore an impressive DSC efficiency enhancement. Finally, the modified DSCs are exhibiting pronounced longevity and stable performance as confirmed via long time measurements. In summary, the presented systems show increased performance compared to non plasmonic enhanced cells with otherwise identical composition, and are demonstrating a previously unpublished longevity for iodide electrolyte/AuNPs combinations."
https://openalex.org/W2079419763,"Sitobion avenae is a major agricultural pest of wheat in China. Using microsatellite markers, we studied the potential gene flow, genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure of seven S. avenae populations from different regions of China (Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces). The populations from Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu showed high levels of genic and genotypic diversity. By contrast, the genic diversity in the Beijing and Hebei populations was much lower. Despite this low genic diversity, the genotypic diversity of the Beijing population was higher than that of all of the other populations, except those from Jiangsu and Shandong. Overall, the genetic divergence among the seven S. avenae populations tested was high, though there was almost no differentiation between the Shandong and Henan populations. We observed significant negative correlation between the strength of gene flow and the geographic distances among populations. Based on genetic analysis, the seven S. avenae populations studied can be divided into four distinct clusters; (i) Hubei, (ii) Shanxi, (iii) Beijing and Hebei, and (iv) Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu. The present results provide a basis for potentially optimizing integrated pest management (IPM) programs in China, through adapting control methods that target biological traits shared by various populations of the same genotype."

Several transcriptional mechanisms regulating expression of PTF1a have been identified. However, regulation of PTF1a protein stability and degradation is still unexplored. Here, we report that inhibition of proteasome leads to elevated levels of PTF1a and to the existence of polyubiquitinated forms of PTF1a. We used the Sos recruitment system, an alternative two-hybrid system method to detect protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm and to map the interactome of PTF1a. We identified TRIP12 (thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 12), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase as a new partner of PTF1a. We confirmed PTF1a/TRIP12 interaction in acinar cell lines and in co-transfected HEK-293T cells. The protein stability of PTF1a is significantly increased upon decreased expression of TRIP12. It is reduced upon overexpression of TRIP12 but not a catalytically inactive TRIP12-C1959A mutant. We identified a region of TRIP12 required for interaction and identified lysine 312 of PTF1a as essential for proteasomal degradation. We also demonstrate that TRIP12 down-regulates PTF1a transcriptional and antiproliferative activities. Our data suggest that an increase in TRIP12 expression can play a part in PTF1a down-regulation and indicate that PTF1a/TRIP12 functional interaction may regulate pancreatic epithelial cell homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2069346368,"A consistently high level of stallion fertility plays an economically important role in modern horse breeding. We performed a genome-wide association study for estimated breeding values of the paternal component of the pregnancy rate per estrus cycle (EBV-PAT) in Hanoverian stallions. A total of 228 Hanoverian stallions were genotyped using the Equine SNP50 Beadchip. The most significant association was found on horse chromosome 6 for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within phospholipase C zeta 1 (PLCz1). In the close neighbourhood to PLCz1 is located CAPZA3 (capping protein (actin filament) muscle Z-line, alpha 3). The gene PLCz1 encodes a protein essential for spermatogenesis and oocyte activation through sperm induced Ca2+-oscillation during fertilization. We derived equine gene models for PLCz1 and CAPZA3 based on cDNA and genomic DNA sequences. The equine PLCz1 had four different transcripts of which two contained a premature termination codon. Sequencing all exons and their flanking sequences using genomic DNA samples from 19 Hanoverian stallions revealed 47 polymorphisms within PLCz1 and one SNP within CAPZA3. Validation of these 48 polymorphisms in 237 Hanoverian stallions identified three intronic SNPs within PLCz1 as significantly associated with EBV-PAT. Bioinformatic analysis suggested regulatory effects for these SNPs via transcription factor binding sites or microRNAs. In conclusion, non-coding polymorphisms within PLCz1 were identified as conferring stallion fertility and PLCz1 as candidate locus for male fertility in Hanoverian warmblood. CAPZA3 could be eliminated as candidate gene for fertility in Hanoverian stallions."
https://openalex.org/W1969596688,"It is widely thought that pregnancy reduces breast cancer risk, but this lacks consideration of breast cancer subtypes. While a full term pregnancy reduces risk for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and luminal breast cancers, parity is associated with increased risk of basal-like breast cancer (BBC) subtype. Basal-like subtypes represent less than 10% of breast cancers and are highly aggressive, affecting primarily young, African American women. Our previous work demonstrated that high fat diet-induced obesity in nulliparous mice significantly blunted latency in C3(1)-TAg mice, a model of BBC, potentially through the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met oncogenic pathway. Experimental studies have examined parity and obesity individually, but to date, the joint effects of parity and obesity have not been studied. We investigated the role of obesity in parous mice on BBC. Parity alone dramatically blunted tumor latency compared to nulliparous controls with no effects on tumor number or growth, while obesity had only a minor role in further reducing latency. Obesity-associated metabolic mediators and hormones such as insulin, estrogen, and progesterone were not significantly regulated by obesity. Plasma IL-6 was also significantly elevated by obesity in parous mice. We have previously reported a potential role for stromal-derived hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) via its cognate receptor c-Met in the etiology of obesity-induced BBC tumor onset and in both human and murine primary coculture models of BBC-aggressiveness. Obesity-associated c-Met concentrations were 2.5-fold greater in normal mammary glands of parous mice. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that, parity in C3(1)-TAg mice dramatically reduced BBC latency compared to nulliparous mice. In parous mice, c-Met is regulated by obesity in unaffected mammary gland and is associated with tumor onset. C3(1)-TAg mice recapitulate epidemiologic findings such that parity drives increased BBC risk and potential microenvironmental alterations in c-Met signaling may play a role in etiology."

However, the sequence of and causal relation between these events is unclear, necessitating a spontaneous animal model. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of intestinal permeability, mucosal and neuromuscular inflammation and nitrergic motor neuron function during the lifetime of the BioBreeding (BB) rat.Normoglycemic BB-diabetes prone (DP) and control rats were sacrificed at different ages and jejunum was harvested to characterize intestinal permeability, inflammation and neuromuscular function.Both structural and functional evidence of increased intestinal permeability was found in young BB-DP rats from the age of 50 days. In older animals, starting in the mucosa from 70 days and in half of the animals also in the muscularis propria from 110 days, an inflammatory reaction, characterized by an influx of polymorphonuclear cells and higher myeloperoxidase activity, was observed. Finally, in animals older than 110 days, coinciding with a myenteric ganglionitis, a loss of nitrergic neurons and motor function was demonstrated.In the BB-rat, mucosal inflammatory cell infiltration is preceded by intestinal barrier dysfunction and followed by myenteric ganglionitis and loss of nitrergic function. This sequence supports a primary role for impaired barrier function and provides an insightful model for the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1965794549,"Background The burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become more and more considerable in China. A macroscopic spatial analysis of HCV infection that can provide scientific information for further intervention and disease control is lacking. Methods All geo-referenced HCV cases that had been recorded by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) during 2005–2011 were included in the study. In order to learn about the changes of demographic characteristics and geographic distribution, trend test and spatial analysis were conducted to reflect the changing pattern of HCV infection. Results Over 770,000 identified HCV infection cases had specific geographic information during the study period (2005–2011). Ratios of gender (Male/Female, Z-value = −18.53, P<0.001), age group (≤30 years old/≥31 years old, Z-value = −51.03, P<0.001) and diagnosis type (Clinical diagnosis/Laboratory diagnosis, Z-value = −130.47, P<0.001) declined. HCV infection was not distributed randomly. Provinces Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Jilin reported more than 40,000 HCV infections during 2005 to 2011, accounting for 43.91% of all cases. The strength of cluster of disease was increasing in China during the study period. Overall, 11 provinces had once been detected as hotspots during 7 years, most of which were located in the central or border parts of China. Tibet, Qinghai, Jiangxi were the regions that had coldspots. Conclusions The number of clustering of HCV infection among older adults increased in recent years. Specific interventions and prevention programs targeting at main HCV epidemic areas are urgently in need in mainland China."

https://openalex.org/W2072308142,"There has been a significant increase in the incidence of Saprolegnia infections over the past decades, especially after the banning of malachite green. Very often these infections are associated with high economic losses in salmonid farms and hatcheries. The use of boric acid to control the disease has been investigated recently both under in vitro and in vivo conditions, however its possible mode of action against fish pathogenic Saprolegnia is not known. In this study, we have explored the transformation in Saprolegnia spores/hyphae after exposure to boric acid (1 g/L) over a period 4-24 h post treatment. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), early changes in Saprolegnia spores were detected. Mitochondrial degeneration was the most obvious sign observed following 4 h treatment in about 20% of randomly selected spores. We also investigated the effect of the treatment on nuclear division, mitochondrial activity and function using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Fluorescence microscopy was also used to test the effect of treatment on mitochondrial membrane potential and formation of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the viability and proliferation of treated spores that correlated to mitochondrial enzymatic activity were tested using an MTS assay. All obtained data pointed towards changes in the mitochondrial structure, membrane potential and enzymatic activity following treatment. We have found that boric acid has no effect on the integrity of membranes of Saprolegnia spores at concentrations tested. It is therefore likely that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the toxic activity of boric acid against Saprolegnia spp."
https://openalex.org/W2141854075,"Prolidases, metalloproteases that catalyze the cleavage of Xaa-Pro dipeptides, are conserved enzymes found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In humans, prolidase is crucial for the recycling of collagen. To further characterize the essential elements of this enzyme, we utilized the Escherichia coli prolidase, PepQ, which shares striking similarity with eukaryotic prolidases. Through structural and bioinformatic insights, we have extended previous characterizations of the prolidase active site, uncovering a key component for substrate specificity. Here we report the structure of E. coli PepQ, solved at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure shows an antiparallel, dimeric protein, with each subunit containing N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain is formed by the pita-bread fold typical for this family of metalloproteases, with two Mg(II) ions coordinated by five amino-acid ligands. Comparison of the E. coli PepQ structure and sequence with homologous structures and sequences from a diversity of organisms reveals distinctions between prolidases from Gram-positive eubacteria and archaea, and those from Gram-negative eubacteria, including the presence of loop regions in the E. coli protein that are conserved in eukaryotes. One such loop contains a completely conserved arginine near the catalytic site. This conserved arginine is predicted by docking simulations to interact with the C-terminus of the substrate dipeptide. Kinetic analysis using both a charge-neutralized substrate and a charge-reversed variant of PepQ support this conclusion, and allow for the designation of a new role for this key region of the enzyme active site."

Player X has the option of proactively adopting a cooperation-trap strategy, which enforces complete cooperation from the rational player Y and leads to a highly beneficial as well as maximally fair situation to both players.

https://openalex.org/W2002617810,"Human urinary disorders are generally studied in rodent models due to limitations of functional in vitro culture models of primary human urothelial cells (HUCs). Current HUC culture models are often derived from immortalized cancer cell lines, which likely have functional characteristics differ from healthy human urothelium. Here, we described a simple explant culture technique to generate HUCs and assessed their in vitro functions. Using transmission electron microscopy, we assessed morphology and heterogeneity of the generated HUCs and characterized their intercellular membrane structural proteins relative to ex vivo urothelium tissue. We demonstrated that our cultured HUCs are free of fibroblasts. They are also heterogeneous, containing cells characteristic of both immature basal cells and mature superficial urothelial cells. The cultured HUCs expressed muscarinic receptors (MR1 and MR2), carnitine acetyltransferase (CarAT), immunoregulatory cytokines IL7, IL15, and IL23, as well as the chemokine CCL20. HUCs also expressed epithelial cell-specific molecules essential for forming intercellular structures that maintain the functional capacity to form the physiological barrier of the human bladder urothelium. A subset of HUCs, identified by the high expression of CD44, expressed the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) along with its co-receptor CD14. We demonstrated that HUCs express, at the mRNA level, both forms of the IL22 receptor, the membrane-associated (IL22RA1) and the secreted soluble (IL22RA2) forms; in turn, IL22 inhibited expression of MR1 and induced expression of CarAT and two antimicrobial peptides (S100A9 and lipocalin-2). While the cellular sources of IL22 have yet to be identified, the HUC cytokine and chemokine profiles support the concept that IL22-producing cells are present in the human bladder mucosa tissue and that IL22 plays a regulatory role in HUC functions. Thus, the described explant technique is clearly capable of generating functional HUCs suitable for the study of human urinary tract disorders, including interactions between urothelium and IL22-producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032734460,"Stationary-phase cultures have been used as an important model of aging, a complex process involving multiple pathways and signaling networks. However, the molecular processes underlying stress response of non-dividing cells are poorly understood, although deteriorated stress response is one of the hallmarks of aging. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a valuable model organism to study the genetics of aging, because yeast ages within days and are amenable to genetic manipulations. As a unicellular organism, yeast has evolved robust systems to respond to environmental challenges. This response is orchestrated largely by the conserved transcription factor Hsf1, which in S. cerevisiae regulates expression of multiple genes in response to diverse stresses. Here we demonstrate that Hsf1 response to heat shock and oxidative stress deteriorates during yeast transition from exponential growth to stationary-phase, whereas Hsf1 activation by glucose starvation is maintained. Overexpressing Hsf1 does not significantly improve heat shock response, indicating that Hsf1 dwindling is not the major cause for Hsf1 attenuated response in stationary-phase yeast. Rather, factors that participate in Hsf1 activation appear to be compromised. We uncover two factors, Yap1 and Sir2, which discretely function in Hsf1 activation by oxidative stress and heat shock. In Δyap1 mutant, Hsf1 does not respond to oxidative stress, while in Δsir2 mutant, Hsf1 does not respond to heat shock. Moreover, excess Sir2 mimics the heat shock response. This role of the NAD+-dependent Sir2 is supported by our finding that supplementing NAD+ precursors improves Hsf1 heat shock response in stationary-phase yeast, especially when combined with expression of excess Sir2. Finally, the combination of excess Hsf1, excess Sir2 and NAD+ precursors rejuvenates the heat shock response."

Furthermore, we observed defective endosomal sorting in mutants of plo1, ark1 and clp1, as has been reported for ESCRT mutants, consistent with a role for these kinases in the control of ESCRT function in membrane traffic. Multiple observations indicate functional interplay between polo and ESCRT components: firstly, two-hybrid in vivo interactions are reported between Plo1p and Sst4p, Vps28p, Vps25p, Vps20p and Vps32p; secondly, co-immunoprecipitation of human homologues of Vps20p, Vps32p, Vps24p and Vps2p by human Plk1; and thirdly, in vitro phosphorylation of budding yeast Vps32p and Vps20p by polo kinase. Two-hybrid analyses also identified interactions between Ark1p and Vps20p and Vps32p, and Clp1p and Vps28p.

https://openalex.org/W2054182473,"In eukaryotes combinatorial activation of transcription is an important component of gene regulation. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Adr1-Cat8 and Adr1-Oaf1/Pip2 are pairs of activators that act together to regulate two diverse sets of genes. Transcription activation of both sets is regulated positively by the yeast AMP-activated protein kinase homolog, Snf1, in response to low glucose or the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source and negatively by two redundant 14-3-3 isoforms, Bmh1 and Bmh2. Bmh regulates the function of these pairs at a post-promoter binding step by direct binding to Adr1. However, how Bmh regulates transcription after activator binding remains unknown. In the present study we analyzed Bmh-mediated regulation of two sets of genes activated independently by these pairs of activators. We report that Bmh inhibits mRNA synthesis when the second activator is absent. Using gene fusions we show that Bmh binding to the Adr1 regulatory domain inhibits an Adr1 activation domain but not a heterologous activation domain or artificially recruited Mediator, consistent with Bmh acting at a step in transcription downstream of activator binding. Bmh inhibits the assembly and the function of a preinitiation complex (PIC). Gene expression studies suggest that Bmh regulates Adr1 activity through the coactivators Mediator and Swi/Snf. Mediator recruitment appeared to occur normally, but PIC formation and function were defective, suggesting that Bmh inhibits a step between Mediator recruitment and PIC activation. In eukaryotes combinatorial activation of transcription is an important component of gene regulation. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Adr1-Cat8 and Adr1-Oaf1/Pip2 are pairs of activators that act together to regulate two diverse sets of genes. Transcription activation of both sets is regulated positively by the yeast AMP-activated protein kinase homolog, Snf1, in response to low glucose or the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source and negatively by two redundant 14-3-3 isoforms, Bmh1 and Bmh2. Bmh regulates the function of these pairs at a post-promoter binding step by direct binding to Adr1. However, how Bmh regulates transcription after activator binding remains unknown. In the present study we analyzed Bmh-mediated regulation of two sets of genes activated independently by these pairs of activators. We report that Bmh inhibits mRNA synthesis when the second activator is absent. Using gene fusions we show that Bmh binding to the Adr1 regulatory domain inhibits an Adr1 activation domain but not a heterologous activation domain or artificially recruited Mediator, consistent with Bmh acting at a step in transcription downstream of activator binding. Bmh inhibits the assembly and the function of a preinitiation complex (PIC). Gene expression studies suggest that Bmh regulates Adr1 activity through the coactivators Mediator and Swi/Snf. Mediator recruitment appeared to occur normally, but PIC formation and function were defective, suggesting that Bmh inhibits a step between Mediator recruitment and PIC activation. Transcription is a key step in gene expression that is regulated by both internal and external cues. The basic mechanisms of this important regulatory process are conserved among eukaryotes from unicellular yeast to multicellular mammals. In addition to the need for the general transcription machinery, specific sets of genes are activated and regulated by a distinct set of promoter-specific transcription factors (TFs). 2The abbreviations used are: TFtranscription factorPICpreinitation complexDBDDNA-binding domainRDregulatory domainADactivation domainGBDGal4-DNA binding domainCTDC-terminal domainIPimmunoprecipitationRT-qPCRreverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCRhADheterologous activation domainpolpolymeraseTSStranscription start site4tU4-thiouracilTBPTATA binding protein. Studies have revealed that many genes have binding sites for more than one TF and can respond to environmental or intracellular signals by utilizing different combinations of non-redundant TFs, a process called combinatorial control. The apparent purpose of combinatorial control is to ensure that gene expression can be modulated by integrating multiple signals at the promoter. Combinatorial transcription activation could be achieved at multiple steps including cooperative activator binding and/or cooperative activation by the specific set of activators. transcription factor preinitation complex DNA-binding domain regulatory domain activation domain Gal4-DNA binding domain C-terminal domain immunoprecipitation reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR heterologous activation domain polymerase transcription start site 4-thiouracil TATA binding protein. Four prototypic transcription factor families, including nonsteroid nuclear receptors (1.Glass C.K. Differential recognition of target genes by nuclear receptor monomers, dimers, and heterodimers.Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar), MADS box-containing proteins (2.Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. The MADS-box family of transcription factors.Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), SOX proteins (3.Wegner M. From head to toes: the multiple facets of Sox proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), and POU factors (4.Herr W. Cleary M.A. The POU domain: versatility in transcriptional regulation by a flexible two-in-one DNA-binding domain.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), represent examples of combinatorial regulation of transcription in mammals. An extensively studied combinatorial transcription regulatory circuit in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is comprised of a MADS-box transcription regulator Mcm1 and one of its many cofactors. Mcm1 and its co-regulators play a prominent role in mating type determination (5.Messenguy F. Dubois E. Role of MADS box proteins and their cofactors in combinatorial control of gene expression and cell development.Gene. 2003; 316: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In most cases, the Mcm1 homodimer binds DNA cooperatively with the help of a distinct set of DNA-binding proteins to differentially regulate a specific set of genes. Another example of combinatorial regulation in S. cerevisiae is represented by the HO promoter. HO expression is activated and regulated by sequential recruitment of transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers that respond to cell cycle signals, ploidy, and mating factors (6.Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Ordered recruitment of transcription and chromatin remodeling factors to a cell cycle- and developmentally regulated promoter.Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 7.Bhoite L.T. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. The Swi5 activator recruits the Mediator complex to the HO promoter without RNA polymerase II.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Swi5 binds first in early G1 phase to the HO promoter and initiates a cascade of events through recruitment of the Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator complexes. In late G1, binding of transcription factor SBF (Swi4/Swi6) to promoter-proximal sequences results in the timely expression of HO. A different type of combinatorial regulation is illustrated by the genes of the methionine biosynthetic pathway. These genes are activated by the TF Met4 that binds DNA with the assistance of three DNA-binding proteins (Met31, Met32, and Cbf1), and one protein (Met28) that facilitates the interaction between Met4 and the DNA-binding proteins to regulate different Met pathway biosynthetic genes (8.Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Metabolism of sulfur amino acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Another example of combinatorial control of gene expression occurs in response to glucose depletion (9.Carlson M. Glucose repression in yeast.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), which results in activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase homolog, Snf1 (9.Carlson M. Glucose repression in yeast.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Snf1 targets include transcription factors, coactivator subunits, and proteins involved in post-transcriptional gene regulatory processes (10.Braun K.A. Vaga S. Dombek K.M. Fang F. Palmisano S. Aebersold R. Young E.T. Phosphoproteomic analysis identifies proteins involved in transcription-coupled mRNA decay as targets of Snf1 signaling.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: ra64Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Snf1 activates two TFs: Adr1, by promoting dephosphorylation (11.Ratnakumar S. Kacherovsky N. Arms E. Young E.T. Snf1 controls the activity of adr1 through dephosphorylation of Ser230.Genetics. 2009; 182: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and Cat8, by direct phosphorylation (12.Randez-Gil F. Bojunga N. Proft M. Entian K.D. Glucose derepression of gluconeogenic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae correlates with phosphorylation of the gene activator Cat8p.Mol. Cell.

In addition, Snf1 stimulates promoter binding of Adr1 by activating the SAGA-associated histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 (14.Abate G. Bastonini E. Braun K.A. Verdone L. Young E.T. Caserta M. Snf1/AMPK regulates Gcn5 occupancy, H3 acetylation and chromatin remodelling at S. cerevisiae ADY2 promoter.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Adr1 and Cat8 act together to regulate genes required for the use of non-fermentable carbon sources such as ethanol (ADH2, ACS1, and ALD4) and lactate (JEN1 and CYB2) (15.Tachibana C. Yoo J.Y. Tagne J.B. Kacherovsky N. Lee T.I. Young E.T. Combined global localization analysis and transcriptome data identify genes that are directly coregulated by Adr1 and Cat8.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Genes encoding peroxisomal structural proteins and enzymes of β-oxidation are regulated by Adr1 and the heterodimeric transcription factor Oaf1/Pip2 (16.Ratnakumar S. Young E.T.

Control of peroxisome proliferation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by ADR1, SNF1 (CAT1, CCR1), and SNF4 (CAT3).Yeast. 1992; 8: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Snf1 dependence of peroxisomal and β-oxidation genes, however, acts solely through Adr1 (16.Ratnakumar S. Young E.T. Snf1 dependence of peroxisomal gene expression is mediated by Adr1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10703-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In both of these examples the promoters have binding sites for both TFs (15.Tachibana C. Yoo J.Y. Tagne J.B. Kacherovsky N. Lee T.I. Young E.T. Combined global localization analysis and transcriptome data identify genes that are directly coregulated by Adr1 and Cat8.Mol. Cell.

The absence of either factor causes a 10-fold or greater decrease in mRNA abundance, suggesting that transcription is activated synergistically by the combination of both factors (16.Ratnakumar S.

Activation of Adr1- and Cat8-dependent genes requires only glucose depletion, whereas Adr1 and Oaf1/Pip2 gene activation requires both glucose depletion and a fatty acid such as oleate (21.Kal A.J. van Zonneveld A.J.

At the ADH2 promoter, Adr1 promotes Cat8 binding, but other genes that require both factors are able to bind Cat8 in the absence of Adr1 (15.Tachibana C. Yoo J.Y. Tagne J.B. Kacherovsky N. Lee T.I. Young E.T. Combined global localization analysis and transcriptome data identify genes that are directly coregulated by Adr1 and Cat8.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). No specific requirements for coactivator recruitment by Adr1 and Cat8 were identified (25.Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. Adr1 and Cat8 mediate coactivator recruitment and chromatin remodeling at glucose-regulated genes.PloS One. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that synergistic activation of transcription might act at a step after coactivator recruitment. Adr1 activity, but not its promoter binding, is regulated by the essential yeast 14-3-3 proteins known as Bmh (26.Braun K.A. Parua P.K. Dombek K.M. Miner G.E. Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins regulate combinatorial transcription following RNA polymerase II recruitment by binding at Adr1-dependent promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell.

Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins inhibit transcription activation by Adr1 through direct binding to its regulatory domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5273-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There are two functionally redundant Bmh isoforms, Bmh1 and Bmh2 (28.van Heusden G.P. Steensma H.Y. Yeast 14–3-3 proteins.Yeast. 2006; 23: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Either Bmh isoform can bind to an Adr1 regulatory domain (RD) (residues 226–240), first identified by ADR1c alleles that confer the ability to activate ADH2 expression in the presence of the repressing carbon source glucose (29.Denis C.L. Fontaine S.C. Chase D. Kemp B.E. Bemis L.T. ADR1c mutations enhance the ability of ADR1 to activate transcription by a mechanism that is independent of effects on cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of Ser-230.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ADR1c alleles prevent Bmh binding either by reducing phosphorylation of Ser-230 or by preventing another important Adr1-Bmh interaction (30.Parua P.K. Young E.T. Binding and transcriptional regulation by 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins requires residues outside of the canonical motif.Eukaryot. Cell. 2014; 13: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A Gal4-DBD (GBD)-Adr1-RD fusion protein is able to bind GAL promoters in the presence of Bmh, but transcription is inhibited (26.Braun K.A. Parua P.K. Dombek K.M. Miner G.E. Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins regulate combinatorial transcription following RNA polymerase II recruitment by binding at Adr1-dependent promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Inactivating Bmh, or preventing Bmh binding by mutating the Adr1 regulatory domain, allows abundant GAL mRNA accumulation (26.Braun K.A. Parua P.K. Dombek K.M. Miner G.E. Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins regulate combinatorial transcription following RNA polymerase II recruitment by binding at Adr1-dependent promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Bmh inhibits Adr1 activity at a step after GAL promoter binding of Gal4-Adr1 and suggest that inhibition might occur at any one of the steps requiring activation domain (AD) function such as coactivator or PIC recruitment. Evidence that Bmh could inhibit PIC activity was obtained in a yeast mutant lacking wild type histone deacetylase activity (hdacΔ). In such strains Adr1 recruited an inactive PIC that could be activated in repressing high glucose conditions by inactivating Bmh or by preventing its binding to Adr1 (26.Braun K.A. Parua P.K. Dombek K.M. Miner G.E. Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins regulate combinatorial transcription following RNA polymerase II recruitment by binding at Adr1-dependent promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31.Tachibana C. Biddick R. Law G.L. Young E.T. A poised initiation complex is activated by SNF1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37308-37315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The observation that ADR1c alleles stimulate transcription from the inactive PIC indicates that Bmh can act directly at the promoter. Further support for this interpretation was the evidence that Bmh co-occupies Adr1-dependent promoters during repressing conditions in the hdacΔ mutant. However, Bmh is also present when the promoter is fully activated by glucose depletion. The latter result suggests that Bmh could have a role in gene activation as well as in maintaining repression (26.Braun K.A. Parua P.K. Dombek K.M. Miner G.E. Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins regulate combinatorial transcription following RNA polymerase II recruitment by binding at Adr1-dependent promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The function that Bmh fulfills at the Adr1-dependent promoters after glucose depletion appears to be related to combinatorial activation of transcription. Genes that require Adr1 and either Cat8 or Oaf1/Pip2 for high levels of expression can be fully activated by Adr1 alone when either Bmh activity is absent or the Bmh binding site in the Adr1 regulatory domain is disrupted (16.Ratnakumar S. Young E.T. Snf1 dependence of peroxisomal gene expression is mediated by Adr1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10703-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25.Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. Adr1 and Cat8 mediate coactivator recruitment and chromatin remodeling at glucose-regulated genes.PloS One. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26.Braun K.A.

Young E.T. 14–3-3 (Bmh) proteins regulate combinatorial transcription following RNA polymerase II recruitment by binding at Adr1-dependent promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The latter observation demonstrates that the effect acts directly through Adr1 and is not due to interaction of Bmh with other proteins such as the Reg1-Glc7 complex (32.Dombek K.M. Kacherovsky N. Young E.T. The Reg1-interacting proteins, Bmh1, Bmh2, Ssb1, and Ssb2, have roles in maintaining glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39165-39174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Bmh has a novel function as a comodulator of transcription, enforcing combinatorial control on the expression of genes regulated by Adr1 and a second transcription factor. However the molecular mechanisms of this regulation remain unclear. Here we report that the mechanism of Bmh-mediated regulation is conserved in two different Adr1-activated systems. Bmh-mediated inhibition of transcription in the absence of a coactivating transcription factor appears to block the formation of a normal PIC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that Bmh does not inhibit Mediator recruitment. Thus, one function of Bmh may be to inhibit a step in PIC formation that occurs after Mediator recruitment. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1, and plasmids are listed in Table 2. S. cerevisiae cultures were grown in either yeast extract peptone or synthetic medium containing 5% glucose (repressing media) and lacking the appropriate amino acid or uracil for plasmid selection. For derepression, mid-log phase cells from repressing medium were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, resuspended into either yeast extract peptone or synthetic medium having 0.05% of glucose, and allowed to grow for the times indicated in Figs. 1 and 2 and for the times indicated in the legends for Figs. 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11. Oleate-inducing medium was made by adding 0.5% Tween 40 and 0.1% oleate to the derepressing medium, and induction was done for 1 h. To maintain selection for plasmids containing TRP1 and/or URA3, the synthetic selective medium contained 0.2% casamino acid rather than the standard dropout solution. All S. cerevisiae strains were grown at 30 °C unless stated otherwise. The BMH2 gene was deleted in both the wild type and mutant (bmh1-ts) strains. BMH1 carries temperature-sensitive mutations in the strain bmh1-ts (33.Lottersberger F. Rubert F. Baldo V. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 14–3-3 proteins in response to DNA damage and to DNA replication stress.Genetics. 2003; 165: 1717-1732PubMed Google Scholar). The bmh1–170(ts) allele is defective for ADH2 repression at 30 °C, although it can still grow at this temperature (27.Parua P.K. Ratnakumar S. Braun K.A. Dombek K.M. Arms E. Ryan P.M.

Thus, we used 30 °C for all of our experiments to avoid the possible complication of inducing a heat stress at 37 °C, its restrictive growth temperature.TABLE 1Strain listStrainRelevant genotypeReferenceKBY15W303–1A MATα cat8Δ::hphMX4(26.Braun K.A.

https://openalex.org/W1987779678,"RNF4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase originally identified as a transcription co-activator. The mechanism by which RNF4 promotes transcription remains unclear. In this study, I found that RNF4 antagonizes transcriptional repression mediated by DNA methylation. RNF4 does not promote DNA demethylation, but mediates the ubiquitination of MeCP2, a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) protein. Removal of MeCP2 from gene promoters activates transcription. This study thus not only uncovers how RNF4 functions as a transcription activator, but also reveals the mechanism by which MeCP2 protein stability is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2095235553,"Predator avoidance is an important component of predator-prey relationships and can affect prey availability for foraging animals. Each summer, the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator is heavily preyed upon by Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) on mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada. We conducted three complementary studies to determine if adult C. volutator exhibit predator avoidance behavior in the presence of sandpipers. In a field experiment, we monitored vertical distribution of C. volutator adults in bird exclosures and adjacent control plots before sandpipers arrived and during their stopover. We also made polymer resin casts of C. volutator burrows in the field throughout the summer. Finally, we simulated shorebird pecking in a lab experiment and observed C. volutator behavior in their burrows. C. volutator adults were generally distributed deeper in the sediment later in the summer (after sandpipers arrived). In August, this response was detectably stronger in areas exposed to bird predation than in bird exclosures. During peak predator abundance, many C. volutator adults were beyond the reach of feeding sandpipers (>1.5 cm deep). However, burrow depth did not change significantly throughout the summer. Detailed behavioral observations indicated that C. volutator spent more time at the bottom of their burrow when exposed to a simulated predator compared to controls. This observed redistribution suggests that C. volutator adults move deeper into their burrows as an anti-predator response to the presence of sandpipers. This work has implications for predators that feed on burrow-dwelling invertebrates in soft-sediment ecosystems, as density may not accurately estimate prey availability."
https://openalex.org/W2100481162,"As global temperatures increase throughout the coming decades, species ranges will shift. New combinations of abiotic conditions will make predicting these range shifts difficult. Biophysical mechanistic niche modeling places bounds on an animal’s niche through analyzing the animal’s physical interactions with the environment. Biophysical mechanistic niche modeling is flexible enough to accommodate these new combinations of abiotic conditions. However, this approach is difficult to implement for aquatic species because of complex interactions among thrust, metabolic rate and heat transfer. We use contemporary computational fluid dynamic techniques to overcome these difficulties. We model the complex 3D motion of a swimming neonate and juvenile leatherback sea turtle to find power and heat transfer rates during the stroke. We combine the results from these simulations and a numerical model to accurately predict the core temperature of a swimming leatherback. These results are the first steps in developing a highly accurate mechanistic niche model, which can assists paleontologist in understanding biogeographic shifts as well as aid contemporary species managers about potential range shifts over the coming decades."
https://openalex.org/W1967456564,"A new method based on image matching and frame coupling to handle the problems of object detection caused by a moving camera and object motion is presented in this paper. First, feature points are extracted from each frame. Then, motion parameters can be obtained. Sub-images are extracted from the corresponding frame via these motion parameters. Furthermore, a novel searching method for potential orientations improves efficiency and accuracy. Finally, a method based on frame coupling is adopted, which improves the accuracy of object detection. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method for a moving object with changing posture and with a moving camera."
https://openalex.org/W2006994272,"A sensitive and label-free analytical approach for the detection of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) instead of PCV2 antibody in serum sample was systematically investigated in this research based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with an establishment of special molecular identification membrane. The experimental device for constructing the biosensing analyzer is composed of an integrated biosensor, a home-made microfluidic module, and an electrical control circuit incorporated with a photoelectric converter. In order to detect the PCV2 using the surface plasmon resonance immunoassay, the mercaptopropionic acid has been used to bind the Au film in advance through the known form of the strong S-Au covalent bonds formed by the chemical radical of the mercaptopropionic acid and the Au film. PCV2 antibodies were bonded with the mercaptopropionic acid by covalent -CO-NH- amide bonding. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of this approach, the known concentrations of PCV2 Cap protein of 10 µg/mL, 7.5 µg/mL, 5 µg/mL, 2.5 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, and 0.5 µg/mL were prepared by diluting with PBS successively and then the delta response units (ΔRUs) were measured individually. Using the data collected from the linear CCD array, the ΔRUs gave a linear response over a wide concentration range of standard known concentrations of PCV2 Cap protein with the R-Squared value of 0.99625. The theoretical limit of detection was calculated to be 0.04 µg/mL for the surface plasmon resonance biosensing approach. Correspondingly, the recovery rate ranged from 81.0% to 89.3% was obtained. In contrast to the PCV2 detection kits, this surface plasmon resonance biosensing system was validated through linearity, precision and recovery, which demonstrated that the surface plasmon resonance immunoassay is reliable and robust. It was concluded that the detection method which is associated with biomembrane properties is expected to contribute much to determine the PCV2 in sample solutions instead of PCV2 antibody in serum samples quantitatively."
https://openalex.org/W2041488668,"Rationale In biomedical journals authors sometimes use the standard error of the mean (SEM) for data description, which has been called inappropriate or incorrect. Objective To assess the frequency of incorrect use of SEM in articles in three selected cardiovascular journals. Methods and Results All original journal articles published in 2012 in Cardiovascular Research, Circulation: Heart Failure and Circulation Research were assessed by two assessors for inappropriate use of SEM when providing descriptive information of empirical data. We also assessed whether the authors state in the methods section that the SEM will be used for data description. Of 441 articles included in this survey, 64% (282 articles) contained at least one instance of incorrect use of the SEM, with two journals having a prevalence above 70% and “Circulation: Heart Failure” having the lowest value (27%). In 81% of articles with incorrect use of SEM, the authors had explicitly stated that they use the SEM for data description and in 89% SEM bars were also used instead of 95% confidence intervals. Basic science studies had a 7.4-fold higher level of inappropriate SEM use (74%) than clinical studies (10%). Limitations The selection of the three cardiovascular journals was based on a subjective initial impression of observing inappropriate SEM use. The observed results are not representative for all cardiovascular journals. Conclusion In three selected cardiovascular journals we found a high level of inappropriate SEM use and explicit methods statements to use it for data description, especially in basic science studies. To improve on this situation, these and other journals should provide clear instructions to authors on how to report descriptive information of empirical data."
