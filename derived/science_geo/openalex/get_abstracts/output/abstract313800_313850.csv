The linear configuration of XeF(2) with the 2.00-A bond length and the vibrational force constants support the assignment of 10 electrons to the valence shell of xenon. Similar arguments support the assignment of 12 and 14 valence electrons respectively to xenon in XeF(4) and XeF(6).

Even if the last amino acid or the last eight amino acids are removed from the C terminus of the B chain of insulin, the altered insulin still reacts with human antibodies to porcine insulin; thus, the antigenic determinant of porcine insulin is located in a part of the molecule where the amino acid sequence is the same as it is in the corresponding part of the human insulin molecule."

Bed II is a sequence of lacustrine clays and laterally equivalent fluvial, eolian, and pyroclastic deposits. Bed III is made up of alluvial deposits and a laterally equivalent assemblage of fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian beds. Bed IV can be subdivided into a lower unit of fluvial clays, sandstones, and conglomerates, and an upper unit of eolian tuffs. The climate was relatively dry throughout much of the time that these beds were deposited, and semidesert or desert conditions may have prevailed at least twice. Tectonic movement seems to have taken place between the deposition of Beds III and IV."

https://openalex.org/W2047796701,"Lee Rowen and colleagues highlight in their Policy Forum (15 Sept., p. [1881][1]) their concerns with the publication of articles containing information derived from publicly available sequence data that have not yet been published in peer-reviewed primary papers. They refer to two review articles ([1][2], [2][3]) on the murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that were published before any primary papers from the data producers. In both cases, great care was taken to ensure that the source of primary sequence data was acknowledged in accordance with the guidelines set out by the hosting databases, the labs that produced the primary sequence were credited, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory/GenBank accession numbers were quoted. It should be noted that Rowen's lab was one of those involved in the primary sequencing efforts, and the decision to publish was taken after a period of consultation with all those involved, including an offer of coauthorship. Although rejected, this latter offer is in line with the “agreeable options” for etiquette-led protocols on use of third-party database entries or annotations.

At present, there is no worldwide policy governing the use of sequence data publicly available on genome databases. A major factor that was taken into consideration in the cases referred to above was the length of time that the primary sequence had been available in the public domain. We recognize that the value of work done by labs that contribute to publicly available genome data goes far beyond their skill in identifying and sequencing genes, and that they deserve priority in bringing the wider impact of these analyses to the primary literature. For the two MHC review papers referred to here, however, most of the primary sequences were deposited in the databases before the end of 1998. Sufficient time had therefore elapsed for the sequence producers to prepare, submit, and publish primary papers.

We welcome the guidelines suggested by Rowen and colleagues in their Policy Forum. However, as they themselves admit, there will be instances where data producers do not publish their analyses within a reasonable time frame and that disputes will occur. They suggest that the research community develop a policy with guidelines about the kinds of analyses for which data producers can claim priority. Additionally, we would argue for a “statute of limitations” on such priority that would define a “reasonable time frame” in which sequence producers can publish their analyses of primary data. After this set time frame—say, a year after public release of the sequence—third parties would have the right to use the data freely.

# Response {#article-title-2}

In our Policy Forum, we argued that the producers of freely available sequence data should have the right to define the scope of the primary paper they intend to write once the data-gathering effort is completed. Our discussion was prompted by the publication of the two review articles to which Bell, the editor of Immunology Today , refers. Although she is correct in stating that the data had been released for a considerable period of time, Bell does not address a key point of dissension, namely that the sequencing projects that were reviewed in the articles were not finished. In the case of Yu et al .'s review, it consisted of a comprehensive analysis of half of the human and mouse MHC class III region, an analysis that relied heavily on the annotation we provided with the data entries. The review was written while we were still sequencing the other half of the region. In the case of the review by Allcock et al ., it included a comprehensive map and gene table for the mouse MHC region, with a clear indication that the sequence of the class I region was not finished. The authors of this review preempted and ignored the publication plans of three laboratories that are collaborating on the completion of the mouse MHC locus.

There are three important issues at stake. First, we do not believe that reviews should be written on unpublished data and analyses that have not gone through the peer-review process. Preparation for publication and peer review give the data producers a chance to correct inadvertent errors in the publicly released data. Second, we do not sanction the preempting of obvious primary publications by third parties when permission to do so has been neither sought nor granted. We argue instead that publicly released data and analyses should be given respect analogous to that given to personal communications. Finally, projects such as the mouse MHC locus research are of sufficient complexity that the time frame for mapping, sequencing, and analyzing the data can be long, especially if funding resources are limited. With an immediate data release policy, some of the data will be available well before completion of the entire project. Thus, imposition of a time frame is only fair to data producers if the clock begins to tick when the data-gathering phase is done.

In sum, we endorse the policy of open data release, and we encourage third parties to make use of the data to further research. However, we maintain that the right to publish a peer-reviewed, well-defined landmark or comprehensive analysis of the primary data should be reserved for the data producers. Precedents set now will define the norms and standard practices for the future. Thus, we urge journal editors to exercise fair and reasonable judgment vis-a-vis third-party publications.

The researchers based this conclusion on their finding that some area 5 neurons fire at their fastest rates when the visual feedback from a monkey's arm matches the sensory feedback, an indication that the neurons are sensitive to both streams of information."
