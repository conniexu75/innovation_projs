https://openalex.org/W1591927171,"An oligonucleotide probe was used to isolate a clone encoding prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase (cyclooxygenase, EC 1.14.99.1) from a sheep seminal vesicle cDNA library. The protein predicted from nucleic acid sequence contains 599 amino acids including a 23-amino acid signal sequence. Thus, the mature cyclooxygenase deduced from the cDNA compares favorably in molecular size to the 70-kDa protein determined by gel electrophoresis. A putative transmembrane region and potential carbohydrate addition sites for N-linked sugars can be inferred from the amino acid sequence. Significantly, sequence similarities exist between cyclooxygenase, myeloperoxidase, and several other heme-containing proteins. The putative glycosylation sites, transmembrane domain, and sequence similarities with functionally related enzymes have been incorporated into a model for the topology of cyclooxygenase in the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1487425110,"We previously identified a 90-kDa cell surface glycoprotein, termed the class III collagen receptor (CRIII), that bound to collagen in affinity chromatography experiments (Wayner, E. A., and Carter, W. G. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1873-1884). Here, we utilize monoclonal antibodies to define three domains of the CRIII, hydrophobic transmembrane, phosphorylated cytoplasmic, and glycosylated extracellular. The domain designations are based on the following characteristics. (i) Differential extraction, phase partitioning with Triton X-114, and incorporation into liposomes all indicate that the CRIII is an intrinsic membrane receptor with a hydrophobic domain. After incorporation into liposomes the CRIII binds collagen. (ii) Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that most nucleated cells express the CRIII and that after extraction with Triton X-100, the Triton-insoluble CRIII distributes in a fibrillar pattern at the cell periphery and in closed loops that partially co-distributed with vimentin. The CRIII contains phosphoserine residues which are located on a cytoplasmic domain that may interact with the cytoskeleton. (iii) The CRIII contains 25% carbohydrate in 8-10 asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains of 2800 daltons each bound to a 65-kDa core peptide in the extracellular domain. Peptide mapping with trypsin defined a glycosylated 27-kDa extracellular fragment and a phosphorylated and glycosylated 35-kDa transmembrane fragment. These data suggest a model for the CRIII that links the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1590324536,"cDNA encoding the alpha-subunit of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was cloned from a chicken kidney cDNA library and the nucleotide sequence determined. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 92% sequence homology with the alpha-subunit of the sheep kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, and high cross-species homologies were found among nucleotide sequences both in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of the kidney-type alpha-subunit mRNAs. The cDNA was subcloned into a shuttle vector derived from pSV2CAT and was stably incorporated into mouse Ltk- cells. Expression of the avian alpha-sub-unit could be activated by culture of the cells in 10 mM butyrate. Cells expressing avian alpha-subunits displayed high-affinity ouabain binding (KD = 2.6 +/- 0.7 x 10(-7) M) and ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake, characteristic of avian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1493003808,"Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) is a small basic protein that is required for efficient integrative recombination of bacteriophage lambda. IHF binds specifically to sequences within attP, the site in bacteriophage lambda that undergoes recombination. It has been suggested that the binding of IHF creates bends in DNA so as to help attP condense into a compact structure that is activated for recombination. In this work we show that IHF binding to either of two sites found within attP does indeed produce bending of DNA. In contrast, the other recombination protein needed for integrative recombination, Int, does not appreciably bend the DNA to which it is bound. In agreement with the proposal that IHF bending is important for creating a condensed attP, bending by IHF persists in the presence of bound Int. Our conclusions about protein-directed bends in DNA are based on the study of the electrophoretic mobility of a set of permuted DNA fragments in the presence or absence of IHF and/or Int. To facilitate this study, we have constructed a novel vector that simplifies the generation of permuted fragments. This vector should be useful in studying the bending of other DNA sequences by specific binding proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1548248031,"Apolipoprotein (apo) E, an important protein involved in cholesterol transport in the plasma, binds with high specificity and high affinity to the apoB, E (low density lipoprotein) receptor. Several lines of evidence have indicated that key basic residues in the vicinity of residues 140-160 of apoE are important in mediating binding to the receptor. Furthermore, apoE variants exhibiting defective receptor binding are associated with the genetic lipid disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia. To determine whether other basic amino acids in this region of apoE also affect receptor binding activity, site-specific mutagenesis of apoE in a bacterial expression system was undertaken. This system had been used successfully to produce apoE3 that was structurally and functionally equivalent to human plasma apoE3. Variants of apoE in which neutral amino acids were substituted for basic residues at positions 136, 140, 143, and 150 were produced. The variants all displayed defective binding; their activity ranged from 9 to 52% of normal (a range similar to that seen with naturally occurring variants of human apoE). In addition, to determine whether the conformation of this region is important for receptor binding, we designed variants in which proline was substituted for leucine 144 or alanine 152. Both variants were defective, exhibiting 13 and 27% of normal binding, respectively. In contrast, a double mutant in which arginine was substituted for serine 139 and alanine for leucine 149 displayed slightly enhanced receptor binding activity. These studies confirm that the middle of the apoE molecule is important in receptor binding and indicate that only certain amino acid substitutions in this region interfere with receptor binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1656176238,"The high fidelity of chick embryo DNA polymerase-gamma (pol-gamma) observed during in vitro DNA synthesis (Kunkel, T. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12866-12874) has led us to examine this DNA polymerase for the presence of an exonuclease activity capable of proofreading errors. Highly purified chick embryo pol-gamma preparations do contain exonuclease activity capable of digesting radiolabeled DNA in a 3'----5' direction, releasing deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates. The polymerase and exonuclease activities cosediment during centrifugation in a glycerol gradient containing 0.5 M KCl. In the absence of dNTP substrates, this exonuclease excises both matched and mismatched primer termini, with a preference for mismatched bases. Excision is inhibited by the addition of nucleoside 5'-monophosphates to the digestion reaction. In the presence of dNTP substrates to permit competition between excision and polymerization from the mismatched primer, the exonuclease excises mismatched bases from preformed terminal mispairs with greater than 98% efficiency. The preference for excision over polymerization can be diminished by addition of either high concentrations of dNTP substrates or nucleoside 5'-monophosphates to the exonuclease/polymerase reaction. To determine if this exonuclease is capable of proofreading misinsertions produced during a normal polymerization reaction, a sensitive base substitution fidelity assay was developed based on reversion of an M13mp2 lacZ alpha nonsense codon. In this assay using reaction conditions that permit highly active exonucleolytic proofreading, pol-gamma exhibits a fidelity of less than one error for every 260,000 bases polymerized. As for terminal mismatch excision, fidelity is reduced by the addition to the synthesis reaction of high concentrations of dNTP substrates or nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, both hallmarks of exonucleolytic proofreading by prokaryotic enzymes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the 3'----5' exonuclease present in highly purified chick embryo pol-gamma preparations proofreads base substitution errors during DNA synthesis. It remains to be determined if the polymerase and exonuclease activities reside in the same or different polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1526108676,"Using a new expression vector that allows stable and steroid inducible expression of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor in mouse L cells, we have examined the functional significance of the highly conserved aspartate residue in the putative second transmembrane region of the receptor. Substitution of aspartate 79 with asparagine produced a mutant receptor that displays the expected affinity and stereoselectivity for antagonists but a 40-, 140-, and 240-fold reduction in its affinity for isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, respectively. This receptor mutant does not display guanine nucleotide-sensitive high affinity binding of agonists. Addition of saturating concentrations of isoproterenol to cell cultures expressing the mutant receptor produces a slight, albeit significant, increase in intracellular levels of cyclic AMP as compared to cells expressing wild type receptor. These observations demonstrate that substitution of aspartate with asparagine at residue 79 in the human beta-adrenergic receptor differentially affects the binding of catecholamines and produces a functional uncoupling of receptors and stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (Gs). These data are consistent with a role for aspartate 79 as a counterion to the amine in catecholamines and in agonist-induced activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor associated with high affinity ligand binding, Gs coupling, and adenylate cyclase stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1602448176,"Long chain bases (sphinganine and sphingosine) are potent inhibitors of protein kinase C in an in vitro mixed micelle-reconstituted system (Hannun, Y. A., Loomis, C. R., Merrill, A. H. J., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12604-12609) and block activation of the superoxide-generating respiratory burst in human neutrophils (Wilson, E., Olcott, M. C., Bell, R. M., Merrill, A. H., Jr., and Lambeth, J. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12616-12623). In the present studies, we have investigated the effects of sphinganine on cellular levels of the second messengers related to phosphoinositide turnover: diacylglycerol and calcium. We find that sphinganine added from a stock solution containing equimolar or greater bovine serum albumin had no effect on either formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated calcium fluxes or diacylglycerol generation, at levels which completely blocked activation of superoxide generation. In addition, there was no effect of sphinganine on cell viability in this concentration range. These data indicate an inhibitory effect subsequent to the generation of second messengers and are consistent with protein kinase C as the locus of action. When sphinganine was added from a stock in dimethyl sulfoxide, significant cytotoxic effects (assayed by trypan blue exclusion, release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase, and leakage of Quin2) were seen at concentrations nearer those which inhibited the respiratory burst. Cytotoxicity was inversely proportional to cell concentration and was probably due to detergent micelle formation which occurs in the absence of albumin. These studies emphasize the importance of the method of delivery and the consideration of cytotoxic effects, but indicate that long-chain bases possess potent inhibitory properties which make them useful probes of signal transduction mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1528907671,"Two type 2A protein phosphatases, phosphatases I (Mr = 180,000) and III (Mr = 177,000), were purified to near homogeneity from human erythrocyte cytosol. Phosphatase I was composed of alpha (34 kDa), beta (63 kDa), and delta (74 kDa) subunits in a ratio of 1:1:1. Phosphatase III comprised alpha, beta, and gamma (53 kDa) subunits in the same ratio. Heparin-Sepharose column chromatography converted most of phosphatase I and 20% of phosphatase III into alpha 1 beta 1 which were indistinguishable from phosphatase IV (Usui, H., Kinohara, N., Yoshikawa, K., Imazu, M., Imaoka, T., and Takeda, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10455-10463). The catalytic subunit alpha and the beta subunit of phosphatases I, III, and IV displayed identical V8 and papain peptide maps, respectively, while the peptide maps of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits were clearly distinct. The molar ratio of phosphatases I, III, and IV in erythrocyte cytosol was estimated to be 6:1:14. Comparison of molecular activities of alpha, alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 1 beta 1 delta 1, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 revealed that beta suppressed phosphorylase and P-H2B histone phosphatase activities of alpha but stimulated the P-H1 histone phosphatase activity, and delta suppressed all the phosphatase activities of alpha 1 beta 1. The gamma subunit stimulated the P-histone phosphatase activity of alpha 1 beta 1 but inhibited the phosphorylase and P-spectrin phosphatase activities. The beta subunit increased the Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirement for P-H2B histone phosphatase activity of alpha, an effect which was counteracted by delta. The effects of heparin, H1 histone, protamine, and polylysine on the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of phosphatases I, III, IV, and alpha were described and discussed in connection with the functions of the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1502757301,"The beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) kinase is a recently discovered enzyme which specifically phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the beta-adrenergic receptor. We have utilized the agonist-dependent nature of this phosphorylation reaction to characterize the ability of partial agonists to interact with the receptor. Partial agonists were tested for their ability to: 1) stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in a three-component reconstituted system, and 2) promote phosphorylation of beta AR by beta AR kinase. There is an excellent correlation between the ability of partial agonists to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity and promote receptor phosphorylation by beta AR kinase (y = 1.02x-0.01, r = 0.996, p less than 0.001). Peptide maps of receptor phosphorylated by beta AR kinase in the presence of full or partial agonists are virtually identical with the partial agonist pattern reduced in intensity. Moreover, kinetic studies of beta AR phosphorylation by beta AR kinase suggest that partial agonists alter the Vmax of the reaction with little, if any, effect on the Km. These results suggest that at steady state partial agonists transform a smaller portion of the receptor pool into the conformationally altered or activated form which serves as the substrate for beta AR kinase, although they do not completely rule out the possibility that a partial conformational change is occurring."
https://openalex.org/W1951574774,"The ability of human alpha and beta DNA polymerases and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA polymerases to insert and extend several nucleotide analogs has been investigated using a variation of Sanger-Coulson DNA sequencing technology. The analogs included the triphosphates of two antiviral nucleosides with incomplete sugar rings: 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (dhpG) and 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine (acyG or acyclovir), as well as dideoxy and arabinosyl nucleoside triphosphates. Three pairs of contrasting behaviors were found, each pair distinguishing the two human polymerases from the two viral ones: first, extension behavior with araNTPs; second, insertion/extension behavior with dhpGTP; and third, the relative preference for insertion of ddGTP versus acyGTP. The relative level of insertion of the nucleotide analogs by HCMV and HSV-2 DNA polymerases was dhpGTP greater than (acyGTP and araNTP) greater than ddGTP, whereas by human alpha polymerase it was araATP greater than ddGTP much greater than (acyGTP and dhpGTP) and by human beta polymerase it was (araATP and ddGTP) much greater than (acyGTP and dhpGTP). Evidence is presented for three mechanisms of inhibition by extendible nucleotides (of dhp and ara types) exhibiting frequent internalization: araATP acted as a simple pseudoterminator of alpha and beta polymerases, but was easily extended past singlet sites by Herpesviridae polymerases and only stalled at sites requiring two or more araATP insertions in a row. Herpesviridae polymerases stalled after adding dhpGMP and one additional nucleotide, suggesting that polymerase translocation problems may be a factor in polymerase inhibition by modified sugar nucleotide analogs. The amino acid sequence of the human alpha DNA polymerase, which is acyGTP resistant, was found to vary by one amino acid from the amino sequences of the Herpesviridae polymerases in a region of significant similarity and probable functional homology. Amino acid differences at that same site differentiate acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 mutants from the acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1 wild type."

https://openalex.org/W1584848805,"Abstract Cytochrome P-450-mediated redox cycling between the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) and diethylstilbestrol-4',4-quinone (DES Q) has previously been demonstrated. Cytochrome P-450 reductase catalyzes the reduction of DES Q presumably via a semiquinone formed by one-electron reduction. A reducing action of NAD(P)H quinone reductase (EC 1.6.99.2) mediating two-electron reduction of DES Q has been investigated in the present work. Quinone reductase catalyzed the conversion in the presence of NADH or NADPH of DES Q to 53-65% Z-DES, a marker product of reduction. Dicumarol (15 microM), a known specific inhibitor of quinone reductase, inhibited this reduction almost completely. Using microsomes from Syrian hamster kidney, a target organ of estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, the reduction of DES Q was only partially inhibited by dicumarol. Apparent Km values of quinone reductase and cytochrome P-450 reductase were 17.25 and 11.9 microM, respectively. These data demonstrate that in hamster kidney, quinone reductase and cytochrome P-450 reductase compete for the reduction of DES Q. Microsomal 02-. radical generation was stimulated 10-fold over base levels by the addition of 100 microM DES Q. The formation of 02-. radicals was inhibited by addition of superoxide dismutase (0.2 mg/ml) or by 2'-AMP or NADP, known inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 reductase. In contrast, dicumarol enhanced microsome-mediated 02-. formation. It is concluded that cytochrome P-450 reductase in hamster kidney microsomes mediates one-electron reduction of estrogen quinones to free radicals (semiquinones), which may subsequently enter redox cycling with molecular oxygen to form 02-.. Moreover, quinone reductase reduces DES Q directly to E- and Z-DES, and thus may prevent the formation of toxic intermediates during redox cycling of estrogens. Measurements of quinone reductase activity in liver and kidney of hamsters treated with estrogen for various lengths of time revealed a temporary decrease in activity by 80% specifically in the kidney after 1 month of chronic treatment with estradiol. Thus, a temporary decrease in quinone reductase activity, which occurred specifically in estrogen-exposed hamster kidney, may enhance the formation of free radical intermediates generated during biotransformation of estrogens."
https://openalex.org/W69947491,"Dihydroxy acid dehydratase, the third enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway, has been purified to homogeneity (5000-fold) from spinach leaves. The molecular weights of dihydroxy acid dehydratase as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate and native gel electrophoresis are 63,000 and 110,000, respectively, suggesting the native enzyme is a dimer. 2 moles of iron were found per mol of protein monomer. Chemical analyses of iron and labile sulfide gave an Fe/S2- ratio of 0.95. The EPR spectrum of dithionite-reduced enzyme (gavg = 1.91) is similar to spectra characteristic of Rieske Fe-S proteins and has a spin concentration of 1 spin/1.9 irons. These results strongly suggest that dihydroxy acid dehydratase contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, a novel finding for enzymes of the hydrolyase class. In contrast to the Rieske Fe-S proteins, the redox potential of the Fe-S cluster is quite low (-470 mV). Upon addition of substrate, the EPR signal of the reduced enzyme changes to one typical of 2Fe ferredoxins (gavg = 1.95), and the visible absorption spectrum of the native enzyme shows substantial changes between 400 and 600 nm. Reduction of the Fe-S cluster decreases the enzyme activity by 6-fold under Vmax conditions. These results suggest the direct involvement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of dihydroxy acid dehydratase in catalysis. Similar conclusions have been reached for the catalytic involvement of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the hydrolyase aconitase (Emptage, M. H., Kent, T. A., Kennedy, M. C., Beinert, H., and Munck, E. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 4674-4678)."
https://openalex.org/W1608095573,"High levels of receptor for intrinsic factor-cobalamin (vitamin B12) were detected in human, canine, and rat kidneys. The ratio of specific activity (picomoles/mg of protein) for kidney relative to intestine was 116, 20, and 797, respectively, in these species. The receptor was purified about 3000-fold from 200 g of rat kidney with a recovery of 16% and exhibited a single band on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Quantitative amino acid analysis of the receptor gave a value of 457,310 g of amino acid/mol of intrinsic factor-cobalamin binding activity. The pure receptor revealed an Mr of 430,000, as assessed by filtration with Bio-Gel A-5m. Treatment with papain resulted in the production of active monomers of Mr to about 205,000-210,000. Electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate confirmed the monomer Mr to be 230,000. The monomer receptor did not reveal the presence of any further subunits upon reductive alkylation. Following cyanogen bromide cleavage the kidney receptor revealed three peptides of Mr 115,000, 60,000, and 54,000. The pI of these peptides was 5.17, 6.17, and 6.17, respectively. Western blot analysis using antiserum raised to the receptor demonstrated a protein with an Mr of 175,000 and 230,000 for intestinal and kidney membrane receptors, respectively. Immunologically, the rat kidney receptor was identical to the rat ileal receptor but was distinct from the canine ileal receptor. Ultrastructural localization revealed the presence of the receptor in the apical surface membrane of proximal tubular cells of the kidney and absorptive cells of the ileum. The kidney is the best source for obtaining this receptor in reasonable quantities."
https://openalex.org/W1538753633,"Thyroid hormones exert a permissive influence on the ability of cells to respond to other hormones. In hypothyroidism, stimulation of adenylate cyclase by beta-adrenergic agonists is impaired in rat fat cells, whereas inhibition by adenosine is potentiated. The effects of thyroid status on steady-state levels of the G-protein subunits alpha-Go, alpha-Gi, and beta-G35/36 were investigated using specific antibodies and quantitative immunoblotting of rat fat cell membranes. The amount of alpha-Go (Mr 39,000, alpha-G39) detected in fat cell membranes of euthyroid rats was 44 +/- 5 pmol/mg of membrane protein (n = 5). In the hypothyroid state, the amount of the alpha-subunits of Gi (Mr 41,000, alpha-G41) and Go were found to be markedly increased in comparison to the control. The steady-state level of alpha-G41 and alpha-G39 increased more than 50 and 70%, respectively, in the hypothyroid state. The beta-subunit of G-proteins of rat fat cells appears as a doublet of proteins with Mr = 35,000/36,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of beta-G35/36 detected in fat cell membranes of euthyroid rats was 0.20 +/- 0.03 nmol/mg of protein (n = 5) and was found to increase by about 60% in the hypothyroid state. Administration of triiodothyronine in vivo (short term hyperthyroidism) resulted in a decrease in the amounts of alpha-G41 and alpha-G39 subunits (25 and 20%, respectively). In contrast to these effects of thyroid hormones on Go and Gi, the steady-state level of beta-adrenergic receptors was not significantly altered by changes in thyroid status. Thus, thyroid status in vivo can modulate the steady-state levels of specific G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1590228583,"We show in the accompanying paper that the steady-state level of free Ca2+ maintained by the organelles of permeabilized RINm5F insulinoma cells varies inversely with the ATP/ADP ratio when this ratio is set by addition of creatine phosphokinase and fixed ratios of creatine to creatine phosphate. We, therefore, asked whether acute cyclic alterations in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio in the range known to modulate O2 consumption might be involved in regulating the physiological activity of Ca2+ -ATPases and the cytosolic free Ca2+ level. To explore this hypothesis we combined two experimental systems: 1) permeabilized RINm5F insulinoma cells that can maintain a low medium Ca2+ concentration and 2) a cell-free extract of rat skeletal muscle that spontaneously exhibits oscillatory behavior of glycolysis and linked oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio, when provided with glucose. The free Ca2+ level maintained by the permeabilized cells oscillated in phase with the glycolytic oscillations and correlated closely with the ATP/ADP ratio but not with glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, orthophosphate, or pH. When glucokinase replaced hexokinase as the glucose phosphorylating enzyme, Ca2+ oscillations were induced by increasing the glucose concentration from 2 to 8 mM. The results demonstrate a link between metabolite changes and free Ca2+ levels in a reconstituted physiological system. They support a model in which oscillations in glycolysis and the ATP/ADP ratio may cause oscillations in cytosolic free Ca2+, beta-cell electrical activity, and insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1651897571,"Topoisomerase I purified from a camptothecin-resistant human leukemia cell line and from the parental, camptothecin-sensitive line were compared in vitro. Relaxation of supercoiled DNA by the wild type enzyme was inhibited in the presence of camptothecin, while the mutant enzyme was unimpaired. Camptothecin altered the cleavage pattern of the wild type but not of the mutant enzyme. The stability of cleavable complexes was studied at a preferred topoisomerase I-binding sequence recognized by both enzymes. Camptothecin greatly enhanced the kinetic stability of the cleavable complex formed by the wild type enzyme, whereas that of the mutant enzyme was only marginally affected. In the absence of camptothecin, the cleavable complex formed by the mutant enzyme was stabilized relative to that of the wild type by several criteria. Thus, the mutant enzyme cleaved the topoisomerase I recognition sequence with 2-fold higher efficiency than the wild type enzyme. The mutant cleavable complex had a higher kinetic stability and was less sensitive to salt dissociation than the wild type complex. Furthermore, the mutant enzyme formed cleavable complexes in the absence of divalent cations, which were required for complex formation by the wild type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1668096137,"cDNA clones coding for the plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha 1-inhibitor III were isolated from an acute phase rat liver library. The isolates could be divided into four groups with characteristic BamHI restriction fragment patterns. The identity of the prototype clone pRLA1I3/2J was established by comparison with the published amino acid sequence of the purified protein. It codes for a 1477-amino acid precursor polypeptide with a 24-residue signal peptide. The mature protein shares 58% overall sequence identity with rat alpha 2-macroglobulin and contains a typical internal thiolester sequence. Twenty-two of its twenty-three cysteinyl residues are conserved with alpha 2-macroglobulin implying similar tertiary structure. However, the prototype alpha 1-inhibitor III sequence differed significantly from the rat and human alpha 2-macroglobulin sequences in its bait region suggesting alpha 1-inhibitor III possesses proteinase inhibitory specificities different from those of alpha 2-macroglobulin. The variant alpha 1-inhibitor III clone pRLA1I3/2J from a second cDNA group also differed from the prototype in the bait region coding sequence, although both specify similar signal peptides and NH2 termini. The observation of variant cDNA classes suggests that acute phase rat livers produce a heterogeneous mixture of alpha 1-inhibitor III mRNA molecules. Evidence was obtained for the presence of at least four different alpha 1-inhibitor III-related genes in the rat genome. During the first 24 h of an acute phase response the abundance of hepatic alpha 1-inhibitor III mRNA was decreased 3-4-fold. This decrease was of the same order of magnitude as the reported reduction of the corresponding plasma protein concentration, suggesting that in the early phase of the acute inflammatory response the plasma concentration of this protein is mainly controlled through the abundance of its hepatic mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1608593917,"Control of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) by a Na+/H+ antiport appears a general property of most eukaryotic cells. In human platelets activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger enhances Ca2+ mobilization and aggregation induced by low concentrations of thrombin (Siffert, W., and Akkerman, J. W. N. (1987) Nature 325, 456-458). Several observations indicate that the exchanger is regulated by protein kinase C. (i) Inhibitors of protein kinase C (trifluoperazine, sphingosine) inhibit the increase in pHi seen during thrombin stimulation as well as Ca2+ mobilization; artificially increasing pHi by monensin or NH4Cl then restores Ca2+ mobilization. (ii) Direct activation of protein kinase C by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol initiates an increase in pHi that depends on the presence of extracellular Na+ and is sensitive to inhibition by ethylisopropylamiloride. The pHi sensitivity of thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization is particularly evident in the range between pH 6.8 and 7.4 and at low thrombin concentrations, whereas thrombin concentrations of more than 0.2 unit/ml bypass the pH sensitivity. In the absence of thrombin an increase in pHi, either induced artificially (by addition of the ionophores nigericin or monensin) or via activation of protein kinase C (by addition of 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol), does not induce Ca2+ mobilization. We conclude that activation of protein kinase C is essential for Ca2+ mobilization in platelets stimulated by low concentrations of thrombin and that protein kinase C exerts this effect via activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger."

Covalent modification of these proteins was specifically reduced when incubation and UV irradiation were conducted in the presence of excess unlabeled pheromone, (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienyl acetate.

The experimental results were compared with computer-calculated predictions of peptide structure, orientation, and molecular area. The complete signal sequence was found to aggregate in a beta-sheet structure when introduced in an aqueous environment; on the other hand, in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles approximately 75% alpha-helical structure was observed. Assuming this to reflect the actual structure in a peptide monolayer and taking into account the orientations predicted for the fragments, the measured molecular areas suggest a looped orientation of the signal sequence with both N and C terminus in the water phase."

The import of ws-porin into mitochondria did not require NTPs, whereas the import of bs-porin required NTPs. In other characteristics, such as binding to a specific receptor protein on the mitochondrial surface, two-step insertion into the outer membrane, and formation of specific membrane channels, ws-porin was indistinguishable from bs-porin. Thus, the acid-base treatment applied in the preparation of ws-porin can substitute for the NTP-requiring step in mitochondrial protein import. We conclude that NTPs are required for unfolding mitochondrial precursor proteins (translocation competent folding)."
https://openalex.org/W1608208747,"A photoreactive derivative of a sulfur-free bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogue, [Nle8,N-epsilon-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)Lys13,Nle18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)-NH2 (NAP-NlePTH), was purified from the products of the reaction of [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)-NH2 (NlePTH) with 4-fluoro-3-nitro-phenylazide and was used to identify binding components of the PTH receptor in clonal rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8). The purified analogue, NAP-NlePTH, is a fully active agonist in three different ROS 17/2.8 cell bioassays: 1) specific binding to saturable PTH receptors; 2) stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation; and 3) inhibition of cellular alkaline phosphatase activity; this analogue gave dose response curves parallel to and 25-33% as potent as its parent molecule, NlePTH. Radioiodinated NAP-NlePTH (125I-labeled NAP-NlePTH) retained maximal receptor-binding potency. Radioligand saturation studies in intact cells showed that the Kd of PTH receptors for the photoligand was slightly less than that for 125I-labeled NlePTH (2.8 and 0.8 nM, respectively), but that the Bmax was essentially identical for both radioligands (8 fmol/10(5) cells). Photoaffinity labeling of ROS 17/2.8 cells revealed several 125I-labeled macromolecular components by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One predominant 125I-labeled band, having an apparent Mr of 80,000 daltons (including Mr = 4,347 ligand; hereafter referred to as the Mr = 80,000 protein), was consistently demonstrated in both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Its labeling was completely inhibited by coincubation with NlePTH (10 nM) at 26-fold molar excess to the photoligand, but not by biologically inactive PTH fragments or unrelated hormone. Labeling of several other macromolecular components persisted in the presence of NlePTH (1 microM). Only the labeling of the Mr = 80,000 protein showed saturation kinetics for photoaffinity labeling; the dose of 125I-labeled NAP-NlePTH (0.8 nM) to half-saturate labeling of the Mr = 80,000 protein was close to the Kd (2.8 nM) of specific binding of the photoligand to receptors in intact ROS 17/2.8 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with NlePTH and dexamethasone led to the predicted proportional decrease or increase, respectively, in labeling of the Mr = 80,000 protein. Our data, using a highly purified photoactive derivative of PTH, having carefully defined chemical and biological properties, show a plasma membrane component of Mr = 80,000 in ROS 17/2.8 cells that possesses the affinity, binding capacity, and physiological characteristics of the PTH receptor."

In addition to a selectivity similar to that of the cyclic compounds [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin and [D-Pen2,L-Pen5]enkephalin, the affinity of [3H][D-Ser2(O-tert-butyl),Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr6 for the delta sites of rat brain membranes is significantly better (KD = 2.2 nM) than that of [3H][D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (KD approximately 8.5 nM). Therefore, [3H][D-Ser2(O-tert-butyl),Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr6 seems to be the most appropriate delta-probe currently available for binding studies. Moreover, the lipophilic and protected peptide [D-Ser2(O-tert-butyl),Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr6(O-tert-butyl) behaves as the most specific ligand for the delta-opioid binding sites and appears appropriate for in vivo investigations. The inactive analogue [D-Thr2(O-tert-butyl),Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr6 might serve as a negative control in biochemical or pharmacological studies."
https://openalex.org/W1534868275,"The effects of hormones on phosphoinositide metabolism were examined in rat adipocytes prelabeled with 32Pi or [3H]inositol. Oxytocin and vasopressin produced large decreases in labeled polyphosphoinositides and increases in phosphatidic acid and inositol phosphates, whereas insulin was without effect, although it stimulated lipogenesis from glucose. Likewise, insulin did not elevate 1,2-diacylglycerol measured chemically by high pressure liquid or thin-layer chromatography in fat cells or pads. It also did not increase the radioactivity in 1,2-diacylglycerol in ghosts prepared from fat cells previously labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, although oxytocin and vasopressin increased this. It is therefore concluded that insulin does not stimulate the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates in adipocytes and that the insulin-like actions of oxytocin must be due to other changes. Insulin induced small, but significant and equal increases (40% at 30 min) in the incorporation of [3H] inositol into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in adipocytes. The effects were not dependent upon glucose and were not evident before 15 min. Oxytocin also produced large increases in the labeling of the three phosphoinositides. Insulin stimulated the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into the three phosphoinositides and also phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine by 50-100% in cells incubated without glucose. No changes in the labeling of glycerol 3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and triacylglycerol were detected, and there was a small increase (30%) in 1,2-diacylglycerol labeling. It is concluded that insulin increases the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine in fat cells partly by stimulating a reaction(s) located between glycerol 3-phosphate and phosphatidic acid in the biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1598593069,"Stimulation of insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell by a fuel such as glucose requires the metabolism of the fuel and is accompanied by increases in oxygen consumption and intracellular free Ca2+. A very early signal for these events could be a decrease in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio due to fuel phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis the regulation of free Ca2+ was evaluated in permeabilized RINm5F insulinoma cells that sequester Ca2+ and maintain a low medium free Ca2+ concentration (set point), between 100 and 200 nM, in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. ATP, creatine, creatine phosphate, and creatine phosphokinase were added to the media to achieve various constant ratios of ATP/ADP. Free Ca2 was monitored using fura-2. The results demonstrated that the steady-state free Ca2+ concentration varied inversely with the ATP/ADP ratio and orthophosphate (Pi) levels. In contrast, no correlation between free Ca2+ and the phosphorylation potential (ATP/ADP.Pi) was found. Regulation of the Ca2+ set point by the ATP/ADP ratio was observed at ratios between 5 and 50 and at Pi concentrations between 1 and 7 mM, irrespective of whether mitochondria were participating in Ca2+ sequestration or were inhibited. Increasing the ATP/ADP ratio stimulated Ca2+ uptake by the nonmitochondrial pool but did not modify Ca2+ efflux. Glucose 6-phosphate (1 mM) had no effect on the Ca2+ set point. The data suggest that variations in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio induced by fuel stimuli may regulate Ca2+ cycling across nonmitochondrial compartments and the plasma membrane by modulating the activity of Ca2+ -ATPases. A mechanism linking fuel metabolism and cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio to activation of the Ca2+ messenger system in pancreatic beta-cells is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1562969614,"In the preceding article, we described physicochemical and kinetic properties of parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptors in clonal rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) using photoaffinity ligand labeling and showed that the physiologically relevant receptor-ligand complex has an apparent Mr = 80,000. In this study, the photoaffinity labeled Mr = 80,000 receptor was localized exclusively on the cell surface plasma membrane and its glycoprotein nature was demonstrated through the use of lectin affinity-chromatography and specific exo- and endoglycosidases. Rinsing ROS cells, preincubated in the dark with 125I-labeled [Nle8, N-epsilon-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)Lys13,Nle18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)-NH2 (NAP-NlePTH) (4 h, 15 degrees C, equilibrium conditions) with acidic phosphate-buffered saline (pH 2.5, 30 s, 4 degrees C) before photolysis resulted in selective and nearly total disappearance of the labeled Mr = 80,000 receptor. PTH receptor integrity to acid rinsing and photolysis was shown by relabeling the Mr = 80,000 receptor after a second incubation of these cells with 125I-labeled NAP-NlePTH, followed by photolysis. Adsorption of Triton X-100-solubilized, 125I-labeled NAP-NlePTH receptors to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose is nearly complete and highly selective, and elution with N-acetylglucosamine resulted in virtually total recovery of the labeled receptors from the column. The wheat germ agglutinin-retarded PTH receptors show increased electrophoretic mobility upon treatment with neuraminidase which was inhibited by simultaneous addition of 2,3-dehydro-3-desoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid, a specific neuraminidase inhibitor. Endoglycosidase F treatment of the Mr = 80,000 receptors generated a single, labeled polypeptide with a Mr = 59,000 which migrated as a narrow band. PTH receptors on ROS 17/2.8 cells appear to be monomeric plasma membrane glycoproteins with an apparent Mr of 80,000 which contain a Mr = 59,000 polypeptide backbone and a polymeric arrangement of N-acetylglucosamine with N-acetylneuraminic acid as major terminal sugar residues."
https://openalex.org/W1552247157,"These studies compared the regulation of expression of the two nonallelic rat insulin genes in vivo. The relative abundance of mRNAs for rat insulins I and II was the same in sucrose-treated and fasted rats despite 2-fold higher total insulin mRNA levels in sucrose-treated groups. The ratio of rat insulin I to rat insulin II mRNA also remained constant when demand for insulin was increased by pregnancy, administration of dexamethasone, or excess growth hormone. The two mRNAs for insulin appeared at the same time during fetal pancreatic development, increased in constant proportion to maximum values during the neonatal period, and fell in tandem to adult values by age 6 weeks. Taken together, these data suggest that similar or identical mechanisms modulate steady-state levels of both insulin mRNAs in rats. Concentrations of precursors for each mRNA were also greater in sucrose-treated rats, indicating that changes in mRNA concentrations were mediated at least in part by changes in either gene transcription rates or in mRNA precursor stability."
https://openalex.org/W1594607082,"Abstract The metabolism of D-glucose is believed to initiate and regulate insulin secretion by islet beta-cells, although the identity of the metabolite which couples glucose metabolism to the cellular events involved in insulin secretion is unknown. An alternative hypothesis involves the presence of a glucoreceptor for which there has been no biochemical evidence. We have investigated whether glucose recognition by the beta-cell is coupled to phospholipase C. We have used digitonin-permeabilized, [3H]inositol-prelabeled islets to study glucose and carbachol activation of phospholipase C. In this model, carbachol recognition by its muscarinic receptor was coupled to phospholipase C activation. D-Glucose (but not L-glucose) also stimulated phospholipase C activity in these permeabilized islets. This effect was not due to glucose metabolism since glucose 6-phosphate did not affect phospholipase C activity and since phosphorylation of [3H]glucose was not detectable in digitonin-permeabilized islets. Glucose had no effect on the myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-5-phosphatase or 3-kinase activities. In the absence of agonist, free Ca2+ concentrations between 0.1 and 1 microM (as determined with a Ca2+-specific electrode) did not influence phospholipase C activity. Stimulation of phospholipase C activity by either carbachol or glucose required Ca2+ in the submicromolar range and was optimal at 0.5 microM free Ca2+.myo-Inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate production from permeabilized islets was synergistically augmented by Ca2+ (0.5-10 microM) and glucose. Phospholipase C activity in islets is therefore not directly activated by free Ca2+ concentrations in the submicromolar range. Furthermore, glucose per se activates phospholipase C activity independently of glucose metabolism. A working hypothesis based on these findings is that glucose is recognized by a site which is coupled to phospholipase C in islets."
https://openalex.org/W1576604779,"The T lymphocytes that expand with age in the peripheral lymphoid organs of autoimmune disease-prone mice homozygous for the lpr mutation display deficient activation and proliferation in response to mitogenic lectins or antigen. In the present study, an attempt was made to correlate the deficient agonist-induced proliferation of these lpr T cells with early transmembrane signaling events mediated by receptor-coupled phosphoinositide hydrolysis. lpr T cells were capable of binding the agonistic lectin, phytohemagglutinin, in a normal manner. In addition, they expressed on their surface the antigen-specific T cell receptor-CD3 complex, which is required for T cell activation, albeit at a lower density than that found on congenic +/+ T cells. Furthermore, lpr T cells contained normal levels of the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme, protein kinase C, and the enzyme was translocated from the cytosol to the particulate fraction upon phorbol ester treatment. On the other hand, the lpr T cells displayed a markedly deficient agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in comparison with their congenic +/+ counterparts, as indicated by the minimal accumulation of the phosphoinositide-derived second messengers, inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. The defective step(s) in transmembrane signaling was bypassed by a combination of phorbol ester plus Ca2+ ionophore, which reconstituted proliferative responses of lpr T cells to normal levels, suggesting that: (a) the phosphoinositide signaling pathway plays an obligatory role in T cell activation; and (b) signaling events subsequent to phosphoinositide hydrolysis are, for the most part, intact in lpr T cells. The deficient step(s) in lpr T cell activation precedes, therefore, the generation of phosphoinositide-derived second messengers and could be due to defective function of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, GTP-binding proteins, and/or phosphoinositide-specific phosphodiesterase. It remains to be determined whether the deficient signaling event(s) in lpr T cells is a direct pathologic consequence of the lpr gene, or rather, reflects the immature status of a normally minor thymic subset that is aberrantly exported and expanded in lpr mice."
https://openalex.org/W1623176633,The saturation magnetizations of the three iron cluster of ferredoxin II of Desulfovibrio gigas in both the oxidized and reduced states have been studied at fixed magnetic fields up to 4.5 tesla over the temperature range from 1.8 to 200 K. The low field (0.3 tesla) susceptibility of oxidized ferredoxin II obeys the Curie law over this entire temperature range. This establishes -2Jox greater than 200 cm-1 as the lower limit for the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of oxidized ferredoxin II. The saturation magnetizations of reduced ferredoxin II at several fixed fields yield a nested family of curves which can be fit with spin S = 2 and D = -2.7(4) cm-1 (with E/D assigned the value 0.23 as determined by Mossbauer and EPR spectra). The low field susceptibility of reduced ferredoxin II also obeys the Curie law from approximately 4 up to 200 K. This establishes -2Jred greater than 40 cm-1 as the lower limit for the antiferromagnetic coupling of reduced ferredoxin II.
https://openalex.org/W1920099854,"Abstract Pig gastric membrane vesicles enriched in (H+ + K+)-ATPase were covalently modified with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). The modification resulted in inhibition of K+-dependent ATP hydrolysis, formation of phosphoenzyme and ATP-driven H+-uptake catalyzed by (H+ + K+)-ATPase. ATP, ADP, and adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate were protective ligands, whereas Mg2+ and K+ were not. Specific PLP-binding of about 4.5 nmol/mg membrane protein was necessary for complete inhibition of the enzyme activity, indicating that the stoichiometry of PLP-binding to the enzyme was about 1:1. Limited proteolysis of the enzyme modified with [3H]PLP by trypsin suggests that PLP specifically modifies the lysine residue located in the 16-kDa fragment of the enzyme cleaved by trypsin. These results suggested that PLP binds to a specific lysine residue in the nucleotide-binding site or a region in its vicinity and inhibits the substrate binding or phosphorylation step of (H+ + K+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1573963235,"The primary envelope (env) gene product of the polycythemia-inducing variant of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (F-SFFVP), representing a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 52,000 (gp52), was isolated from F-SFFVP-infected normal rat kidney cells metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose in the presence or absence of glucose. Structures of the oligosaccharides present were determined by micromethylation analysis, acetolysis, and digestion with exoglycosidases. Gp52 radiolabeled in the presence of glucose contains solely oligomannosidic glycans comprising 6 to 9 mannose residues (Man6-9GlcNAc2), some of which carry additional glucose. The structures of the glycans found reflect the typical intermediates of oligosaccharide processing. The glycosylation of gp52 isolated from glucose-deprived cells (-Glc), however, is characterized by increased amounts of Man5-7 species comprising other structural isomers. Only gp52 (-Glc) glycans are, in part, further processed yielding incomplete complex-type oligosaccharides. Our results demonstrate that the limited post-translational processing of the primary F-SFFVP env gene product is neither due to aberrant trimming of its oligomannosidic glycans nor due to transfer of immature lipid-linked oligosaccharide-intermediates as observed in glucose-starved cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601889844,"Autolysis or tryptic hydrolysis converts human alpha-thrombin to its beta-derivative and subsequently to gamma-thrombin. Human beta-thrombin was obtained by tryptic digestion of alpha-thrombin and isolated by BioRex chromatography. The kinetic parameters for human alpha- and beta-thrombins with H-D-phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-L-arginine-para-nitroanilide were similar, as well as the rate of inactivation by tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone. By contrast, the rate of inactivation by diisopropyl fluorophosphate was reduced by half, and the inhibition constant for benzamidine was increased 2.5-fold. Moreover, the beta cleavages induced a drastic reduction in reactivity toward protein C, affinity for thrombomodulin, and fibrinogen clotting activity. Unlike alpha-thrombin, beta-thrombin was not protected from inhibition by diisopropyl fluorophosphate in the presence of fibrinogen and failed to bind to fibrin-Sepharose. Our results indicate that the beta cleavages induce multiple defects in the functions of human thrombin. Although the three catalytic residues remain in an active configuration, subtle changes are induced in the microenvironment of the active serine. However, the drastic reduction of fibrinogen clotting activity should rather be ascribed to major alterations observed in both the fibrinopeptide groove and the fibrin recognition site. These observations provide further evidence for a double-site mechanism in the interaction of fibrinogen with thrombin."

The effects of F- on the kinetics of O2 reduction were examined to determine the catalytic roles of the copper sites. Under steady-state conditions, F- rapidly inhibits the oxidation of dimethylphenylenediamine. Both reductant-dependent and -independent steps are inhibited. Rapid-freeze ESR spectra under steady-state conditions showed that F- decreased the steady-state concentrations of oxidized type 1 copper and oxidized type 2 copper while increasing the concentration of an oxygen radical intermediate. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were used to determine the catalytic step(s) affected by F-. The most significant effect of F- was on the reductant-dependent rate of reduction of the type 3 site. While a strictly first-order dependence was observed in the absence of F-, a hyperbolic dependence was detected in the presence of F- indicating a limiting reductant-independent step. The steady-state kinetic rapid-freeze ESR and stopped-flow kinetic data are consistent with the implicated step being the reduction of the oxygen radical in an intermediate containing reduced type 1 and reduced type 2 copper. The results suggest a role for the type 2 Cu(I) site in binding the oxygen radical and catalyzing its reduction to H2O."
https://openalex.org/W1583656667,"Transmembrane signaling by chemoattractants in leukocytes appears to require activation of phosphoinositide metabolism with subsequent generation of the second messenger substances, inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. In addition, previous studies have shown that conditions which lead to an intracellular increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), a by-product and competitive inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine-mediated methylation reactions, inhibit all chemoattractant-mediated functions of leukocytes, suggesting that AdoHcy also interferes with chemoattractant transmembrane signaling. In the present study, we determined whether AdoHcy altered the metabolism of phosphoinositides in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Treatment of 32P-labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes with the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, plus exogenous adenosine and L-homocysteine thiolactone, conditions which cause an increase in AdoHcy, produced as much as a 37% decrease in the amount of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate associated with the cells. The formation of inositol bisphosphate was inhibited by as much as 45% by erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, adenosine, and L-homocysteine thiolactone suggesting decreased availability of phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate. In support of this, AdoHcy, in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mM, inhibited the transfer of gamma-32P from gamma-[32P] ATP to phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). The inhibition of PtdIns kinase was competitive with an apparent Ki for AdoHcy of 43 microM. Increased intracellular AdoHcy reduced chemoattractant-mediated increases in inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate formation suggesting abrogation of transmembrane signaling. These findings for the first time demonstrate that AdoHcy is a competitive inhibitor of PtdIns kinase and thus a regulator of the phosphoinositide pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1603038364,"Abstract The two types of the rat kininogen genes show different modes of mRNA production. The K gene encodes two distinct mRNAs for high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) kininogens. These two mRNAs are generated by differential usage of the 3'-terminal exon (LMW exon) and the one next to this exon (HMW exon) through alternative polyadenylation and splicing. In contrast, the two T genes selectively generate the LMW form of the mRNA, although the T genes are extremely homologous to the K gene, including the sequence (psi HMW region) corresponding to the HMW exon of the K gene. In this study, we constructed a series of chimeric kininogen genes by exchanging equivalent restriction fragments of the K and T genes and examined the sequences and the mechanisms governing the different expression patterns of the kininogen genes by introducing the chimeric genes into heterologous COS cells. The results indicate that the formation of the two forms of the mRNA is controlled by two separate 3' sequences of the kininogen genes. One is located within the internal sequence of the HMW/psi HMW region, whereas the other is within the LMW exon and its preceding region. Our data also suggest that the different expression patterns of the kininogen genes are primarily governed by differing splicing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1545841043,"alpha-Thalassemia trait is common in Black Americans; the (-alpha) haplotype occurs in 30% of that population. However, hemoglobin H disease (genotype:- -/-alpha) is very uncommon due to the rarity of the (- -) haplotype. A subject with HbH-HbG Philadelphia (alpha 2(68)Asn—-Lys) synthesized only alpha G and no alpha A. Digestion of DNA with BamHI produced a single 10-kilobase (kb) alpha-specific fragment. Her son had alpha-thalassemia trait, did not make HbG Philadelphia, and demonstrated 14- and 10-kb alpha fragments upon BamHI digestion. Since the 14-kb fragment could not have been inherited from the mother, the son apparently received from her a chromosome bearing a single nonfunctional (alpha T) gene. Therefore, the two genotypes are: mother (-alpha G/-alpha T), son (-alpha T/alpha alpha). A 16-kb BglII fragment, containing the gene of interest from the son, was cloned into the BamHI site of phage EMBL 3 followed by subcloning of a 1.5-kb PstI alpha-specific fragment into plasmid pBR322. The mutant alpha gene demonstrated a deletion of an AG dinucleotide from the tandem repeat normally occurring in the Glu-Arg codons 30 and 31 at the junction of the first exon with intervening sequence 1. The loss of two nucleotides leads to a reading frameshift and a totally novel amino acid coding sequence in the second exon from codons 31-54 followed by the appearance of a chain termination codon (TAA) at position 55. No complete globin chain can be produced from this gene. HbH disease in this Black family is thus due to the combination of gene deletion and a nonfunctional alpha gene."

A mutant promoter, with base substitutions at positions contacted by AraC, was used to isolate suppressor mutations in araC by direct selection. Two hydroxylamine-induced araC mutations were isolated repeatedly; each contained a single amino acid substitution. When tested against a set of base substitution promoter mutants, one revertant, an Arg to His substitution at residue 250, displayed altered base specificity for a single position within the araBAD promoter. The other revertant, a Cys to Tyr substitution at residue 204, did not show consistent base-specific suppression. Neither demonstrated a higher affinity than the wild type protein for the mutant promoter in vitro. Both proteins suppress mutant sequences by a mechanism that does not appear to involve the formation of new net favorable contacts with the mutant base pairs of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1537146940,"A variety of nitrogenous compounds broaden the activity versus pH profile for the peroxidation of dianisidine catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but not by myeloperoxidase, chloroperoxidase, Escherichia coli hydroperoxidase I, methemoglobin, or microperoxidases. The peroxidation of dianisidine catalyzed by cytochrome c peroxidase was affected by the nitrogenous compounds, but to a lesser extent than was the action of HRP. The peroxidations of a variety of phenols by HRP exhibited broad activity versus pH profiles and were unaffected by the nitrogenous compounds. The energy of activation for the peroxidation of dianisidine by HRP was unaffected by changes of pH in the range 6.5-8.5 and was unchanged by the presence of the nitrogenous compounds. The nitrogenous compounds markedly increased Vm for the peroxidation of dianisidine by HRP, but did not change the slope of Lineweaver-Burk plots of kinetic data. These results are accommodated by a mechanism in which nitrogenous compounds hydrogen-bond to the distal histidine of HRP and in so doing raise its pK alpha. Since the acid form of the distal histidine is thought to facilitate peroxidations catalyzed by HRP by hydrogen bonding to the ferryl oxygen of compound II, raising its pK alpha broadens the activity versus pH profile for the peroxidation of anilino substrates, such as dianisidine. We propose that phenolic substrates hydrogen-bond directly to the ferryl oxygen, thus displacing the distal histidine and eliminating the possibility of being influenced by nitrogenous compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1543756376,"Previously we have shown that atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) are phosphorylated at Ser-104 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (Rittenhouse, J. Moberly, L., O'Donnell, M.E., Owen, N.E., and Marcus, F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7607-7610). In our present study, atrial natriuretic peptide prohormone (pro-ANP) purified from extracts of rat atria that had been incubated in situ with [32P]orthophosphate was found to be phosphorylated. The site of in situ phosphorylation was localized to the ANP region of the prohormone and was further delineated to a chymotryptic peptide having the same retention time by high performance liquid chromatography as the hexapeptide Arg101-Arg102-Ser103-Ser(P)104-Cys105-Phe106+ ++. This hexapeptide was also formed from in vitro phosphorylated pro-ANP and synthetic ANP. It is thus likely that Ser-104 is the site of phosphorylation of pro-ANP both in situ and in vitro. Incubation of atria with intracellular cyclic AMP-elevating agents consistently increased the specific radioactivity of the resulting purified pro-ANP by 5-10-fold. However, the overall extent of phosphorylation was low, suggesting that a subpopulation of pro-ANP molecules are phosphorylated at Ser-104 by a cyclic AMP-mediated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1552049385,"We measured an electronic change at cysteine ligand(s) of the CuA2+ center brought on by reduction of other metal centers within cytochrome c oxidase, notably cytochrome a.

The electron nuclear double resonance ENDOR signals of these beta-protons had previously been assigned through study of selectively deuterated yeast oxidase. In the present study the ENDOR signals of the CuA2+ center were compared from the following forms of oxidase: resting (a3+.CuA2+.a3+3.CuB2+); mixed valence, 2-electron-reduced CO-ligated oxidase (a3+.CuA2+.a2+3CO.CuB+), and a more completely reduced mixed-valence CO-ligated oxidase. In agreement with previous studies on 3-electron-reduced oxidase, the latter more completely reduced oxidase showed cytochrome a preferentially reduced with respect to CuA, implying that the majority of paramagnetic CuA2+ centers had reduced cytochrome a partners. The ENDOR-resolved splitting of the beta-proton hyperfine features substantially decreased in going from the first two more oxidized forms to the more fully reduced latter form. Thus, the electronic structure of the CuA2+ center specifically monitored by hyperfine couplings to cysteine protons changed in response to a reductive event elsewhere in the protein. This structural change may correlate with the anticooperative redox interaction recently reported between cytochrome a and CuA."
https://openalex.org/W1561843287,"Type II DNA topoisomerases isolated from posterior silk glands of Bombyx mori and HeLa cells utilize ATP for unknotting of knotted DNA, relaxation of super-coiled DNA, and catenation/decatenation of circular duplex DNA under catalytic conditions. In these reactions, ATP cannot be replaced by GTP. However, GTP induces knotting, catenation, relaxation, but decatenation of circular duplex DNA by stoichiometric amounts of these enzymes. Only a limited round of the reactions proceeds with a concomitant hydrolysis of GTP and then pauses. The GTP-dependent reactions may be employed for maintenance of the knotted and/or catenated state they formed."
https://openalex.org/W1503769621,We have investigated the interaction of ligands in the active site of the angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit lung by monitoring the concurrent effects of two inhibitors on enzyme activity. A strong synergism is found in the binding of N-acetyl-L-proline (an analog of the COOH-terminal dipeptide portion of preferred substrates) and acetohydroxamate (a zinc ligand). Analysis of the inhibition data with the Yone-tani-Theorell plot yields an unusually low value of 0.0063 for the interaction constant (alpha). This result indicates that each of the above ligands stimulates the binding of the other by about 150-fold. Similar but often less pronounced synergism is observed for other zinc ligands and with some other N-acyl amino acids. These specific structural requirements suggest that the above effect is associated with an induced-fit mechanism which brings the important zinc atom into a catalytically optimal state only in the presence of certain preferred substrates.
