https://openalex.org/W1975854652,"Brian, Curtis and Hemming1 have recently reported the production by Penicillium Janczewskii of a factor having little antibiotic action but causing characteristic distortion of fungal hyphæ growing in its presence. This substance, isolated in a crystalline state and given the formula C20H20O92, has been termed âcurling factor. The description and illustrations of the stunting and curling caused by this factor are strongly reminiscent of the appearance of hyphal tips growing in the presence of a number of relatively simple inhibitory substances (notably methyl p-hydroxybenzoate3) encountered by me during the course of fungistatic investigations using Aspergillus niger, Penicillium roqueforti and Byssochlamys fulva. Brian, Curtis and Hemming, while referring to earlier records of similar morphological effects caused by the metabolic products of organisms, consider their effect to be distinct from any previously described for pure chemicals. I consider that the behaviour of the esters referred to above is likely to come into the same class of phenomenon as claimed for 'curling factor'."

https://openalex.org/W2036708086,"During the course of some observations designed to determine the most suitable conditions for maintaining the workers of Coptotermes curvignathus (the termite pest of Hevea brasiliensis) in captivity, the development of an unusually high death-rate in one of the treatments led to an examination which disclosed that the insects had been parasitized by an entomophthoraceous fungus. The causal organism was isolated, and cultivated without difficulty on standard media and on rice-bran."

At 30° C. the rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated with benzyl hyponitrite is approximately thirty times as fast as the rate observed with an equal amount of benzoyl peroxide."

https://openalex.org/W2017640792,"A METHOD of obtaining protein macro-molecules in crystalline form by the use of heparin has been described by Cohen1. As melanin is generally believed to have a high molecular weight, an attempt has been made to crystallize it by Cohen's method, using ethylene chlorhydrin as solvent. Heparin is not soluble to any appreciable extent in pure ethylene chlorhydrin ; but both it and melanin are soluble in a mixture of equal parts of water and ethylene chlorhydrin. 'Dopa' and Sepia melanin have been used, with concentrations of heparin of 1, 2, 5, and 10 percent, with and without addition of electrolyte (sodium chloride), at temperatures varying from 20° to 20° C. The attempt has failed completely, no precipitate being observed under any conditions even after standing for seven days."

https://openalex.org/W2090867420,"As a representative of Psyllid I selected Psylla mali, which, feeding on the apple tree, was easily available for investigation, and also for confirmatory work by other investigators. Profft1 has published the best account that has appeared on symbiosis in this group of insects. On p. 312, in Fig. 19, he illustrates a section of the bacteriotome, called by him, in conformity with others, a mycetome. Unfortunately, the magnification of the section is only 165, which is exceptionally low for any cytological study. Further, he does not give any illustration of the symbiotes as seen in a smear of the tumour. In his illustration the majority of the tumour cells contain curved dark-staining objects. When I studied them in smears, stained with Giemsa, they appeared to be thick comma-shaped bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2082449059,"While making a comparative study of the colour reaction of steroids and triterpenes, we have found a hitherto undescribed reaction produced by the D vitamins, producing a clear and limpid blue colour which we think might be used for quantitative estimations. We carry out Pettenkofer's reaction for the biliary acids as follows: to 1–2 mgm. calciferol is added 1-2 mgm. saccharose, and the whole is dissolved completely in 1–2 c.c. of absolute ethanol. Then we add two drops of concentrated sulphuric acid, giving a red colour; then six drops of sulphuric acid are added, giving a stark blue colour. The test-tube is shaken to mix the two layers. The colour diffuses throughout the liquid, and the definitive colour is a pale limpid blue."
