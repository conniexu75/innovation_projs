https://openalex.org/W2158130856,"Simple perceptual tasks have laid the groundwork for understanding the neurobiology of decision-making. Here, we examined this foundation to explain how decision-making circuitry adjusts in the face of a more difficult task. We measured behavioral and physiological responses of monkeys on a two- and four-choice direction-discrimination decision task. For both tasks, firing rates in the lateral intraparietal area appeared to reflect the accumulation of evidence for or against each choice. Evidence accumulation began at a lower firing rate for the four-choice task, but reached a common level by the end of the decision process. The larger excursion suggests that the subjects required more evidence before making a choice. Furthermore, on both tasks, we observed a time-dependent rise in firing rates that may impose a deadline for deciding. These physiological observations constitute an effective strategy for handling increased task difficulty. The differences appear to explain subjects' accuracy and reaction times."

https://openalex.org/W2038979071,"Recycled oceanic crust, with or without sediment, is often invoked as a source component of continental and oceanic alkaline magmas to account for their trace-element and isotopic characteristics. Alternatively, these features have been attributed to sources containing veined, metasomatized lithosphere. In melting experiments on natural amphibole-rich veins at 1.5 gigapascals, we found that partial melts of metasomatic veins can reproduce key major- and trace-element features of oceanic and continental alkaline magmas. Moreover, experiments with hornblendite plus lherzolite showed that reaction of melts of amphibole-rich veins with surrounding lherzolite can explain observed compositional trends from nephelinites to alkali olivine basalts. We conclude that melting of metasomatized lithosphere is a viable alternative to models of alkaline basalt formation by melting of recycled oceanic crust with or without sediment."
https://openalex.org/W2164513774,"To understand the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease, we analyzed an experimental mouse model of chronic lung disease with pathology that resembles asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in humans. In this model, chronic lung disease develops after an infection with a common type of respiratory virus is cleared to only trace levels of noninfectious virus. Chronic inflammatory disease is generally thought to depend on an altered adaptive immune response. However, here we find that this type of disease arises independently of an adaptive immune response and is driven instead by interleukin-13 produced by macrophages that have been stimulated by CD1d-dependent T cell receptor–invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells. This innate immune axis is also activated in the lungs of humans with chronic airway disease due to asthma or COPD. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease with the discovery that the transition from respiratory viral infection into chronic lung disease requires persistent activation of a previously undescribed NKT cell–macrophage innate immune axis."

We demonstrate that periodic wrinkling is only one possible solution for such strained membranes. Folds, which involve highly localized curvature, appear whenever the membrane is compressed beyond a third of its initial wrinkle wavelength. Eventually the surface transforms into a symmetry-broken state with flat regions of membrane coexisting with locally folded points, reminiscent of a crumpled, unsupported membrane. We provide general scaling laws for the wrinkled and folded states and proved the transition with numerical and experimental supported membranes. Our work provides insight into the interfacial stability of such diverse systems as biological membranes such as lung surfactant and nanoparticle thin films."
https://openalex.org/W2035550470,"Non-human primates are valuable for modelling human disorders and for developing therapeutic strategies; however, little work has been reported in establishing transgenic non-human primate models of human diseases. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairment, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric disturbances followed by death within 10-15 years of the onset of the symptoms. HD is caused by the expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG, translated into glutamine) trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the human huntingtin (HTT) gene. Mutant HTT with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues, but causes selective neurodegeneration that is most prominent in the striatum and cortex of the brain. Although rodent models of HD have been developed, these models do not satisfactorily parallel the brain changes and behavioural features observed in HD patients. Because of the close physiological, neurological and genetic similarities between humans and higher primates, monkeys can serve as very useful models for understanding human physiology and diseases. Here we report our progress in developing a transgenic model of HD in a rhesus macaque that expresses polyglutamine-expanded HTT. Hallmark features of HD, including nuclear inclusions and neuropil aggregates, were observed in the brains of the HD transgenic monkeys. Additionally, the transgenic monkeys showed important clinical features of HD, including dystonia and chorea. A transgenic HD monkey model may open the way to understanding the underlying biology of HD better, and to the development of potential therapies. Moreover, our data suggest that it will be feasible to generate valuable non-human primate models of HD and possibly other human genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2109603802,"The variability of bird beak morphology reflects diverse foraging strategies. One such feeding mechanism in shorebirds involves surface tension–induced transport of prey in millimetric droplets: By repeatedly opening and closing its beak in a tweezering motion, the bird moves the drop from the tip of its beak to its mouth in a stepwise ratcheting fashion. We have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency. We also highlight the critical dependence of the capillary ratchet on the beak's wetting properties, thus making clear the vulnerability of capillary feeders to surface pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W2027704011,"The mammalian circadian clockwork is modeled as transcriptional and posttranslational feedback loops, whereby circadian genes are periodically suppressed by their protein products. We show that adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) signaling constitutes an additional, bona fide component of the oscillatory network. cAMP signaling is rhythmic and sustains the transcriptional loop of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, determining canonical pacemaker properties of amplitude, phase, and period. This role is general and is evident in peripheral mammalian tissues and cell lines, which reveals an unanticipated point of circadian regulation in mammals qualitatively different from the existing transcriptional feedback model. We propose that daily activation of cAMP signaling, driven by the transcriptional oscillator, in turn sustains progression of transcriptional rhythms. In this way, clock output constitutes an input to subsequent cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2098643925,"The Ashwell receptor, the major lectin of hepatocytes, rapidly clears from blood circulation glycoproteins bearing glycan ligands that include galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine. This asialoglycoprotein receptor activity remains a key factor in the development and administration of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals, yet a biological purpose of the Ashwell receptor has remained elusive. We have identified endogenous ligands of the Ashwell receptor as glycoproteins and regulatory components in blood coagulation and thrombosis that include von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelets. The Ashwell receptor normally modulates vWF homeostasis and is responsible for thrombocytopenia during systemic Streptococcus pneumoniae infection by eliminating platelets desialylated by the bacterium's neuraminidase. Hemostatic adaptation by the Ashwell receptor moderates the onset and severity of disseminated intravascular coagulation during sepsis and improves the probability of host survival."
https://openalex.org/W2069989784,"It is now well established that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the calcium sensor of endoplasmic reticulum stores required to activate store-operated calcium entry (SOC) channels at the surface of non-excitable cells. However, little is known about STIM1 in excitable cells, such as striated muscle, where the complement of calcium regulatory molecules is rather disparate from that of non-excitable cells. Here, we show that STIM1 is expressed in both myotubes and adult skeletal muscle. Myotubes lacking functional STIM1 fail to show SOC and fatigue rapidly. Moreover, mice lacking functional STIM1 die perinatally from a skeletal myopathy. In addition, STIM1 haploinsufficiency confers a contractile defect only under conditions where rapid refilling of stores would be needed. These findings provide insight into the role of STIM1 in skeletal muscle and suggest that STIM1 has a universal role as an ER/SR calcium sensor in both excitable and non-excitable cells."

https://openalex.org/W2121407329,"Transcription of the bacterial genome by the RNA polymerase must terminate at specific points. Transcription can be terminated by Rho factor, an essential protein in enterobacteria. We used the antibiotic bicyclomycin, which inhibits Rho, to assess its role on a genome-wide scale. Rho is revealed as a global regulator of gene expression that matches Escherichia coli transcription to translational needs. We also found that genes in E. coli that are most repressed by Rho are prophages and other horizontally acquired portions of the genome. Elimination of these foreign DNA elements increases resistance to bicyclomycin. Although rho remains essential, such reduced-genome bacteria no longer require Rho cofactors NusA and NusG. Deletion of the cryptic rac prophage in wild-type E. coli increases bicyclomycin resistance and permits deletion of nusG . Thus, Rho termination, supported by NusA and NusG, is required to suppress the toxic activity of foreign genes."

https://openalex.org/W2073557556,"Type I collagen, the predominant protein of vertebrates, polymerizes with type III and V collagens and non-collagenous molecules into large cable-like fibrils, yet how the fibril interacts with cells and other binding partners remains poorly understood. To help reveal insights into the collagen structure-function relationship, a data base was assembled including hundreds of type I collagen ligand binding sites and mutations on a two-dimensional model of the fibril. Visual examination of the distribution of functional sites, and statistical analysis of mutation distributions on the fibril suggest it is organized into two domains. The ""cell interaction domain"" is proposed to regulate dynamic aspects of collagen biology, including integrin-mediated cell interactions and fibril remodeling. The ""matrix interaction domain"" may assume a structural role, mediating collagen cross-linking, proteoglycan interactions, and tissue mineralization. Molecular modeling was used to superimpose the positions of functional sites and mutations from the two-dimensional fibril map onto a three-dimensional x-ray diffraction structure of the collagen microfibril <i>in situ</i>, indicating the existence of domains in the native fibril. Sequence searches revealed that major fibril domain elements are conserved in type I collagens through evolution and in the type II/XI collagen fibril predominant in cartilage. Moreover, the fibril domain model provides potential insights into the genotype-phenotype relationship for several classes of human connective tissue diseases, mechanisms of integrin clustering by fibrils, the polarity of fibril assembly, heterotypic fibril function, and connective tissue pathology in diabetes and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2016348702,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is likely the most common mode of regulated influx of Ca2+ into cells. However, only a limited number of pharmacological agents have been shown to modulate this process. 2-Aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB) is a widely used experimental tool that activates and then inhibits SOCE and the underlying calcium release-activated Ca2+ current (I CRAC). The mechanism by which depleted stores activates SOCE involves complex cellular movements of an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, STIM1, which redistributes to puncta near the plasma membrane and, in some manner, activates plasma membrane channels comprising Orai1, -2, and -3 subunits. We show here that 2-APB blocks puncta formation of fluorescently tagged STIM1 in HEK293 cells. Accordingly, 2-APB also inhibited SOCE and I(CRAC)-like currents in cells co-expressing STIM1 with the CRAC channel subunit, Orai1, with similar potency. However, 2-APB inhibited STIM1 puncta formation less well in cells co-expressing Orai1, indicating that the inhibitory effects of 2-APB are not solely dependent upon STIM1 reversal. Further, 2-APB only partially inhibited SOCE and current in cells co-expressing STIM1 and Orai2 and activated sustained currents in HEK293 cells expressing Orai3 and STIM1. Interestingly, the Orai3-dependent currents activated by 2-APB showed large outward currents at potentials greater than +50 mV. Finally, Orai3, and to a lesser extent Orai1, could be directly activated by 2-APB, independently of internal Ca2+ stores and STIM1. These data reveal novel and complex actions of 2-APB effects on SOCE that can be attributed to effects on both STIM1 as well as Orai channel subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1992351676,"The basal ganglia portions of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits have consistently been implicated in the pathogenesis of Tourette syndrome, whereas motor and sensorimotor cortices in these circuits have been relatively overlooked. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we detected cortical thinning in frontal and parietal lobes in groups of Tourette syndrome children relative to controls. This thinning was most prominent in ventral portions of the sensory and motor homunculi that control the facial, orolingual and laryngeal musculature that is commonly involved in tic symptoms. Correlations of cortical thickness in sensorimotor regions with tic symptoms suggest that these brain regions are important in the pathogenesis of Tourette syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1972166647,"Development of the nervous system requires that timely withdrawal from the cell cycle be coupled with initiation of differentiation. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the N-Myc oncoprotein in neural stem/progenitor cells is thought to trigger the arrest of proliferation and begin differentiation. Here we report that the HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 ubiquitinates the N-Myc oncoprotein through Lys 48-mediated linkages and targets it for destruction by the proteasome. This process is physiologically implemented by embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiating along the neuronal lineage and in the mouse brain during development. Genetic and RNA interference-mediated inactivation of the Huwe1 gene impedes N-Myc degradation, prevents exit from the cell cycle by opposing the expression of Cdk inhibitors and blocks differentiation through persistent inhibition of early and late markers of neuronal differentiation. Silencing of N-myc in cells lacking Huwe1 restores neural differentiation of ES cells and rescues cell-cycle exit and differentiation of the mouse cortex, demonstrating that Huwe1 restrains proliferation and enables neuronal differentiation by mediating the degradation of N-Myc. These findings indicate that Huwe1 links destruction of N-Myc to the quiescent state that complements differentiation in the neural tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2069685762,"Insights into the proteome reactivity of electrophiles are crucial for designing activity-based probes for enzymes lacking cognate affinity labels. Here, we show that different classes of carbon electrophiles exhibit markedly distinct amino acid labeling profiles in proteomes, ranging from selective reactivity with cysteine to adducts with several amino acids. These data specify electrophilic chemotypes with restricted and permissive reactivity profiles to guide the design of next-generation functional proteomics probes."

Using pooling, we identified a new melanoma risk locus on chromosome 20 (rs910873 and rs1885120), with replication in two further samples (combined P < 1 x 10(-15)). The per allele odds ratio was 1.75 (1.53, 2.01), with evidence for stronger association in early-onset cases."

https://openalex.org/W2001796236,"Although valence electrons are clearly delocalized in molecular bonding frameworks, chemists and physicists have long debated the question of whether the core vacancy created in a homonuclear diatomic molecule by absorption of a single x-ray photon is localized on one atom or delocalized over both. We have been able to clarify this question with an experiment that uses Auger electron angular emission patterns from molecular nitrogen after inner-shell ionization as an ultrafast probe of hole localization. The experiment, along with the accompanying theory, shows that observation of symmetry breaking (localization) or preservation (delocalization) depends on how the quantum entangled Bell state created by Auger decay is detected by the measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2147289229,"Development of axonal tracts requires interactions between growth cones and the environment. Tracts such as the anterior commissure and internal capsule are defective in mice with null mutation of Celsr3 . We generated a conditional Celsr3 allele, allowing regional inactivation. Inactivation in telencephalon, ventral forebrain, or cortex demonstrated essential roles for Celsr3 in neurons that project axons to the anterior commissure and subcerebral targets, as well as in cells that guide axons through the internal capsule. When Celsr3 was inactivated in cortex, subcerebral projections failed to grow, yet corticothalamic axons developed normally, indicating that besides guidepost cells, additional Celsr3-independent cues can assist their progression. These observations provide in vivo evidence that Celsr3-mediated interactions between axons and guidepost cells govern axonal tract formation in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2107521540,"Selenium is an essential dietary element with antioxidant roles in immune regulation, but there is little understanding of how this element acts at the molecular level in host defense and inflammatory disease. Selenium is incorporated into the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), which in turn is inserted into selenoproteins in a manner dependent on Sec tRNA([Ser]Sec). To investigate the molecular mechanism that links selenium to T cell immunity, we generated mice with selenoprotein-less T cells by cell type-specific ablation of the Sec tRNA([Ser]Sec) gene (trsp). Herein, we show that these mutant mice exhibit decreased pools of mature T cells and a defect in T cell-dependent antibody responses. We also demonstrate that selenoprotein deficiency leads to oxidant hyperproduction in T cells and thereby suppresses T cell proliferation in response to T cell receptor stimulation. These findings offer novel insights into immune function of selenium and physiological antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2054612255,"The rotational spectrum of a highly excited molecule is qualitatively different from its pure rotational spectrum and contains information about the intramolecular dynamics. We have developed a broadband Fourier transform microwave spectrometer that uses chirped-pulse excitation to measure a rotational spectrum in the 7.5- to 18.5-gigahertz range in a single shot and thereby reduces acquisition time sufficiently to couple molecular rotational spectroscopy with tunable laser excitation. After vibrationally exciting a single molecular conformation of cyclopropane carboxaldehyde above the barrier to C-C single-bond isomerization, we applied line-shape analysis of the dynamic rotational spectrum to reveal a product yield and picosecond reaction rate that were significantly different from statistical predictions. The technique should be widely applicable to dynamical studies of radical intermediates, molecular complexes, and conformationally flexible molecules with biological interest."
https://openalex.org/W2027485492,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans influence embryonic development as well as adult physiology through interactions with various proteins, including growth factors/morphogens and their receptors. The interactions depend on HS structure, which is largely determined during biosynthesis by Golgi enzymes. A key step is the initial generation of N-sulfated domains, primary sites for further polymer modification and ultimately for functional interactions with protein ligands. Such domains, generated through action of a bifunctional GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) on a [GlcUA-GlcNAc]n substrate, are of variable size due to regulatory mechanisms that remain poorly understood. We have studied the action of recombinant NDSTs on the [GlcUA-GlcNAc]n precursor in the presence and absence of the sulfate donor, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). In the absence of PAPS, NDST catalyzes limited and seemingly random N-deacetylation of GlcNAc residues. By contrast, access to PAPS shifts the NDST toward generation of extended N-sulfated domains that are formed through coupled N-deacetylation/N-sulfation in an apparent processive mode. Variations in N-substitution pattern could be obtained by varying PAPS concentration or by experimentally segregating the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation steps. We speculate that similar mechanisms may apply also to the regulation of HS biosynthesis in the living cell.

We speculate that similar mechanisms may apply also to the regulation of HS biosynthesis in the living cell. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as coreceptors for growth factors and cytokines and are important for maintenance of morphogen gradients during development (1Bulow H.E. Hobert O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 375-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The biological activities generally depend on charge interaction of heparan sulfate (HS) 3The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; EXT, exostosin; GlcNH2, glucosamine; GlcNS, N-sulfated glucosamine; MES, 4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acid; NA domains, non-modified N-acetylated regions; NA/NS domains, regions of alternating GlcNAc and GlcNS units; NDST, glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase; NS domains, contiguous stretches of GlcNS-containing disaccharides; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate. chains with proteins and thus on the distribution of sulfate residues along the chains. This structural trait is essentially established during HS biosynthesis (2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) but may also be modified through postbiosynthetic action of recently identified endosulfatases (3Lamanna W.C. Kalus I. Padva M. Baldwin R.J. Merry C.L. Dierks T. J. Biotechnol. 2007; 129: 290-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HS is synthesized in the Golgi network through complex, concerted action of several distinct enzymes (Fig. 1) (2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). First, a glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-xylose (GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-) “linkage tetrasaccharide” is formed that will connect the HS chain proper with a serine unit of a proteoglycan core protein. After the addition of a GlcNAc residue, polymerization proceeds through transfer of alternating units of GlcUA and GlcNAc catalyzed by complexed EXT1 and EXT2 polymerases. The nascent [4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-]n polysaccharide chain is modified by N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of selected GlcNAc units, effected by a family of bifunctional N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) enzymes. N-Sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) units are typically found in contiguous stretches (NS domains) separated by non-modified N-acetylated regions (NA domains). Often, regions of alternating GlcNS and GlcNAc units (NA/NS domains) surround the NS domains (2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Subsequent modifications are largely confined to the NS domains. These include epimerization of GlcUA units into l-iduronic acid catalyzed by C5-epimerase and O-sulfation at different positions generated by 2-O-, 6-O-, and 3-O-sulfotransferases. The association of all modifications with N-sulfated regions demonstrates the key importance of the NDSTs in designing HS structure. Except for the C5-epimerase and the 2-O-sulfotransferase, which are encoded by single genes in mammals, the modification enzymes occur in several isoforms (4Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Four NDSTs (NDST1–4) have been identified, NDST1 and NDST2 being the most widely distributed (5Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind the non-random distribution of N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units in HS are unknown. The N-deacetylation and N-sulfation reactions could be experimentally segregated using a heparin-producing mastocytoma microsomal system (6Hook M. Lindahl U. Hallen A. Backstrom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6065-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); only after identification of bifunctional NDSTs was it realized that both processes should be attributed to a single enzyme (7Kjellen L. Pettersson I. Unger E. Lindahl U. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 313: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, recombinant NDSTs were used to define the mode of enzyme action, in the absence and presence of the sulfate donor, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). N-Deacetylation of a fully N-acetylated precursor polysaccharide in the absence of PAPS was found to be an essentially stochastic process generating a limited proportion of randomly distributed, N-unsubstituted glucosamine (GlcNH2) residues. By contrast, the addition of PAPS converted the enzyme to a virtually processive mode of action, resulting in formation of extended sequences of consecutive, N-sulfated disaccharide units. Our findings thus suggest that key structural features of HS chains may be ascribed to mechanisms inherent to the NDST enzymes. His-tagged NDST1—Full-length cDNA of wild type mouse NDST1 cloned in pBluescript SK vector was used as template in a PCR to introduce an enterokinase cleavage site followed by a His6 tag in the C-terminal end of the NDST1 protein.

The PCR product was cleaved with BglII and EcoRI and used to replace the corresponding sequence of wild type NDST1 in pBluescript SK. The resulting NDST1-His sequence was then cloned into expression vector pBud4.1CE (Invitrogen) using XhoI and NotI. His6-tagged NDST2—Full-length cDNA of wild type mouse NDST2 cloned in pUC119 vector was used as template in a PCR to introduce an enterokinase cleavage site followed by a His6 tag in the C-terminal end of the NDST2 protein.

The PCR product was cleaved with XbaI and Kpn21 and used to replace the corresponding sequence of wild type NDST2 in pUC119. The resulting NDST2-His sequence was then cloned into expression vector pCDNA3 using XbaI and EcoRI. The His constructs were transfected into HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable clones were selected at a high concentration of Zeocin (400 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for NDST1 or G418 (800 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for NDST2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt) containing 2 mm l-glutamine (Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone®, Invitrogen), 60 μg/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (PeSt, Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt) and were maintained in the same medium containing 200 μg/ml Zeocin for NDST1-expressing cells and 200 μg/ml G418 for NDST2-expressing cells. Transfected NDST1- and NDST2-expressing cells, respectively, from four confluent T175 cell flasks were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 1.5 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma-Aldrich)). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to 60 μl of Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) and incubated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed twice with each of three buffers (buffer 1: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm imidazole; buffer 2: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl; buffer 3: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl) and finally eluted with 2 × 125 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm imidazole). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 25% followed by dialysis of the eluate against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 25% glycerol. The purified recombinant proteins were stored at –20 °C. N-Deacetylase activities of NDST1 and NDST2, measured as described previously (8Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U.

The released [3H]acetate was quantified in a biphasic scintillation counting system (8Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K5 polysaccharide was metabolically labeled and isolated essentially as described previously (10Roman E. Roberts I. Lidholt K. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Further purification of the 14C-labeled K5 polysaccharide included β-elimination with 0.5 m NaOH, 18 h, 4 °C, and neutralization by HCl followed by treatment with 12 units Benzonase (Merck) for 2 h in 37 °C and purification on a Sep-Pak Plus C-18 cartridge (Waters) primed in methanol. Finally, the polysaccharide was applied to DEAE-Sephacel, equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, washed in 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.0, and eluted in 0.5 m NaCl. The purified 14C-labeled K5 polysaccharide, molecular weight ∼100,000 and specific activity 35 × 103 cpm/μg, was desalted on PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) before it was used in the enzyme incubations. Equal amounts of NDST1 and NDST2, based on His tag content as assayed by Western blotting using penta-His-antibody (Qiagen), were used in the incubations with 14C-labeled K5 capsular polysaccharide in 50 mm MES, pH 6.3, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, and 0.25 μg/ml Polybrene, in the presence or absence of PAPS. Standard incubations of 100 μl contained 14C-labeled K5 substrate (20,000 cpm) and enzyme corresponding to an N-deacetylase activity of 700 cpm (see above), with or without PAPS (Sigma-Aldrich; 0.1 mm if not otherwise indicated) and were maintained at 37 °C for different periods of time. Additions of enzyme and PAPS were renewed each hour. Incubations with PAP were performed as described above, using PAP (Sigma-Aldrich) instead of PAPS. Enzymatically modified K5 polysaccharide was examined for occurrence and distribution of GlcNH2 and N-sulfated GlcNS residues by selective deaminative cleavage. Samples were treated with nitrous acid at pH 3.9 or at pH 1.5 to achieve chain cleavage at GlcNH2 and GlcNS residues, respectively, as described previously (11Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Deamination products were separated by gel chromatography on Superdex 30 (GE Healthcare) in 0.5 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting. The extent of N-deacetylation or N-sulfation was calculated from the relative proportions of the various even-numbered oligosaccharide deamination products. NS domains were prepared as described (12Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of modified K5 polysaccharide were first chemically N-deacetylated by treatment with 70% (w/v) aqueous hydrazine (Fluka) containing 1% (w/v) hydrazine sulfate at 96 °C for 4 h (13Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and were then cleaved by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 3.9. Products were separated by gel chromatography as described above. The E. coli K5 capsular polysaccharide has the same [4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-]n structure as the unmodified endogenous substrate that NDST enzymes will encounter in the Golgi compartment of the cell. We applied metabolically radiolabeled K5 polysaccharide as target for recombinant NDSTs and aimed at elucidating the mode of action of the enzyme under different conditions of PAPS access. Recombinant NDSTs with an enterokinase-sensitive C-terminal His tag were produced in HEK 293 cells. The proteins are retained in the Golgi compartment through their membrane-spanning domain, and the cells were therefore solubilized in detergent-containing buffer before purification by Talon metal affinity chromatography. To ascertain that enzyme activity was not affected by the added His tag, N-deacetylase activity was measured before and after cleavage of purified NDSTs with enterokinase. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, removal of the His tag did not affect enzyme activity. For further experiments, the enzymes were used without removal of the tag. Polymer Modification by NDST1 and NDST2 in the Absence or Presence of PAPS—14C-Labeled K5 polysaccharide was incubated with NDST1 or NDST2 in the absence of PAPS, and the products were cleaved at the generated N-unsubstituted GlcNH2 units by deamination at pH 3.9. Gel chromatography of both samples revealed a disperse population of oligosaccharides, with tetramers and hexamers as the predominant species (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, very small amounts of disaccharides were observed after cleavage, indicating that the enzyme rarely attacked GlcNAc residues in neighboring disaccharide units. The distribution of variously sized oligosaccharides pointed to an essentially random mode of enzyme attack for both NDST1 and NDST2. Inclusion of PAPS in the incubations enabled the enzymes to perform both N-deacetylation and N-sulfation and resulted in a dramatically altered modification pattern (Fig. 2, A and B). Products were essentially resistant to deamination at pH 3.9, pointing to the absence of N-unsubstituted GlcNH2 residues (data not shown). By contrast, deamination at pH 1.5 generated disaccharides as the predominant cleavage product, indicating degradation of consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units. Access to PAPS thus altered the target selection pattern of the NDST enzyme, from random N-deacetylation to concerted N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of adjacent disaccharide units, as required to generate NS domains. Moreover, a greater proportion of the substrate was subject to modification, amounting to ∼65% N-sulfation in the presence of PAPS and either NDST1 or NDST2, as compared with ∼40% N-deacetylation in the absence of the sulfate donor (calculated from the chromatograms in Fig. 2, A and B). PAPS apparently affected the two NDST enzymes in a similar fashion and to the same extent. For further characterization of the influence of PAPS on enzyme action, we chose to study NDST2. The effect of PAPS on the course of NDST action appeared strongly associated with the sulfate donor function but could conceivably also reflect a regulatory influence of the nucleotide portion. To test this alternative, 0.1 mm PAP rather than PAPS was included in the incubations, and the distribution of N-unsubstituted residues was determined. Judging from the increased susceptibility of the incubated polysaccharide to deamination at pH 3.9, PAP appeared to stimulate N-deacetylation (Fig. 2D). However, the same oligosaccharides were seen as after incubation in the absence of PAP, without any significant amounts of disaccharides. Binding of the nucleotide per se thus does not seem to modulate NDST action in a qualitative sense. Processive Formation of NS Domains—To determine the size distribution of the NS domains generated by NDST2 in the presence of PAPS, the remaining unmodified GlcNAc units in the 14C-labeled K5 substrate were deacetylated through hydrazinolysis and cleaved by reaction with nitrous acid at pH 3.9. Gel chromatography of the products showed extended NS domains, composed of ≥8 disaccharide units (Fig. 3). Hardly any oligosaccharides of smaller size (<8-mer) were obtained, suggesting that sulfation occurred in long, continuous stretches with only very few GlcNAc residues remaining unmodified between the NS domains. Such domains could be formed either by processive action of the NDST along the polysaccharide chain or by random, but efficient, coupled N-deacetylation and N-sulfation, eventually yielding extended N-sulfated stretches. To distinguish between these alternatives, incubation of the labeled substrate with NDST2 and PAPS was conducted for different periods of time, and the products were cleaved at N-sulfated residues by deamination at pH 1.5. The procedure resulted in progressive formation of disaccharides with increasing incubation time but gave very small amounts of larger oligosaccharides (Fig. 4), pointing to an essentially processive mode of N-sulfation.FIGURE 4NS domains are formed in processive manner. NDST2 was incubated with 14C-labeled K5 polysaccharide and 0.1 mm PAPS during different time periods: 15 min (□), 30 min (•), 1 h (○), and 4 h (▴). The samples were then cleaved at N-sulfated residues with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 and analyzed by gel chromatography on Superdex 30.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of PAPS on NDST Target Pattern—Authentic HS species contain NS domains and unmodified NA domains but also contain substantial proportions of NA/NS domains composed of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units (14Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In our experimental setting, extended NS domains dominated the N-sulfation pattern of the substrate when PAPS was included in the incubations (Figs. 2, 3, 4). We next decided to test whether altering the concentration of PAPS would influence the domain structure. At the lowest concentration tested, 0.1 μm, no N-sulfation of the substrate was detected (Fig. 5). When increased to 1 μm, di- and tetrasaccharides as well as larger cleavage products were obtained after treatment of the substrate with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (Fig. 5). At a PAPS concentration of 5 μm, the relative abundance of consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units in the substrate was higher, as shown by the increased amounts of disaccharides obtained after nitrous acid treatment (Fig. 5). Incubations in the presence of 5 and 10 μm PAPS gave identical results (data not shown). These data suggest that the N-substitution pattern of HS may be regulated through variation in PAPS concentration during biosynthesis. Since the enzyme attacked the substrate in an apparently random mode in the absence of PAPS, we wanted to see how uncoupling of the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation reactions would influence N-substitution patterns. 14C-Labeled K5 polysaccharide was therefore incubated with NDST2 for 1 h in the absence or presence of PAPS followed by incubation for an additional hour with 0.1 mm PAPS. The formation of N-unsubstituted and N-sulfated GlcN units was monitored as before after selective deaminative cleavage of the polysaccharide. As in previous experiments, incubation without PAPS resulted in the generation of N-unsubstituted GlcNH2 residues dispersed along the chain and separated by one, two, or more N-sulfated disaccharide units (Fig. 6A). An additional hour in the presence of PAPS only marginally lowered the amounts of N-unsubstituted residues in the substrate (Fig. 6A). However, during this second hour, N-sulfation had occurred, as indicated primarily by the formation of di- and tetrasaccharides after nitrous acid cleavage at pH 1.5 (Fig. 6B) but also by the appearance of extended saccharide sequences resistant to deamination at pH 3.9 (fraction emerging between 38 and 41 ml in Fig. 6A). Taken together, these findings suggest that preformed N-unsubstituted GlcNH2 units are not preferred targets for N-sulfation as compared with GlcNAc residues that undergo concerted N-deacetylation/N-sulfation. In chains containing such GlcNH2 units the concerted, presumably processive modification reactions will primarily involve extended, uninterrupted N-acetylated regions but may then entail N-sulfation also of adjacent GlcNH2 units (see scheme in Fig. 6). Current information regarding HS structure points to extensive variability regarding level of sulfation as well as domain organization (14Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 15Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such variability applies to samples derived from different tissues, cell types, or developmental stages of a particular species, whereas variation between individuals is low (at least in inbred mice (15Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)). These and similar observations support the view that HS biosynthesis is subject to stringent control. So far, little is known about the mechanisms of regulation. The lack of a template, such as DNA in protein synthesis, suggests that regulation is exerted largely through the availability of various HS biosynthetic enzymes with different activities and substrate specificities. The concerted action of these membrane-bound enzymes would in turn be controlled by their organization in the Golgi network, possibly along with other proteins that lack catalytic activity but nevertheless assist the overall process. The “GAGosome” concept was introduced to define a physical complex of enzymes (and potentially other proteins) committed to the assembly of HS chains; it was speculated that product structure would be determined by the composition and stoichiometry of the complex, dependent on the relative abundancies of the various proteins (17Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). This concept has some support in experimental data. Complete polymer modification of a single chain during cell-free biosynthesis of heparin in a mouse-mastocytoma microsomal fraction thus occurred within seconds (6Hook M. Lindahl U. Hallen A. Backstrom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6065-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in accord with the notion of a tightly knit enzyme complex catalyzing several reactions in rapid succession. Moreover, microsomal polymer formation, now known to be catalyzed by the EXT1-EXT2 complex (18McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 19Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was found to be greatly promoted by concomitant sulfation (20Lidholt K. Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Actual physical association between enzymes has been demonstrated, e.g. between EXT2 and NDST1 (21Presto J. Thuveson M. Carlsson P. Busse M. Wilén M. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and between GlcUA C5-epimerase and l-iduronic acid 2-O-sulfotransferase (22Pinhal M.A. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa Ji J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 30: 30Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently showed that the level of expression of EXT1 and EXT2 affected the amount of active NDST1 in the cell, in turn influencing HS structure (21Presto J. Thuveson M. Carlsson P. Busse M. Wilén M. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our present study, using recombinant NDSTs, PAPS as sulfate donor, and a radiolabeled bacterial polysaccharide as acceptor, shows that one of the key features of HS biosynthesis, i.e. the formation of extended NS domains, may be ascribed to mechanisms inherent to the NDST enzyme without any involvement of other proteins. The process is (not unexpectedly) slower than in a natural setting, yet efficient, yielding NS domains similar in size to those of heparin and considerably longer than those commonly occurring in HS (Fig. 3) (23Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 24Kreuger J. Matsumoto T. Vanwildemeersch M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6303-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Results of incubations maintained for different periods of time (Fig. 4) pointed to a processive mode of action; i.e. once engaged, the enzyme will hold on to, and work its way along the substrate, substituting N-acetyl with N-sulfate groups. The process is radically different from the random target selection displayed by the same enzyme in the absence of PAPS (Fig. 2, A–C) and also noted when polysaccharide generated by mastocytoma microsomal enzymes from UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc in the absence of sulfate donor was studied (6Hook M. Lindahl U. Hallen A. Backstrom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6065-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we cannot presently distinguish between a bona fide processive mechanism, where the enzyme never lets go of the substrate, and a mechanism where the enzyme, after being released from the substrate, preferably rebinds to GlcNAc residues adjacent to already N-sulfated sequence. Indeed, previous experiments involving a crude microsomal enzyme fraction showed that N-deacetylation of a polysaccharide substrate was promoted by introduction of N-sulfate groups (26Riesenfeld J. Hook M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 421-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation of extended NS domains being generated by unaided NDST action again raises the crucial question of regulation. What factor(s) determine the length and distribution of such domains in authentic HS? Molecular modeling suggested that the sulfotransferase domains of the four NDST isoforms differ in structure, and the enzymes also differ in kinetics of N-deacetylation and N-sulfation (27Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In fact, NDST2 has been associated with formation of the highly N- (and O-)sulfated heparin in mast cells (28Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 29Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), which show high expression of NDST2 but little or no NDST1 transcript (30Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, embryonic day 18.5 liver from NDST1–/– mice also expresses NDST2 as the only NDST isoform yet produces a low sulfated HS (31Ledin J. Ringvall M. Thuveson M. Eriksson I. Wilen M. Kusche-Gullberg M. Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35727-35734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Conversely, recombinant NDST1 also yielded extended NS domains in the presence of PAPS (data not shown). Therefore, it seems unlikely that regulation be primarily dictated by availability of isoforms. Notably, the polysaccharide formed upon incubation of rat liver microsomes with UDP-sugar precursors and PAPS was much more N-sulfated than the actual HS produced by the corresponding hepatocytes (32Riesenfeld J. Hook M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7050-7055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that appropriate regulation of polymer modification depends on factors associated with intact cells, which were lost in subcellular fractionation. Interestingly, overexpression in liver of heparanase, an HS-degrading endoglucuronidase, resulted in greatly increased turnover of heparan sulfate proteoglycan(s) with dramatically up-regulated N-sulfation and extended NS domains (33Escobar Galvis M.L. Jia J. Zhang X. Jastrebova N. Spillmann D. Gottfridsson E. van Kuppevelt T.H. Zcharia E. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Variation in intracellular PAPS concentration could potentially be important for regulation of HS biosynthesis. We presently found that lowering PAPS concentration in vitro led to a relative decrease in disaccharide deamination products, suggesting that formation of NS domains had subsided (Fig. 5). More dramatic effects were noted by experimentally segregating NDST action in the absence and presence of PAPS, on the same polysaccharide substrate (Fig. 6). Although NS domains were generated in the presence of PAPS, saccharide regions containing the scattered GlcNH2 residues introduced during preceding incubation in the absence of the sulfate donor remained essentially unaffected. Several reports including immunolocalization studies (22Pinhal M.A. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa Ji J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 30: 30Google Scholar, 34Crawford B.E.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) indicate that HS biosynthesis in several cell types occurs proximal to the trans Golgi/trans Golgi network, where chondroitin sulfate is synthesized and PAPS transporters are believed to reside (36Kamiyama S. Sasaki N. Goda E. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Kannagi R. Irimura T. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10945-10953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25958-25963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hence, the first encounter between NDST enzymes and the growing HS chain may occur in Golgi subcompartments, where PAPS is absent or present at low concentrations. Notably, studies of NDST mutant cells suggested that N-deacetylation and N-sulfation can occur independently; overexpression in 293 cells of NDST1 lacking N-sulfotransferase activity resulted in elevated HS N-sulfation with no concomitant increase in GlcNH2 residues (38Bengtsson J. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The more random modification in the absence of PAPS followed by the apparently processive synthesis of NS domains in the presence of the sulfate donor could thus represent one means to generate the cell specific domain structure of HS.

Ectopic expression of WWOX in cancer cells lacking expression of endogenous WWOX results in significant growth inhibition and prevents the development of tumors in athymic nude mice (5Bednarek A.K.

Recently, we generated a mouse carrying a targeted deletion of the Wwox gene (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S.

We reported that loss of both alleles of Wwox resulted in the formation of frequent juvenile osteosarcomas, whereas loss of one allele increased the incidence of spontaneous and chemically induced tumors (7Aqeilan R.I.

The identification of WWOX-interacting proteins has provided insights into the potential roles of WWOX in cell signaling and its impact on cell fate. WWOX cytosolic interactions, through its first WW domain that binds PPXY ligand-containing proteins, regulate the transactivation activity of several transcription factors. For example, we recently showed that WWOX interacts with p73 and suppresses its transactivation activity (9Aqeilan R.I. Pekarsky Y. Herrero J.J. Palamarchuk A. Letofsky J. Druck T. Trapasso F. Han S.Y. Melino G. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4401-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, this association contributes to the increased rate of WWOX pro-apoptotic activity. We also reported that the association of WWOX with the AP2γ transcription factor and the ErbB4 intracellular domain might contribute to breast carcinogenesis (10Aqeilan R.I. Palamarchuk A.

Sudol M. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6764-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, WWOX antagonizes the function of Yes-associated protein (YAP), another WW domain-containing protein, and suppresses its co-activation ability of ErbB4-dependent transcription. WWOX physically associates with c-Jun following ultraviolet radiation and functionally suppresses its transcriptional ability (12Gaudio E. Palamarchuk A. Palumbo T. Trapasso F. Pekarsky Y. Croce C.M. Aqeilan R.I. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11585-11589Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other research groups have shown that WWOX associates with proline-rich motifs of SIMPLE (13Ludes-Meyers J.H. Kil H. Bednarek A.K. Drake J. Bedford M.T. Aldaz C.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and EZRIN (14Jin C. Ge L. Ding X. Chen Y. Zhu H. Ward T. Wu F. Cao X. Wang Q. Yao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and with proteins lacking the PPXY motif such as p53 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (15Chang N.S. Hsu L.J. Lin Y.S. Lai F.J. Sheu H.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 12-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, although WWOX is involved in specific protein complexes that define its function as an important suppressor of transactivator functions, its specific function in vivo is not clearly defined. To investigate in vivo requirements for WWOX, we examined the Wwox-null mice for phenotypical abnormalities. Wwox-deficient mice display many postnatal defects that include growth retardation, postnatal lethality, and abnormalities of bone metabolism. Mice—C57Bl/6J × 129/SvJ-F1,-F2,-F3,-F4, and -F5 mice (B6-129 F1-F5; (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S. Lian J.B.

Animals were sacrificed; tissues of all organs were removed, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and examined for histological abnormalities by two pathologists after hematoxylin and eosin staining. Bones were cleaned by separation from soft tissue (skin, muscle) leaving the periosteum intact for radiograph and μCT studies. Histology and LacZ Staining—Tissue from different organs were processed, embedded, sectioned (4 μm), and hematoxylin and eosin-stained according to standard methods. Bones were dissected for fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and either demineralized in 18% EDTA for paraffin embedding or embedded in methyl methacrylate for examination of sections of mineralized tissues. Sections were stained for mineral and matrix using the von Kossa 3% silver nitrate stain combined with toluidine blue to distinguish cartilage and bone. Alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase enzyme detection for demonstrating osteoblast and osteoclast activities, respectively, was performed using reagent kits from Sigma. Because our targeting construct included the lacZ gene (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Croce C.M. Proc.

Mundlos S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Prior to preparing frozen sections from E17.5 embryos, limbs (femur with tibia) were removed for separate embedment. Frozen sections of stained embryos and limbs were refixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and restained in X-gal solution and serial sections counterstained in 0.5% eosin after dehydration (50% alcohol). Immunochemistry for WWOX was performed using WT limb sections of newborn mice with WWOX polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody (a gift from Dr. Kay Huebner, Ohio State University) at 1:1000 dilution (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Bone Analyses—Skeletons were prepared for visualization of cartilage and bone using Alcian blue and alizarin red stains, respectively. Briefly, eviscerated embryos were fixed in 100% ethanol, stained overnight in a solution containing 4 parts ethanol, 1 part glacial acetic acid, and 0.3 mg/ml Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma). Soft tissues were dissolved for 6 h in a 2% KOH followed by an overnight staining in a 1% KOH solution with 75 μg/ml alizarin red S (Sigma). Skeletons are destained in 20% glycerol, 1% KOH for several days and stored in 50% glycerol, 50% ethanol. Radiography of dissected limbs at ages 7, 12, 17, and 20 days was performed after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C under vacuum 2 days and rinsing in PBS using a Faxitron MX-20 specimen radiography system. Microcomputed tomography studies were performed on limbs fixed in 70% ethanol for scanning. Qualitative and quantitative three-dimensional analysis of femurs was carried out using micro-CT imaging (μCT 40, Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) at the University of Connecticut Health Science Center μCT Facility by Dr. Douglas J. Adams. Calvarial Osteoblast Differentiation—Primary calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from postnatal day 3 wild-type and homozygous KO pups following collagenase P digestion, and cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, as described previously (17Pratap J. Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M. Robinson J.A. Choi J.Y. Komori T. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5357-5362PubMed Google Scholar). For osteogenic differentiation of both primary osteoblast and MC3T3 cells, stimulus was provided at confluence by subsequent feedings with the BGJb medium containing 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate (BGP04) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. For histochemical staining, cell layers were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde before staining, and reagents used were from Sigma. Briefly, cells were stained with 0.05% naphthol AS-Mx phosphate disodium salt, 2.8% dimethyl formamide,. and 0.1% Fast Red TR salt in 0.1 m Tris maleate buffer (pH 8.4) at 37 °C for 30 min. Osteoclast Differentiation—Bone marrow cells were prepared from the long bones of 7-9-week-old BALB/c mice. Marrow was flushed from bones with a 30-gauge syringe, and cells were dispersed through a metal filter. 1 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 12-well plate and incubated at 37 °C in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 3 days before addition of recombinant RANKL (5 ng/ml). RAW264.7 cells (a kind gift from Philip Osdoby (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin and plated in 6-well (2-4 × 105 cells/well) or 100-mm plates (1 × 106 cells). Cells were allowed to settle 2 days after plating before addition of RANKL (5 ng/ml). After differentiated osteoclasts were observed, mononuclear cells were shaken off and cell layers rinsed in PBS. Mononuclear cells (controls in which no RANKL was added) and the enriched multinucleated osteoclasts on the plates were harvested in TRIzol for mRNA isolation according to manufacturers' procedure (Invitrogen). Cell Lines, Transfection, and Reporter Assays—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and MC3T3 in a growth medium of α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma). Transient transfections were performed at subconfluency using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The RUNX2 and WWOX expression vector (pCMV-MYC-WWOX; pCMV-MYC-WWOXY33R; pcDNA3.1-HA-RUNX2) were used in this study. For control of expression, vector pcDNA3.1 was transfected according to the experimental conditions. Previously described constructs (18McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R.

Real Time PCR—RNA was isolated from the different tissues followed by homogenizing in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bones were cut at the mid-diaphysis and flushed free of marrow by PBS after removing the epiphyses from either end. The bone halves were placed and frozen in TRIzol for RNA isolation by homogenization. cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers using the Super-Script first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Antibodies used were monoclonal anti-WWOX, monoclonal or polyclonal anti-RUNX-2, anti-MYC and anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (Santa Cruz), and Lamin B1 (Zymed). Chromatin IP (ChIP) Assay—For identifying association of RUNX2 and WWOX on chromatin of a RUNX2 target gene osteocalcin, the mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells at 30 to 50% confluence were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes specific for murine Runx2 gene-specific siRNA ((5′-r(UGC CUC UGC UGU UUG AAA) d(TT)-3′) and nonspecific siRNA (5′-r(UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG U) dTdT-3′) duplexes for 48 h, obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Stanford, CA). Total proteins from the specific siRNA oligonucleotide-treated and nonspecific-oligonucleotide-treated cells were analyzed by Western blotting to evaluate the RUNX2 knockdown profile. After Runx2 siRNA treatment, cells were cross-linked with 1% form-aldehyde, and soluble chromatin fractions were immunoprecipitated with RUNX2 rabbit polyclonal (3 μg) and WWOX rabbit polyclonal (3 μg) antibody. The procedure for ChIP in osteoblasts has been described (19Hassan M.Q. Tare R.S. Lee S.H. Mandeville M. Morasso M.I. Javed A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40515-40526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). DNA fragments from immunoprecipitates were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR using 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Eurogentec) and a two-stage cycling protocol (60 °C annealing and extension, 94 °C denaturation, 40 cycles). The following primers were used to amplify the proximal mouse osteocalcin (mOC) promoter (mOC-F1 5′-CCC TCA GGG AAG AGG TCT G-3′ and mOC-R1 5′-CTA ATT GGG GGT CAT GTG CT-3′). Affymetrix Chip Analysis—mRNAs from 26 samples (including kidney, spleen, brain, pituitary gland, femur, and calvarial bones) were hybridized with Affymetrix mouse gene-chip 430 2.0 arrays. Normalization was performed by using GC robust multiarray average. Genes showing minimal variation across the set of arrays were excluded from the analysis. Genes whose expression differed by at least 1.5-fold from the median in at least 20% of the arrays were retained. For class comparison, we identified genes that were differentially expressed between KO and WT mice by using a multivariate permutation test (www.linus.nci.nih). In comparing the genotypes we controlled for the analyzed tissues, we used the multivariate permutation test to provide 90% confidence that the false discovery rate was less than 10%. The false discovery rate is the proportion of the list of genes claimed to be differentially expressed that are false positives. The test statistics used are random variance F-statistics for the effect of genotype on each gene. Although F-statistics were used, the multivariate permutation test is nonparametric and does not require the assumption of a gaussian distribution. The summarized cDNAs presented in supplemental Table 4 represent those up- and down-regulated genes that were common to all analyzed tissues. Wwox Is Essential for Postnatal Survival—To characterize the role of the Wwox gene in vivo, B6-129 F1-F5 hybrid mice were examined for phenotypical abnormalities. Genotype analysis of newborns obtained from a Wwox+/- intercross demonstrated the presence of all three genotypes with ratios consistent with the Mendelian distribution (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Wwox heterozygous (HET) pups were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) animals at all stages of development and postnatal life. At birth, homozygous Wwox-null pups were indistinguishable from their WT or HET littermates up to 3 days postpartum; subsequently, homozygous (KO) pups were easily recognizable by their smaller size (Fig. 1A). KO pups continued to grow more slowly than their littermates, and 100% of the KO mice died by 3 weeks after birth (Fig. 1B). Although homozygous mice were runted, they did not exhibit any abnormal behavior or impaired motor skills. All KO pups showed normal suckling behavior, and milk was found in their stomachs. At 2 or 3 days prior to their death, Wwox-null pups became lethargic and showed signs of wasting. Consistent with growth retardation, key organs, including spleen, thymus, brown adipose tissue, heart, and liver, weighed less in both female and male KO pups compared with wild-type littermates as measured on postnatal day 14 (supplemental Table 2). Interestingly, the brain, adrenal and the pituitary gland of KO pups were heavier compared with WT littermates. Macroscopic and histological examination of the organs confirmed the atrophy of many organs in KO animals without significant microscopic lesions, though KO mice are born with gonadal abnormalities and displayed impaired steroidogenesis. 4R. Aqeilan, unpublished data. Serum chemistry analysis showed marked hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypotriglyceridemia, and hypocholesterolemia (supplemental Table 3). Reduced serum levels of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids concurrently without significant histological lesions in liver, pancreas, intestinal tract, and kidney indicate that KO pups most likely suffered from severe metabolic defect. To further determine the in vivo functions of Wwox, we studied the differential expression of mRNAs in the Wwox-deficient mice compared with their WT and HET littermates. mRNAs extracted from spleen, kidney, brain, pituitary, femur and calvarial bone were analyzed using mouse Affymetrix microarray gene-chip 430 2.0 arrays. Chromatin structure, cell cycle, and other related genes were among the most differentially expressed genes in KO mice tissues as compared with control mice (supplemental Table 4). A Bone Metabolic Disorder in Wwox-null Mice—Limbs of the KO mice revealed not only a size difference proportional to the animal weight, but radiography revealed that KO limbs exhibited decreased density of trabeculae bone and a thinner cortex compared with WT beginning at day 7 (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows the striking differences in bone density at 3 weeks age. To determine whether the observed osteopenia was a consequence of a metabolic disorder or related to cell autonomous defects in bone cell populations, we first examined skeletal development using alizarin red/Alcian blue staining of newborn pups. As shown in Fig. 1D, no apparent size differences or abnormalities related to skeletal patterning were observed. Some variability in ossification of the calvarium was found at birth among HET and KO Wwox mice, but radiography showed no differences in craniofacial bones on day 7 (data not shown). Because our targeting vector included the lacZ gene (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we next examined expression of Wwox promoter in the skeleton. In our previous report, lacZ staining of Wwox-/- mice revealed Wwox expression throughout the skeleton of whole embryos in craniofacial bones, vertebrae, and limb bones (7Aqeilan R.I. Trapasso F. Hussain S. Costinean S. Marshall D. Pekarsky Y. Hagan J.P. Zanesi N. Kaou M. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To address the activity of Wwox promoter in specific cell populations of the skeleton, we performed in situ immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2A, newborn) and sectioning of X-gal-stained embryos at E17.5 (Fig. 2, B-E). In the embryo, WWOX protein is expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts of the developing WT limb (Fig. 2A, newborn). Wwox promoter activity was identified in limb sections in chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and tendon fibroblasts in long bone (Fig. 2B). Chondrocytes and osteoblasts in vertebral bodies of the spine were also positive (Fig. 2, C and D). In the developing calvarium (Fig. 2E), we found robust expression of Wwox promoter activity in early differentiating osteoblasts that are forming the bone matrix. To identify modifications in bone cell populations and tissue organization to account for the apparent reduced bone formation revealed by radiography (less dense bone) in the Wwox-deficient mice, histologic sectioning of limbs was performed at several ages. Normal organization of zones of chondrocyte maturation at the growth plate was observed, and mineralization of trabecular and cortical bone tissue appeared normal on day 1 (Fig. 3A), but the KO mouse bone size was slightly smaller (∼8-10%). By day 3 impaired bone growth was visually evident, and as shown at day 5, the KO mouse bones clearly have fewer trabeculae compared with WT. The diminished volume of trabecular bone in the KO mice continued until the mice died. The three-dimensional μCT images of femur metaphysis in mice at day 15 (Fig. 3B) show reduced trabecular member connectivity and bone surface area in both the HET and KO. However, mineral content (tissue density parameter) of the trabecular bone in HET is not significantly changed from WT. Given the reduced serum values of 50% lower calcium and 20% increased phosphate in the KO mouse (supplemental Table 3), as well as loss of trabecular bone, these findings suggest a metabolic bone disease contributing to the osteopenic phenotype in KO mouse. We therefore examined bone tissue for the number and activity of osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells) by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase histochemical staining at several postnatal ages (Fig. 3C). Higher acid phosphatase activity was consistently observed in femur bone sections of KO mice compared with the WT by day 3 in the primary spongiosa (Fig. 3C, upper panel). The day 5 (Fig. 3C, lower panel) sections of diaphysis are shown to illustrate the less osteoclast activity around mature cortical and trabeculae bone (indicated by *) compared with the KO. We next addressed if the stimulated osteoclast activity was solely because of the physiologic response to low serum calcium in Wwox-deficient mice or if WWOX deficiency directly influenced stimulation of osteoclast activity. Because of organ wasting, it was not possible to isolate viable progenitors from bone marrow or spleen from the Wwox-/- mice for ex vivo osteoclast differentiation. Therefore, WWOX expression was examined in two in vitro osteoclast differentiation systems (Fig. 3D). Both the RAW264."

HCT116 colon cancer cells carry stabilizing mutations in β-catenin and exhibit an elevated activation of Wnt signaling. To clarify the role of an overactive Wnt signaling, we used DNA microarray analysis to search for genes whose expression is up-regulated after knockdown of the wild type adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor in HCT116 cells, which further enhances Wnt signaling activation. Serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) was among the most up-regulated genes following APC knockdown through small interfering RNA. Up-regulation of SGK1 in response to small interfering RNA against APC was inhibited by concomitant knockdown of β-catenin. Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed that SGK1 is a direct β-catenin target gene. SGK1 negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic transcription factor Forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) via phosphorylation and exclusion from the nucleus. We show that Wnt signaling activation results in FoxO3a exclusion from the nucleus and inhibits expression of FoxO3a target genes. Importantly, FoxO3a mutants that fail to be phosphorylated and therefore are regulated by SGK1 are not influenced by activation of Wnt signaling. In line, knockdown of SGK1 relieves the effects of Wnt signaling on FoxO3a localization and FoxO3a-dependent transcription. Finally, we show that induction of Wnt signaling inhibits FoxO3a-induced apoptosis.

SGK1 activity is stimulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1/2-mediated phosphorylation and is tightly linked to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (6Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In this respect, SGK1 resembles PKB/Akt, with which it also shares specific substrates, namely members of the Forkhead box transcription factor (FoxO) family. SGK1 phosphorylates and inhibits the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of the pro-apoptotic FoxO3a/FKHRL1 (7Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

Indeed, it is currently believed that induction of SGK1 by environmental stress stimuli allows the cell to survive under such adverse conditions, most likely through its capacity to inhibit FoxOs (7Brunet A.

In line, studies in Caenorhabditis elegans show a role of the SGK1/FoxO pathway in stress tolerance (15Hertweck M. Gobel C. Baumeister R. Dev.

Wnts are secreted factors that bind to Frizzled/LRP receptors, leading to the stabilization of the nucleocytoplasmic protein β-catenin. Stabilization of β-catenin enhances its nuclear translocation and cooperation with members of the TCF/Lef family of transcriptional regulators to induce transcription of target genes such as c-Myc, survivin, cyclinD1, and axin2/conductin (17Kim P.J.

In the absence of Wnt signals, β-catenin is found in the so-called β-catenin destruction complex that includes the tumor suppressor APC, scaffold proteins axin and axin2/conductin, and the kinases casein kinase 1ϵ and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which promote the phosphorylation of β-catenin at the N-terminal serine and threonine residues (24Kitagawa M.

Disregulated Wnt signaling is a hallmark of many cancers, especially colorectal cancer. Activation of Wnt signaling in the majority of colorectal tumors is achieved through mutations in APC that compromise the integrity of the β-catenin destruction complex (31Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar, 32Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N.

In a small percentage of colorectal cancers, mutations in β-catenin itself lead to its stabilization and increased transcriptional activity (33Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cancer cells that carry mutated β-catenin but wild type APC, the magnitude of Wnt-signaling may be dampened because of binding and sequestration of mutated β-catenin into the cytoplasm by functional APC, axin, and axin2/conductin (34Krieghoff E. Behrens J. Mayr B. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 35Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M.

Indeed, we have previously noticed that expression of the Wnt target gene axin2/conductin can be further activated through the siRNA-mediated knockdown of APC in HCT116 cells, which carry mutated β-catenin but wild type APC (38Hadjihannas M.V. Bruckner M. Jerchow B. Birchmeier W. Dietmaier W. Behrens J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10747-10752Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This indicates that wild type APC can suppress Wnt signaling even in the presence of mutated β-catenin. The different Wnt signaling activation levels in these two genetic settings, represented by APC or β-catenin mutations, might serve as a dosage switch to diversify the response of target genes. Using DNA microarrays, we identified SGK1 to be up-regulated upon knockdown of APC in HCT116 cells in a β-catenin-dependent manner. Activation of Wnt signaling by APC depletion or strong overexpression of β-catenin led to nuclear exclusion of the SGK1 substrate FoxO3a and diminished FoxO-dependent transcription and apoptosis. Our present study identifies Wnt signaling as an activator of SGK1 and provides a link between overactive Wnt signaling and transcription factors of the FoxO family. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. For reporter assays, the cells were transfected with polyethylenimin in 24-well tissue culture plates with the indicated constructs and the following DNA amounts: reporters, 25 ng; regulators, 50 ng; and RSV-βGal (encodes the β-galactosidase (39Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)), 50 ng, to normalize for transfection efficiency. FoxO-dependent reporters were activated by transfection of 20 ng of FoxO3a/4. The amount of DNA for each transfection was adjusted by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 vector. Luciferase activity was assayed 24 h after transfection and normalized to β-galactosidase activity as previously described (40Krueger C. Berens C. Schmidt A. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transfections of siRNAs (100 nmol) were performed in 6-well tissue plates using TransIt TKO (Mirus, Madison, WI), as recommended by the manufacturers. After 24 h the medium was changed, and 48 h post-transfection the cells were harvested. Plasmids and siRNAs—The following plasmids and siRNAs were described previously: CMV-APC, RFP-APC, RFP-Wnt3a, RFP-LRP6da, YFP-β-catenin, and YFP-S45A β-catenin (34Krieghoff E. Behrens J. Mayr B. J.

Commercially available vectors of the c-Jun system pFR-Luc, pFA2-Jun, and pFC-MEKK from STRATAGENE (product 219000), the triple mutant of FoxO3a (FLAG-FoxO3a-TM) from addgene (plasmid 8361), and the siRNA against SGK1 (SGK Validated Stealth™ RNA interference DuoPak) from Invitrogen were used. The reporter constructs BIM-luc and p27Kip1-luc were kind gifts from Rene H. Medema, and FLAG-Asef2 was a kind gift from A. Grohmann. Plasmids with the cDNAs of SGK1 (identification code IRATp970E014D), FoxO3a (identification code IRAUp969FO851D), and FoxO4 (identification code IRAMp995HO213Q) were purchased from RZPD (Berlin, Germany). To create FLAG-tagged constructs of SGK1 and FoxO4, we used cDNA clones as templates together with the following primers: for SGK1 5′-ATAAGAATTGCGGCCGCTGACGGTGAAAACTGAGGCTGC-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-TTAGTTTAGCGGCCGCAATCAGAGGAAAGAGTCCGTGGGAGG-3′ (3′ primer) and for FoxO4 5′-ATAAGAATTGCGGCCGCTGGATCCGGGGAATGAGAATTC-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-TTAGTTTAGCGGCCGCAATCAGGGATCTGGCTCAAAGTTGAAGTC-3′ (3′ primer). The resulting amplification products were cloned into the NotI site of pcDNA-FLAG. For YFP-tagged SGK1, PCR was performed with the primers: 5′-TCCCCCCGGGACGGTGAAAACTGAGGCTGC-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGGAAAGAGTCCGTGGGAGG-3′ (3′ primer) and the product was ligated into mYF-C2 via XmaI and BamHI. YFP-FoxO3a was constructed with the amplifying primers: 5′-TCCCTCCGGAGCAGAGGCACCGGCTTCC-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCTGGCACCCAGCTCTG-3′ (3′ primer). The 8×DBE reporter construct was generated as described (43Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Analysis of Gene Expression—Total RNA was prepared from DLD1-dnTCF and HCT116 cells using peqGOLD Trifast® reagent (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were generated from 1 μg of RNA using Superscript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primer, according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. In addition 40 units of RNase inhibitor were added (RNaseOUT™; Invitrogen). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using specific sense and antisense primers in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 12.5 μl of Absolute™ QPCR SYBR® Green Mix (ABgene, Hamburg, Germany), 0.25 pmol of each primer, and 1 μl of cDNA. The amplification number of cycles was 50, and the reaction took place for 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 57 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C, with an initial step of 95 °C for 12 min (hot start) and a final step of 72 °C for 2 min. Oligonucleotide primers were the following: for SGK1, 5′-GATCTCCCAACCTCAGGAGCC-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CTGGAAAGAGAAGTGAAGGCCC-3′ (3′ primer); for Axin2, 5′-GCAAACTTTCGCCAACCGTG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CTCTGGAGCTGTTTCTTACTGCCC-3′ (3′ primer); for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGG-3′ (3′ primer); for BIM and p27KIP1, as described previously (44Barreyro F.J.

Cell Res. 2006; 312: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using Microarray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix; statistical algorithm), Data Mining Tool 3.0 (Affymetrix), and MS Excel and Access software. Western Blotting—The cells were cultured for 24 h (reporter assays) or 48 h (experiments with RNA interference), and Western blotting was performed as described previously (38Hadjihannas M.V. Bruckner M. Jerchow B. Birchmeier W. Dietmaier W. Behrens J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10747-10752Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies rabbit anti-SGK1 (Biomol), mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma), and mouse anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), as well as peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detection of Conductin/Axin2, the mouse C/G7 antibody (22Lustig B. Jerchow B. Sachs M. Weiler S. Pietsch T. Karsten U. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Schlag P.M. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Mol.

The bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence on a LAS-3000 (FUJIFILM) and quantified using Aida Image Analyzer v. 3.52 software. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed essentially as described earlier (47Weiske J. Albring K.F. Huber O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fifty micrograms of DNA were incubated in 300 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer overnight at 4 °C, with 2 μg of anti-TCF-4 (H-125X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 2 μg of anti-β-catenin (clone14) (BD Biosciences), or anti-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Following precipitation of immune complexes, a 212-bp region of the human SGK1 promoter was amplified (94 °C for 5 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 64 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by a final 5-min extension at 72 °C) using the oligonucleotides: forward 5′-CTTTCCCAGCCAGACTCCAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGGCACAGTCCCGTAAATACC-3′. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—293T and DLD1 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with rabbit anti-β-catenin (H102, Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. DLD1 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 5 min followed by 10 min of incubation at –20 °C in ice-cold methanol, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and incubated with rabbit anti-FoxO3a (75D8) (product 2497; Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit/mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Appropriate Cy3/Cy2-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used to visualize primary antibodies. The nuclei were stained with bis-benziminde (Hoechst 33258; Sigma) for 5 min. Cell micrographs were obtained with a CCD camera (Visitron, Munich, Germany) on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). TUNEL Assay—24 h after transfection, supernatants and trypsinized cells were collected and pelleted. Staining of free DNA 3′OH ends was performed with APO-Brd™ TUNEL assay kit (A23210; Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cell fluorescence was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). Wnt Signaling Overactivation Leads to the Up-regulation of SGK1—TOP/FOP reporter assays showed that moderate β-catenin-dependent transcription in HCT116 is increased following the knockdown of APC and is restored to moderate levels when β-catenin is concomitantly knocked down (supplemental Fig. S1). Knockdown efficiency was validated by Western blotting (38Hadjihannas M.V. Bruckner M. Jerchow B. Birchmeier W. Dietmaier W. Behrens J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10747-10752Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To identify genes activated following APC knockdown, we performed a DNA microarray analysis. For this, HCT116 cells were transfected with either control siRNA (siGFP) or a siRNA against APC (siAPC) or siRNAs against both APC and β-catenin (siAPC/siβ-cat). RNA was isolated 48 h after transfection and used to probe Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. In line with our previous results (38Hadjihannas M.V. Bruckner M. Jerchow B. Birchmeier W. Dietmaier W. Behrens J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10747-10752Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), moderate levels of axin2 in HCT116 cells were increased after knockdown of APC by 5.5-fold. This increase was significantly prevented by concomitant knockdown of β-catenin (down to 2.2). SGK1 was found to be regulated in a very similar pattern as axin2, i.e. up-regulated by siAPC 6.0-fold and down-regulated again when siβ-cat was concomitantly transfected by 3.0-fold. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the microarray analysis (Fig. 1A). To substantiate whether SGK1 is a Wnt/β-catenin target gene, we induced the expression of a dominantnegative version of TCF4 (dnTCF4) in DLD1 colon cancer cells, which has been previously shown to inhibit β-catenin-mediated transcription (22Lustig B.

In these cells, SGK1, like axin2 expression levels, were repressed after the induction of dnTCF4 (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis showed that protein levels of axin2 and SGK1 were modulated in a similar manner as the mRNA levels after siAPC and siβ-cat transfection in HCT116 and after the induction of dnTCF4 in DLD1 cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, SGK1, similar to axin2, was up-regulated in Rat2 cells with constitutive activation of Wnt signaling because of stable expression of the Wnt1 ligand (Rat2-Wnt1) (22Lustig B. Jerchow B.

SGK1 Is a Direct β-Catenin Target Gene—Promoter-reporter assays showed that a –2886-bp fragment of the putative SGK1 promoter was activated after knockdown of APC and inhibited by knockdown of β-catenin by siRNAs in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, the putative SGK1 promoter was activated following transfection of a stabilized version of β-catenin in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B). Conversely, the SGK1 promoter reporter was inhibited in DLD1-dnTCF4 cells after induction of dnTCF4 by doxycycline and transfection of APC in SW480 cells that carry mutated APC (Fig. 2B). Reporter constructs for Wnt signaling activation (TOP) and controls (FOP) as well as Axin2 promoter reporter were used to verify induction and inhibition of Wnt signaling-dependent transcription in the various cellular systems used above (Fig. 2B). Importantly ChIP analyses in DLD1-dnTCF4 indicate that β-catenin and TCF4 binds to a fragment of the putative SGK1 promoter and that the binding of β-catenin is abolished following induction of the dnTCF4 by the addition of doxycycline (Fig. 2C). Additionally β-catenin, TCF4 as well as LEF1 are bound to the SGK1 promoter in SW480 cells (Fig. 2C). β-Catenin is found in a complex with LEF-1 or TCF4 at the promoter as revealed by consecutive immunoprecipitations where immunocomplexes obtained by anti-β-catenin antibodies were reimmunoprecipitated with antibodies to TCF4 or LEF-1. These data strongly demonstrate that SGK1 is a direct transcriptional target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt Signaling Inhibits the Nuclear Localization of FoxO3a through SGK1—SGK1 phosphorylates FoxO transcription factors and inhibits their activity by nuclear exclusion. In light of our results, we sought to determine whether the activation of Wnt signaling would affect FoxO activity. After transfection in 293T cells, FoxO3a was uniformly present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. When SGK1 was cotransfected, FoxO3a was restricted to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A) (7Brunet A. Park J. Tran H.

https://openalex.org/W2159384155,"The soilborne fungus Trichoderma virens secretes a small protein (Sm1) that induces local and systemic defenses in plants. This protein belongs to the ceratoplatanin protein family and is mainly present as a monomer in culture filtrates. However, Hypocrea atroviride (the telomorph form of Trichoderma atroviride) secretes an Sm1-homologous protein, Epl1, with high levels of dimerization. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in recognition and the signaling pathways involved in the induction of systemic resistance in plants are still unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that Sm1 and Epl1 are mainly produced as monomer and a dimer, respectively, in the presence of maize seedlings. The results presented show that the ability to induce plant defenses reside only in the monomeric form of both Sm1 and Epl1, and we demonstrate for the first time that the monomeric form of Epl1, likewise Sm1, induces defenses in maize plants. Biochemical analyses indicate that monomeric Sm1 is produced as a glycoprotein, but the glycosyl moiety is missing from its dimeric form, and Epl1 is produced as a nonglycosylated protein. Moreover, for Sm1 homologues in various fungal strains, there is a negative correlation between the presence of the glycosylation site and their ability to aggregate. We propose a subdivision in the ceratoplatanin protein family according to the presence of the glycosylation site and the ability of the proteins to aggregate. The data presented suggest that the elicitor's aggregation may control the Trichoderma-plant molecular dialogue and block the activation of induced systemic resistance in plants.

The data presented suggest that the elicitor's aggregation may control the Trichoderma-plant molecular dialogue and block the activation of induced systemic resistance in plants. Rhizosphere colonization by certain bacterial strains results in a state of heightened resistance in plants, locally and systemically, to subsequent pathogen attack (1Cook R.J. Thomashow L.S.

During the colonization process, a complex molecular dialogue is established between plants and the microorganisms in which signaling molecules (elicitors) play an essential role (3Nimchuk Z.

Various molecules associated with the basic metabolism of microbes, such as cell wall glucans, chitin oligomers, and glycopeptides, have been described with elicitor activity (7Reymond P.

In addition, certain structural proteins and enzymes encoded in the invader genome (such as Sm1, chitinase, and flagellin) have also been shown to act as signal molecules (10Felix G. Duran J.D.

ISR confers systemic protection in plants by mechanisms different from those of the well known and well studied systemic acquired resistance (reviewed by Vallard and Goodman (2Vallard G.E. Goodman R.M. Crop Sci. 2004; 44: 1920-1934Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar)). However, the mechanisms that underlie the molecular cross-talk between plants and the microbes that initiate ISR are not fully understood. This type of induced resistance has primarily been linked to the colonization of plant roots by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and recently to some species of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma (13Djonović S.

Wiest A. Brotman Y. Chet I. Kenerley C. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2007; 8: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The characterization of two ISR elicitors secreted by T. virens Gv29-8 was recently described. Peptaibols (peptides with antimicrobial activity) produced by T. virens were demonstrated to have ISR elicitor effects, and they systemically induce defenses in cucumber leaves (18Viterbo A. Wiest A. Brotman Y. Chet I. Kenerley C. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2007; 8: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The second ISR elicitor produced by T. virens is the extracellular small protein Sm1, whose gene expression was demonstrated to be up-regulated in the presence of cotton plants. This elicitor is able to locally and systemically induce defense responses in plants (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Further in vivo studies, using reverse genetic analyses, demonstrated that expression of Sm1 is essential for triggering ISR in maize plants and providing protection against the foliar pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola (14Djonović S. Vargas W.A. Kolomiets M.V. Horndeski M. Wiest A. Kenerley C.M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In maize, the metabolic pathways that lead to the establishment of Sm1-mediated ISR involve the signaling networks associated with salicylic acid, green leafy volatiles, and jasmonic acid metabolism and seem to be independent of PR proteins (14Djonović S. Vargas W.A. Kolomiets M.V. Horndeski M. Wiest A. Kenerley C.M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms relevant to Sm1 recognition and signal transduction have not yet been described.Sm1 was the first and the only (to our knowledge) proteinaceous elicitor, with no enzymatic activity, involved in ISR responses described to date. Sm1 is a secreted hydrophobin-like protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 12,545.8 Da. According to structural and sequence analyses, Sm1 belongs to the cerato-platanin (CP) protein family (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol.

Paradoxically, characterization of Sm1 demonstrated a lack of phytotoxicity toward various plants, including cotton, rice, tobacco, and peanut (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Sm1 was previously purified from T. virens Gv29-8 culture filtrates as a monomeric protein (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Djonović S. Vargas W.A. Kolomiets M.V. Horndeski M. Wiest A. Kenerley C.M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, in some growth conditions, a faint band corresponding to the SDS-resistant dimeric form was detected in Western blots. 4C. M. Kenerley, unpublished observations. 4C. M. Kenerley, unpublished observations. The existence of Sm1 monomer and dimer forms could be important for its biological activity. For example, there are reports of key regulators of defense responses whose activity in vivo is regulated by redox changes (25Mou Z. Fan W. Dong X. Cell. 2003; 113: 935-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 26Durrant W.E. Dong X. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Recently, Epl1, the Sm1 homologue produced by Hypocrea atroviride, was also detected in two forms (monomer and dimer) in fungal culture filtrates (27Seidl V. Marchetti M. Schandl R. Allmaier G. Kubicek C.P. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4346-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To gain novel insights into ISR and the molecular mechanisms underlying the elicitor recognition and response induction, we have investigated the relevance of the oligomerization states of Sm1 and Epl1 for ISR. In this report, we demonstrate that Epl1 indeed elicits the activation of the plant defense mechanism, but only the monomeric forms of Sm1 and Epl1 are able to induce such responses, whereas both dimers fail to protect maize plants against a leaf pathogen. Further biochemical characterization of Sm1 and Epl1 demonstrates that the monomeric form of Sm1 is produced as a glycoprotein. However, glycosylation was not present in either dimer forms of Sm1 or Epl1. The occurrence of Sm1/Epl1 homologues was analyzed in different fungal strains by sequence analysis and immunodetection of the polypeptides. The results of this work led us to conclude that the glycosylation state may be controlling the protein oligomerization status and altering the recognition of the elicitor and the induction of defenses in plants. We discuss the importance of the glycosylation state of Sm1 in the molecular dialogue during plant-Trichoderma associations and in the stimulation of ISR in plants. A novel subdivision on the CP protein superfamily, based on to the protein's ability to aggregate and the presence of glycosylation sites, is also proposed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFungal and Plant Materials—The Trichoderma species used in this study were Trichoderma virens Gv29-8, T. virens G6, T. virens G9, T. virens Gv29-8-ΔSm1 (14Djonović S. Vargas W.A. Kolomiets M.V. Horndeski M. Wiest A. Kenerley C.M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), Trichoderma atroviride IMI206040, Trichoderma reesei 6, and Trichoderma viride 21. Also for this research, we used the filamentous fungi Magnaporthe grisea 70-15, Aspergillus fumigatus FGSC1152, and Neurospora crassa 74A. A GFP-tagged Colletotrichum graminicola M1.001-BH isolate (28Sukno S.A. García V.M. Shaw B.D. Thon M.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used as a foliar pathogen for disease development studies in maize. The fungal strains were routinely maintained on potato dextrose agar (Difco). Maize (Zea mays inbred line B73) seedlings used in this study were grown in a hydroponic system (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) or planted in plastic containers (3.81 × 20.9 cm) containing a soilless mix (Metromix 366) and incubated in a growth chamber at 25 °C, with a 14-h photoperiod and 60% humidity.Analysis of Fungal Secreted Proteins from the Hydroponic Growth System—A hydroponic system (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the plant defense response of maize seedlings when inoculated with T. virens or T. atroviride strains. Maize seeds were surface-sterilized using 10% hydrogen peroxide as previously described (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The mycelial inoculum of the Trichoderma strains was aseptically added into the hydroponic systems containing 300 ml of fresh Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and 4-day-old maize seedlings. Two days later, the medium from each treatment was collected and successively filtered through a 10-μm NITEX nylon cloth and a 0.45-μm filter. Culture filtrates (CFs) were then treated with a protease inhibitor mixture (0.05%, v/v; Sigma) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 min, and then 300 ml of each treatment were concentrated by using 10 kDa cut-off Millipore filter devices (Bedford, MA). Protein extracts were used to determine enzymatic activity and also used for SDS-PAGE or Western blotting analyses.Enzymatic Activity Assays and Protein Quantification—The activity of β-1,3-glucanase, β-1,6-glucanase, endochitinase, and proteinase secreted by T. virens and T. atroviride in various culture conditions was compared. Enzymatic activities of both strains when grown in liquid Vogel's minimal medium (VM) (29Vogel H.J. Microbiol. Genet. Bull. 1956; 13: 42-43Google Scholar) or VM supplemented with 1.5% sucrose (VMS) or cultured in MS medium in the presence or absence (control) of maize seedlings were assayed. The activities of β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucanase were determined in the presence of pustulan and laminarin, respectively, by detecting the reducing sugars released after incubation (30Djonović S. Vittone G. Mendoza-Herrera A. Kenerley C. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2007; 8: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protease and endochitinase activities were determined in the presence of Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanalide (Sigma) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N,N′,N″-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma), respectively, as recently described (30Djonović S. Vittone G. Mendoza-Herrera A. Kenerley C. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2007; 8: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined in a microplate assay using the protein reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by detecting absorbance at 280 nm, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific activities were calculated as units/mg protein.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Assays—Polypeptides were separated on SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue or blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (HyBond C®; Amersham Biosciences) for immunoassays (32Renart J. Sandoval I.V. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein blots were probed with specific antibodies raised against Sm1 (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).Purification of Sm1 and Epl1 Isoforms—For Sm1 and Epl1 purification, T. virens Gv29-8 and T. atroviride IMI206040 were grown for 7 days in VMS medium, and CFs were collected by filtration through a 10-μm NITEX nylon cloth. Proteins were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate, collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 20 mm NH4HCO3, and dialyzed against the same solution. Total protein was loaded onto High Q support columns (0.5 × 20 cm) (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with 20 mN Tris-NaOH (pH 7.5) (anion exchange chromatography). Proteins were eluted with a 0-0.5 m NaCl linear gradient in the equilibration buffer. The elution of Sm1 and Epl1 was followed by SDS-PAGE and protein immunodetection. The fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm NH4HCO3, and vacuum-dried. The dried protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl and further purified by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) through Bio-Gel P30 columns (1.0 × 100 cm) (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with the same solution. The elution of Sm1 and Epl1 was followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Although the monomeric form of Epl1 was not detected in the column eluant, the monomeric form of Sm1 eluted pure after this purification step. The fractions containing pure Sm1 were pooled, dialyzed (20 mm NH4HCO3), and vacuum-dried for further experiments. For purification of the dimeric forms of Sm1 and Epl1, an immunoaffinity purification assay was required. The fractions containing the dimers were pooled, dialyzed and concentrated to continue their purification. Both dimers were purified through an Affi-Gel column, where anti-Sm1 antibodies (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) had been immobilized according to the manufacturer's directions (Affi-Gel® Hz Immunoaffinity Kit; Bio-Rad). In order to obtain the dissociated form of Sm1 and Epl1, the purified dimers were sonicated in trifluoroacetic acid at 0 °C (33Peñas M.M. Ásgeirsdóttir S.A. Lasa I. Culiañez-Macià F.A. Pisabarro A.G. Wessels J.G.H. Ramírez L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociated fraction was then dialyzed, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in water.Sm1 Tryptic Digestion and MS Fingerprint Analysis—The bands corresponding to both isoforms of Sm1 after separation on SDS-PAGE were excised manually and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The digestion products were extracted and prepared for MALDI-MS. The peptide mass fingerprint was analyzed in a Shimadzu/Kratos MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory (Texas A&M University).Protein Glycosylation Assays—Glycosylation state was assayed using a glycoprotein detection reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Different amounts of purified Epl1 (dimer) and both isoforms of Sm1 were oxidized with sodium meta-periodate and subjected to a reaction with a freshly made 0.5% solution of glycoprotein detection reagent in 1 n NaOH. A negative (bovine serum albumin) and a positive control (ovalbumin) were also included in the assay. In-gel glycoprotein staining was performed after SDS-PAGE protein separation, using the GelCode glycoprotein staining kit (Pierce) as suggested by the manufacturer.RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Analyses—Total RNA from maize or fungal tissue was prepared using the TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen). Previous to the extraction, plant tissues were ground with a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen; in the case of the fungal tissue, it was lyophilized and crushed prior to the extraction process. RNA quality and PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. In all cases, total RNA was DNase-treated before expression assays using a DNA-free kit (Ambion). For Sm1 and Epl1 expression assays, quantitative real time RT-PCR experiments were performed. The constitutively expressed gene for T. reesei actin (X75421) was used to design primers to amplify its homologue in T. virens and T. atroviride as a control reference (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In maize, the expression of AOS (allene oxide synthase), HPL (hydroperoxide lyase), OPR7 (12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase 7), and PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) was evaluated by quantitative real time RT-PCR using GAPc (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase) as the control reference. The experiments were performed using the QuantiTect® SYBR® green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The reactions were carried out in a 20-μl reaction with 1× QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix, 1× RT QuantiTect Mix, 200 nm primers (Table 1), and 100 ng of total RNA. The reactions were performed in a 7500 Fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. The absence of primer dimers was confirmed in reactions without RNA. The experiments were independently repeated two times (with similar results), and each reaction was performed in triplicate using relative quantification analysis. The expression of each specific gene was normalized versus the control reference with the formula, 2-ΔΔCT, where ΔCT = CT(specific gene) - CT(GAPc gene); ΔΔCT =ΔCT(arbitrary constant) (the highest ΔCT) (59PE Applied BiosystemsSequence Detector User Bulletin 2. PEAp-plied Biosystems, 2001: 1-36Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test using VassarStat (available on the World Wide Web).TABLE 1List of primers used for gene expression assaysGene namePrimer sequenceProduct sizeAccession numberbpAOS5′-AAACCGACGAATTTGAGCAA-3′74AY488135.15′-GGAGGCTCGCAACAAGTTG-3′HPL5′-GAAGGACGCCATCAACAACA-3′80AY540745.15′-ACCAGGAAGGGCAGGAACAC-3′OPR75′-AGAGGCGGAGTATTGTTTGTATGT-3′64AY921644.15′-CGCGGCATTACCCAGATG-3′PAL5′-CCCATCGGCGTGTCCAT-3′110L77912.15′-GGTGAGCCCGTTGTTGTAGAA-3′GAPc5′-TCCTGATCTGAATGGCAAGCT-3′63X07156.15′-AACCGAGACATCCACAGTAGGAA-3′TvSm15′-ACGCTGCTTCTGGCTTCAACATT-3′125DQ1211335′-CTTTAGAGACCGCAGTTCTTAACA-3′TaEpl15′-ATCCCTCGCTTCCCATACATTG-3′221AJ9018795′-ACTTGAGAGGCAGTGGCAGAAAC-3′Actin5′-GTATCATGATCGGTATGGGTCAGA-3′156X754215′-TAGAAGGTGTGGTGCCAGATCTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Infection of Trichoderma-treated Maize Plants with C. graminicola—Cultures of C. graminicola strain M1.001-BH expressing the GFP gene were grown for 14 days on potato dextrose agar at room temperature under constant light. Spores were scraped from plates, filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem), and washed three times with water by centrifugation for 1 min at 10,000 rpm. Spores were counted by using a hemacytometer, and a spore suspension of 6.5 × 104 spores/ml was prepared in a solution of 0.02% Tween 20 in water. Inoculation with T. virens Gv29-8, T. virens ΔSm1 and T. atroviride IMI206040 strains was performed by coating maize seeds with a latex sticker (Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, PA) and then coating with fine granules of chlamydospore preparations (34Weaver M. Kenerley C. Biocontrol. Sci. Technol. 2005; 15: 847-857Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Control (nontreated) and coated seeds were planted in plastic containers (3.81 × 20.9 cm) containing a soilless mix (Metromix 366) and incubated in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a 14-h photoperiod and 60% humidity for 2 weeks. Fourteen-day-old plants (at the V4 developmental stage) were inoculated with C. graminicola by placing the plants in trays and proceeding as previously described (14Djonović S. Vargas W.A. Kolomiets M.V. Horndeski M. Wiest A. Kenerley C.M. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The third leaf from all plants was inoculated with six droplets (10 μl) of the spore suspension, placed on the adaxial side, away from the midvein of the leaf. The trays were sealed and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. After 48 h of incubation in growth chambers, inoculated leaves were used for microscopy or immediately frozen for gene expression assays. For microscopy assays, five plants were infected in each of three independent experiments. Forty-eight hours after infection, five infection sites were excised form each leaf and analyzed with an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY).Infection of Maize Plants with C. graminicola after Elicitor Infiltration—The purified monomer of Sm1, dissociated Epl1, and dimers of both Sm1 and Epl1 (1 nmol), were syringe-infiltrated into the third leaf of 14-day-old plants (13Djonović S. Pozo M.J. Dangott L.J. Howell C.R. Kenerley C.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The infiltrated plants were incubated for 24 h in growth chamber, and then leaves were harvested for RNA extraction or infected with the GFP-tagged C. graminicola strain as described above. In the case of the infection with the GFP-tagged pathogen, three independent experiments were performed, infecting five plants in each case. Forty-eight hours after inoculation, five infection sites were excised from each leaf and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope as above.Sequence Analyses—Sequence comparisons were performed using deduced amino acid sequences available in the data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; available on the World Wide Web) and those previously reported by Seidl et al. (27Seidl V. Marchetti M. Schandl R. Allmaier G. Kubicek C.P. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4346-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were generated with the ClustalX (version 1.8) software (35Harman G.E. Phytopathology. 2006; 96: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and graphic representations of phylogenetic trees were performed using the TREEVIEW16 software.

The collagen-binding site resides in helix αA of the extracellular calcium-binding domain of SPARC and is partially masked by helix αC. Previously, we found that the removal of helix αC caused a 10-fold increase in the affinity of SPARC for collagen, and we identified amino acids crucial for binding by site-directed mutagenesis. In this study, we used rotary shadowing, CNBr peptides, and synthetic peptides to map binding sites of SPARC onto collagens I, II, and III. Rotary shadowing and electron microscopy of SPARC-collagen complexes identified a major binding site ∼180 nm from the C terminus of collagen. SPARC binding was also detected with lower frequency near the matrix metalloproteinase cleavage site. These data fit well with our analysis of SPARC binding to CNBr peptides, denaturation of which abolished binding, indicating triple-helical conformation of collagen to be essential. SPARC binding was substantially decreased in two of seven α2(I) mutant procollagen I samples and after N-acetylation of Lys/Hyl side chains in wild-type collagen. Synthetic peptides of collagen III were used to locate the binding sites, and we found SPARC binding activity in a synthetic triple-helical peptide containing the sequence GPOGPSGPRGQOGVMGFOGPKGNDGAO (where O indicates 4-hydroxyproline), with affinity for SPARC comparable with that of procollagen III.

In vitro collagen fibrillogenesis was delayed in the presence of SPARC, suggesting that SPARC might modulate collagen fibril assembly in vivo. Collagens are major components of the extracellular matrix, comprising ∼30% of the protein mass of vertebrates. At least 28 collagens have been identified so far (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I.

The defining feature of collagens is a triple-helical domain assembled from three polypeptide strands, called α-chains, which each consist of repeating Gly-X-Y sequences, where X is often proline and Y is often hydroxyproline. This primary structure facilitates left-handed poly-proline II helical conformation in each α-chain, and three α-chains form a right-handed triple helix stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds (4Brodsky B. Shah N.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To form this structure, Gly is required as every third residue. Its lack of side chains allows contact between α-chains, whereas the side chains of residues X and Y are exposed on the surface of the triple helix where they can interact with various molecules. Collagens are major structural proteins, endowing mechanical strength upon the extracellular matrix and also regulating cell behavior through the binding of cell surface receptors and other proteins, such as discoidin domain receptors, a subset of the integrins α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1, NG2 proteoglycan, and many matrix molecules (5Brown J.C.

Nearly 50 different ligands have been shown to interact with collagen, and the binding sites for half of these have been mapped onto collagen I (8Di Lullo G.A. Sweeney S.M. Korkko J. Ala-Kokko L.

SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), also referred to as BM-40 or osteonectin, is an abundant 33-kDa extracellular calcium-binding protein expressed in various tissues. Particularly high expression is associated with morphogenesis, tissue repair, and remodeling. SPARC belongs to the matricellular protein family, which includes thrombospondins, osteopontin, CCN proteins (CRY61, CTGF, and NOV), and tenascin-C and -X. These proteins are thought to modulate cell-matrix interactions and cell function rather than to contribute to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (13Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). SPARC is a counter-adhesive and anti-proliferative protein that also regulates the activity of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (14Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). It interacts with the fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, and V), basement membrane collagen IV, vitronectin, thrombospondin 1, albumin, hydroxyapatite (16Yan Q. Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and fibrinogen fragments (17Wang H. Workman G. Chen S. Barker T.H. Ratner B.D. Sage E.H. Jiang S.

Interestingly, targeted disruption of the SPARC gene revealed an important role in lens transparency, because SPARC-null mice develop early onset cataracts (19Gilmour D.T. Lyon G.J. Carlton M.B.L.

Heber-Katz E. Sage E.H. Howe C.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2674-2680PubMed Google Scholar). Other phenotypes of SPARC-null mice are osteopenia (21Delany A.M. Kalajzic I. Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), alteration of collagen fibrils in dermis (22Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P.

Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting that SPARC is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis. These data indicate that SPARC both modulates cellular phenotype and is involved in tissue organization. SPARC consists of three domains, a flexible N-terminal domain I, a follistatin-like domain, and a C-terminal extracellular EF-hand calcium-binding (EC) 3The abbreviations used are: EC, extracellular calcium-binding; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; VWF, von Willebrand factor. domain (24Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The structures of the follistatin-like and EC domains have been elucidated by x-ray crystallography (25Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The EC domain possesses a binding site of moderate affinity for several types of collagen located in helix αA, which is partially masked by helix αC (supplemental Fig. S1). The cleavage of a single peptide bond in helix αC either by unknown endogenous proteases (between Leu-197 and Leu-198) (27Maurer P. Göhring W. Sasaki T. Mann K. Timpl R. Nischt R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or by MMPs (between Glu-196 and Leu-197) (28Sasaki T. Göhring W. Mann K. Maurer P. Hohenester E. Knäuper V. Murphy G. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9237-9243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) increases affinity for collagen by a factor of 10. Based on these observations, we have expressed the helix αC deletion mutant (SPARC ΔI, αC, in which the residues Val-196 to Phe-203 are deleted) to mimic this effect of cleavage on affinity for collagen. X-ray crystallography of the deletion mutant demonstrated a rearrangement in the shortened link region between helix αA and the pair of EF hands, exposing the central part of helix αA, in which the collagen-binding site is located (29Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It can be assumed that a similar situation exists in tissues when SPARC is nicked proteolytically at helix αC. Therefore, the deletion mutant, SPARC ΔI, αC can be a good model of the activated form of SPARC (29Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). This deletion mutant has allowed us to map the binding site and identify within it by site-directed mutagenesis those amino acids crucial for collagen binding (29Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, we have developed two neoepitope-specific antibodies that distinguish between two adjacent cleavage sites and neither of which bind intact SPARC (30Sasaki T. Miosge N. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using these antibodies, a variable degree of cleavage was detected in SPARC obtained from several adult mouse tissues, suggesting this cleavage to be a physiological mechanism of modulating collagen binding. There is evidence that the N-glycan at Asn-99 also modulates the binding affinity for collagen (31Xie R.L. Long G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23212-23217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Kelm R.J. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. To date, most information on the SPARC-collagen interaction concerns SPARC alone, and much less is known about the binding site on collagens, apart from a single study on collagen I using atomic force microscopy (34Wang H. Fertala A. Ratner B.D. Sage E.H. Jiang S. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 6765-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further, the biological consequences of SPARC-collagen interaction in vivo are poorly understood. In the present study we mapped the SPARC-binding sites on collagens I, II, and III by using the intact collagens, CNBr peptides, and synthetic peptides. Rotary shadowing was used for the visualization of complexes. In this study the deletion mutant of SPARC (SPARC ΔI,αC) was used because recombinant wild-type SPARC has a lower affinity for collagen because of the absence of endogenous cleavage, whereas the native alternative, SPARC obtained from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor, is a mixture of intact and enzyme-nicked protein (27Maurer P. Göhring W. Sasaki T. Mann K. Timpl R. Nischt R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also showed that some mutations in the collagen α2(I) chain of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) caused decreased SPARC binding to collagen I. In vitro collagen fibrillogenesis assays demonstrated that SPARC may play a role for collagen fibril assembly. Sources of Proteins—Acid-soluble collagen I from bovine skin, pepsin-soluble collagen II from bovine nasal septum, and their CNBr peptides were prepared and analyzed as described previously (35Rossi A.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purification of Human Procollagen I—Human procollagen I was purified from serum-free conditioned medium of skin fibroblasts derived from human dermal punch biopsies, under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum; serum-free conditioned medium was collected from confluent cells. Procollagen I was precipitated from the medium by adding solid ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 176 mg/ml (30% saturation). The pellet was dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 2 m urea, 2.5 mm EDTA in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 mm benzamidine, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), dialyzed overnight against the same buffer, and loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose (DE52; Whatman) column (2.5 × 6.5 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer without inhibitors. Procollagen I was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl. Fractions containing procollagen I were pooled, dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.01% NaN3, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Purified procollagen I was stored at -80 °C. Seven differently mutated procollagen I samples were similarly purified from the culture media of skin fibroblasts originating from osteogenesis imperfecta patients. All of the mutations were single glycine substitutions in the triple-helical domain of the pro-α2(I) chain (Gly-250 → Ser, Gly-421 → Asp*, Gly-436 → Arg, Gly-622 → Asp*, Gly-646 → Cys, Gly-688 → Ser, and Gly-706 → Ser*, where the asterisks indicate lethal mutations; amino acids are numbered from the first glycine of the triple-helical domain).

In principle, all of the mutated procollagen samples are a ∼1:1 mixture of normal and overmodified trimers, containing a normal or a mutated α2(I) chain, respectively, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis with and without pepsin treatment. Under these conditions, a band with normal mobility and a band with delayed mobility for both the α1(I) and α2(I) chains are detected (data not shown). Recombinant Production and Purification of Human Procollagen III—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which were stably co-transfected with human α1(III) procollagen chain and with murine HSP47 (42Hosokawa N. Hohenadl C. Satoh M. Kühn K. Nagata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were used to collect serum-free conditioned medium in the presence of l-ascorbic acid phosphate at 77 μg/ml (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). The medium (400–500 ml) was dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, with 2 m urea, and passed over a DEAE-cellulose (DE52; Whatman) column (2.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer as used for dialysis. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl (400 ml) and procollagen III eluted at ∼0.15 m NaCl. Procollagen III was further purified on a Superose 6 HR16/50 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.5 m NaCl. The purity and CD spectrum of procollagen III are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Proteolytic Digestions—Pepsin digestion was performed in 0.1 m acetic acid at 20 °C for 2 h at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1:100 and stopped by adding 1 m NaOH to inactivate pepsin. Cleavage was examined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To obtain fragments generated by MMP13, collagen was dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and digested with recombinant human proMMP13 (kindly provided by Dr Gillian Murphy, University of Cambridge) (43Knäuper V. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1:100 at 25 °C for 24 h. Prior to the digestion, proMMP13 was activated by 2 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate at room temperature for 1 h. The cleavage products were separated on Superose 6 HR10/30 equilibrated in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl. Purified fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S2). To test whether SPARC interferes with MMP cleavage of collagens I, II, and III, 2 μg of collagen samples (collagen I, procollagen II, collagen II, procollagen III, and collagen III) were incubated with 0.02 μg of MMP1 (kindly provided by Dr Hideaki Nagase, Imperial College, London) or MMP13 in the presence of SPARC ΔI, αC at different ratios at 25 °C and different time intervals and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analytical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined after hydrolysis with 6 m HCl (16 h at 110 °C) on a LC 3000 amino acid analyzer (Biotronik). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis followed standard protocols. The runs were calibrated with protein standards. Edman degradation was performed on 473 and Procise sequencers following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Samples for CD analysis were dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid, and protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. CD spectra in the far UV region were recorded at 10 °C on a JASCO J-715 CD spectropolarimeter in a thermostatted quartz cell with an optical pathlength of 1 mm. Scans were performed at 20 nm/min, collecting data points every 0.1 nm and averaging the data over at least five scans, with background subtraction. Molar ellipticities [Θ] were calculated assuming a mean residue molecular mass and were expressed in degrees cm2 dmol-1. Rotary Shadowing—Electron microscopy followed standard protocols for rotary shadowing of proteins (44Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In experiments to visualize collagen/SPARC complexes, procollagen and SPARC ΔI, αC were incubated in 1:1–1:3 ratios at 30–50 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20. The solutions were dialyzed against 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate before proceeding to rotary shadowing. The lengths of collagen molecules and the locations of binding sites were measured using NIH Image J 1.55 software. Binding Assays—The collagens were immobilized by adsorption on plastic wells, and SPARC ΔI, αC was used as a soluble ligand as established previously (45Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Binding tests were performed in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 at room temperature unless mentioned. For denaturing conditions, collagenous samples were heated at 50 °C for 5 min prior to coating. Synthesis of Collagen Peptides—The Collagen III Toolkit was used to map the SPARC-binding site onto collagen III. Peptide synthesis, using an AB Systems Pioneer automated synthesizer and N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry, and the sequences have been described in detail (11Raynal N. Hamaia S.W. Siljander P.R.M. Maddox B. Peachey A.R. Fernandez R. Foley L.J. Slatter D.A. Jarvis G.E. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3821-3831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); briefly, the peptides were purified after synthesis by high pressure liquid chromatography, identity, and purity proven by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and triple-helical conformation in aqueous solution demonstrated by polarimetry. The host-guest strategy was applied (46Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to prepare a set of overlapping homotrimeric peptides from the entire triple-helical domain of collagen III. The guest sequence of 27 amino acids (primary collagen sequence) are placed between (GPP)5 hosts, and the C-terminal 9 amino acids of each peptide overlap with the first 9 amino acids of the next peptide. Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay—Acid soluble calf collagen I in 50 mm acetic acid (1.22 mg/ml) was diluted into 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with 150 mm NaCl, at a final concentration of 122 μg/ml. Fibril formation in the absence and presence of SPARC or SPARC ΔI, αC at different molar ratios was measured by monitoring absorbance at 313 nm in a Cary4 spectrophotometer at 34 °C. Localization of SPARC-binding Regions in Collages I, II, and III—To locate the SPARC-binding regions on collagens, we examined mixtures of SPARC ΔI, αC and collagen by rotary shadowing followed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1). The use of procollagens allowed the C terminus of collagen molecules to be identified, because the C-propeptides appeared as globular structures. The total length of collagen molecules was found to be ∼300 nm, indicating that the majority of collagen molecules are intact (304 ± 12 nm for procollagen I, 321 ± 24 nm for procollagen II, and 320 ± 18 nm for procollagen III). SPARC molecules were found at two or three different sites on procollagen I (Fig. 1A) and procollagen II (Fig. 1B). Usually only a single SPARC molecule was observed on procollagen III, with infrequent binding of one or two additional molecules (Fig. 1C). The position of SPARC was calculated as the distance from the procollagen C terminus, and histograms are shown in Fig. 2. For procollagen I, frequent binding was found at 72 ± 10 and 177 ± 6 nm from the C terminus. Almost equal frequencies of occupation of collagen II were observed at 77 ± 13 and 186 ± 9nm from the C terminus. These data suggested the presence of two binding sites on collagen I and II and one binding site on collagen III, at 182 ± 9 nm from its C terminus. Sites observed to be occupied by SPARC with ∼10% of the frequency of the most prominent sites may represent in all three collagens either low affinity sites or artifacts of identification.FIGURE 2Histograms of the binding events of SPARC ΔI, αC along collagen molecules. The position of bound SPARC ΔI, αC was measured from the C terminus. A, human procollagen I (n = 63); B, human procollagen II (n = 70); C, human procollagen III (n = 90). The averages of total length of collagen molecules were 304 nm for procollagen I, 321 nm for procollagen II, and 320 nm for procollagen III. For type I, a total of 95 binding events, for type II, a total of 125 events, and for type III, a total of 126 events were counted. The mean distance from the C terminus ± S.D. is shown in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of the Binding of SPARC to CNBr Peptides Derived from Collagens I and II and Modified Collagens—CNBr peptides from bovine collagens I and II were purified and characterized previously (35Rossi A.

CB8, CB3, CB7, CB6, CB3,7, and CB3,8 of the α1(I) chain, CB4 and CB3,5 of the α2(I) chain (Fig. 3B), and CB12, CB11, CB8, and CB10 of the α1(II) chain (Fig. 3D) were immobilized for solid phase binding assays. The activated form of SPARC (SPARC ΔI, αC) was used as soluble ligand. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Prominent binding to α1(I) CB3,8, which consists of uncleaved CB3 and CB8, was observed, and the concentration of SPARC ΔI, αC required for half-maximal binding was 85 nm. The individual peptides CB3 (Fig. 3A) and CB8 (not shown) did not interact with SPARC, suggesting that its binding site is located near the junction of these two peptides, at residue 402 (Fig. 3B). Other peptides, CB7, CB3,7 of α1(I), and CB3,5 of α2(I) showed weaker binding that did not reach a plateau (Fig. 3A). CB7 and CB3,7 of α1(I) contain the second binding site (72 ± 10 nm from the C terminus) located by rotary shadowing. This site was occupied with lower frequency compared with the site in α1(I) CB3,8. CB3,5 of α2(I) contains two binding sites demonstrated by rotary shadowing but has much lower affinity than homotrimeric peptides (CB3,8, CB7, and CB3,7) derived from α1(I) chain. CNBr peptides of bovine collagen II, CB10 and CB12 but not CB11 and CB8, interacted with SPARC, with CB10 displaying higher affinity (Fig. 3C). Although we observed the same binding profile for CB12 reproducibly, we cannot interpret this binding because it does not correlate with the rotary shadowing data. All of the binding shown in Fig. 3 (A and C) was abolished after denaturation of peptides at 50 °C for 5 min, indicating that triple-hel"

https://openalex.org/W1985012226,"Msx2 is a homeodomain transcription factor first identified in craniofacial bone and human femoral osteoblasts. We hypothesized that Msx2 might activate skeletal Wnt signaling. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of CMV-Msx2 transgene (Msx2Tg) expression on skeletal physiology and composition. Skeletal Msx2 expression was increased 2-3-fold by Msx2Tg, with expanded protein accumulation in marrow, secondary ossification centers, and periosteum. Microcomputed tomography established increased bone volume in Msx2Tg mice, with increased numbers of plate-like trabeculae. Histomorphometry revealed increased bone formation in Msx2Tg mice versus non-Tg siblings, arising from increased osteoblast numbers. While decreasing adipogenesis, Msx2Tg increased osteogenic differentiation via mechanisms inhibited by Dkk1, an antagonist of Wnt receptors LRP5 and LRP6. Bone from Msx2Tg mice elaborated higher levels of Wnt7 canonical agonists, with diminished Dkk1, changes that augment canonical signaling. Analysis of non-Tg and Msx2Tg siblings possessing the TOPGAL reporter confirmed this; Msx2Tg up-regulated skeletal beta-galactosidase expression (p </= 0.01), along with Wnt7a and Wnt7b, and reduced circulating Dkk1. To better understand molecular mechanisms, we studied C3H10T1/2 osteoprogenitor cells. As in bone, Msx2 increased Wnt7 genes and down-regulated Dkk1, while inducing the osteoblast gene alkaline phosphatase. Msx2-directed RNA interference increased Dkk1 expression and promoter activity, while reducing Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, Msx2 inhibited Dkk1 promoter activity and reduced RNA polymerase association with Dkk1 chromatin. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and LRP6 significantly reduced Msx2-induced alkaline phosphatase. Msx2 exerts bone anabolism in part by reducing Dkk1 expression and enhancing Wnt signaling, thus promoting osteogenic differentiation of skeletal progenitors."

This integrated pathway diverges from the molecular chaperone-inducing branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in several ways. While UPR-specific targets were inversely regulated by ER and osmotic stresses, NRPs required both signals for full activation. Furthermore, BiP (binding protein) overexpression in soybean prevented activation of the UPR by ER stress inducers, but did not affect activation of NRPs. We also found that this integrated pathway transduces a PCD signal generated by ER and osmotic stresses that result in the appearance of markers associated with leaf senescence. Overexpression of NRPs in soybean protoplasts induced caspase-3-like activity and promoted extensive DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, transient expression of NRPs in planta caused leaf yellowing, chlorophyll loss, malondialdehyde production, ethylene evolution, and induction of the senescence marker gene CP1. This phenotype was alleviated by the cytokinin zeatin, a potent senescence inhibitor. Collectively, these results indicate that ER stress induces leaf senescence through activation of plant-specific NRPs via a novel branch of the ER stress response.

This complex signaling cascade is conserved in eukaryotes, although the mechanism of signal transduction differs across species. The central transducer of the UPR is IRE1, a transmembrane kinase that appears to be the only means of signal transduction in yeast, but is part of a tripartite signaling response in animals, which also includes the ER-transmembrane transducers PERK and ATF6 (1Maa Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Chem. Neuroanatomy. 2004; 28: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In plants, there is compelling evidence that the UPR operates through IRE1 (2Buzeli R.A.A.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), but characterization of this cytoprotective signaling pathway is still incipient. The only known components of plant UPR are the putative proximal sensors that include two Arabidopsis Ire1p homologues and two ATF6-related proteins, designated AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 (8Koizumi N. Martinez I.M. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Sano H. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Iwata Y. Koizumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the N-terminal domain of plant IRE1 homologues can replace functionally the yeast IRE1, downstream components of the IRE1 signaling are yet to be identified (8Koizumi N. Martinez I.M. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Sano H. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). AtbZIP60 and AtbZIP28 have been described as ER stress-induced leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor genes that are anchored to the ER membrane under normal conditions and may serve as ER stress sensors and transducers (9Iwata Y. Koizumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5280-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Liu J.-X. Srivastava R. Che P. Howell S.H. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 4111-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Upon sensing the ER stress, AtbZIP28 is proteolytically released from the membrane and translocated to the nucleus by a mechanism that is predicted to be similar to that acting on mammalian ATF6 transducer (10Liu J.-X. Srivastava R. Che P. Howell S.H. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 4111-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Expression of a truncated form of either AtbZIP28 or AtbZIP60, harboring the bZIP domain, up-regulates UPR target genes under normal conditions (9Iwata Y. Koizumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5280-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Liu J.-X. Srivastava R. Che P. Howell S.H. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 4111-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The UPR up-regulated chaperone BiP (binding protein) is central to this cytoprotective response as the indirect sensor of alterations in the ER environment. In addition to this role as molecular chaperone, in mammalian cells, BiP has been shown to regulate the UPR by controlling the activation status of the three transducers, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 (11Malhotra J.D. Kaufman R.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 716-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, the luminal domains of these sensors are occupied with BiP, which is recruited by unfolded proteins upon ER stress. The dissociation of BiP promotes oligomerization and phosphorylation of IRE1 and PERK, as well as relocalization of ATF6 to the Golgi where its transcriptional domain is proteolytically released from the membrane into the nucleus. Although the UPR has not been extensively characterized in plants, conserved aspects between mammalian and plant UPR include its negative regulation by BiP, possibly through interaction with the putative proximal sensors, and the BiP cytoprotective role (12Leborgne-Castel N. Jelitto-Van Dooren E. Crofts A.J. Denecke J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In fact, we have previously demonstrated that BiP confers tolerance to water deficit in transgenic plants (13Alvim F.C. Carolino S.M.B. Cascardo J.C.M. Nunes C.C. Martinez C.A. Otoni W.C. Fontes E.P.B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Constant challenges by adverse conditions and environmental stresses pose major constraints for development, growth, and productivity of plants. Our knowledge about stress-specific adaptive responses and cross-talk between signaling cascades has advanced considerably with genome-wide analyses and expression-profiling studies in different plant species under different stress conditions (14Denekamp M. Smeekens S.C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1415-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Kreps J.A. Wu Y.J. Chang H.S. Zhu T. Wang X. Harper J.F.

A common theme that has emerged is that plants transduce environmental signals through integrated networks between different stress-induced adaptive responses. Despite the potential of ER stress response to accommodate adaptive pathways, its integration with environmental-induced responses is poorly understood in plants. Recently, we performed global expression profiling on soybean leaves exposed to polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment or to UPR inducers to identify integrated networks between osmotic and ER stress-induced adaptive responses (4Irsigler A.S. Costa M.D. Zhang P. Reis P.A.B. Dewey R.E. Boston R.S. Fontes E.P.B. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to uncovering specific responses to ER stress and osmotically regulated changes, a small proportion (5.5%) of the up-regulated genes represented a shared response that seemed to integrate the two signaling pathways. These co-regulated genes had similar induction kinetics and a synergistic response to the combination of osmotic- and ER stress-inducing treatments. Thus, they were considered to be downstream targets of the integrating pathway. Two ESTs (N-richI and N-richII), which showed the strongest synergistic induction, were homologous to genes encoding asparagine-rich proteins that have a plant-specific development and cell death (DCD) domain. Here we investigated the possibility that the integrated pathway might transduce a programmed cell death (PCD) signal generated by ER and osmotic stress. We demonstrated that induction of target genes, such as N-richI and N-richII ESTs, by ER stress-inducing agents occurs via a pathway distinct from the UPR. We also found that the N-rich proteins are critical mediators of osmotic- and ER stress-induced cell death in plants. Plant Growth, Soybean Suspension Cells, and Stress Treatments—Soybean (Glycine max) seeds (cultivar Conquista) were germinated in soil and grown under greenhouse conditions (avg: 21 °C, max: 31 °C, min: 15 °C) under natural conditions of light, 70% relative humidity, and approximately equal day and night length. Two weeks after germination, the seedlings were transferred to a 2-ml 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) solution (DMSO, as control). After 12 and 24 h of treatment, the leaves were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until use. Alternatively, the aerial portions of 3-week-old plants were excised below the cotyledons and directly placed into 15 ml of 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW 8000, Sigma), 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma), or 50 mm l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC, Sigma) solutions. The first trifoliate leaves were harvested after 4, 10, or 16 h of PEG and tunicamycin treatments, then immediately frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until use. Each stress treatment and RNA extraction were replicated in three independent experiments. Cotyledons cells from the soybean variety Conquista were cultured as described previously (17Cascardo J.C.M. Almeida R.S. Buzeli R.A.A. Carolino S.M.B. Otoni W.C. Fontes E.P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14494-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured every 10 days by diluting the culture 1:10 in fresh MS medium. All treatments were performed on 5-day-old subcultures. Tunicamycin was added to cultures by dilution of a 5 mg/ml stock in DMSO into normal growth medium to 10 μg/ml and incubated for the intervals indicated in the figure legends. For PEG-induced dehydration, the cells were washed and then cultured with normal growth medium containing 10% (w/v) PEG-8000 for the indicated intervals. Suspension cells were directly treated with 0.5 μg/ml cycloheximide, 10 μm BAP (6-benzylaminopurine), and 10 μm zeatin for the intervals indicated in the figure legends. After treatments, the cells were filtrated under vacuum, washed with 0.25 m NaCl, and immediately frozen in liquid N2. Rapid Amplification of 3′-cDNA Ends (3′-RACE) and NRP-B cDNA Cloning—3′-RACE was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). Total RNA isolated from PEG-treated soybean leaves was used for reverse transcription, and an N-richI EST-specific primer (FwNRich1, TACAGGCATCCAATTTGGCGAACC) and oligo dT primer from the kit were used in the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragment was cloned in pCR4 to generate pCR4-NRPB, which harbors the full-length NRP-B cDNA. Plasmid Construction—For transient expression in protoplasts, NRP-B and NRP-A (gi:57898928) cDNAs were amplified and inserted into the BglII and EcoRI sites of pMON921 (18Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A.

The resulting clones pUFV967 and pUFV849 contain NRP-B or NRP-A cDNAs, respectively, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the 3′-end of the pea E9 rbcS gene. For agroinfiltration in tobacco leaves, NRP-A and NRP-B cDNAs were amplified by PCR and introduced by recombination into the entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pUFV908 and pUFV874, respectively. NRP-A and NRP-B cDNAs were then transferred by recombination to the plant transformation binary vector 35S-YFP-cassetteA-Nos-pCAMBIA1300 yielding pUFV937 (35S:NRP-B) and pUFV938 (35S:NRP-A), which contain NRP-B or NRP-A cDNA, respectively, under the control of the 35S promoter and 3′-ends of nos. For subcellular localization, NRP-A and NRP-B cDNAs were amplified by PCR with appropriate extensions and introduced by recombination into the entry vector pDONR201 (Invitrogen) and then transferred to the binary vector pK7FWG2 to generate pK7F-NRP-B and pK7F-NRP-A, which contain the GFP gene fused in-frame after the last codon of the respective cDNAs. The U16322 plasmid harboring a full-length NIG (NSP-interacting GTPase, Ref. 19Carvalho, C. M., Fontenelle, M. R., Florentino, L. H., Santos, A. A., Zerbini, F. M., and Fontes, E. P. B. (2008) Plant J., in pressGoogle Scholar). cDNA was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and used as a control. For this purpose, the full-length NIG cDNA was amplified by PCR from U16322 cDNA, cloned into pDONR201 and then transferred to the binary vector pK7WG2 to obtain pK7-NIG, which contains NIG cDNA under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from frozen leaves or cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The RNA was treated with 2 units of RNase-free DNase (Promega) and further purified through RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) columns. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using oligo-dT(18) and Transcriptase Reversa M-MLV (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed on an ABI7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems), using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The amplification reactions were performed as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. To confirm quality and primer specificity, we verified the size of amplification products after electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel, and analyzed the Tm (melting temperature) of amplification products in a dissociation curve, performed by the ABI7500 instrument. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. For quantitation of gene expression in soybean protoplasts and seedlings, we used RNA helicase (4Irsigler A.S. Costa M.D. Zhang P. Reis P.A.B. Dewey R.E. Boston R.S. Fontes E.P.B. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as the endogenous control gene for data normalization in real-time RT-PCR analysis. For quantitation of gene expression in tobacco leaves, we used actin as a control gene. Fold variation, which is based on the comparison of the target gene expression (normalized to the endogenous control) between experimental and control samples, was quantified using the comparative Ct method: 2−^ - (ΔCtTreatment - ΔCtControl). The absolute gene expression was quantified using the 2-ΔCT method, and values were normalized to the endogenous control. Soybean Transformation—A plant expression cassette containing the BiPD gene was constructed by insertion of the 2.0-kb XbaI cDNA insert of pUFV24 (17Cascardo J.C.M. Almeida R.S. Buzeli R.A.A.

The resulting clone pBS35SdAMVNOS2-BiP contains the BiP cDNA under control of a duplicated cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter with an enhancer region from the alfalfa mosaic virus and the polyadenylation signal of the nos gene. The Arabidopsis thaliana ahas gene (that confers tolerance to the herbicide imazapyr) was removed from the vector pAC321 (20Aragão F.J.L. Sarokin L. Vianna G.R. Rech E.L. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2000; 101: 1-6Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with XbaI and inserted into the vector pFACM1 to generate pFACMahas. The BiPD expression cassette was released with SalI and NotI from pBS35SdAMVNOS2-BiP and cloned into the vector pFACMahasm to yield pahasBip. The vector pahasBip was used to transform soybean (cv. Conquista) as previously described (20Aragão F.J.L. Sarokin L. Vianna G.R. Rech E.L. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2000; 101: 1-6Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Primary transformants were selected by PCR using the primers bipsoy235 (5′-GAGAGACTAATTGGAGAGGCTG-3′) and bipsoy645c (5′-ATAGGCAATGGCAGCAGCAGTG-3′), which amplify a 410-bp sequence from the BiPD gene coding region and cover an intron region from the genomic BiPD sequence. Segregation analyses of independently transformed soybean lines were performed by PCR, and accumulation of BiP was monitored in each subsequent generation by immunoblotting. RNA Gel Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from frozen leaves of control and tunicamycin-treated wild type and soybean transgenic seedlings, which were treated with tunicamycin or control DMSO for 24 h, with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total RNA were denatured by formamide/formaldehyde and resolved on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary transfer and immobilized by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The membrane was hybridized at high stringency conditions using the soyBiPD cDNA (17Cascardo J.C.M. Almeida R.S. Buzeli R.A.A. Carolino S.M.B. Otoni W.C. Fontes E.P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14494-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as probe. The hybridization probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primed labeling (Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiography was performed at -80 °C using a Lightning-Plus intensifying screen. The amount of RNA and the integrity of ribosomal RNA were monitored by rehybridizing the membranes with an 18 S rDNA probe. Immunoblot Analysis—Total protein was extracted from control and tunicamycin-treated leaves of wild-type and soybean transgenic seedlings as previously described (17Cascardo J.C.M. Almeida R.S. Buzeli R.A.A. Carolino S.M.B. Otoni W.C. Fontes E.P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14494-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out, and the proteins were transferred from 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Immunoblot analyses were performed using polyclonal anti-BiP-carboxyl antibodies (2Buzeli R.A.A. Cascardo J.C.M. Rodrigues L.A.Z. Andrade M.O. Loureiro M.E. Otoni W.C. Fontes E.P.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 757-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), an anti-calreticulin serum (21Pagny S. Cabanes-Macheteau M. Gillikin J. Leborgne-Castel N. Lerouge P. Boston R.S. Faye L. Gomord V. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 739-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or an anti-GmSBP2 serum (22Delú-Filho N. Pirovani C.P. Pedra J.H.F. Matrangolo F.S.V. Macêdo J.N.A. Otoni W.C. Fontes E.P.B. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38 (353): 353Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution and a goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) at a 1:5000 dilution. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) and p-nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Transient Expression in Soybean Protoplasts—Protoplasts were prepared from soybean suspension cells as essentially described by Fontes et al. (18Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.S. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protoplasts were isolated 5 days after subculture by digestion for 3 h, under agitation at 40 rpm, with 0.5% cellulase, 0,5% macerozyme R-10, 0.1% pectolyase Y23, 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm MES, pH 5.5. The extent of digestion was monitored by examining the cells microscopically at each 30-min interval. After filtration through nylon mesh of 65 μm, protoplasts were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, separated by centrifugation in a sucrose gradient (20% (w/v) sucrose, 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm MES, pH 5.5), and diluted into 2 ml of electroporation buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.6 m mannitol). Transient expression assays were performed by electroporation (250 V, 250 μF) of 10 μg of expression cassette DNA, and 30 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA into 2 × 105 - 5 × 106 protoplasts in a final volume of 0.8 ml. Protoplasts were diluted into 8 ml of MS medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 0.6 m mannitol, pH 5.5. After 36 h of incubation in the dark, the protoplasts were washed with 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, and frozen in liquid N2 until use. Caspase-3-like Activity and in Situ Labeling of DNA Fragmentation (TUNEL)—Total protein was extracted from soybean cells 36-h post-electroporation. Caspase-3-like activity was determined using the ApoAlert® Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The substrate was DEVD-pNA, and the inhibitor of caspase-3 activity was the synthetic tetrapeptide DEVD-fmk supplied by the kit. Free 3′-OH in the DNA was labeled by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the ApoAlert DNA Fragmentation Assay kit (Clontech) as instructed by the manufacturer. Samples were observed with a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope fitted with the configuration: excitation at 488 nm and emission at 515 nm. As a positive control, samples were treated with DNase1. Transient Overexpression in Nicotiana tabacum by Agrobacterium Infiltration—N. tabacum plants were grown in a greenhouse with natural day length illumination. Three weeks after germination, the plants were transferred to a growth chamber at 21 °C with a 16-hour light and 8-hour dark cycle. Agrobacterium infiltration was performed in the leaves of N. tabacum with Agrobacterium strain GV3101 carrying pUFV937 (35S: NRP-B) or pUFV938 (35S:NRP-A), NIG (35S:NIG), rpl10 (35S: rpL10) as previously described (23Batoko H. Zheng H.Q. Hawes C. Moore I. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2201-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of Proteins—For subcellular localization of proteins, N. tabacun leaves were agroinoculated with pK7F-NRP-B and pK7F-NRP-A. About 72-h post-agroinfiltration, 1-cm2 leaf explants were excised incubated with 0.6 m mannitol for 10 min, and GFP fluorescence patterns were examined in epidermal cells with ×40 oil immersion objective and a Zeiss LSM510 META inverted laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon laser as excitation source. For imaging GFP, the 455-nm excitation line and the 500–530-nm band pass filter were used. The pinhole was usually set to give a 1–1.5-μm optical slice. Post-acquisition image processing was done using the LSM 5 Browser software (Carl-Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Microsomal fractions were prepared from agroinoculated leaves, as described (24Pirovani C.P. Macêdo J.N.A. Contim L.A.S. Matrangolo F.S.V. Loureiro M.E. Fontes E.P.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3998-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted with an anti-GFP serum. Determination of Chlorophyll Content and Lipid Peroxidation—Total chlorophyll content was determined spectrophotometrically at 663 and 646 nm after quantitative extraction from individual leaves with 80% (v/v) acetone in the presence of ∼1 mg of Na2CO3 (25Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8704) Google Scholar). The extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves was estimated by measuring the amount of MDA (malondialdehyde, a decomposition product of the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids). MDA content was determined by the reaction of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) as described by Cakmak and Horst (26Cakmak I. Horst W.J. Physiol. Plantarum. 1991; 83: 463-468Crossref Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Ethylene Determination—For ethylene measurements as a function of NRP-A and NRP-B expression, whole leaves of 3-week-old tobacco plants were agroinoculated with pK7-NRP-A, pK7-NRP-B, or control binary vector. Agroinfiltrated tobacco plants were placed in 25-ml flasks containing a Petri dish with 3 ml of 1 m HgClO4·4H2O and sealed with rubber serum caps. After 5 days, the solution was collected into a sealed assay tube, and ethylene was released with the injection of 1 ml of 1 m KCl. 1 ml of gas was collected with a syringe, and ethylene was measured on a model 5840A gas chromatography system (Hewlett-Packard Canada Ltda) equipped with a flame ionization detector. A Porapak N (80–100 mesh, 100 cm × 6 mm) column was used at 60 °C. The injection port and detector temperatures were 100 and 150 °C, respectively. The flow of nitrogen, air, and hydrogen was at 30, 130, and 20 ml min-1, respectively. N-richI and N-richII ESTs Are Both Encoded by the NRP-B Gene—The N-richI and N-richII ESTs correspond to different regions of a contiguous soybean genomic sequence (scaffold_78:2951370.2949024). To determine if both ESTs corresponded to the same mRNAs, we obtained the full sequences of N-richI and N-richII cDNAs through RACE. A comparison of the cDNA sequences revealed that these ESTs represented the same gene which we designated NRP-B (N-rich protein B; supplemental Fig. S1A). The deduced NRP-B protein has an estimated Mr of 37092 and pI 7.05 and is most closely related to the previously identified NRP from soybean (27Ludwig A.A. Tenhaken R. Eur. J. Plant Pathol. 2001; 107: 323-336Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), here designated NRP-A. The two NRPs share a highly conserved C-terminal DCD domain in addition to a high content of asparagine residues at their more divergent N termini. This structural organization places NRP-A and NRP-B in the subgroup I of plant-specific DCD-containing proteins (28Tenhaken R. Doerks T. Bork P. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Analysis of several subgroup I DCD domain-containing proteins by ClustalW showed that NRP-A and NRP-B form a subgroup with the Arabidopsis protein of unknown function encoded by At5g42050 (gi 231 18422167, supplemental Fig. S1B). An examination of available microarray data indicated that the At5g42050 locus is induced by cycloheximide, osmotic stress, salt stress, and during senescence (GeneInvestigator).

https://openalex.org/W2152372179,"After protracted low level arsenic exposure, the normal human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 acquires a malignant phenotype with DNA hypomethylation, indicative of disrupted methyl metabolism, and shows arsenic adaptation involving glutathione overproduction and enhanced arsenic efflux. Thus, the interplay between methyl and glutathione metabolism during this progressive arsenic adaptation was studied. Arsenic-treated cells showed a time-dependent increase in LC50 and a marked increase in homocysteine (Hcy) levels. A marked suppression of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels occurred with decreased methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (converts methionine to SAM) expression and increased negative regulator methionine adenosyltransferase B, suggesting reduced conversion of Hcy to SAM. Consistent with Hcy overproduction, activity and expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (converts S-adenosylhomocysteine to Hcy) were both increased. Expression of cystathionine β-synthase, a key gene in the transsulfuration pathway, and various glutathione production genes were increased, resulting in a 5-fold increase in glutathione. Arsenic efflux increased along with expression of ATP-binding cassette protein C1, which effluxes arsenic as a glutathione conjugate. Evidence of genomic DNA hypomethylation was observed during early arsenic exposure, indicating that the disruption in methyl metabolism had a potential impact related to oncogenesis. Thus, cellular arsenic adaptation is a dynamic, progressive process that involves decreased SAM recycling and concurrent accumulation of Hcy, which is channeled via transsulfuration to increase glutathione and enhance arsenic efflux but may also impact the carcinogenic process.

Arsenic is a metalloid widely distributed in the environment mainly found in inorganic forms. Inorganic arsenic is a human carcinogen inducing cancers of the skin, lung, and urinary bladder and possibly liver, prostate, and kidney (1Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waalkes M.P. Environ.

Our laboratory has developed an in vitro prostate cancer model in which the normal human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 is malignantly transformed after chronic, low level arsenite exposure (1Benbrahim-Tallaa L.

The transformed cells, called CAsE-PE, form malignant carcinoma after inoculation into nude mice and overexpress prostate-specific antigen (1Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waalkes M.P. Environ.

Chronic, low level arsenite exposure also induces adaptation to arsenic, in which cells become resistant to acute arsenic toxicity (6Brambila E.M. Achanzar W.E. Qu W. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 183: 99-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leslie E.M. Haimeur A. Waalkes M.P. J. Biol.

This arsenic adaptation occurs through various metabolic changes, including overexpression of efflux transport proteins and increased glutathione production (6Brambila E.M. Achanzar W.E. Qu W. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 183: 99-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leslie E.M. Haimeur A. Waalkes M.P. J. Biol.

Arsenic can be enzymatically modified to form mono- and dimethylarsenic compounds via arsenic methyltransferases using SAM 2The abbreviations used are: SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; Hcy, homocysteine; MAT2A, methionine adenosyltransferase 2A; MAT2B, methionine adenosyltransferase 2B; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; AHCY, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; GCLC, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase. as the methyl donating cofactor (9Thomas D.J. Styblo M. Lin S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 176: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Because this methylation may generate toxic intermediates, it is no longer thought to be detoxicating of inorganic arsenic (9Thomas D.J. Styblo M. Lin S. Toxicol. Appl.

SAM is involved in most cellular methyltransferase reactions, including DNA methylation (12Loenen W.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DNA methylation is a key controlling factor in expression of various genes (13Razin A. Kantor B. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2005; 38: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and hypomethylation can lead to overexpression of several genes linked to oncogenesis (14Ehrlich M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 310: 251-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, RWPE-1 cells have a very poor capacity to methylate arsenic and would not biochemically compete for SAM through arsenic biomethylation (15Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waterland R.A. Styblo M. Achanzar W.E. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 206: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, after arsenic-induced malignant transformation and concurrent adaptation, these cells show clear evidence of genomic DNA hypomethylation (15Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waterland R.A. Styblo M.

The mechanism of arsenic-induced oncogenic transformation is not fully understood, but a comparison of different models reveals potentially common patterns.

Commun. 2007; 352: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) are seen after chronic arsenic exposure. In fact, it is suspected that the DNA hypomethylation observed after arsenic exposure may be, in part, a result of a competition for SAM, because SAM is required for both DNA methylation and the biomethylation of inorganic arsenic, at least in arsenic methylation-competent cells (16Zhao C.Q. Young M.R. Diwan B.A. Coogan T.P. Waalkes M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10907-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 17Reichard J.F. Schnekenburger M. Puga A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 352: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, such a competition for SAM in methylation reactions would not occur in cells that poorly methylate arsenic, such as RWPE-1 cells and its malignant transformant, CAsE-PE cells (15Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waterland R.A. Styblo M. Achanzar W.E. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 206: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, in these cells arsenic may impact methyl metabolism through some as yet undefined indirect mechanism. Glutathione is one of the most important anti-oxidant molecules of the cell and has critical functions in various detoxication processes (22Pastore A. Federici G. Bertini E. Piemonte F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 333: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). For instance, arsenic will form glutathione conjugates that can be effluxed by transport proteins (7Leslie E.M. Haimeur A. Waalkes M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Liu J. Chen H. Miller D.S. Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. Johnson D.R. Klaassen C.D. Waalkes M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and glutathione depletion greatly enhances arsenic toxicity in various model systems (6Brambila E.M. Achanzar W.E. Qu W. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 183: 99-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leslie E.M. Haimeur A. Waalkes M.P. J. Biol.

In fact, arsenic efflux as a glutathione conjugate is thought to be a key component of cellular arsenic adaptation (7Leslie E.M. Haimeur A. Waalkes M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32700-32708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Liu J. Chen H. Miller D.S. Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. Johnson D.R. Klaassen C.D. Waalkes M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that SAM pathway and glutathione production are linked through the transsulfuration pathway (see Scheme 1), with Hcy as the nodal compound. In fact, Hcy is irreversibly catabolized via the transsulfuration pathway, making it unavailable for further SAM production. Furthermore, disrupted glutathione homeostasis has clearly been shown to be a result of altered SAM metabolism (25Lu S.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present work, we use an established cell model system to test the hypothesis that arsenic adaptation may have an impact on methyl metabolism by shifting it toward increased glutathione production. Such a response may enhance short term survival by allowing greater arsenic efflux but could be harmful in the long run by disruption of cellular methyl homeostasis and precipitation of oncogenic events. In this regard, RWPE-1 cells were selected because, at the point of malignant transformation with arsenic (∼30 weeks), they show evidence of disrupted methyl metabolism (DNA hypomethylation), as well as a clear adaptation to arsenic (5Achanzar W.E. Brambila E.M. Diwan B.A. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Brambila E.M. Achanzar W.E. Qu W. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P.

Pharmacol. 2005; 206: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, because RWPE-1 cells do not methylate arsenic, results would not be complicated by potential direct competition for SAM. Early time points were studied to assess key events in the acquisition of metabolic adaptation. Chemicals and Reagents—Sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) was obtained from Sigma. Keratinocyte serum-free medium, epidermal growth factor, bovine pituitary extract, and 100× penicillin G-streptomycin-amphotericin mixture were purchased from Invitrogen. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibody to β-actin purchased from Calbiochem; rabbit polyclonal antibody to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) purchased from Proteintech (Chicago, IL); rabbit polyclonal antibody to MAT2A purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); and rabbit polyclonal antibody to glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The Bradford protein assay was purchased from Bio-Rad. Cell Culture and Conditions of Exposure—RWPE-1 cells were derived from normal human prostate epithelial cells and are immortalized but not tumorigenic (26Bello D. Webber M.M. Kleinman H.K. Wartinger D.D. Rhim J.S. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 27Webber M.M. Bello D. Kleinman H.K. Hoffman M.P. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1225-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in complete medium (keratinocyte serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic mixture) and passaged weekly. Chronic arsenic treatment consisted of a continuous exposure to 5 μm arsenite for up to 16 weeks. These cells are termed CAsE-PE for chronic arsenic exposed prostate epithelial cells. Cells grown in medium without arsenic provided passage-matched controls. Similar arsenic concentrations result in malignant transformation in these cells at ∼30 weeks of exposure (5Achanzar W.E. Brambila E.M. Diwan B.A. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Acute Arsenite Lethality—Control RWPE-1 or cells cultured for different times in arsenite were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in arsenic-free medium. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing acutely cytholethal levels (≤75 μm) of sodium arsenite. The cells were incubated for an additional 48 h, at which point they were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline three times and harvested. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting. Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by a purification step with an RNeasy column (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The ABI Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) was used to design the forward and reverse gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1). The primers were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Woodlands, TX). The SYBR green master mix (ABgene, Rochester, NY) was used for real time PCR analysis. Sample-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels were used to normalize values, and the results are expressed as percentages of adjusted control expression. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extract was obtained using M-PER reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay, and 30 μg protein of each sample were electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting was performed using antibody dilutions for AHCY at 1:200, GCLC at 1:500, or β-actin for standardization, at 1:10,000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used at a 1:10,000 dilution and Super-Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was used for protein detection. The signals were visualized by exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using the Image J program (developed by the National Institutes of Health). Hcy, Glutathione, and SAM Levels—The cells were harvested after trypsinization, and total Hcy levels were assayed at selected time points according to the manufacturer's instruction with a homocysteine microtiter plate assay (Diazyme, San Diego, CA). Total and oxidized glutathione were assayed using a glutathione assay kit from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD), and reduced glutathione levels were derived from these values. SAM levels were assayed according to manufacturer instructions using the Bridge-it® SAM fluorescence assay kit (Mediomics, St. Louis, MO). Enzymatic Activity—Enzymatic activity of glutathione reductase was measured according to the manufacturer's instruction using a glutathione reductase assay kit from Cayman Chemical (Ann Harbor, MI). AHCY enzymatic activity was measured according to the protocol described by Kloor et al. (28Kloor D. Kurz J. Fuchs S. Faust B. Osswald H. Kidney Blood Press Res. 1996; 19: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Arsenite Efflux—Control cells and cells exposed to low level arsenic for 16 weeks were grown in arsenite-free medium to ∼70% confluence. The cells were then pre-exposed to 10 μm arsenite for 24 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in fresh arsenic-free medium for 24 h. These cells were then harvested, counted, and digested overnight with 50% perchloric acid:nitric acid (2:1) at 70 °C. As a reflection of effluxed arsenic, the total remaining cellular arsenic levels were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 600 equipped with an auto sampler. The data were normalized to cell number. Restriction Enzyme Digestions of Genomic DNA—One μg of DNA from control and arsenic-treated cells at 4 weeks of arsenic exposure was separately digested with either 10 units of RsaI, 10 units each of RsaI and the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII, or 10 units each of RsaI and MspI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37 °C for 16 h. This was followed by heat inactivation of the enzymes at 65 °C for 20 min. The digests were then stored at –20 °C. HpaII does not cut DNA if the internal cytosine of its restriction site (CCGG) is methylated. MspI has the same restriction site but can cut when the internal cytosine is methylated. Methylation-sensitive Arbitrarily Primed PCR—A couple of primers (MGC0, 5′-AACCCTCACCCTAACCGCGC-3′; MGF2, 5′-AACCCTCACCCTAACCCGCG) were used to amplify restriction-digested DNA (200 ng) (29Welsh J. McClelland M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7213-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (4195) Google Scholar, 30Peinado M.A. Malkhosyan S. Velazquez A. Perucho M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 594-599PubMed Google Scholar). PCRs were performed in a total volume of 50 μl using 2.5 units of platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), the buffer provided by the manufacturer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 25 pm of the primer. The PCR consisted of 94 °C for 10 min of enzyme activation, followed by five cycles at low stringency conditions of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and 35 cycles at higher stringency conditions of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and a final elongation of 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel according to the manufacturer's instructions and stained with SilverXpress silver staining kit (Invitrogen). The gels were finally scanned. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. and represent at least three separate determinations. The data from arsenic-exposed cells are individually compared with passage-matched concurrent control data. These data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test with a p value of ≤0.05 considered significant. In addition, to help define correlations between progressive changes in LC50 and expression of selected genes (ABCC1 and AHCY) or glutathione, linear regression was performed using mean LC50 data verses individual data for ABCC1, AHCY, or reduced glutathione. The resulting slope was tested against a slope of zero using an unpaired t test, and the p values of these tests are reported. Our prior work showed that chronic, low level in vitro arsenic exposure for ∼30 weeks results in malignant transformation of the human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 (5Achanzar W.E. Brambila E.M. Diwan B.A. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Additionally, these cells show stable adaptation to arsenic during this transformation involving overproduction of glutathione (6Brambila E.M. Achanzar W.E. Qu W. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 183: 99-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), concurrently with DNA hypomethylation (15Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waterland R.A. Styblo M. Achanzar W.E. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 206: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Based on the hypothesis that these changes may be linked, we studied the impact of arsenic exposure during the early stages of adaptation (≤16 weeks) on cellular glutathione production and methyl metabolism (see Scheme 1 for a pathway overview) as well as potential related oncogenic events (DNA methylation). Progressive Development of Arsenic Adaptation in RWPE-1 Cells—The progressive acquisition of resistance to acute arsenic cytholethality was assessed in RWPE-1 cells chronically exposed to low level (5 μm) arsenic and compared with passage match control (Fig. 1). Arsenic adaptation occurred as an early event, and even at 4 weeks of low level exposure, the LC50 for acute arsenic exposure was increased compared with control cells (∼2.8-fold). The resistance to acute high dose arsenic cytholethality progressively increased with the time of exposure to low level arsenic in these cells. These data clearly indicate that arsenic adaptation is a dynamic, progressive process in human cells. Altered SAM Recycling during Arsenic Adaptation—To determine the impact of arsenic adaptation on cellular methyl metabolism, the expression levels of several key components of the SAM cycle (see Scheme 1) were assessed. Because RWPE-1 cells do not readily methylate arsenic (15Benbrahim-Tallaa L. Waterland R.A. Styblo M. Achanzar W.E. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 206: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the results would not be complicated by the need for SAM in arsenic methylation. Transcript levels of genes encoding for key enzymes in the SAM recycling system were initially studied (Fig. 2). The expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), the enzyme responsible for the final step in SAM synthesis, was initially decreased during arsenic adaptation at 4 and 8 weeks (maximum decrease, ∼40%) but returned to normal levels by 12 weeks. MAT2B, the negative regulatory subunit that, by binding to MAT2A, inhibits its enzymatic activity, although initially decreased at 4 weeks, returned to control levels at 8 and 12 weeks but then was significantly increased by 50% after 16 weeks of continuous low level arsenic treatment. These data suggest an overall reduction of SAM production occurred first by a reduction of synthesis via reduced MAT2A and then by an increase in MAT2B related inhibition. Indeed, SAM levels fortify this notion as they were persistently decreased during arsenic adaptation, with reductions starting by 4 weeks of treatment, as great as 35% (Fig. 2, right panel). AHCY transcript, which encodes for an enzyme that produces Hcy from SAH, showed a clear, time-dependent increase to maximal levels of 240% of control by 16 weeks of low level arsenic exposure (Fig. 3, top left panel). In fact, there was a very strong positive relationship between increasing AHCY transcript and increasing LC50 (linear regression p = 0.0063). Assessment of protein levels of AHCY showed a strong increase at 12 weeks of exposure that correlated with increased transcript levels (Fig. 3, top right panel). AHCY enzymatic activity was similarly increased (Fig. 3, bottom left panel). Furthermore, when Hcy levels were assessed, they were also markedly increased (Fig. 3, bottom right panel). This increase in Hcy is consistent with Hcy overproduction via up-regulation of AHCY at the transcript, protein, and enzymatic activity levels during arsenic adaptation. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase are key genes encoding for enzymes involved in the conversion of Hcy back into methionine and, eventually, in the production of SAM. At the transcript level BHMT transcript was significantly reduced over 60% during the initial phase of arsenic adaptation (data not shown), indicating that the use of Hcy in the SAM cycle may be reduced during the early adaptation period. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase transcript levels were unchanged, indicating at this point in SAM recycling that major changes did not occur with arsenic adaptation. The Transsulfuration Pathway in Arsenic Adaptation—Transcript levels for genes encoding for major enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway, which irreversibly utilizes Hcy to produce cysteine as a precursor of glutathione, were assessed. Transcript levels of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), which encodes for the key enzyme involved in the first, irreversible step in the transsulfuration pathway and plays a key role in"

The vertebrate prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H) family consists of three members, P3H1 being responsible for the hydroxylation of collagen I. We expressed human P3H2 as an active recombinant protein in insect cells. Most of the recombinant polypeptide was insoluble, but small amounts were also present in the soluble fraction. P3H1 forms a complex with the cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) that is required for prolyl 3-hydroxylation of fibrillar collagens. However, coexpression with CRTAP did not enhance the solubility or activity of the recombinant P3H2. A novel assay for P3H activity was developed based on that used for collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4H) and lysyl hydroxylases (LH). A large amount of P3H activity was found in the P3H2 samples with (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)5 as a substrate. The Km and Ki values of P3H2 for 2-oxoglutarate and its certain analogues resembled those of the LHs rather than the C-P4Hs. Unlike P3H1, P3H2 was strongly expressed in tissues rich in basement membranes, such as the kidney. P3H2 hydroxylated more effectively two synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences that are hydroxylated in collagen IV than a peptide corresponding to the 3-hydroxylation site in collagen I. These findings suggest that P3H2 is responsible for the hydroxylation of collagen IV, which has the highest 3-hydroxyproline content of all collagens. It is thus possible that P3H2 mutations may lead to a disease with changes in basement membranes.

Hydroxylysine residues have two important functions: they are essential for the stability of the intermolecular cross-links that provide the collagen fibrils with their tensile strength and mechanical stability and they serve as attachment sites for carbohydrate units (1Kivirikko K.I.

The functions of 3-hydroxyproline residues are not known in detail, but their presence in the X positions of repeating -X-4Hyp-Gly-triplets has a destabilizing effect on the triple helix (5Jenkins C.L.

Chick P3H1 copurifies with cyclophilin B and the cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), indicating that it forms a tight complex with these endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins (11Vranka J.A.

It localizes specifically to tissues that express fibril-forming collagens (11Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Cole W.G. Royce P.M. Steinmann B Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders, Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 385-430Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice lacking CRTAP suffer from a severe OI-like syndrome with short stature, kyphosis, and severe osteoporosis (18Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M.

Cell. 2006; 127: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses showed that the single 3-hydroxyproline residue present in the polypeptide chains of collagens I and II is absent in the mutant mice and that collagen fibrillogenesis is altered, indicating that this unique modification has an essential role in bone formation (18Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M. Castagnola P. Rauch F. Glorieux F.H. Vranka J. Bächinger H.P. Pace J.M. Schwarze U. Byers P.H. Weiss M. Fernandes R.J. Eyre D.R. Yao Z.

Furthermore, these results indicate that although P3H1 can hydroxylate collagen chains in vitro without the presence of CRTAP (11Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23615-23621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the latter is required for its efficient function in vivo. In humans, a deficiency in CRTAP and a concomitant lack of or reduction in prolyl 3-hydroxylation was found to lead to recessive OI, ranging in severity from neonatal lethality to a milder phenotype depending on the nature of the mutation (18Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M. Castagnola P. Rauch F. Glorieux F.H. Vranka J. Bächinger H.P. Pace J.M. Schwarze U. Byers P.H. Weiss M. Fernandes R.J. Eyre D.R. Yao Z.

Similarly, mutations in the gene coding for human P3H1 have recently been shown to cause recessive lethal or severe OI (20Cabral W.A. Chang W. Barnes A.M. Weis M. Scott M.A. Leikin S. Makareeva E. Kuznetsova N.V. Rosenbaum K.N. Tifft C.J. Bulas D.I. Kozma C. Smith P.A. Eyre D.R. Marini J.C. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).We report here on the expression of human P3H2 as an active recombinant protein in insect cells. Most of the recombinant P3H2 polypeptide was found in the insoluble fraction, but small amounts were also present in the soluble fraction. Coexpression with CRTAP did not improve the solubility of the recombinant P3H2 polypeptide and had no effect on its P3H activity level. P3H2 efficiently hydroxylated a synthetic (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)5 peptide, its Km for this peptide being slightly lower than that of C-P4H-I for a peptide of a corresponding length. Small but distinct differences in Km values were found between P3H2 and C-P4H-I for reaction cosubstrates Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutarate. The 2-oxoglutarate analogue pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate effectively inhibited P3H2, but unlike C-P4H-I, P3H2 was inhibited by pyridine 2,5-dicarboxylate only at very high concentrations. We also show that in contrast to P3H1, P3H2 is strongly expressed in tissues where basement membranes predominate. Furthermore, P3H2 hydroxylated two synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences known to be hydroxylated in collagen IV more efficiently than a peptide corresponding to the 3-hydroxylation site in collagen I. P3H2 is thus likely to be involved in the hydroxylation of collagen IV in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPCR Analysis of P3H mRNA Expression in Various Mouse and Human Tissues—Expression of mouse and human P3H1–3 mRNAs in various tissues was studied by PCR analysis of the mouse and human multiple tissue cDNA (MTC™) panel I and the human fetal MTC panel (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes). The primer pairs were 5′-CCCTTTGTGGATCCGGACTCATGG-3′ and 5′-ATAGAGGGGCGTGTCCAGGCGG-3′ for mouse P3H1, 5′-CTCACACGTTCTTCATGGCCAACCCC-3′ and 5′-AAATCCTCCCGGGCCTCAATGG-3′ for mouse P3H2, 5′-GGACACTGGATACGGGTTCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGCAGCAGAACCCCACAC-3′ for mouse P3H3, 5′-GGATCCGGATTCATGGACTCC-3′ and 5′-GACCCCGGTAGCCATCTCC-3′ for human P3H1, 5′-TGTGGATTACTATGAGAGTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGACGTTATCCAGGAGAACC-3′ for human P3H2, and 5′-TCAGGTGGGCAATCTGTCCC-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGCCTGGAATCCTGGG-3′ for human P3H3. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (Clontech) were used to analyze the amounts of templates present in the MTC panels. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and their identities were verified by sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems).Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Human P3H Isoenzymes and CRTAP in Insect Cells—The human P3H1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from fetal Marathon-Ready cDNA and lung QUICK-Clone cDNA (BD Biosciences) in two fragments. The PCR primers 5′-GCGGCGGCCGCGGGTGGCTGGCGGTTCCGTTAGG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGGGAATTCCAAAAACATCATAAGCG-3′ were used to obtain the 5′ end and primers 5′-TTTTTGGAATTCCCTTTGTGGATCCGG-3′ and 5′-CGCTCTAGATTCCTCTTCATGGGTCTAGTCACCC-3′ for the 3′ end. The primers had an internal P3H1 EcoRI restriction site (bold) and artificial NotI and XbaI (underlined) restriction sites to facilitate cloning into NotI-XbaI-digested pVL1392 (Pharmingen). The full-length human P3H2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human kidney cDNA pool (Clontech) using primers 5′-GCGAGATCTGAGCGTAACCGTCCCGCGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAAATAAATATTTGATAGAACATTCTTTCTC-3′. Artificial BglII and XbaI restriction sites (underlined) were included in the primers to facilitate cloning into similarly digested pVL1392. The P3H3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from Ad5 and ovarian carcinoma cell lines (human cell line MTC panel, Clontech) in two fragments. The primers 5′-GCGGAATTCCCGGCGGCTCCGACATCATG-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGATCCTTGAAGCTGGTCCC-3′ were used to obtain the 5′ end and 5′-TCAAGGATCCTGACCCCTGGACC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCTAGACCACAAGTCAAGTGGCCACATCC-3′ for the 3′ end. The primers had an internal P3H3 BamHI restriction site (bold) and artificial EcoRI and XbaI (underlined) restriction sites to facilitate cloning into EcoRI-XbaI-digested pVL1392. The human CRTAP cDNA was amplified from clone IRAUp969B1128D (German Resource Center for Genome Research) with primers 5′-GCGGAATTCATGGAGCCGGGGCGCCGGG-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCCTAGCTGGTCTCCTCCAGTTCC-3′. Artificial EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined) were included in the primers to facilitate cloning into similarly digested pVL1392. The sequences were verified on an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).The recombinant vectors were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant viruses were amplified (21Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System; Instruction Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures of Sf9 cells in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of 5 and a cell density of 5 × 106 per 100-mm plate. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS), and homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, including the complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The remaining pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS, and aliquots of both fractions were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or ECL Western blotting (Amersham Biosciences) with polyclonal antibodies against P3H1 and P3H2 (see below) at 1:5000 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. N-terminal sequencing of the putative recombinant P3H polypeptides present in the 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS-soluble fractions was performed using samples transferred to a ProBlott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems) and a Procise™ 492 sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Analysis of P3H Activity—P3H activity was analyzed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (22Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 0.5 ml, which contained 50–75 μl of the Triton X-100 extracts of the insect cells as a source of the enzyme, differing amounts of a peptide substrate (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)5 (Innovagen), 0.025 μmol of FeSO4, 0.05 μmol of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate, 1 μmol of ascorbate, 30 μg of catalase (Sigma), 0.05 μmol of dithiothreitol, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 25 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer, adjusted to pH 7.8 at 25 °C. The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. In additional experiments the above peptide substrate was replaced by the synthetic peptides Ser-Lys-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Phe-Met-Gly-Pro-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Gln-4Hyp-Gly-Leu-4Hyp-Gly or Pro-Thr-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Asp-Gly-Ley-4Hyp-Gly-Ser-Met-Gly corresponding to two known prolyl 3-hydroxylation sites in the collagen IV α1 chain (23Schuppan D. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), respectively, or Leu-Asn-Gly-Leu-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Ile-Gly-Pro-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Asp-Ala-Gly corresponding to the only prolyl 3-hydroxylation site in the collagen I α1 chain at position 986 of the triple helix (18Morello R.

A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and a peptide substrate (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 were used in control experiments.Production of P3H Antibodies, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were produced against mouse P3H1 and P3H2 using synthetic peptides PEEVIPKRLQEKQKSE and MGKKSPPKIGRDLREG corresponding to residues 398–413 and 422–437 of mouse P3H1 and P3H2, respectively (Innovagen). Both antibodies were purified on a Hi-Trap G HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The adult mouse specimens for use in the immunofluorescence studies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Samples from these were cut into 5-μm cryosections on SuperFrost plus glass (Menzel-Gläser) slides and the sections were fixed in pre-cooled acetone for 10 min at 4 °C. After rinsing with PBS, pH 7.2, nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubating the sections with 5% goat serum in PBS, pH 7.2, for 12 h at 22 °C. Incubation with the primary antibodies was performed at 22 °C for 90 to 150 min using 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions of the P3H1 and P3H2 antibodies, respectively, and a 1:300 dilution of a polyclonal collagen IV antibody (Chemicon). The slides were washed in PBS, pH 7.2, 5 times for 5 min, followed by a 30-min incubation in a 1:300 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). After washing 7 times for 5 min in PBS, pH 7.2, the slides were mounted with Immumount (Thermo Electron Corporation). Control sections were stained with the secondary antibody alone. Preimmune sera from the rabbits immunized with the P3H1 and P3H2 peptides were also used as negative controls. The samples were examined under an Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus) and photographed with a DP50 digital camera (Olympus).Fresh adult mouse kidney was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer with 2.5% sucrose, pH 7.4, for 2 h. Small pieces of tissue were immersed in 2.3 m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thin cryosections were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome. The sections for immunolabeling were first incubated in 0.05 m glycine in PBS followed by incubation in 5% bovine serum albumin with 0.1% cold water fish skin gelatin (Aurion) in PBS. The antibodies and gold conjugate were diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/cold water fish skin gelatin (Aurion) in PBS. All washings were performed in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/cold water fish skin gelatin in PBS. The sections were then incubated with an antibody to P3H2 (dilution 1:300) for 60 min followed by protein A-gold complex (size 10 nm) for 30 min. The controls were prepared by carrying out the labeling procedure without any primary antibody. The sections were embedded in methylcellulose and examined in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope (FEI Company). Images were captured by CCD camera equipped with a TCL-EM-Menu, version 3, from Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems GmbH (Gaunting).RESULTSExpression of the P3H 1–3 mRNAs in Various Mouse and Human Tissues—We used PCR analysis of multitissue cDNA panels to study the expression of the P3H isoenzyme mRNAs in various mouse and human tissues. P3H2 mRNA was expressed in all the tissues studied except for adult human brain and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). The highest expression levels in mouse tissues were seen in the lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney, in adult human tissues in the placenta, lung, liver, and kidney, and in fetal human tissues in the heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 1). P3H1 mRNA was expressed in all the tissues except for mouse brain and spleen (Fig. 1). The highest levels in mouse tissues were seen in the liver and skeletal muscle, in adult human tissues in the placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas and in fetal human tissues in the spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 1). In addition to the expected 344-bp human P3H1 PCR product, a longer product was also amplified with the P3H1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B), which proved to contain the intron 7 sequence. This variant corresponds to the previously identified Gros1-S variant that contains part of the intron 5 sequence and the entire intron 7 sequence, leading to a premature stop codon and the generation of a truncated 363-amino acid polypeptide (13Kaul S.C. Sugihara T. Yoshida A. Nomura H. Wadhwa R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3576-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) instead of the 736-residue full-length polypeptide. This truncated polypeptide cannot be an active P3H, as it lacks the catalytically critical residues identified in the 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases (2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 22: 15-24Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 15Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Clifton I.J. McDonough M.A. Ehrismann D. Kershaw N.J. Granatino N. Schofield C.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 644-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The 344-bp PCR product was the predominant form in adult human heart and placenta and in fetal human heart, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 1B). The PCR product corresponding to Gros1-S predominated in the fetal human brain and thymus, whereas the ratio of the two PCR products was about 1:1 in the rest of the human tissues studied (Fig. 1B). Expression of mouse P3H3 was seen in the heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, the expression level in the liver being very low (Fig. 1A). The expression pattern of human P3H3 mRNA closely resembled that of human P3H1 in the adult tissues studied, but the human P3H3 mRNA had a more restricted pattern in the fetal tissues, where the highest expression levels were seen in the lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 1B).Expression of an Active Recombinant Human P3H2 in Insect Cells—Recombinant human P3H1, P3H2, and P3H3 polypeptides were expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged, and the remaining pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic mouse P3H1 and P3H2 peptides. Most of the recombinant P3H1 and P3H2 polypeptides were found in the SDS-soluble fraction (Fig. 2), but a significant amount of P3H1 and a small amount of P3H2 were also seen in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig. 2). The Coomassie Blue staining and comparison with samples from non-infected Sf9 cells suggested that the P3H3 polypeptide was present only in the SDS fraction (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis showed that the P3H1 and P3H2 antibodies were specific for their target isoenzymes (Fig. 2, B and C), except that the P3H2 antibody additionally recognized a nonspecific insect cell protein with a lower molecular weight, which was also stained in the noninfected control cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the same insect cell protein was stained with preimmune serum collected from the rabbits immunized with the P3H2 peptide (data not shown).FIGURE 2Analysis of the expression of recombinant human P3H1, P3H2, and P3H3 polypeptides in insect cells. SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining (A) and Western blotting with a P3H2 (B) or P3H1 (C) antibody of Triton X-100-soluble (odd numbered lanes) and SDS-soluble (even numbered lanes) proteins from Sf9 insect cells infected with a virus encoding P3H1 (lanes 1 and 2), P3H2 (lanes 3 and 4), or P3H3 (lanes 5 and 6), and non-infected Sf9 cells (lanes 7 and 8). Lanes 7 and 8 in B were grouped from a different part of the same gel as lanes 1–6 in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression of the P3H polypeptides was further verified by N-terminal sequencing. The prediction for the P3H1 signal peptide cleavage site is uncertain, but it is located between residues 18 and 23, whereas the sizes of the signal peptides of P3H2 and P3H3 are predicted to be 24 and 20 amino acids, respectively. N-terminal sequencing indicated that P3H1 and P3H2 polypeptides with N termini of 19ASQAEVESEA and 25GPPDSPRREL, respectively, were present in both the Triton X-100 and SDS fractions, whereas a P3H3 sequence 21EPPGLTQLSP was present only in the SDS fraction. These results agree with those obtained in the SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses above.To study whether the recombinant P3H polypeptides had P3H activity, Triton X-100-soluble fractions of the cell homogenates were assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (22Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A large amount of P3H activity was obtained in the P3H2 sample when the synthetic peptide (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)5 was used as the substrate (results of a typical experiment are shown in Table 1),"
https://openalex.org/W1986226274,"The diversity of tropical herbivorous insects has been explained as a direct function of plant species diversity. Testing that explanation, we reared 2857 flies from flowers and seeds of 24 species of plants from 34 neotropical sites. Samples yielded 52 morphologically similar species of flies and documented highly conserved patterns of specificity to host taxa and host parts. Widespread species of plants can support 13 species of flies. Within single populations of plants, we typically found one or more fly species specific to female flowers and multiple specialists on male flowers. We suggest that neotropical herbivorous insect diversity is not simply a function of plant taxonomic and architectural diversity, but also reflects the geographic distribution of hosts and the age and area of the neotropics."

Mutagenesis on P2X1 receptors of conserved residues in mammalian P2X receptors has established the paradigm that three lysine residues, as well as FT and NFR motifs, play an important role in mediating ATP action. In this study we have determined whether cysteine substitution mutations of equivalent residues in P2X2 and P2X4 receptors have similar effects and if these mutant receptors can be regulated by charged methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds. All the mutants (except the P2X2 K69C and K71C that were expressed, but non-functional) showed a significant decrease in ATP potency, with >300-fold decreases for mutants of the conserved asparagine, arginine, and lysine residues close to the end of the extracellular loop. MTS reagents had no effect at the phenylalanine of the FT motif, in contrast, cysteine mutation of the threonine was sensitive to MTS reagents and suggested a role of this residue in ATP action. The lysine-substituted receptors were sensitive to the charge of the MTS reagent consistent with the importance of positive charge at this position for coordination of the negatively charged phosphate of ATP. At the NFR motif the asparagine and arginine residues were sensitive to MTS reagents, whereas the phenylalanine was either unaffected or showed only a small decrease.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1356-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As the receptors provide novel drug targets for a range of diseases (9Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 58-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) an understanding of the agonist binding site would be useful for rational drug design. However, it is clear that common ATP binding sequences, e.g. the Walker motif (10Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar), are not present in P2X receptors. In the absence of a crystal structure a site-directed mutagenesis approach has been used to gain insight into amino acids important in mediating the actions of ATP at P2X receptors. We have used the human P2X1 receptor and alanine mutagenesis of conserved residues in the extracellular loop (Fig. 1) to propose a model of the ATP binding site (reviewed in Refs. 11Vial C. Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 487-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 12Roberts J.A. Vial C. Digby H.R. Agboh K.C. Wen H.

Cysteine substitution mutagenesis and charged methanethiosulfonate (MTS) 3The abbreviations used are: MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; WT, wild type. compounds have been useful in investigating a variety of ion channels including the pore region (13Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as residues involved in ATP action/sensitivity at P2X receptors (15Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4072-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have used this approach to study the contribution of the 44 amino acids before the second transmembrane domain to ATP action at the P2X1 receptor (16Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4072-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For example, we have shown that for the mutant K309C, ATP potency and binding of radiolabeled 2-azido-ATP is reduced. The K309C mutant was also accessible to MTS reagents. When positively charged MTSEA ((2-aminoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide) modifies a free cysteine residue it produces a positively charged side chain of similar size to lysine (17Fountain S.J. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15044-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MTSEA application rescued ATP potency at K309C supporting that the charged lysine at this position plays a role in coordinating the binding of the negatively charged phosphate tail of ATP (16Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4072-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition our work with alanine and cysteine mutants has also identified residues that are unlikely to play a major role in ATP action (Fig. 1). Taken together our work has given rise to a model of the ATP binding site with the phosphate tail of ATP bound to residues Lys68 and Lys309, and the aromatic ring sandwiched between residues Phe185-Thr186 and Asn290-Phe291-Arg292. This is supported by a recent study on the P2X1 receptor showing that substituted cysteine mutants of residues Lys68 and Phe291 can form an intersubunit disulfide bond and this is inhibited in the presence of ATP (18Marquez-Klaka B. Rettinger J. Bhargava Y. Eisele T. Nicke A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The model is also corroborated by some mutagenesis studies from P2X2 and P2X4 receptors (15Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Stojilkovic S.S. Tomic M. He M.L. Yan Z. Koshimizu T.A. Zemkova H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1048: 116-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, an alternative model of ATP action at the P2X4 receptor based on a similarity in predicted structure to the tRNA synthetases has also been suggested (20Yan Z. Liang Z. Tomic M. Obsil T. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1078-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study to determine whether P2X receptor subunits share a core common mode of ATP action we tested at P2X2 and P2X4 receptors whether cysteine mutagenesis of the residues corresponding to those proposed in the P2X1 receptor model have any effects on ATP potency or the action of MTS reagents. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cysteine point mutations for residues were introduced via the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using a human P2X2 receptor or rat P2X4-myc (Y378A) plasmid as the template. Human P2X2 receptor plasmid (gift of Dr. Andrew Powell, GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom) contained the sequence of the P2X2a isoform (Q9UBL9) with the NH2-terminal variant MAAAQPKYPAGATA → MV as described. 4R. A. McMahon, T. M. Egan, P. T. Hurley, A. Nelson, M. Rogers, and F. Martin, submitted to EMBL-EBI Data Bank with accession number AF109387. For the rat P2X4-myc (gift of Dr. Francois Rassendren, CNRS, Montpellier, France), the mutant Y378A was created and used as the template for more stable currents (21Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Production of the correct mutations and absence of coding errors in the P2X2 and P2X4 mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (Automated ABI Sequencing Service, University of Leicester). Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Wild type and mutant constructs were transcribed to produce sense strand cRNA (mMessage mMachine™, Ambion, TX) as described previously (22Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Manually defoliculated stage V X. laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl (50 ng) of cRNA using an Inject+Matic microinjector (J. Alejandro Gaby, Genéva, Switzerland) and stored at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Media was changed daily prior to recording 3–7 days later. Electrophysiological Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings (at a holding potential of –60 mV) were carried out on cRNA-injected oocytes using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier with a Digidata 1322 analog to digital converter and pClamp 8.2 acquisition software (Axon Instruments) as previously described (22Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Native oocyte calcium-activated chloride currents in response to P2X receptor stimulation were reduced by replacing 1.8 mm CaCl2 with 1.8 mm BaCl2 in the ND96 bath solution. ATP (magnesium salt, Sigma) was applied via a U-tube perfusion system. ATP (0.1 μm to 10 mm) was applied at 5-min intervals, using this regime reproducible ATP-evoked responses were recorded. Individual concentration-response curves were fitted with the Hill equation: Y = [(X)H × M]/[(X)H + (EC50)H], where Y is response, X is agonist concentration, H is the Hill coefficient, M is maximum response, and EC50 is the concentration of agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response. pEC50 is the –log10 of the EC50 value. Mutants that had considerably shifted ATP potency were tested with ATP concentrations up to 10 mm. For the calculation of EC50 values individual concentration-response curves were generated for each experiment and statistical analysis carried out on the pEC50 data generated. In the figures, concentration-response curves are fitted to the mean normalized data. Characterization of the Effects of Methanethiosulfonate Compounds—To study the effect of MTS compounds on ATP activation at wild type and cysteine mutants, ATP (∼EC50 concentration) was applied and either MTSEA or sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) were bath-perfused (for at least 5 min; the recovery time required between application to see reproducible responses) prior to coapplication with ATP via the U-tube as described previously (15Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4072-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MTS reagents (1 mm) were made in ND96 solution immediately prior to use. MTS reagents were applied for 10 min with the maximal, or near maximal response seen after 5 min. The effects of the MTS reagents on the P2X2 receptor mutants were the same following washout of the compounds showing that they irreversibly modified the receptors. The effects of the MTS compounds on the mutant P2X4 receptors were reversible following a 5–10 min washout. The P2X4 receptor has been shown to be subject to extensive constitutive and agonist induced trafficking (23Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) even for the Y378A mutant used in this study (21Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Royle S.J. Qureshi O.S. Bobanovic L.K. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3073-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine whether longer incubations could be used to irreversibly modify P2X4 mutant receptors we treated the oocytes for 3 h in the presence of MTSES (1 mm) and 3.2 units/ml of apyrase to break down any endogenous ATP, or just apyrase. This longer incubation was aimed to modify more of the pool of P2X4 receptors. This was followed by washing and subsequent testing of responses to an EC50 concentration of ATP (in the absence of MTSES). This treatment had no effect on the amplitude of WT P2X4 receptor currents, however, reductions of the mutants were equivalent to those where MTSES was present during the recordings demonstrating that any changes in properties for the mutant receptors result from irreversible modification of introduced cysteine residues and that cysteine residues were available in the resting un-liganded state of the receptor. MTS reagents have a reasonably short half-life and this suggests that the 1 mm concentration used is supramaximal and there was still sufficient reagent present during the 3-h incubation to irreversibly modify the receptors. These results suggest that the reversal of MTS effects following washout of short applications is likely to result from trafficking of un-modified receptors to the cell surface and longer incubations are required to irreversibly modify the whole pool of P2X4 mutant receptors. We have therefore presented data for effects on an EC50 concentration of ATP during the presence of the MTS reagents as this allows us to analyze data from the same oocyte before and during application of the reagents. The effects of MTS reagents on the concentration responses to ATP for P2X2 receptors were investigated following washout of MTSEA (applied at 1 mm for 10 min in the absence of agonist), there was no effect on WT responses. For P2X4 receptors the effects of MTSEA on concentration responses were investigated by application of ATP following incubating the oocytes for 1 h in MTSEA (1 mm) and washout of MTSEA. ATP concentrations were applied via the U-tube with ND96 bathing solution (no MTS reagents present). Western Blotting—Expression levels of wild type and mutant receptors were estimated by Western blot analysis of total cellular protein and cell surface proteins. Total cellular protein samples were prepared from oocytes injected with wild type or mutant receptor cRNA homogenized in buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture) at 20 μl/oocyte. Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) labels cell surface proteins by reacting with primary amines and was used to estimate the level of wild type or mutant receptor trafficked to the cell surface membrane. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin is impermeable to the cell membrane and can only biotinylate proteins available at the cell surface. Oocytes injected with wild type or mutant receptor cRNA were treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in ND96 for 30 min and washed with ND96. Oocytes were homogenized in buffer H, and the spin-cleared supernatant was mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) treated as described previously (25Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). All samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading. Samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and screened for immunoreactivity for the anti-P2X2 or P2X4 antibody (1:500) (Alomone, Israel). Analysis—All data are shown as mean ± S.E. Significant differences between WT and mutant maximum current amplitudes, agonist potency, and MTS reagent modification were calculated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparisons of individual mutants against control using the GraphPad Prism package. Differences in mutant concentration response curves for individual mutants, on treatment with MTSEA, were tested with Student's t test. n corresponds to the number of oocytes tested for electrophysiological data. Effects of Cysteine Mutants on ATP Responses at P2X2 Receptors—At WT human P2X2 receptors ATP evoked concentration-dependent inward currents with an EC50 of ∼13 μm (Fig. 2 and Table 1) similar to that reported previously for this receptor (14Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Robust currents were also recorded for F183C, T184C, and F289C mutants, however, they showed a modest 4–10-fold decrease in ATP potency (Fig. 2, Table 1). The peak amplitude of currents to a maximal concentration of ATP (10 mm) were reduced by ∼90% for the mutant R290C and for this receptor the amplitude of responses continued to increase between 3 and 10 mm indicating the EC50 is >3 mm ATP. At mutants N288C and K307C 10 mm ATP evoked very small currents suggesting that the EC50 for these receptors is >3 mm. No currents were recorded in response to 10 mm ATP for mutants K69C and K71C. Analysis of the expression of both total and surface levels of P2X2 WT and mutant receptors with reduced peak current amplitudes showed that there was at most an ∼50% reduction in surface expression (K307C), predicting a halving in peak current amplitude, however, there was a >97% reduction in amplitudes for K69C, K71C, and N288C. This indicates that any reductions in current amplitude compared with WT were predominantly due to an effect on channel properties and not trafficking to the cell surface. Overall these results are consistent with those from similar mutants for the P2X1 receptor (12Roberts J.A. Vial C. Digby H.R. Agboh K.C. Wen H. Atterbury-Thomas A.E. Evans R.J. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 486-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of the effects of cysteine substitution on P2X2 and P2X4nA (max)EC50pEC50MTSEAMTSESHuman P2X2 WT4465 ± 47713 μm4.89 ± 0.1127 ± 2%101 ± 3% K69CNFaNF, nonfunctional.NFNFNo effectNo effect K71CNFNFNFNo effectNo effect F183C4661 ± 120940 μm4.40 ± 0.1bp < 0.01, n = 3-18.128 ± 2%96 ± 1% T184C4515 ± 1402117 μm3.93 ± 0.1cp < 0.001, n = 3-18.195 ± 11%dp < 0.05, n = 3-18.20 ± 3%cp < 0.001, n = 3-18.

Open table in a new tab Effects of MTS Reagents on Cysteine Mutant P2X2 Receptors—At P2X receptors the 10 conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular domain are thought to form five intrasubunit disulfide bonds (25Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Clyne J.D. Wang L.F. Hume R.I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substituted cysteine accessibility method has been used to look at the contribution of introduced cysteine mutants to receptor function, where modification of properties following application of MTS reagents indicates that the introduced cysteine residue is accessible in the aqueous environment and may play an important role in receptor function (28Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Previously, charged MTS reagents (positively charged MTSEA and negatively charged sodium MTSES), have been used to probe residues involved in ATP action at P2X receptors (15Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4072-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as they may interact with the negative charge of the phosphate tail of ATP or magnesium complexed with ATP in physiological solutions giving rise to localized positive charge. At WT P2X2 receptors MTSEA (1 mm) produced a small increase (128 ± 3% of control) in the response to an EC50 concentration of ATP (Table 1, Fig. 3) as reported previously for this receptor (13Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MTSEA had no effect on the potency of ATP and current amplitudes returned to control levels on washout. MTSEA had a similar effect at F183C and F289C mutant P2X2 receptors (Table 1, Fig. 3). At T184C there was an increase in potentiation to 195 ± 11% of control, however, on washout this was reduced to 141 ± 11% of control indicating that it results from a combination of the reversible effect seen for WT and an additional irreversible modification. R290C and K307C MTSEA produced a significantly larger increase in the response to an EC50 concentration of ATP (Table 1, Fig. 3) that was sustained on washout indicating that it results from irreversible modification of the introduced cysteine. At R290C the amplitude of responses was still rising in response to increases from 3 to 10 mm ATP, indicating a large decrease in ATP sensitivity at this mutant. MTSEA application for 10 min in the absence of agonist resulted in a large increase in amplitude of responses and a leftward shift in the concentration response to ATP and now a fully saturating concentration response was generated following MTSEA treatment (pEC50 values 2.8 ± 0.1, estimated from a free fit as responses did not saturate for control, to 3.3 ± 0.2, p < 0.01, for MTSEA, n = 3–4) (Fig. 4). Responses to a high concentration of ATP (10 mm) were small (∼50 nA) for the K307C mutant and responses were below the limit of detection for 1 mm ATP, however, following a 10-min MTSEA treatment (and washout) there was a very large increase in the amplitude of responses and the pEC50 for ATP in the presence of MTSEA was 3.5 ± 0.1 (n = 7). As MTSEA was able to rescue the responses to mutants with small amplitude currents we tested whether MTSEA had any effect on mutants where receptor protein could be detected at the cell surface but little or no current was detected in response to high concentrations of ATP. At N288C the responses to ATP (3 mm) were reduced to 22 ± 5% of control following MTSEA treatment, this effect was sustained on MTSEA washout. For mutants K69C and K71C, ATP-evoked currents were still not detected following MTSEA treatment. The negatively charged MTS reagent MTSES (1 mm) had no effect on currents at WT P2X2 receptors (Table 1, Fig. 3) as described previously (15Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly MTSES had no effect on ATP responses at F183C mutant P2X2 receptors (Table 1, Fig. 3). MTSES, however, reduced the amplitude of response to an EC50 concentration of ATP by ∼80% for mutants T184C, N288C, R290C, and K307C, a more modest ∼20% decrease was recorded at F289C (Table 1, Fig. 3). These effects were maintained following washout of MTSES indicating that the reagent was acting irreversibly to modify the introduced cysteine residues. For non-functional mutants K69C and K71C in the presence of MTSES, 3 mm ATP still did not evoke a response. Effects of Cysteine Mutants on ATP Responses at P2X4 Receptors—The myc-tagged rat P2X4 receptor with the Y378A mutation was used as the background for these studies. The Y378A mutation was introduced to improve surface expression of the receptor (21Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and increased the peak amplitude of ATP currents by >20–50-fold in the present study. ATP evoked concentration-dependent responses at the rat P2X4-myc Y378C receptor with an EC50 of ∼13 μm (Table 1, Fig. 5) similar to that reported previously for rat P2X4 receptors (29Bo X. Zhang Y. Nassar M. Burnstock G. Schoepfer R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 30Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A.

Physiol. 2005; 125: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and this construct will be referred to as P2X4 WT. At all cysteine mutants tested there was a decrease in ATP potency. For F185C, T186C, and F294C mutants full concentration-response curves were generated and the EC50 for ATP was increased by ∼20-, 50-, and 4-fold, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 5). For the remaining mutants (K67C, K69C, N293C, R295C, and K313C) ATP-evoked responses did not saturate at the maximum concentration tested (10 mm) and for these mutants the ATP EC50 is reported as >3 mm (Table 1, Fig. 5). Mutants K67C, R295C, and K313C had reduced maximal current amplitudes compared with WT, however, this was not reflected by a marked reduction in either total or surface expression of the receptors (Fig. 4C). For the mutant N293C the smaller peak current amplitudes may result in part from a reduction in trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface (Fig. 4C). Effects of MTS Reagents on Cysteine Mutant P2X4 Receptors—Positively charged MTSEA (1 mm) had no effect on ATP-evoked currents at WT P2X4 receptors (Table 1, Fig. 6) consistent with that described previously (17Fountain S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2063405392,"Tumor development involves complex bidirectional interactions between tumor cells and host stromal cells. Endosialin (Tem1) has been identified as a highly O-glycosylated transmembrane glycoprotein, which is specifically expressed by tumor vessel-associated pericytes and stromal fibroblasts of a wide range of human tumors. Recent experiments in endosialin-deficient mice have unraveled a critical role of endosialin in site-specific tumor progression and metastasis. To molecularly understand the mechanisms of endosialin function, we aimed to identify extracellular endosialin ligands and identified Mac-2 BP/90K as a specific interaction partner. Detailed biochemical analyses identified a C-terminal fragment of Mac-2 BP/90K, which was shown to contain binding sites for galectin-3, and collagens as the structures responsible for endosialin binding. Subsequent expression analysis of Mac-2 BP/90K in vivo revealed weak or no expression in most normal tissues and strong up-regulation in tumor cells of human neoplastic tissues. Intriguingly, the expression patterns of Mac-2 BP/90K and endosialin were mutually exclusive in all human tissues. Correspondingly, loss-of-function adhesion experiments of Mac-2 BP/90K-expressing tumor cells on endosialin-expressing fibroblasts revealed a repulsive outcome of the Mac-2 BP/90K interaction. Taken together, the experiments identify a novel repulsive interaction between endosialin on stromal fibroblasts and Mac-2 BP/90K on tumor cells."

Despite their structural similarity, endothelial NOS (eNOS) has a 6-fold lower NO synthesis activity and 6–16-fold lower cytochrome c reductase activity than neuronal NOS (nNOS), implying significantly different electron transfer capacities. We utilized purified reductase domain constructs of either enzyme (bovine eNOSr and rat nNOSr) to investigate the following three mechanisms that may control their electron transfer: (i) the set point and control of a two-state conformational equilibrium of their FMN subdomains; (ii) the flavin midpoint reduction potentials; and (iii) the kinetics of NOSr-NADP+ interactions. Although eNOSr and nNOSr differed in their NADP(H) interaction and flavin thermodynamics, the differences were minor and unlikely to explain their distinct electron transfer activities. In contrast, calmodulin (CaM)-free eNOSr favored the FMN-shielded (electron-accepting) conformation over the FMN-deshielded (electron-donating) conformation to a much greater extent than did CaM-free nNOSr when the bound FMN cofactor was poised in each of its three possible oxidation states. NADPH binding only stabilized the FMN-shielded conformation of nNOSr, whereas CaM shifted both enzymes toward the FMN-deshielded conformation. Analysis of cytochrome c reduction rates measured within the first catalytic turnover revealed that the rate of conformational change to the FMN-deshielded state differed between eNOSr and nNOSr and was rate-limiting for either CaM-free enzyme. We conclude that the set point and regulation of the FMN conformational equilibrium differ markedly in eNOSr and nNOSr and can explain the lower electron transfer activity of eNOSr. Nitric oxide (NO) is a physiological mediator synthesized by NO synthases (NOS).

NO is synthesized from l-Arg by the NO synthases (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39), a family of homodimeric enzymes that are commonly known as neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible NOS in mammals (2Stuehr D.J.

Each NOS monomer consists of an N-terminal oxygenase domain (NOSoxy) that contains binding sites for iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), (6R)-5,6,7,8,-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B), and l-Arg, a flavoprotein subdomain that contains binding sites for FAD, FMN, and NADPH, and an intervening calmodulin (CaM)-binding sequence (3Li H.

Although the NOSoxy structure is unique, NOSr shares structural and catalytic features with a family of NADPH-utilizing dual-flavin enzymes, including cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), methionine synthase reductase, sulfite reductase flavoprotein, and novel reductase-1 (6Wolthers K.R.

The dual-flavin enzymes all consist of a subdomain that binds NADPH and FAD (FNR subdomain) and a subdomain that binds FMN (FMN subdomain).

In this model the nNOSr structure shifts between an “FMN-shielded” conformation that has the FMN subdomain interacting with the FNR subdomain to receive electrons, and an “FMN-deshielded” conformation that has the FMN subdomain moved away from the FNR subdomain and exposing the FMN surface so it may transfer electrons to protein acceptors like the NOSoxy domain or cytochrome c (Fig. 1). The conformational equilibrium of nNOSr is known to be regulated by CaM and NADPH binding (27Tiso M. Konas D.W. Panda K. Garcin E.D. Sharma M. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

One residue located just upstream in sequence from the C-terminal tail (Phe-1395 in nNOS) is also critical for regulation of the nNOSr conformational equilibrium. The presence of this Phe is required to shift the nNOSr conformational equilibrium toward its FMN-shielded form in the absence of bound CaM (24Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W.

Phe-1395 is also required to facilitate NADP+ dissociation so that this step does not become rate-limiting during catalysis by the CaM-bound form of nNOSr. CaM binding destabilizes the FMN-shielded state of nNOSr, and this has been proposed to be a primary mechanism by which CaM may increase the cytochrome c reductase activity of nNOSr (28Craig D.H.

However, CaM binding is also proposed to speed intermolecular electron transfer between the bound FAD and FMN cofactors (33Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys.

To address this issue we characterized an Escherichia coli-expressed bovine eNOSr, focusing on three mechanisms that could possibly cause its low activity. These mechanisms are a slow NADP+ release, altered flavin midpoint potentials relative to nNOSr, and a different native FMN-shielded:FMN-deshielded ratio (or equilibrium “set point”) plus differential effects of CaM and NADPH binding on the eNOSr set point relative to nNOSr (i.e. regulation of the conformational equilibrium). We ran identical experiments with nNOSr to enable a direct comparison. Our results show there are significant differences in the set point and regulation of the conformational equilibrium of eNOSr and nNOSr that can explain their individual catalytic activities. General Methods and Materials—All reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma, Amersham Biosciences, or other sources as reported previously (24Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W.

Absorption spectra and steady-state kinetic data were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC or Cary 50 Biospectrometer. Single wavelength stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed using a Hi-Tech Scientific (Salisbury, UK) SF-61 instrument equipped with anaerobic setup and photomultiplier detection. Full-spectra stopped-flow experiments were performed using a Hi-Tech Scientific KinetAsyst SF-61DX2 stopped-flow system equipped with anaerobic setup and rapid-scanning photodiode array detector. Data from multiple identical stopped-flow experiments were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral traces were fit according to single or multiple exponential equations using software provided by the instrument manufacturer. The best fit was determined when adding further exponentials did not improve the fit as judged from the residuals. All plots and some additional curve-fitting were done using Origin® 7.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). All experiments were repeated two or more times with at least two independently prepared batches of proteins to ensure consistent reproducibility of the results. Data were analyzed and are expressed as mean ± S.D. For all experiments and protein purifications, the buffer used contained 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl (buffer A), unless noted otherwise. Anaerobic samples were prepared in an air-tight cuvette using repeated cycles of vacuum followed by a positive pressure of catalyst-deoxygenated nitrogen gas. All NOSr proteins samples were fully oxidized by adding potassium ferricyanide, and the excess potassium ferricyanide was removed by passing through a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, GE Healthcare). Molecular Biology, Protein Expression, Purification, and Analysis—A recombinant bovine eNOSr construct that contains an intact CaM -binding site (amino acids 445–1204) was created using a PCR-based approach. The PCR primers were used to amplify a fragment from eNOS that introduced an NdeI and a start codon at the 5′ end (5′-TTTT CAT ATG GTC AAC TAC ATC CTG TCC CCT-3′; reverse 5′-AAT GCC GCC TTT GCC CAA CCA C-3′). The PCR product was gel-purified and digested with NdeI and SacI. The resulting 673-bp fragment was cloned into the pCWori vector that had been similarly digested with NdeI and SacI. After confirming the DNA sequence, the vector was transformed into E. coli Rosetta cells and selected using ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The rat nNOSr construct (695–1429) was prepared as described previously with modifications (35Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The nNOSr proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with a pACYC plasmid containing human CaM and selected with chloramphenicol to co-express CaM with the protein. The eNOSr and nNOSr proteins were purified using 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by CaM-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (24Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35412-35425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were concentrated, buffer-exchanged (buffer A), and stored at -80 °C. The purity of protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectroscopy. The concentration of NOSr proteins was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 22,900 m-1 cm-1 at 457 nm for the fully oxidized form. To quantify protein-bound flavins, a known amount of NOSr was boiled in a sealed vial shielded from light to release the flavins followed by centrifugation to remove the denatured protein. The concentration of free flavins in the supernatant was determined by absorbance spectroscopy (λmax = 447 nm; ϵ447 nm = 12.2 mm-1 cm-1). Steady-state Cytochrome c Reduction Assays—The cytochrome c reductase activity was determined at 10 and 25 °C by monitoring the absorbance increase at 550 nm and using an extinction coefficient ϵ550 = 21 mm-1cm-1 as described previously (40Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interaction between the NOSr Proteins and NADP+ or thio-NADP+—UV-visible spectral changes resulting from the association of NADP+ or thio-NADP+ (S-NADP+) with the eNOSr and nNOSr proteins were determined by calculating a difference spectrum between the protein (40 μm) before and after treatment with a 3-fold molar excess of NADP+ or S-NADP+ (120 μm). For these experiments, the eNOSr and nNOSr proteins were incubated with 1 mm of 2′-AMP and then passed through a PD-10 desalting column prior to use to remove any NADP+ that remained bound to the proteins (22Tiso M. Tejero J. Panda K. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 14418-14428Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35412-35425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The observed rate constant (koff) values for the dissociation of either NADP+ or S-NADP+ from the eNOSr and nNOSr proteins were determined in the stopped-flow instrument at 10 °C. A solution containing eNOSr or nNOSr (40 μm) and NADP+ or S-NADP+ (120 μm) was rapidly mixed with a solution of 2′,5′-ADP (4 mm). The absorbance changes were monitored at 300–700 nm spectral range. The kinetic traces were fit to a single-exponential decay function to yield the observed NADP+ or S-NADP+ dissociation rate (koff). Redox Potentiometry—Sample preparation and redox titrations were carried out in a glove box (Bell Technology) under nitrogen atmosphere with oxygen levels below 5 ppm as described previously (41Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12596-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The NOSr protein concentration was 30–40 μm containing either EDTA (1 mm) or CaCl2 (2 mm) + CaM (60–80 μm) in buffer A. Absorption spectra were recorded in Cary 50 using a dip probe detector, and the potentials were monitored using Accumet AB15 coupled to a silver/silver chloride electrode saturated with 4 m KCl. Measurements were done in a custom-made glass beaker kept in a water bath at 15 ± 1 °C. A reductive titration was performed by stepwise addition of sodium dithionite, whereas an oxidative titration was done by adding potassium ferricyanide. The redox mediators with midpoint potentials in the range of flavin potentials used were 0.5–1 μm of phenazine methasulfate (+80 mV), indigo carmine (-125 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-152 mV), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfide (-184 mV), anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (-225 mV), phenosafranin (-252 mV), safranin O (-280 mV), benzyl viologen (-348 mV), and methyl viologen (-443 mV). The electrode was calibrated against phenosafranin (-252 mV) and the potential of a 5 mm solution of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), at 25 °C (+425 mV). A correction factor of (+199 mV) was obtained, which is in good agreement with the reported potential of the electrode. Based on the temperature dependence of the electrode potential, a correction factor of (+209 mV) at 15 °C was used. The absorption changes at 457 and at 600 nm were plotted with electrochemical potentials (mV). The midpoint potentials were calculated using the four-electron Nernst Equation 1, A=(a10(2E−E1′−E2′)/57+b10(E−E2′)/57+c +d10(E3′−E)/57+e10(E3′+E4′−2E)/57)(1+10(2E−E1′−E2′)/57+10(E−E2′)/57 +10(E3′−E)/57+10(E3′+E4′−2E)/57)(Eq. 1) where A is the absorbance; a–e are the relative absorbance values contributed by the diflavin in each of five nondegenerate oxidation states; E is the observed system potential, and E′1 – E′4 are the four midpoint potentials, two for each flavin. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Flavin fluorescence was measured at room temperature using a Hitachi model F-2000 spectrofluorometer. Different concentrations from 1–5 μm of the oxidized eNOSr and nNOSr proteins were dissolved in buffer A. The samples were placed in a 1-ml quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Both proteins were excited at 457 nm wave-length, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded from 480 to 650 nm. The isolated FNR subdomain was prepared as described previously (41Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12596-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensities of the FNR subdomain in buffer A were also measured under similar conditions. A correction factor was generated from a linear regression fit of the FNR subdomain fluorescence intensities versus its concentration to obtain only the FMN subdomain fluorescence intensity in the eNOSr and nNOSr samples. This correction factor was subtracted from the total flavin fluorescence intensity of each protein. The maximum fluorescence at 525 nm of eNOSr and nNOSr proteins was plotted versus protein concentration. Linear regression analysis of the data gave the slope of the line for each sample. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR sample preparation and power saturation experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (24Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35412-35425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, solutions (40 μm) of eNOSr and nNOSr were prepared in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 25% glycerol (v/v). The proteins were initially treated with a slight molar excess of NADPH and allowed to air-oxidize to generate the flavin semiquinone radical species before being frozen in EPR tubes. For CaM-bound samples, CaM (80 μm) and CaCl2 (2 mm) were added. Each sample contained either 0, 3.3, 6.7, 10, or 13 mm dysprosium(III)-HEDTA comp"

The genes encoding nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase (ndt) from Lactobacillus leichmannii and Lactobacillus fermentum underwent random mutagenesis to select variants specialized for the synthesis of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides. An Escherichia coli strain, auxotrophic for uracil and unable to use 2',3'-dideoxyuridine, cytosine, and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine as a source of uracil was constructed. Randomly mutated lactobacilli ndt libraries from two species, L. leichmannii and L. fermentum, were screened for the production of uracil with 2',3'-dideoxyuridine as a source of uracil. Several mutants suitable for the synthesis of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of the corresponding genes revealed a single mutation (G --> A transition) leading to the substitution of a small aliphatic amino acid by a nucleophilic one, A15T (L. fermentum) or G9S (L. leichmannii), respectively. We concluded that the adaptation of the nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase activity to 2,3-dideoxyribosyl transfer requires an additional hydroxyl group on a key amino acid side chain of the protein to overcome the absence of such a group in the corresponding substrate. The evolved proteins also display significantly improved nucleoside 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyribosyltransferase activity."

In the presence of H218O2, one labeled oxygen atom was incorporated into these products. The hHO-1-isoporphyrin complexes were found to have half-lives of 1.7 and 2.4 h for the p-trifluoromethyl- and p-methyl-substituted phenylhemes, respectively. The addition of NADPH-P450 reductase to the H2O2-generated hHO-1-isoporphyrin complex produced α-biliverdin, confirming its role as a reaction intermediate.

The reaction releases iron, which is largely recycled, and produces CO and biliverdin. Recent studies have shown that the CO has important physiological functions, in part as a cell signaling molecule (1Kim H.P. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 411-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), whereas the biliverdin is immediately converted to bilirubin, a powerful antioxidant species (2Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar, 3Baranano D.E. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence suggests that these heme oxygenase products have significant protective roles in a number of disease processes, including atherogenesis and carcinogenesis (4Stocker R. Perrella M.A. Circulation. 2006; 114: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 5Berberat P.O. Dambrauskas Z. Gulbinas A. Giese T. Giese N. Kunzli B. Autschbach F. Meuer S. Buchler M.W. Friess H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 3790-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, heme degradation by pathogenic bacterial heme oxygenases, which is essential for their survival because it serves as a primary source of iron, makes these enzymes of potential interest for antibacterial strategies (6Furci L.M. Lopes P. Eakanunkul S. Zhong S. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Wilks A. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 3804-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) utilizes O2 and NADPH in the three-step process shown in Fig. 1 (7Unno M. Matsui T. Ikeda-Saito M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2305-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The heme acts as both a substrate and a cofactor that sequentially activates a total of three O2 molecules in oxidation of the macrocycle, a process that requires seven electrons provided by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). In the first step, the two-electron reduction of O2 at the heme iron generates a ferrous hydroperoxide intermediate (Fe(III)-OOH) that inserts the terminal oxygen of the peroxide moiety into the α-meso carbon of the same heme, generating α-meso-hydroxyheme (10Wilks A. Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 8204-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The second step utilizes one molecule of O2 to form verdoheme in a reaction that results in elimination of the α-meso carbon as CO. Finally, in the third step the verdoheme is transformed into biliverdin in a reaction that requires both O2 and five reducing equivalents from CPR.An analogous heme degradation reaction can occur spontaneously in a coordinating solvent such as pyridine in the presence of an electron donor such as ascorbate. This process of “coupled oxidation” is non-regiospecific so that random oxidation occurs at all four meso carbons to give a mixture of the corresponding IXα, IXβ, IXγ, and IXδ biliverdin isomers (12Bonnett R. McDonagh A.F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1973; 9: 881-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hHO-1-catalyzed reaction regiospecifically oxidizes the α-meso carbon. Multiple factors contribute to this hHO-1 regiospecificity. Of primary importance are the steric constraints imposed by the distal helix in which two conserved glycine residues at its center, Gly-139 and Gly-143, provide the flexibility required to sandwich the heme between two helices (14Takahashi S.

Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct.

Lightning L.K. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34501-34507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure of nitric oxide-bound hHO-1 indicates that in addition to this steric constraint, a hydrogen bonding network involving Asp140-water-NO H-bonds cause a tilt of the NO toward the α-meso carbon (17Lad L. Wang J. Li H. Friedman J. Bhaskar B. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, the orientation of the heme relative to an axis through the iron perpendicular to the heme plane is determined by electrostatic interactions between charged residues on the protein and the heme propionate groups (18Zhou H. Migita C.T. Sato M. Sun D.Y. Zhang X.H. Ikeda-Saito M. Fujii H. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8311-8312Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Wang J. Evans J.P. Ogura H. La Mar G.N. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Heme oxygenase can utilize a number of alternate Fe(III)porphyrins as substrates with the only clear prerequisite being the presence of the two vicinal propionate groups (20Frydman R.B. Tomaro M.L. Buldain G. Awruch J. Diaz L. Frydman B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous studies have investigated the oxidation of hemes in which the α-meso carbon bears a methyl, formyl, or phenyl substituent (21Torpey J. Lee D.A. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9172-9173Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42593-42604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, phenyl-substituted hemes readily bind to the hHO-1 active site due to the presence of a hydrophobic cavity, formed by residues Met-34, Phe-37, and Phe-214, that is postulated to function as a CO trapping site (24Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hHO-1 oxidation of α-meso-methyl and -phenyl-substituted hemes produces α-biliverdin, whereas the oxidation of α-meso-formyl heme does not. The product containing the α-meso carbon in the oxidation of α-meso-methylheme was not identified but was inferred to be acetic acid. More recently, benzoic acid has been identified as a product of the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of α-meso-phenylheme. An additional intermediate is required to account for benzoic acid formation (23Wang J. Niemevz F. Lad L. Huang L. Alvarez D.E. Buldain G. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42593-42604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).To further characterize the oxidation mechanism of hHO-1, we report here additional studies of the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of α-meso-phenylheme as well as the symmetrical mesoheme III (MH), α-meso-(p-methylphenyl)-mesoheme-III (CH3PMH), and α-meso-(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)-mesoheme-III (CF3PMH). We anticipated that the addition of substituents with varying electron donating/withdrawing properties would modulate the reactivity in a way that would facilitate the detection of intermediates. A unique absorbance appeared transiently during the catalytic reaction with NADPH-CPR in the near IR region that is characteristic of an isoporphyrin. The formation of a long-lived isoporphyrin was confirmed by mass spectrometry in the reaction supported by H2O2. This is the first actual evidence for formation of this unique tetrahedral intermediate during HO catalytic turnover.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—MH, CH3PMH, CF3PMH, and α-meso-phenylheme-IX (PH) were synthesized as described previously (25Niemevz F.

The dimethyl esterified biliverdin isomers were prepared from the corresponding heme by coupled oxidation in the presence of pyridine, O2, and ascorbic acid according to published procedures (27Niemevz F.

NADPH and H2O2 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. H218O2 (90%) and 18O2 (99%) were from Icon Isotopes (Summit, NJ). H218O (95%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA). The concentration of the stock solution of H2O2 was determined from ϵ240 = 43.6 m-1cm-1 (29Hildebrandt A.G. Roots I. Tjoe M. Heinemeyer G.

Superoxide dismutase and catalase were from Sigma-Aldrich.Reconstitution of hHO-1 with Mesoheme Derivatives—MH or one of the mono meso-arylmesohemes was first fully dissolved in a minimum volume of 0.1 N NaOH (sonication was used to aid in dissolution), diluted in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and then added to the purified apo-hHO-1 to give a final 1.2:1 heme:protein ratio. The sample was allowed to stand for at least 2 h at 4 °C before it was applied to a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column (12 ml) preequilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The column was then washed with the same buffer (5 volumes), and the protein was eluted in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The fractions containing the heme-hHO-1 complex were pooled and concentrated.Single Turnover Assays—All spectra were performed on a Varian Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Because all the reactions in this study were carried out in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), this buffer is referred to as the standard buffer. The reaction mixtures (500 μl) contained 5 μm heme-hHO-1 complex, 40 nm CPR, 50 μm NADPH, and 10 μg/ml catalase in standard buffer. Spectra were recorded at 15-s intervals over the range of 300–1000 nm for 20 min. For the H2O2 reactions, 20 μm H2O2 was added in place of NADPH, CPR, and catalase. The reaction was also performed under an argon atmosphere in the presence of 20 μm H2O2 using an anaerobic cuvette with a side arm, where H2O2 was contained in the side-arm until gas exchange was complete, as described previously (34Liu Y. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To monitor the stability of the isoporphyrin-hHO-1 complex, 10 μg/ml catalase was added to the reaction of 5 μm arylheme-hHO-1 and 40 μm H2O2 after 20 min, and the decay was monitored over 6 h.CO Formation Assay—Horse myoglobin (Sigma) was used as a CO trap according to the protocol previously described (23Wang J. Niemevz F. Lad L. Huang L. Alvarez D.E. Buldain G. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42593-42604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reactions (1 ml) consisted of 10 μm arylmesoheme-hHO-1 complex, 60 nm CPR, and 100 μm NADPH in standard buffer and were allowed to proceed for 20 min in a sealed container before the addition of myoglobin via syringe to a final concentration of 4 μm.Biliverdin Isomer Analysis—A solution (300 μl) of 100 μm heme-hHO-1 complex, 2.7 μm CPR, 5 mm NADPH, 10 μg/ml catalase, and 17 units/ml superoxide dismutase in standard buffer was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with two drops of hydrochloric acid (37%) plus a few drops of acetic acid and was then extracted with 700 μl of CH2Cl2. The work-up, esterification, and HPLC analysis were carried out as described previously (19Wang J. Evans J.P. Ogura H. La Mar G.N. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Product Analysis by HPLC and LC-ESI-MS—Reactions (500 μl) containing 10 μm heme-hHO-1 and either 80 μm H2O2 or 10 μg/ml catalase, 160 nm CPR, and 100 μm NADPH in standard buffer were quenched after 20 min with 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Additional reactions were performed by first incubating with 80 μm H2O2 for 20 min followed by the addition of 10 μg/ml of catalase, 160 nm CPR, and 100 μm NADPH for an additional 20 min before the acid quench. The quenched reactions were immediately extracted with 700 μl of CH2Cl2, and the organic phase was evaporated under a stream of air. The resulting residue was dissolved in 100% acetonitrile and was then analyzed on either an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC attached to a G1315B diode array detector using a YMC ODS-AQ column (S-5, 120 Å, 4.5 × 250 mm) or by LC-ESI-MS performed on a Waters Micromass ZQ coupled to a Waters Alliance HPLC system using a Symmetry ODS column (Waters, 3.5 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm). Solvents were water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). The running conditions were identical for each case differing only in flow rate, 1.0 ml/min for the 4.5-mm inner diameter column or 0.2 ml/min for the 2.1-mm inner diameter column, and were as follows: 30% B for 5 min, 30–80% B in 35 min, 80–95% B in 5 min, 95% B for 5 min, 95–30% B in 5 min, and finally 30% B for 5 min. The settings for the mass spectrometer were as follows: mode, ES+; capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; cone voltage, 25 V; desolvation temperature, 300 °C; source temperature, 120 °C.Origin of the Oxygen Atoms in the Products—Oxidation of arylmesohemes by hHO-1 was carried out in the presence of either 18O2, H218O, or H218O2. Reactions in the presence of 18O2 and H218O were performed as described previously (23Wang J. Niemevz F. Lad L. Huang L. Alvarez D.E. Buldain G. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42593-42604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All reactions in the presence of H218O2 were performed as described above but with H218O2 in place of H2O2.RESULTSUV-visible Spectra of meso-Phenylheme-reconstituted hHO-1—The symmetrical MH, CH3PMH, and CF3PMH were combined with hHO-1 followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography to remove excess and non-specifically bound heme. The UV spectra of the ferric, ferrous, and ferrous-CO forms at pH 7.4 (supplemental Fig. S1) reveal that all three heme analogues bind to the active site in a similar mode as heme and, most importantly, that the heme-iron can undergo redox cycling. In the spectrum of MH, replacement of the vinyl groups of heme by ethyl groups places greater electron density on the iron and causes a blue shift of the Soret band from the normal 404 to 394 nm. Upon reduction to the ferrous state, the Soret maximum shifts to 421 nm and, upon further exposure to CO, to 410 nm, consistent with formation of the ferrous-CO complex. In comparison to the MH-hHO-1 complex, the CH3PMH and CF3PMH complexes exhibit a red-shifted Soret maximum at 400 nm that shifts to 426–428 nm in the ferrous state and to ∼416 nm in the ferrous-CO complex. This red-shift is consistent with the presence of an electron-withdrawing substituent (i.e. aryl group) on the heme α-meso carbon that removes electron density from the iron.Formation of CO during the NADPH/CPR-supported Reaction—The normal degradation of heme by hHO-1, supported by electrons from NADPH via CPR, produces biliverdin IXα and CO. An assay based on the binding of CO to ferrous deoxymyoglobin was used to investigate its formation in the NADPH/CPR-supported reactions of MH, CH3PMH, and CF3PMH. In the presence of CO, the Soret maximum of Fe(II) Mb at λmax = 434 nm shifts to λmax = 422 nm (Fe(II)-CO Mb) with α/β bands at 540 and 570 nm, respectively. In the reaction of MH with hHO-1, degradation of the heme clearly generates CO, as shown by the resulting peak at 422 nm. The reactions of CH3PMH and CF3PMH do not show the clear shift in the Soret maximum of Fe(II) MB, instead giving peaks at 431 and 428 nm, respectively, without α/β bands. The absence of the expected peak shifts indicates that no CO was formed.Biliverdin Isomer Analysis by HPLC—To facilitate the isolation and identification of the biliverdin isomers produced from the normal HO reaction, the products were dimethylesterified before HPLC analysis. Chemical oxidation in the absence of hHO-1 using ascorbic acid under coupled oxidation conditions gives a mixture of the isomers from reaction at the non-substituted meso positions of each heme analogue (Fig. 2) (28Niemevz F. Buldain G.Y. J. Porphyrins Phthalocyanines. 2004; 8: 989-995Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of each heme analogue in the presence of NADPH/CPR produces only the α-mesobiliverdin isomer. Even using sodium ascorbate as the electron donor, hHO-1 enforces the specificity for the α-meso position, producing only the α-mesobiliverdin derivative (not shown).FIGURE 2Biliverdin isomer analysis. Chemical oxidation of MH, CH3PMH, and CF3PMH results in oxidation only at the unprotected meso positions, so that coupled oxidation of MH gives three isomers corresponding to the α (26.7 min), β, δ (28.1 min), and γ (30.0 min) (A), CH3PMH gives two isomers, γ (32.1 min) and β,δ (32.6 min) (C), and CF3PMH gives two isomers, β,δ and γ with overlapping retention times (31.9 min) (E). The HPLC of the enzymatic oxidations of MH (B), CH3PMH (D), and CF3PMH (F), shown below the corresponding standard HPLC, shows that it results exclusively in formation of the α-isomer with all three heme substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Single Turnover Reaction Supported by NADPH-CPR—We examined the reactivity of each of the modified heme-hHO-1 complexes with NADPH/CPR (Fig. 3). Upon the addition of NADPH (50 μm, 10 eq relative to heme-hHO-1 complex), CPR (0.04 μm), and catalase, the heme-hHO-1 complex changed immediately to the ferrous-oxy form, as indicated by a shift of the Soret maximum from 405 to 408 nm and the appearance of 530- and 566-nm peaks. Under these conditions this intermediate decays over the course of 20 min with a corresponding increase in the visible region at 680 nm due to the formation of verdoheme and at 640 nm due to CO-bound ferrous verdoheme. Ultimately biliverdin is formed with a broad peak centered at 688 nm (Fig. 3A). The PH-hHO-1 complex, upon the addition of NADPH/CPR, also converted immediately to the ferrous-oxy form as indicated by the Soret shift from 404 to 408 nm (Fig. 3B). However, there are two major differences from the heme-hHO-1 reaction. First, there are transient increases in absorbance at 440 and 900 nm, suggestive of an additional intermediate, and second, there is no detectable CO-ferrous verdoheme absorbance at 640 nm.FIGURE 3Reaction in the presence of O2 and NADPH/CPR.

The intensity of the verdoheme intermediate and mesobiliverdin product are significantly lower than those of the equivalent species in the oxidation of heme itself. The CH3PMH-hHO-1 (Fig. 3D) and CF3PMH-hHO-1 (not shown) complexes underwent a similar Soret shift, going from 400 to 409 nm on conversion to the ferrous oxy form, and a transient increase in absorbance at 440 and 900 nm. In all the arylheme reactions there was a transient increase in absorbance at both 440 and 900 nm that was not observed in the oxidation of heme or MH. These absorbances are characteristic of both isoporphyrins (35Ator M.A. David S.K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9250-9257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and benzoylbiliverdins (36Ongayi O. Fronczek F.R. Vicente M.G.H. Chem. Commun. 2003; : 2298-2299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it was first necessary to determine whether this species was a side product or an intermediate in the pathway of biliverdin formation.Single Turnover Reaction Supported by H2O2—Fe(III)-verdoheme can be generated by reaction of the heme-hHO-1 complex with H2O2 (30Wilks A.

The single turnover reaction of MH with 4 eq of H2O2 (20 μm) resulted in the accumulation of verdoheme, as indicated by a decrease in the Soret band and a concomitant increase at 650 nm (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when the α-meso position is blocked with a phenyl group, as in CH3PMH (Fig. 4B), CF3PMH, and PH (not shown), the reaction exclusively generates what looks like an isoporphyrin intermediate (Fig. 4B), as shown by the decrease in the Soret band with concomitant increases in absorbance at 440 and 930 nm.FIGURE 4Reaction in the presence of four equivalents of H2O2.

Both intermediates exhibit peaks at ∼360 and 435 nm in the UV region and a strong peak with a maximum at ∼935 nm in the near IR region with a side band at 840 nm. This species can be removed from the protein by mild quenching with acid and extraction with dichloromethane. The optical absorption spectra of the extracted isoporphyrins of CH3PMH and CF3PMH dissolved in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 5B) are very similar to those of ferric and zinc isoporphyrins (37Gold A. Ivey W.

Previous studies have implicated inhibition of fibroblast proliferation with polymerized collagen-mediated suppression of S6K1, but the molecular mechanism of the critical negative feedback loop has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that polymerized collagen suppresses G1/S phase transition and fibroblast proliferation by a novel mechanism involving the formation of a β1 integrin-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) complex that represses S6K1 activity. In response to fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen, β1 integrin forms a complex with PP2A that targets TSC2 as a substrate. PP2A represses the level of TSC2 phosphorylation and maintains TSC2 in an activated state. Activated TSC2 negatively regulates the downstream kinase S6K1 and inhibits G1/S transit. Knockdown of TSC2 enables fibroblasts to overcome the anti-proliferative properties of polymerized collagen. Furthermore, we show that this reduction in TSC2 and S6K1 phosphorylation occurs largely independent of Akt. Although S6K1 activity was markedly suppressed by polymerized collagen, we found that minimal changes in Akt activity occurred. We demonstrate that up-regulation of Akt by overexpression of constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 subunit had minor effects on TSC2 and S6K1 phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that polymerized collagen represses fibroblast proliferation by a mechanism involving the formation of a β1 integrin-PP2A-TSC2 complex that negatively regulates S6K1 and inhibits G1/S phase transition.

Control of cell proliferation is a critical event for normal development as well as physiologic repair of tissue following injury. Pathologic proliferation underlies a variety of disease states including tumorigenesis and fibroproliferative disorders involving the lung, liver, kidney, heart, vasculature, and integument (1Bitterman P.B. Henke C.A. Chest. 1991; 99: 81S-84SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to peptide growth factors and cell-cell interactions, the interaction of a cell with the matrix microenvironment is a key regulator of cell proliferation (2Folkman J. Moscona A.

Acting via a negative feedback mechanism, fibroblast synthesis, deposition, and subsequent contact with polymerized collagen restrains their proliferation during normal tissue repair. This provides an effective physiologic mechanism to limit fibroproliferation after tissue injury. Currently, the molecular mechanism of the critical negative feedback loop has not yet been fully elucidated. However, investigation into the mechanism by which polymerized collagen inhibits fibroblast proliferation indicates that integrin-polymerized collagen interaction leads to up-regulation of the cdk2 inhibitors p21 and p27 and subsequent inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2 activity and suppression of the G1/S phase transition (8Koyama H.

Furthermore, polymerized collagen was noted to rapidly and potently decrease the level of S6K1 phosphorylation. The mechanism by which polymerized collagen suppresses S6K1 phosphorylation remains unknown. However, the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A blocked the reduction in S6K1 phosphorylation, suggesting that a protein phosphastase may mediate the effect of polymerized collagen on S6K1 (8Koyama H.

On the basis of this information, we examined the effects of fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen on the ability of PP2A to associate with integrin and regulate S6K1 activity. We have discovered that in response to fibroblast attachment to polymerized collagen, a β1 integrin-PP2A complex forms and targets TSC2 as a substrate. This reduces the level of TSC2 phosphorylation, activating TSC2, inhibiting S6K1, and repressing G1/S phase cell cycle transit.

Anti-Akt, S6K1, TSC2, HA tag, and anti-phospho-Akt, S6K1, and TSC2 antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. Okadaic acid was purchased from Calbiochem. Wortmannin was from Sigma. Collagen Matrices—To prepare two-dimensional monomeric collagen matrices, tissue culture dishes were coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen solution (PureCol, INAMED, Fre-mont, CA) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated (37 °C, 45 min). Three-dimensional polymerized collagen matrices (final concentration, 2 mg/ml) were prepared by neutralizing the collagen solution with ⅙ volume of 6× DMEM and diluting to a final volume with 1× DMEM to which fetal calf serum was added at a final concentration of 1% fetal calf serum. Gels formed following incubation of this solution at 37 °C for 1-2 h as described previously (9Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol.

Lentivirus Vector and Adenoviral Vectors—Lentivirus control and PP2Ac siRNA (hairpin sequence: 5′-CCG GCA CAC AAG TTT ATG GTT TCT ACT CGA GTA G AA ACC ATA AAC TTG TGT GTG TTT TT-3′) vectors were ordered from OPEN Biosystems (Boston, MT). Lentivirus was generated in the 293 cell line by three co-transformations (Lentivirus vector, pCMV, and pMDG). Adenoviral vectors containing constitutively active PI3K p110 (Ad-PI3Kp110-GFP) and control (Ad-GFP) constructs were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Takara Shuzo Co, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). An adenoviral vector containing an HA-tagged PP2A catalytic (c) subunit (Ad-PP2Ac HA) was kindly provided by Dr. Alexander Verin (University of Chicago). The cells were infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 1:20. TSC2 siRNA and Control siRNA—TSC2 and control siRNA were obtained from Invitrogen. TSC2 siRNA is from Validated Stealth RNAi duoPak. Control siRNA is from Stealth RNA interference negative control duplexes. Transient transfection of normal lung fibroblasts was performed using FuGENE. HD siRNA transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Applied Science and utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Cycle Assay—DNA content was analyzed by FACS. Briefly, the cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% alcohol overnight and stained with 2 μg/ml propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml DNase in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 60 min. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was quantified by FACS analysis using FACS Calibur software. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Serum-starved fibroblasts were plated on extracellular matrix-coated plates and lysed at the indicted times using cell lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, with protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science). Western analysis was performed on the resulting lysates. For immunoprecipitation assay, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the lysates were precleared for 1 h at room temperature with protein G beads and immunoprecipitated for 16 h at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody. The samples were processed for Western analysis. Proliferation Assay—Fibroblasts were serum-starved for 2 days and then plated on monomeric (100 μg/ml) or on top of polymerized collagen (2 mg/ml) matrices in DMEM + 1% fetal calf serum. After the cells replated onto polymerized collagen matrices, the media were replaced with DMEM + 10% FBS. The cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 5 h before the cells were harvested at 24 h. The cells were then stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody to quantify DNA synthesis and 7-amino actinomycin D as a measure of total DNA. DNA synthesis was quantified by assessing the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells by FACS according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Bio-sciences, San Diego, CA). For cell cycle analysis, serum-starved fibroblasts were synchronized by pretreatment with 5 mm thymidine for 24 h prior to plating on monomeric or polymerized collagen. PP2A Catalytic (c) Subunit Activity Assay—Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). PP2A catalytic C subunit was immunoprecipitated from lysates containing an equal number of cells by incubation with an anti-PP2A catalytic C subunit antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl), followed by two additional washes with phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). PP2A c activity was then analyzed using a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit that measures free phosphate with a malachite green dye, according to the manufacturer's instructions Upstate (Temecula, CA). Data Analysis—Comparisons of data among each experiment were carried out with unipolar unpaired or paired Student's t test. All of the experiments were replicated a minimum of three times, and the data are expressed as the means ± S.D. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Inhibition of Fibroblast Proliferation by Polymerized Collagen Is Associated with a Reduction in the Level of S6K1 Phosphorylation—Prior studies have demonstrated that compared with monomeric collagen, polymerized collagen displays anti-proliferative properties toward fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (6Schor S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 41: 159-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rhudy R.W. McPherson J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfedlt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we have found that the proliferation of lung fibroblasts is suppressed by polymerized collagen compared with monomeric collagen (Fig. 1A). We have previously found that when fibroblasts interact with monomeric collagen via β1 integrin, the level of Akt and S6k1 phosphorylation is high. However, when we examined the effect of fibroblast attachment to polymerized collagen on the state of Akt/S6K1 activity, the pattern of signaling differed from that observed with monomeric collagen. The level of phosphorylated Akt increased modestly as a function of time when fibroblasts first attached to polymerized collagen, but S6K1 did not become phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). These findings indicate that compared with monomeric collagen, the amplitude of S6K1 phosphorylation on polymerized collagen is attenuated. This demonstrated a correlation between suppression of fibroblast growth by polymerized collagen and a reduction in the activity of S6K1, but not in Akt activity, and suggested that polymerized collagen may mediate its anti-proliferative effect by suppressing S6K1 activity. The Serine/Threonine Phosphatase PP2A Mediates the Repressive Function of Polymerized Collagen toward S6K1—Because polymerized collagen suppresses the level of phosphorylation of threonine 389 of S6K1, this suggested that a serine/threonine phosphatase may be important in regulating the activity of S6K1. To examine this issue, fibroblasts were treated with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid and plated on polymerized collagen. We found that the level of S6K1 phosphorylation increased in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, whereas the level of Akt phosphorylation remained relatively stable (Fig. 2, A and B). These data are consistent with a previous study that found that the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A enhanced the level of S6K1 phosphorylation and supports the concept that a serine/threonine phosphatase may be involved in regulating the repressive function of polymerized collagen toward S6K1 (8Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfedlt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). PP2A is an ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase whose activity is inhibited by okadaic acid. One prior study found that PP2A activity increased in response to fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen (24Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining whether PP2A may be responsible for the repressive effect of polymerized collagen on S6K1. Consistent with this prior study, we found that PP2A activity increased in a time-dependent fashion when fibroblasts attached to polymerized collagen (Fig. 2C). We next knocked down PP2A by using siRNA directed against the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac). PP2A siRNA markedly knocked down PP2Ac expression (Fig. 2D). Similar to the effect of okadaic acid, knockdown of PP2A robustly increased the level of S6K1 phosphorylation in fibroblasts adhering to polymerized collagen but had minimal effect on the level of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Control siRNA did not affect the level of S6K1 phosphorylation, and S6K1 phosphorylation was markedly suppressed by polymerized collagen. It is important to note that inhibition of PP2A by either okadaic acid or by siRNA had a minimal effect on the level of Akt phosphorylation. Therefore, these data support the concept that polymerized collagen suppresses proliferation by inactivation of S6K1 in a PP2A-dependent fashion. Inhibition of S6K1 phosphorylation by PP2A may be by direct interaction with S6K1. However, we could not identify a direct association of PP2A with S6K1 (or vise versa) by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This suggested that PP2A indirectly inhibits S6K1. Polymerized Collagen-mediated Inactivation of S6K1 Involves PP2A-mediated Augmentation of TSC2 Tumor Suppressor Activity—The TSC1-TSC2 complex functions as a tumor suppressor (30Crino P.B. Nathanson K.L. Henske E.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). TSC2 negatively regulates the mTOR/S6K1 signal pathway by stimulating the conversion of Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP (15Zhang Y. Gao X. Ssucedo L.J. Ru B. Edgar B.A. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). This inactivates Rheb and represses mTOR and S6K1 activity. The activity of the TSC2 catalytic subunit is regulated by its phosphorylation state (17Dan H.C. Sun M. Yang L. Feldmaan R.I. Sui X.M. Ou C.C. Nellist M. Yeung R.S. Halley D.J. Nicosia S.V.

PI3K/Akt-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation reduces TSC2 activity, whereas TSC2 actively inhibits Rheb when the level of TSC2 phosphorylation is suppressed by inhibition of PI3K/Akt. We sought to determine whether the repressive effects of polymerized collagen on S6K1 activity and fibroblast proliferation were regulated via PP2A-mediated activation of TSC2 tumor suppressor activity. We first examined the effect of fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen on the level of TSC2 phosphorylation. We found that there was a slight increase in the level of TSC2 phosphorylation (Thr1462) in response to fibroblast attachment to polymerized collagen (Fig. 3A). However, when we pretreated the fibroblasts with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid and permitted the fibroblasts to adhere to polymerized collagen, we found that the level of phosphorylated TSC2 increased substantially more (Fig. 3B). This increase in TSC2 phosphorylation (decrease in TSC2 activity) correlated with the increase in S6K1 phosphorylation seen in response to okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 2B). To confirm this finding, we knocked down PP2A with PP2Ac siRNA and examined the effect on TSC2 and S6K1 phosphorylation in response to fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen. Consistent with the effect of okadaic acid, knockdown of PP2Ac markedly increased the level of TSC2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) and enhanced the level of S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). There was a greater than 16-fold increase in the level of TSC2 phosphorylation at 30 min in fibroblasts treated with PP2A siRNA compared with control, indicating that PP2A has a robust suppressive effect on the level of TSC2 phosphorylation in response to fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen. Together, these data strongly suggest that the mechanism of polymerized collagen-mediated inactivation of S6K1 involves PP2A-mediated suppression of TSC2 phosphorylation, thereby augmenting TSC2 tumor suppressor activity. To verify the role of TSC2 in suppressing S6K1 activity in response to polymerized collagen matrices, we knocked down TSC2 expression by transfecting the fibroblasts with TSC2 siRNA. TSC2 siRNA knocked down TSC2 expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, we found that the level of S6K1 phosphorylation (Thr389) increased as a function of time when TSC2 siRNA treated fibroblasts interacted with polymerized collagen (Fig. 3E). In contrast, in control siRNA-treated fibroblasts, the level of S6K1 phosphorylation was suppressed when these fibroblasts attached to polymerized collagen matrices. The TSC2 knockdown studies are consistent with the concept that TSC2 is exerting a suppressive effect on S6K1 in response to fibroblast interaction with polymerized collagen. PP2A Complexes with TSC2 in Fibroblasts Adhering to Polymerized Collagen—Our data indicate that PP2A decreases TSC2 phosphorylation when fibroblasts interact with polymerized collagen. To determine whether PP2A reduces the level of TSC2 by directly interacting with TSC2, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. We infected our fibroblasts with an adenoviral vector containing a PP2Ac HA-tagged construct and permitted the cells to attach to polymerized or monomeric collagen. In response to fibroblast adhesion to polymerized collagen, we identified an association of PP2A with TSC2 (Fig. 4A). However, no PP2A-TSC2 complex could be detected in fibroblasts transfected with the PP2Ac HA-tagged construct and plated on monomeric collagen. A β1 Integrin-PP2A Complex Forms and Associates with TSC2 in Response to Fibroblast Attachment to Polymerized Collagen—Our data indicate that in response to fibroblast attachment to polymerized collagen, PP2A associates with TSC2. Fibroblast attachment to polymerized collagen is mediated through cell surface integrin matrix receptors. α2β1 is a major integrin receptor mediating adhesion to polymerized collagen (31Hynes R.O.

Sphingoid base phosphates play a vital role in cell survival, proliferation, migration, heat stress, and cell wall integrity pathways. Little is known about the structure and regulation of Dpl1p. In this study, we have undertaken a combined computational modeling and mutagenesis approach for structure-function analysis of Dpl1p to discover possible modes of regulation. Our results identify important residues for catalysis in Dpl1p and confirm it as an integral endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein. Results further indicate that Dpl1p is most likely not regulated spatially.

In mammals, sphingosine 1-phosphate, mostly through binding to cell surface receptors, promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, inhibits apoptosis, and regulates lymphocyte trafficking (1Hait N.C.

Biochem. 2004; 92: 882-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The involvement of LCBPs in diverse essential cellular processes requires a precise control and regulation of their intracellular and extracellular levels. Moreover, the potential role of LCBPs in disease pathogenesis makes the metabolic enzymes responsible for their regulation attractive targets to study. One such key enzyme is sphinganine-1-phosphate lyase (Dpl1p). This yeast homologue of mammalian sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1 (SPL) catabolizes LCBPs to ethanolamine phosphate and an alkyl aldehyde, which is the only irreversible reaction in the sphingolipid pathway. The importance of this particular reaction is further underscored by the fact that it is the only exit point that connects sphingolipids to other metabolic pathways as the products of the reaction can serve as precursors to phospholipid metabolism. Thus, like SPL, Dpl1p is in a vital position, since it can regulate the flux of precursors between the sphingolipid and the phospholipid metabolic pathways. In fact, flux through sphingolipid pathway and the end products of the lyase reaction serve as a major source of ethanolamine for Leishmania, contributing to infectivity, and therefore SPL is also a candidate target for treatment of Leishmania diseases (3Zhang K.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dpl1p is instrumental in the heat shock response, diauxic shift and calcium mobilization (8Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J.

The high conservation of SPL throughout evolution makes it reasonable to study Dpl1p, the yeast enzyme, to gain more insights into SPL. Both are predicted to be integral membrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a structural model of Dpl1p, from which we predicted and tested important features of the protein by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme characterization. The sequence of Dpl1p encodes 589 amino acid residues and is predicted to possess a single transmembrane segment (spanning residues 59–81 according to TMHMM (12Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9260) Google Scholar)), followed by a large soluble domain, responsible for the catalytic activity, which was proposed by Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (11Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be located in the cytoplasm. This finding was later confirmed by a topology study carried out by Ikeda (13Ikeda M. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) on mouse SPL. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that residues 1–58 of the Dpl1p sequence reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The predicted topology of Dpl1p is shown in Fig. 1A. Bioinformatic analysis of the cytoplasmic region of Dpl1p shows that a large part of it is distantly related to the sequence of the PLP-dependent enzyme GadB, a bacterial glutamate decarboxylase. In fact, Dpl1p groups with GadB and related enzymes in the PFAM domain data base. These facts prompted us to attempt parsed homology modeling of the active site region of Dpl1p. Based on the model and on the biochemistry of PLP-dependent enzymes, we were able to rationally design Dpl1p mutants for functional analysis. In our study, we validated the structural model by experiment. Furthermore, we carried out a mutagenesis study to investigate the role of the luminal and transmembrane domain (TMD), hitherto considered redundant, in Dpl1p function and spatial regulation. Our results show that Dpl1p is statically retained in the ER. Most intriguingly, Dpl1p forms homo-oligomers, whose detection depends upon the presence and sequence features of the transmembrane domain. These features are required for optimal activity in vivo but not for catalytic activity in vitro, although they have no influence on protein localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. We speculate about possible explanations for this intriguing finding.

All constructs were verified by sequencing. Phytosphingosine Sensitivity Dpl1p Functionality Test—Cells from overnight culture in SD medium were serially diluted 10-fold (for the last spot, 1:5 dilution) and spotted on SD medium containing either ethanol (carrier vehicle) or 50 μm phytosphingosine (4-OH sphinganine; PHS). After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C, plates were imaged. Pulse-Chase Experiment—Pulse-chase analysis was performed essentially as described in Ref. 18Watanabe R. Funato K. Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49538-49544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. Briefly, 10 A600 units of logarithmic phase cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant Dpl1p were pulsed with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mix (EasyTag™ EXPRESS[35S] mix from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 min at 30 °C. The chase was initiated by adding 1/100 volume of a mixture of 0.3% methionine/cysteine in 0.3 m (NH4)2SO4. At specific time intervals, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was terminated by adding NaF/NaN3 to a 10 mm final concentration. Dpl1p was immunoprecipitated using FLAG beads. Similarly, the Gas1p control was immunoprecipitated by anti-Gas1p antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The proteins were eluted into TEPI (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) containing 1% SDS buffer, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol by boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. Eluates were equally divided into three immunoprecipitation reactions: the first with anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), the second with α-1,3-mannose antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads, and the third with protein G-Sepharose beads alone. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Cyclone Storage Phosphor system (Packard). Cell Extract Preparation—Cells were resuspended as 100 A600 units of cells/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After glass bead lysis and removal of cell debris by centrifugation, protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. Endoglycosidase H Treatment—Cells grown in selective SD medium were harvested in midlogarithmic phase. Cells were lysed and processed as previously described (19Kageyama-Yahara N. Riezman H. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 40 μl of cell extract was treated with 25 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Boiled samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting (20Heese-Peck A. Pichler H. Zanolari B. Watanabe R. Daum G. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2664-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Protein Purification and Sphinganine 1-Phosphate Lyase Assay—FLAG-tagged purification was performed as described previously (21Vallee B. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Cells bearing DPL1-FLAG on overexpression plasmids were grown to exponential phase in selective S-raffinose 2% (w/v), glycerol 3% (w/v) minimal medium, and expression was induced by 2% galactose for 4 h. Cells were broken in lysis buffer with chilled glass beads. After removal of cell debris, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1% to the resulting supernatant. Binding to FLAG beads, washing, and elution were performed as described before. [4,5-3H]Spinganine 1-phosphate was prepared from radiolabeled [4,5-3H]sphinganine (ARC, Saint Louis, MO) by incubation with purified yeast sphingosine kinase, Lcb4p (provided by I. Riezman, University of Geneva), separation by TLC, and extraction from the plate. The activity of purified wild-type and mutant Dpl1p proteins was assayed by incubating 0.5 μg of purified protein with 5 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine 1-phosphate at 30 °C for 30 min in reaction conditions as previously described (11Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteasome Inhibition and Cycloheximide (CHX) Chase Analysis—The experiment was carried out as described in Ref. 22Fujita M. Yoko O.T. Jigami Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 834-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Cells were grown to 1 A600 and incubated at 30 °C with 100 μm MG-132 (Sigma) in DMSO. 12 A600 units of cells were removed and added to NaN3 (final concentration 10 mg/ml) at time points 0 and 2 h. For CHX chase, cells were grown similarly as for the proteasome inhibition assay. A 0.5 mg/ml final concentration of CHX (Sigma) in DMSO was added to cells. 7 A600 cells were removed per time point. Cell extract preparation was performed as described above. Immunoprecipitation—Cell extract was prepared as described above and solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with digitonin 0.5% (v/v) final concentration. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was collected. 2 mg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Venus antibody and Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) or anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA 0.1% digitonin. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting(20). Blue Native PAGE (BN-PAGE)—Overnight cultures were harvested at 1 A600 unit, and cells were resuspended at 100 A600 units/ml in native PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) (NativePAGE-SB). After glass bead lysis, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in NativePAGE-SB with 0.5% digitonin and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized sample was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The final sample was prepared by adding NativePAGE-SB 5% Coomassie G-250 (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 0.125% to the solubilized clarified extract. Samples were separated on a 4–16% acrylamide gradient NativePAGE-SB Novex BisTris gel (Invitrogen), and Western blotting was performed (20Heese-Peck A. Pichler H. Zanolari B. Watanabe R. Daum G. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2664-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Synthetic Lethality Test—RH4863 cells were transformed with pRS415 plasmids containing wild type or mutant DPL1 genes. Cells were grown in SD medium without leucine, 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared, and cells were spotted onto agar plates containing SD without leucine, without uracil, or containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for cells that had lost the pLCB3::URA3 CEN plasmid. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells bearing DPL-VENUS plasmids were grown to exponential phase in minimal selective medium. Fluorescence images were obtained using a yellow fluorescent protein filter on an Axio Imager Z1 microscope. Quantification of Cellular PHS-1P—JS16 cells carrying pRS415 series plasmids with wild type or mutant DPL1 were grown to late log phase in SD without leucine. 40 A600 units of cells were harvested and washed once with SD minus leucine. Cells were resuspended in SD minus leucine containing 20 μm sphinganine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Trichloroacetic acid was added to 5% final concentration, and the cells were cooled and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold water. Cell pellets were frozen, and 10 μg each of C17 sphingosine and C17 sphingosine 1-phosphate (Avanti Polar Lipids) were added before extraction using glass beads and ethanol/ether/pyridine (23Guan X.L. Wenk M.R. Yeast. 2006; 23: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) at 60 °C, except that the samples were not desalted after extraction. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry as described (24Sullards, M. C., and Merrill, A. H., Jr. (2001) Sci. STKE 2001, PL1Google Scholar) on a Varian 320 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Sphingoid bases were separated on a Uptisphere ODB column (5 μm, 1 × 150 mm) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 30 °C, and data were acquired using the following optimized transitions (C17 sphingosine, 286 > 268, -17 V, C17 sphingosine 1-phosphate, 366 > 250, -15 V, sphinganine 302 > 282, -22V, PHS, 318 > 282 -24 V, sphinganine 1-phosphate, 382 > 282, -18 V, PHS 1-phosphate, 398 > 282, -18 V). Two independent experiments were performed, each in duplicate, and each sample was analyzed at least three times by HPLC-mass spectrometry. Sphinganine was rapidly converted to PHS intracellularly, because the former was not detected in most samples. Data for PHS 1-phosphate levels were corrected for recovery and detection by reference to the internal standard C17 sphingosine 1-phosphate, which allows a reliable relative quantification between samples but does not permit an absolute quantification. Parsed Homology Modeling—A parsed homology model of Dpl1p was created based on the structure of Escherichia coli GadB at low pH (Protein Data Bank code 1PMM) using the program Modeler (version 7) (25Sali A. Mol. Med. Today. 1995; 1: 270-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The PLP cofactor was also modeled into the active site, and the Schiff base linkage to Lys380 was optimized in a final energy minimization step with CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Only the residues in the active site region and the cofactor, which aligned very clearly with the template and other SPL and Gad sequences in multiple sequence alignments, were retained in the final model. DPL1 Parsed Homology Modeling and Mutational Testing—According to the PFAM data base (27Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar), Dpl1p and related SPLs from different eukaryotes belong to the PLP-dependent aminotransferase superfamily clan. More specifically, their catalytic domain is a pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase conserved domain (PF00282). A BLAST search of Dp11p versus the Protein Data Bank data base identified E. coli GadB (28Capitani G. De Biase D. Aurizi C. Gut H. Bossa F. Grutter M.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4027-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Gut H. Pennacchietti E. John R.A. Bossa F. Capitani G. De Biase D. Grutter M.G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2643-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as the top hit, with a sequence identity of 23% over a 251-residue long aligned region. Based on the two representative structures of PF00282, GadB and Dopa-decarboxylase (30Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri-Voltattorni C. Jansonius J.N. Malashkevich V.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), one can assume that the quaternary assembly of Dpl1p is either dimeric (like Dopa-decarboxylase) or a multiple of dimeric units (like GadB, a hexamer that is a trimer of dimers) (Fig. 1B). We analyzed the possibility that Dpl1p is part of a large molecular weight complex by BN-PAGE and Western blotting (see Fig. 9B). Both Dpl1p-Venus and Dpl1p-FLAG-tagged proteins migrated in BN-polyacrylamide gels at an apparent molecular size of over 300,000 daltons, confirming that it is part of a large complex. Co-precipitation experiments (see below) prove that Dpl1p subunits self-associate. It is not possible to determine whether the Dpl1p oligomer is a tetramer or a hexamer from our data, a problem that is rendered more difficult to solve by the obligatory presence of detergent to keep the enzyme soluble. To determine if the luminal domain of Dpl1p has any role in its function, we generated an NΔ57 truncation mutant lacking the entire luminal domain, which, as mentioned above, is predicted by TMHMM to span residues 1–58. NΔ57 was tested for its ability to complement a dpl1Δ mutant in the presence of phytosphingosine. Under standard laboratory growth conditions, Dpl1p is not essential, but it is required for yeast cells to grow on a medium containing an elevated concentration of PHS (50 μm was used in this study). PHS is cytotoxic at high concentrations. This mutant was completely inactive in the in vivo complementation assay (Fig. 2A). The steady state level of the NΔ57 mutant protein was nearly undetectable (Fig. 2B). A partial or total absence of the luminal domain could affect the steady state level of Dpl1p by modulating protein stability. We further investigated this possibility by constructing other truncation mutants, as discussed below. One of the major aims of this study was to identify important residues for the structural integrity, catalytic activity, and substrate binding of Dpl1p. To this end, a parsed homology model of the Dpl1p active site region was created, based on the structure of GadB and on multiple sequence alignments of Dpl1p and SPLs. Also, information from PF00282 was taken into account. The model (Fig. 1C) shows that the cofactor, covalently linked to Lys380, is sandwiched between Cys344 and His268. The pyridinium nitrogen of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ring interacts electrostatically with the side chain carboxylate of Asp342. The phosphate moiety of the cofactor is held in place by a network of hydrogen bonding interactions with the main chain amides of Gly235, Thr236, the side chain imidazole of His379, and the side chain hydroxyl of Ser422. Several mutants were designed (Table 2) based on the active site homology model. H268A was aimed at impairing PLP binding via removal of the stacking aromatic ring of His268. Two Lys to Ala mutants, K380A and K386A, were assumed, respectively, not to be able to form an internal aldimine link with the cofactor (removal of the catalytic lysine side chain) and to be impaired in substrate binding (removal of a Lys side chain, which is near the region where the phosphate moiety of LCBP is supposed to bind). All of the above mutants were created and tested for their ability to complement the dpl1Δ mutant in the presence of PHS. As predicted, the mutants did not complement the dpl1Δ deletion mutant; therefore, we conclude that they exhibit very low or no activity (Fig. 2A). The Lys380 and Lys386 mutants exhibit normal steady state protein levels, but they lack function (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that the absence of function in the Lys380 and Lys386 mutants is due to a lack of enzymatic activity by using an in vitro enzyme activity assay (Fig. 2C). Another residue, Cys344, is a PLP-stacking residue and may be the nucleophilic Cys that was proposed to attack the C3 carbon of the substrate (31van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 69-98PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant Dpl1p-C344A was partially active in the in vivo complementation assay (Fig. 2A) and present at almost normal levels (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the residue corresponding to Cys344 in mammalian SPL, Cys317, has been mutated to Ser and exhibits a severe loss of activity in vitro (32Van Veldhoven P.P. Gijsbers S. Mannaerts G.P. Vermeesch J.R. Brys V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Important DPL1 residues from parsed homology modeling based on the GadB structureDPL1 residueGadB residuePutative functionGly235Ser126Binding of PLP phosphate groupThr236Ser127Binding of PLP phosphate groupHis268Gln163Stacking of PLP ringHis340His341Structurally critical residue for the PF00282 familyAsp342Asp243Salt bridge with pyridinium nitrogen of PLP ringAsp377Ser273Binding of PLP phosphate groupCys344Ala245Van der Waals interaction with PLP ringHis379His275Binding of PLP phosphate groupLys380Lys276Covalent binding of PLP (internal aldimine)Lys386Lys282Providing a positive charge for binding of the substrate phosphateSer422Ser318Binding of PLP phosphate group Open table in a new tab An additional histidine mutant, H340A, was designed based on the consideration that a fully conserved residue in members of the PF00282 family, His241 of GadB, has been proposed to play a critical structural role in the stability of this group of proteins (33Capitani G. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Grutter M.G. De Biase D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We created this mutant, and it was also inactive for complementation (Fig. 2A). Steady state levels of this mutant protein were substantially lower than the wild type, suggesting that the mutant protein is indeed unstable, which is consistent with the proposed function of this residue (Fig. 2B). Two additional mutants, Y554A and Y554F, belonging to the C-terminal region of Dpl1p, were designed by analogy with GadB. Namely, the C-terminal region of GadB, which encompasses residues 452–466, does not belong to the PF00282 domain core and is flexibly disordered at low pH. This region can take up an ordered conformation and insert into the active site at neutral pH, thus inhibiting the enzyme. The inhibition has been recently shown to take place via a covalent linkage between the distal side chain nitrogen of His465 (the penultimate residue of the protein) and the C4′ atom of the cofactor (29Gut H. Pennacchietti E. John R.A. Bossa F. Capitani G. De Biase D."
https://openalex.org/W2075051169,"Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays essential roles in a wide array of cellular processes, such as in development and the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis, including that associated with progressive kidney diseases. Tight regulation of its signaling pathways is critical, and proteins that associate with the TGF-beta receptors may exert positive or negative regulatory effects on TGF-beta signaling. In the present study we employed a yeast-based two-hybrid screening system to identify BAT3 (HLA-B-associated transcript 3) as a TGF-beta receptor-interacting protein. Analysis of endogenously expressed BAT3 in various tissues including the kidney reveals the existence of approximately 140-kDa full-length protein as well as truncated forms of BAT3 whose expression is developmentally regulated. Endogenous BAT3 protein interacts with TGF-beta receptors type I and type II in renal mesangial cells. Functional assays show that expression of full-length BAT3 results in enhancement of TGF-beta1-stimulated transcriptional activation of p3TP-Lux reporter, and these effects require the presence of functional TGF-beta signaling receptors as demonstrated in R-1B and DR-26 mutant cells. Moreover, expression of full-length BAT3, but not C-terminal truncated mutant of BAT3, enhanced TGF-beta1-induced type I collagen expression in mesangial cells, whereas knock down of BAT3 protein expression by small interfering RNA suppressed the expression of type I collagen induced by TGF-beta1. Our findings suggest that BAT3, a TGF-beta receptor-interacting protein, is capable of modulating TGF-beta signaling and acts as a positive regulator of TGF-beta1 stimulation of type I collagen expression in mesangial cells."

Here we report a novel role of LXR activation in protecting cells from statin-induced death.

The simultaneous addition of selective LXR agonists prevented the statin-induced apoptosis. By using mouse embryo fibroblasts from wild-type (LXRα+/+/LXRβ+/+), LXRα knock-out mice (LXRα-/-/LXRβ+/+), LXRβ knock-out mice (LXRα+/-/LXRβ-/-), and LXR double knock-out mice (LXRα-/-/LXRβ-/-) as well as 3T3-L1 cells transduced with retroviruses expressing either wild-type LXRα or a dominant negative version of LXRα, we demonstrate that the response to LXR agonists is LXR-dependent. Interestingly, LXR-mediated rescue of statin-induced apoptosis was not related to up-regulation of genes previously shown to be involved in the antiapoptotic action of LXR. Furthermore, forced expression of Bcl-2 did not prevent statin-induced apoptosis; nor did LXR action depend on protein kinase B, whose activation by insulin was impaired in statin-treated cells. Rather, LXR-dependent rescue of statin-induced apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes required NF-κB activity, since expression of a dominant negative version of IκBα prevented LXR agonist-dependent rescue of statin-induced apoptosis.

Inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, collectively known as statins, are well established effective agents used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (1Evans M.

The precise mechanism by which statins induce apoptosis is not yet elucidated, and it remains unclear which proteins and signal transduction cascades are involved. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase results in decreased farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of several proteins essential for cellular proliferation and survival, such as members of the Ras and Rho families, but mechanistic studies also show that the expression of the proto-oncogene, Bcl-2, is down-regulated in transformed cells undergoing apoptosis in response to statin exposure (8Wong W. Dimitroulakos J. Minden M.D. Penn L. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is a key regulator prolonging cell survival by blocking apoptosis (15Annis M.G.

Gene array analysis revealed that expression of a subset of both pro- and antiapoptotic genes is regulated in an LXR-dependent manner (46Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L.

Finally, it was reported that inactivation of LXRβ leads to neuronal degeneration (50Andersson S. Gustafsson N. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the beneficial effects of statins on lipid homeostasis are well documented, the effects of statins on glucose homeostasis and adipocyte function are less well understood, and conflicting results have been reported (51Chamberlain L.H.

Here we report that the lipophilic statin, simvastatin, induced apoptosis in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) when administered during the first 4 days of the differentiation program. The addition of mevalonate, but not cholesterol or farnesol, rescued survival and differentiation, and the addition of geranylgeraniol partly rescued differentiation. Insulin-dependent activation of PKB was impaired in statin-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We show that the addition of LXR agonists rescued survival and differentiation. Inhibition of PKB did not prevent LXR agonist-mediated rescue of cell survival but, as expected, abolished adipocyte differentiation. By using MEFs deficient for LXRα or LXRβ or both and by using retroviral expression of a dominant negative form of LXR, we demonstrated that LXR agonist-dependent rescue was indeed dependent on LXR activity. Interestingly, LXR-mediated rescue of statin-induced apoptosis was not related to up-regulation of the genes, AIM/SPα/Api6 and Bcl-xL, previously shown to be involved in the antiapoptotic action of LXR in macrophages (48Joseph S.B. Bradley M. Castrillo A. Bruhn K. Pei L. Hogenesch J. O’connell R. Cheng G. Saez E. Miller J. Tontonoz P.

Rather, activation of LXR prevented statin-induced apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a manner dependent on NF-κB activity, possibly via an up-regulation of CARD14, known to activate IκB kinase to induce phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (56Bertin J.

Thus, the results presented in this paper add novel facets to the action of statins on adipocyte differentiation and LXR-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. Cell Culture and Differentiation—3T3-L1 cells were cultured to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Two days postconfluent (designated day 0) cells were induced to differentiate with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml insulin (Roche Applied Science). Inhibitors and ligands were dissolved in Me2SO and added when differentiation was induced. Cells not treated with ligands or inhibitors received similar volumes of Me2SO. After 48 h, the media were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin. The cells were subsequently refed every 48 h with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When present, 5 μm simvastatin (Calbiochem) was added every 48 h. Simvastatin was converted to the active form by dissolving it in absolute ethanol, followed by the addition of 1 m NaOH to a final concentration of 100 mm. The simvastatin solution was neutralized with 1 m HCl and diluted in vehicle (Me2SO) before use. MEFs—MEFs were isolated from 13.5-day embryos from crosses between LXRα+/-/LXRβ+/- (57Steffensen K.R.

The isolated MEFs were genotyped by PCR. MEFs were grown in AmnioMax basal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7.5% FBS, 7.5% AmnioMax-C100 supplement, 2 mm glutamine, 62.5 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Medium was changed every second day. For differentiation, 2-day postconfluent cells (day 0) were treated with growth medium containing 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 5 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. From day 2, medium contained 5 μg/ml insulin and was changed every second day. Oil-Red-O Staining—Staining of lipid by Oil-Red-O was performed as described previously (59Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Jorgensen C. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26335-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Microscopical Assessment of Apoptosis—Cells were grown on collagen-coated coverslips in 12-well plates. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed in PBS, stained with 2.5 μg/μl Hoechst 33258 (Sigma B-2883) in PBS for 5 min, and washed three times for 5 min each in PBS. The cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy to assess chromatin condensation and by phase-contrast microscopy to assess apoptotic cell budding and shrinkage. Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts, electrophoresis, blotting, visualization, and stripping of membranes were performed as described (59Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K.

Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-phospho-PKB (Ser-473), rabbit anti-PKB (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-IKKα (Ser-181), rabbit anti-IKKα/β, rabbit anti-IκBα, mouse anti-Bcl-2, mouse anti-PPARγ, and rabbit anti-TFIIB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies obtained from DAKO. De Novo Cholesterol Synthesis—Cells were incubated with [1(2)-14C]acetic acid, sodium salt (0.2 μCi/ml medium) (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h, harvested in water, and frozen. Cellular lipids were extracted from the cell suspensions by the method of Folch, Lees, and Sloane-Stanley (60Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The cell suspension was mixed with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 4 volumes of 0.9% NaCl, pH 2. The organic phase was evaporated under N2, and the lipids were dissolved in n-hexane and separated by TLC on silica gel plates developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, by volume). The bands were detected with iodine vapor, cut into pieces, and assayed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Cellular Levels of Triacylglycerols—Cells grown in 6-well plates were harvested in 1 ml of water and frozen. The cells were sonicated, and the cellular levels of triacylglycerols were measured on an AXON Byer spectrophotometer using the TRINDER reaction kit from BioMèrieux. Plasmids—The retroviral expression vector pBABE-PPARγ2 was constructed by inserting an SmaI fragment containing full-length mouse PPARγ2 cDNA into the SnaBI site of pBABE-puro. pBABE-LXRα and pBABE-LXRαDN were a kind gift of Dr. Peter Åkerblad. pWZL-Bcl-2 was kindly provided by Dr. Camilla Krakstad, and pLZRS-IκBα-mut (61Dajee M.

Transient Transfections—50% confluent 3T3-L1 cells in 12-well dishes were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Each well received, 50 ng of p(κB)3-luc+ reporter and 25 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase were used for normalization. 6 h after transfection, the medium was changed, and cells were incubated for 20 h with tumor necrosis factor-α or vehicle (Me2SO) as indicated. Retrovirus Production and Transduction—Phoenix cells were transfected with viral DNA at 50% confluence. Two days post-transfection, the virus-containing media were collected by centrifugation and immediately used to infect 30-40% confluent 3T3-L1 cells by mixing viral supernatant 1:1 with DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Polybrene (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 7 μg/ml. After 24 h, the transduced cells were split and subjected to selection (3 μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen)) (IκBα-mut- and vector-transduced 3T3-L1 cells were not subjected to selection). Approximately 3 days later, the selected clones were pooled and replated for differentiation. RT-qPCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperscriptII and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). The concentration and quality of the purified total RNA were determined spectrophotometrically at A260 and by the A260/A280 ratio, respectively. mRNA expression levels were quantified using the ABI 7500 instrument and the SYBR green technology (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All primers were designed with the Primer Express® software, version 2.0, a program specifically provided for primer design using ABI qPCR instruments. 100 nm SYBR green assay primers were used, and for each primer pair, a dissociation curve analysis was carried out to ensure the specificity of the qPCR amplification. We calculated relative changes employing the comparative CT method using 18 S or TBP as the internal reference gene.

LXR Agonists Rescue Statin-induced Cell Death—When 2 days postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are treated with isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin, they synchronously reenter the cell cycle and undergo two sequential rounds of mitosis in a process known as mitotic clonal expansion and subsequently express genes that control the adipocyte phenotype (64Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). During this phase, statin treatment induced severe cell death (Fig. 1A). By contrast, statin was well tolerated if added 4 days after induction (Fig. 1A), when the cells are growth-arrested (64Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The statin-induced cell death was prevented by the LXR agonist T0901317 but only when it was present from day 0 (Fig. 1B). The protective effect was not restricted to the Tularik compound T0901317, since the LXR agonist GW3965 also prevented statin-induced cell death (Fig. 1C). Hoechst staining of nuclei revealed that statin-induced cell death was associated with pronounced hypercondensation of nuclear chromatin (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, apoptotic cell budding and shrinkage was observed upon treatment with simvastatin (results not shown). This indicates that simvastatin induced an apoptotic type cell death in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that T0901317 treatment induced known LXR target genes, including the ones involved in cholesterol transport, and demonstrated that they were up-regulated also in the presence of simvastatin (Fig. 1E). The activation of LXR can stimulate the expression also of other cellular transport systems (65Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S36-S42Crossref PubMed Google Sch"
