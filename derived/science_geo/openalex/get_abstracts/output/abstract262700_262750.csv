https://openalex.org/W2104206289,"An emerging concept is that the mammalian myocardium has the potential to regenerate, but that regeneration might be too inefficient to repair the extensive myocardial injury that is typical of human disease. However, the degree to which stem cells or precursor cells contribute to the renewal of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes remains controversial. Here we report evidence that stem cells or precursor cells contribute to the replacement of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes after injury but do not contribute significantly to cardiomyocyte renewal during normal aging. We generated double-transgenic mice to track the fate of adult cardiomyocytes in a 'pulse-chase' fashion: after a 4-OH-tamoxifen pulse, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was induced only in cardiomyocytes, with 82.7% of cardiomyocytes expressing GFP. During normal aging up to one year, the percentage of GFP+ cardiomyocytes remained unchanged, indicating that stem or precursor cells did not refresh uninjured cardiomyocytes at a significant rate during this period of time. By contrast, after myocardial infarction or pressure overload, the percentage of GFP+ cardiomyocytes decreased from 82.8% in heart tissue from sham-treated mice to 67.5% in areas bordering a myocardial infarction, 76.6% in areas away from a myocardial infarction, and 75.7% in hearts subjected to pressure overload, indicating that stem cells or precursor cells had refreshed the cardiomyocytes."

The best available model of liver humanization, the uroplasminogen-activator transgenic model, has major practical limitations. To provide a broadly useful hepatic xenorepopulation system, we generated severely immunodeficient, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice. After pretreatment with a urokinase-expressing adenovirus, these animals could be highly engrafted (up to 90%) with human hepatocytes from multiple sources, including liver biopsies. Furthermore, human cells could be serially transplanted from primary donors and repopulate the liver for at least four sequential rounds. The expanded cells displayed typical human drug metabolism. This system provides a robust platform to produce high-quality human hepatocytes for tissue culture. It may also be useful for testing the toxicity of drug metabolites and for evaluating pathogens dependent on human liver cells for replication."

https://openalex.org/W2119013116,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important pathogen recognition molecules and are key to epithelial immune responses to microbial infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate TLR expression in epithelia are obscure. Micro-RNAs play important roles in a wide range of biological events through post-transcriptional suppression of target mRNAs. Here we report that human biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) express <i>let-7</i> family members, micro-RNAs with complementarity to TLR4 mRNA. We found that <i>let-7</i> regulates TLR4 expression via post-transcriptional suppression in cultured human cholangiocytes. Infection of cultured human cholangiocytes with <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> a parasite that causes intestinal and biliary disease, results in decreased expression of primary <i>let-7i</i> and mature <i>let-7</i> in a MyD88/NF-κB-dependent manner. The decreased <i>let-7</i> expression is associated with <i>C. parvum</i>-induced up-regulation of TLR4 in infected cells. Moreover, experimentally induced suppression or forced expression of <i>let-7i</i> causes reciprocal alterations in <i>C. parvum</i>-induced TLR4 protein expression, and consequently, infection dynamics of <i>C. parvum in vitro</i>. These results indicate that <i>let-7i</i> regulates TLR4 expression in cholangiocytes and contributes to epithelial immune responses against <i>C. parvum</i> infection. Furthermore, the data raise the possibility that micro-RNA-mediated post-transcriptional pathways may be critical to host-cell regulatory responses to microbial infection in general."

In Drosophila, separate but conceptually similar endonucleolytic pathways produce siRNAs and miRNAs. Here, we show that despite their distinct biogenesis, double-stranded miRNAs and siRNAs participate in a common sorting step that partitions them into Ago1- or Ago2-containing effector complexes. These distinct complexes silence their target RNAs by different mechanisms. miRNA-loaded Ago2-RISC mediates RNAi, but only Ago1 is able to repress an mRNA with central mismatches in its miRNA-binding sites. Conversely, Ago1 cannot mediate RNAi, because it is an inefficient nuclease whose catalytic rate is limited by the dissociation of its reaction products. Thus, the two members of the Drosophila Ago subclade of Argonaute proteins are functionally specialized, but specific small RNA classes are not restricted to associate with Ago1 or Ago2.

In animals, miRNAs typically reduce the stability or repress translation of the mRNAs they regulate. miRNAs can regulate mRNAs with which they are only partially complementary, because they bind their target RNAs largely through a small region at the 5′ end of the miRNA (positions 2–7 or 8), the “seed” (Lai, 2002Lai E.C.

Animal miRNAs are produced by the sequential action of two distinct RNase III endonucleases. Drosha converts primary miRNAs, most of which are full-length RNA polymerase II transcripts, into pre-miRNAs, ∼70 nt RNAs that fold into a stem-loop or hairpin structure. Dicer then excises the mature miRNA, bound to its miRNA∗ strand, from the pre-miRNA (Grishok et al., 2001Grishok A. Pasquinelli A.E. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A. Ruvkun G.

Dicer-1 (Dcr-1) acts with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein partner, Loquacious (Loqs), to convert pre-miRNA to a miRNA/miRNA∗ duplex, whereas Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) produces siRNA duplexes by cleaving long dsRNA (Bernstein et al., 2001Bernstein E.

Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Processing of pre-microRNAs by the Dicer-1-Loquacious complex in Drosophila cells.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e235Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Such restriction of each class of small RNA to a distinct Argonaute complex could occur because miRNAs and siRNAs are produced by different Dicer pathways in flies (Figure 1A). In this manuscript, we show that the specific pathway that produces a miRNA or siRNA does not predestine that small RNA to associate with a particular Argonaute protein (Figure 1B). Rather, we find that a miRNA produced by Dcr-1 and Loqs can nonetheless be loaded by Dcr-2 and R2D2 into an Ago2-containing RISC. Our data from both cultured Drosophila cells and adult flies suggest that small RNA production and small RNA loading into Argonaute protein complexes are separate steps in vivo. In the accompanying paper (Tomari et al., 2007Tomari Y. Du T. Zamore P.D. Sorting of Drosophila small silencing RNAs.Cell. 2007; 130 (this issue): 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]), we describe the molecular basis for sorting small RNA duplexes, explaining why some miRNAs associate predominantly with Ago1 while others associate mainly with Ago2. Here, we show that the sorting of miRNAs into Ago1- and Ago2-RISCs has unexpected consequences for the mechanism of target mRNA regulation: Ago1, but not Ago2, can repress an mRNA containing multiple, partially complementary miRNA-binding sites in its 3′ untranslated region (UTR), whereas Ago2, but not Ago1, can silence an mRNA containing fully complementary miRNA-binding sites. The different regulatory capacities of Ago1 and Ago2 can be explained, in part, by our finding that while Ago2 is a robust, multiple-turnover RNA-directed RNA endonuclease, Ago1 is not. Like all known Drosophila miRNAs, miR-277 is produced by cleavage of its precursor by Dcr-1 acting with Loqs, rather than Dcr-2, which generates siRNAs (Lee et al., 2004Lee Y.S. Nakahara K. Pham J.W.

The miR-277/miR-277∗ duplex is predicted to have more double-stranded character than typical miRNA/miRNA∗ duplexes, which are interrupted by mismatches and internal loops (Khvorova et al., 2003Khvorova A.

Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Thus, miR-277 has a miRNA/miRNA∗ duplex that resembles an siRNA. We asked if the resemblance of the miR-277/miR-277∗ duplex to an siRNA led to its being loaded into Ago2, rather than Ago1, in Drosophila cells. That is, is the biogenesis of a miRNA tightly coupled to its loading into Ago1? Or are miRNAs, and perhaps siRNAs, sorted into distinct Ago proteins by a step unlinked to the Dicer that produced them? To this end, we established stable lines of S2 cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA alone, with a 3′ UTR containing one or two sites fully complementary to miR-277 or with four 3′ UTR sites complementary to miR-277 but bearing mismatches with miR-277 nucleotides 9, 10, and 11 (Figures S1–S3). Surprisingly, repression of the reporter bearing two fully complementary miR-277-binding sites required Ago2 but not Ago1 (Figure 1). Treating the S2 cells with dsRNA to deplete Ago2 by RNAi increased GFP expression ∼6-fold (Figures 2A and 2B). This agrees well with the extent of derepression observed with a miR-277-specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO; Figure S1), suggesting that without Ago2, the reporter is no longer repressed. Moreover, ago1(RNAi) increased repression of this reporter. Essentially identical data were obtained for a reporter containing a single miR-277-binding site (Figure S3).Figure 2Components of Both the miRNA and the RNAi Pathways Are Required to Silence a Reporter with Perfect Matches to miR-277Show full caption(A) Mean GFP fluorescence (average ± standard deviation for three or four trials).

The three isoforms of Loqs are indicated at the right of the Loqs panel. The bands above and below Ago2 correspond to crossreacting proteins characteristically detected with this antibody. Expression of the miR-277-regulated reporter also increased when the cells were treated with dsRNA to deplete Drosha, the enzyme that excises pre-miRNAs from their primary transcripts or with dsRNA to deplete Dcr-1 or Loqs, which together convert pre-miRNA to miRNA/miRNA∗ duplexes (Figure 2A). RNAi directed against ago1, ago2, or drosha had no detectable effect on the expression of the GFP reporter lacking miR-277-binding sites. We note that a control dsRNA was not inert with respect to Ago2-dependent silencing (i.e., RNAi), likely because it can compete with miR-277 for Ago2 loading. The idea that nonspecific dsRNA can compete for Ago2 and other components of the Ago2-loading machinery is consistent with earlier reports that RNAi is a saturable process (Haley and Za"

How the chemical reactions that occur in three catalytic sites are coupled to mechanical rotation is the central question. Here, we show by high-speed imaging of rotation in single molecules of F1 that phosphate release drives the last 40° of the 120° step, and that the 40° rotation accompanies reduction of the affinity for phosphate. We also show, by single-molecule imaging of a fluorescent ATP analog Cy3-ATP while F1 is forced to rotate slowly, that release of Cy3-ADP occurs at ∼240° after it is bound as Cy3-ATP at 0°. This and other results suggest that the affinity for ADP also decreases with rotation, and thus ADP release contributes part of energy for rotation. Together with previous results, the coupling scheme is now basically complete. F1-ATPase is a rotary molecular motor that proceeds in 120° steps, each driven by ATP hydrolysis.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Three β subunits, each hosting a catalytic site, hydrolyze ATP sequentially to power the rotation of the γ subunit. It is a reversible molecular machine in that, when γ is rotated in the reverse direction by an external force, ATP is synthesized in the catalytic sites (Itoh et al., 2004Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Mechanically driven ATP synthesis by F1-ATPase.Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The reversal achieved by manipulation of the γ angle alone implies a γ-dictator mechanism: the rotary angle of γ determines which of the chemical reactions is to occur in each catalytic site, binding/release of ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), synthesis/hydrolysis of ATP, and release/binding of ATP (Kinosita et al., 2004Kinosita Jr., K. Adachi K. Itoh H. Rotation of F1-ATPase: how an ATP-driven molecular machine may work.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). During rotation driven by ATP hydrolysis, the three catalytic sites (and the three β subunits) will cooperate by communication through the γ angle. A major task that remains is to establish the actual coupling scheme between the γ rotation and chemical reactions. Here we propose the scheme in Figures 1A and 1B (or 1C) for ATP-driven rotation; in principle, ATP synthesis by reverse rotation would follow the same scheme in reverse. Previously we have shown that rotation of F1-ATPase occurs in steps of 120°, each driven by hydrolysis of one ATP molecule (Adachi et al., 2000Adachi K. Yasuda R. Noji H. Itoh H. Harada Y. Yoshida M.

F1-ATPase is a highly efficient molecular motor that rotates with discrete 120° steps.Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). At submillisecond time resolution, the 120° step is further resolved into 80°–90° and 40°–30° substeps. Initially we reported the substep amplitudes as 90° and 30° (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), but subsequent studies (Hirono-Hara et al., 2001Hirono-Hara Y.

USA. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) indicated that they are closer to 80° and 40°. Hereafter, we adopt the latter values, although experimental precision does not warrant absolute distinction and a possibility remains that a third small substep may exist between the two (Kinosita et al., 2004Kinosita Jr., K. Adachi K. Itoh H. Rotation of F1-ATPase: how an ATP-driven molecular machine may work.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The 80° substep is driven by ATP binding, and the 40° substep by release of ADP or Pi (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). After a 80° substep, γ dwells on 80° for ∼2 ms, during which two ∼1 ms reactions take place (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). One of the reactions at 80° has been identified as ATP hydrolysis (Shimabukuro et al., 2003Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Catalysis and rotation of F1 motor: cleavage of ATP at the catalytic site occurs in 1 ms before 40° substep rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The ATP that is hydrolyzed there is one that was bound 200° ago (Figure 1B; Nishizaka et al., 2004Nishizaka T. Oiwa K. Noji H. Kimura S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Chemomechanical coupling in F1-ATPase revealed by simultaneous observation of nucleotide kinetics and rotation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar): an ATP molecule that is bound at 0° will be hydrolyzed after γ rotates for 120° + 80°. Here, we show by high-speed imaging of γ rotation that the other of the two ∼1 ms reactions at 80° is Pi release, and that the Pi release drives the last 40° substep. We also show that ADP is released at 240° after it is bound as ATP at 0°, by direct observation of the binding and release of a fluorescent ATP analog 2′-O-Cy3-EDA-ATP (Oiwa et al., 2003Oiwa K. Jameson D.M. Croney J.C. Davis C.T. Eccleston J.F. Anson M. The 2′-O- and 3′-O-Cy3-EDA-ATP(ADP) complexes with myosin subfragment-1 are spectroscopically distinct.Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 634-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), hereafter referred to as Cy3-ATP, in a single molecule of F1-ATPase. These two findings complete the basic scheme as shown in Figure 1B, with a possible alternative in Figure 1C. A similar scheme has been proposed (Weber and Senior, 2000Weber J. Senior A.E. ATP synthase: what we know about ATP hydrolysis and what we do not know about ATP synthesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the minimal subcomplex of F1-ATPase that is active in hydrolysis and rotation, composed of α3β3γ subunits. The subcomplex, which we refer to as F1 in this paper, was derived from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 and has been modified such that it has only two cysteine residues at the protruding portion of γ and that each β has a histidine tag at the amino terminus (α-C193S, β-His10 at amino terminus, γ-S107C, γ-I210C). Because these modifications are minor, we regard this mutant as wild-type. We immobilized the F1 molecules on a glass surface functionalized with Ni-NTA that would bind the introduced histidines on β. To observe rotation, we biotinylated the cysteines on γ and attached a 40 nm gold bead through streptavidin-biotin linkages. Because the bead was small, the rate of rotation would be limited by chemical reactions rather than viscous friction against the bead, and thus we should be able to resolve the 80° and 40° substeps. To see whether it is the release of Pi or ADP that induces the 40° substep, we added phosphate to the buffer for rotation assay. In the absence of Pi and at 2 mM ATP, we observed 80° dwells averaging ∼2 ms, as before (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), whereas ATP-waiting dwells at 0° (and multiples of 120°) were short and mostly unresolved at the temporal resolution of 0.125 ms (black in Figure 2A). Addition of Pi increased the dwell time at 80°, without much effect at 0° (red and magenta in Figure 2A), suggesting that Pi release triggers 40° substeps. At 20 μM ATP, near the Michaelis-Menten constant Km for unloaded rotation and hydrolysis (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), both 0° and 80° dwells were clearly resolved, with similar dwell times in the absence of Pi (black in Figure 2B). Addition of Pi at 20 μM ATP prolonged both dwells (red and magenta in Figure 2B). KCl also prolonged the 0° dwell, but not the 80° dwell (green in Figure 2B), suggesting that only the prolongation of the 80° dwell is specific to phosphate. We further examined the effect of divalent anions, inorganic sulfate and organic succinate (Figures 2C–2F). The plots versus ionic strength (Figures 2E and 2F) show that both 0° and 80° dwells are sensitive to the ionic strength, the 80° dwell to a much lesser extent, and that the effect of Pi on the 80° dwell is outstanding among others, even against its kin sulfate. Thus we conclude that the 40° substep terminating a 80° dwell is triggered by the release of phosphate. The unusually high Pi concentration ([Pi]) needed to retard the 40° substep is due to rapid rotation of γ in the 40° substep, which takes less than our resolution of 0.125 ms: Pi has to rebind before γ rotates (see below for quantitative analysis). We further propose that Pi release not only triggers the 40° substep, possibly by initiating a next reaction(s) that causes the 40° substep, but is the reaction that is directly coupled to the 40° rotation. If Pi release is the direct cause, rebinding of Pi after a 40° substep should lead to reversal of the substep. We indeed observed frequent reversals at 500 mM Pi, as seen in magenta lines in Figure 2B. When driving force for rotation originates from Pi release, that rotation should accompany a decrease in the affinity of the catalytic site for Pi (Kinosita et al., 2004Kinosita Jr., K. Adachi K. Itoh H. Rotation of F1-ATPase: how an ATP-driven molecular machine may work.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This explains why 500 mM Pi was required to observe frequent backward substeps, as analyzed in detail below. In this section, we determine from experiments the rate constants in Figure 3A and thereby estimate the free-energy differences among the four configurations. We consider the free energy G of the system composed of F1 and medium as the function of the chemical state S of F1 (we denote the states before and after Pi release as S = F1·ADP·Pi and F1·ADP; the analysis below applies to Figure 1C as well), the γ angle θ (conformation of F1 for the given chemical state), and [Pi] (Kinosita et al., 2004Kinosita Jr., K. Adachi K. Itoh H. Rotation of F1-ATPase: how an ATP-driven molecular machine may work.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although θ is a continuous variable, here we adopt the simple two-conformation diagram in Figure 3A and neglect intermediate conformations (80° < θ < 120°), which would not be populated significantly because 40° rotation is fast. We denote the angle-dependent rates for Pi release and rebinding by koffPi(θ) and konPi(θ), respectively, where θ = 80° or 120°. Then, ΔGbind(θ), per F1 molecule, for Pi binding at θ (magenta to green in Figure 3A) is given byΔGbind(θ)≡G(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi;θ,[Pi])−G(F1⋅ADP;θ,[Pi])=kBTlnKdPi(θ)−kBTln[Pi](1) where KdPi(θ)=koffPi(θ)/konPi(θ) is the angle-dependent dissociation constant and kBT=4.1pN·nm the thermal energy at room temperature. Rotary rates k+ and k− are related to ΔGrot(S), the change in conformational energy upon rotation in the given chemical state S, or the mechanical work needed for the rotation, byΔGrot(S)≡G(S;120°,[Pi])−G(S;80°,[Pi])=kBTln{k−(S)/k+(S)}(2) Previous studies have indicated that the work done in 120° rotation amounts to 80–90 pN·nm, and that the energy-conversion efficiency may reach ∼100% (Yasuda et al., 1998Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. F1-ATPase is a highly efficient molecular motor that rotates with discrete 120° steps.Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Because the torque of this motor is nearly constant over rotary angles (Kinosita et al., 2000Kinosita Jr., K. Yasuda R. Noji H. Adachi K.

Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the work in the 40° (or possibly 30°) substep is given simply as {(40°–30°)/120°} × (80–90) pN·nm = (20–30) pN·nm ≈25 pN·nm. The high efficiency suggests that this work is nearly equal to the available conformational energy (Kinosita et al., 2004Kinosita Jr., K. Adachi K. Itoh H.

Struct. 2004; 33: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar):ΔGrot(F1⋅ADP)≈−25pN⋅nm(3) In the Pi-bound state, the 80° conformation must be stable, and thusΔGrot(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi)>0(4) Consistency requires−ΔGbind(80°)+ΔGrot(F1⋅ADP)+ΔGbind(120°)−ΔGrot(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi)=0orkoffPi(80°)×k+(F1⋅ADP)×konPi(120°)×k−(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi)=koffPi(120°)×k−(F1⋅ADP)×konPi(80°)×k+(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi)(5) Now we determine the eight rate constants in Figure 3A. We first analyze the events at 80°. Figure 3B shows histograms of dwell times at 80°. Reactions that determine the duration of a 80° dwell areF1(80°)⋅ATP→khyd(80°)F1(80°)⋅ADP⋅Pi⇄krebindPi(80°)koffPi(80°)F1(80°)⋅ADP→k+(F1·ADP)F1(120°)⋅ADP(6) where khyd(80°) is the rate of ATP hydrolysis, and krebindPi(80°) represents the first-order rate konPi(80°)[Pi]; we have assumed that the rate of thermal process k+(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi) is negligible, as justified below. Simultaneous, or global, fit to all four histograms at [ATP] = 20 μM in Figure 3B with this scheme (see Experimental Procedures), with all parameters in common except for krebindPi(80°), gave khyd(80°) = (4.1 ± 0.1) × 103 s−1, koffPi(80°) = (8.4 ± 0.1) × 102 s−1, k+(F1⋅ADP) = (1.8 ± 0.1) × 104 s−1, and krebindPi(80°) values shown in Figure 3C (errors in this paper are SEM, standard error of a mean, unless stated otherwise). Though let free, krebindPi(80°) was found to be proportional to [Pi] (Figure 3C), as expected, and the slope gave the second-order rate konPi(80°) of (1.7 ± 0.1) × 105 M−1s−1. This rate is two orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of ATP binding at 0° (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Pi-release site at 80° is less open than the site waiting for ATP at 0°. The rate k−(F1⋅ADP) for thermally agitated rotation in the reverse direction is calculated from Equation 3 as 4.0 × 101 s−1. The dissociation constant for Pi at 80°, KdPi(80°) = koffPi(80°)/ konPi(80°), is 4.9 mM, which is close to physiological [Pi]. Al-Shawi et al., 1997Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. The Escherichia coli FOF1 γM23K uncoupling mutant has a higher K0.5 for Pi. Transition state analysis of this mutant and others reveals that synthesis and hydrolysis utilize the same kinetic pathway.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar have reported a similar value of ∼3 mM for Km for ATP synthesis in E. coli F1. Of the remaining four of the eight rate constants in Figure 3A, we set k−(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi) ≈104 s−1, because the backward 40° substep was as fast as the forward substep with k+(F1⋅ADP) of 1.8 × 104 s−1. The rest were obtained from the analysis of dwells at 120° (Figure 3D), as detailed in Experimental Procedures. At this angle, a 40° backward substep driven presumably by Pi rebinding (thermal rate k−(F1⋅ADP) being small) and a forward 80° substep driven by ATP binding compete with each other. The simplest scheme isF1(80°)⋅ADP⋅Pi←konPi,app⋅[Pi]F1(120°)⋅ADP→konATP(120°)⋅[ATP]F1(200°)⋅ADP⋅ATP(7) where konPi,app(120°) and konATP(120°) are apparent binding rates defined by this simplified scheme. This scheme predicts an exponential dwell-time distribution, exp(-kt). Fitting each histogram in Figure 3D yielded four values of k=konPi,app[Pi]+konATP[ATP], which we plot as k/[Pi] in Figure 3E and k/[ATP] in Figure 3F. The intercepts at [ATP] = 0 and [Pi] = 0 respectively gave konPi,app(120°) = (4.4 ± 2.5) × 101 M−1s−1 and konATP(120°) = (2.0 ± 0.3) × 107 M−1s−1, the latter being consistent with the previous estimate (Yasuda et al., 2001Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). From konPi,app(120°) together with other constraints, we obtain two possible sets of parameters (Experimental Procedures): (i) k+(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi) ≈ 102 s−1, and KdPi(120°)= koffPi(120°)/ konPi(120°) ≈ 2 × 102 M. The last two rates could not be determined except for the ratio, and we make an arbitrary choice of koffPi(120°) = 107 s−1 and konPi(120°) = 5 × 104 M−1s−1. (ii) k+(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi) ≈ 3 × 102 s−1, koffPi(120°) ≈ 3 × 103 s−1, and konPi(120°) ≈ 4 × 101 M−1s−1, giving KdPi(120°) ≈ 7 × 101 M. The two sets (i) and (ii) give similar values for KdPi(120°), 200 M or 70 M, which is >104 greater than KdPi(80°) of 4.9 mM; a state of F1 where Kd is far above 1 M has been documented (Weber and Senior, 2000Weber J. Senior A.E. ATP synthase: what we know about ATP hydrolysis and what we do not know about ATP synthesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), though it is not clear whether it corresponds to KdPi(120°). The >104-fold reduction in affinity drives the 40° rotation. ΔGrot(F1⋅ADP⋅Pi) in Equation 2 is 18 pN·nm in (i) and 14 pN·nm in (ii), which are indistinguishable. Both are positive, ∼4 kBT, implying that the Pi-bound state is more stable at 80° than at 120°. Because the set (ii) is only marginally possible (Experimental Procedures), we opt for (i) and show, in Figure 3A, numerical values of the rate constants at 500 mM Pi in parentheses, the two arbitrary rates in double parentheses. At different [Pi]s, the two green bars shift vertically by a same amount, according to Equation 1. At physiological [Pi] of ∼5 mM, green and magenta bars at 80° nearly overlap, whereas at 120°, the green bar is above by ∼11 kBT (probability of finding bound Pi ≈0.00003). Having established the timing of phosphate release, we next inquire when ADP is released. Because F1-ATPase is prone to inhibition by MgADP (Hirono-Hara et al., 2001Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Pause and rotation of F1-ATPase during catalysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we could not add ADP in the medium as in the experiments with phosphate above. Instead we directly visualized the binding and release of Cy3-AT(D)P on single molecules of F1 with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Simultaneously, we controlled the rotation of F1 with magnets by attaching a magnetic bead(s) to γ, while imaging the bead movement with bright-field microscopy (Figure 4A). Cy3-ATP bound to F1 appeared as a bright spot in the fluorescence image, whereas unbound Cy3-ATP gave dim, homogeneous background because of its rapid Brownian motion in solution (Funatsu et al., 1995Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Imaging of single fluorescent molecules and individual ATP turnovers by single myosin molecules in aqueous solution.Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, Nishizaka et al., 2004Nishizaka T. Oiwa K. Noji H. Kimura S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Chemomechanical coupling in F1-ATPase revealed by simultaneous observation of nucleotide kinetics and rotation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Detection of single fluorophores requires an integration time, and thus we used ordinary video cameras at 30 frames/s for the results below. To resolve the angles of binding and release at 30 frames/s, we forced γ to rotate slowly in the hydrolysis direction at a constant speed using electromagnets (Figure 4A). The medium contained 100 nM Cy3-ATP and 200 nM ATP, and the rotary speed was lower than ∼1.7 revolutions/s, time-averaged rate of rotation driven by unlabeled ATP at 200 nM. The rate of Cy3-ATP binding was about one-tenth that of unlabeled ATP (see below), and thus F1 bound mostly unlabeled ATP and occasionally Cy3-ATP (Figure 4B). When Cy3-ATP was bound, it was released, presumably as Cy3-ADP, after 245° ± 57° (SD) of rotation, irrespective of the rotary speed (Figure 4C). If this result applies to unlabeled ATP as well, ATP that is bound at 0° will be released as ADP at ∼240°, simultaneous with the binding of a third ATP (Figure 1A). We also examined the timing of Cy3-ADP release during spontaneous, uncontrolled rotation. At the video rate, resolving the release angle during stepping motion was impossible, but we hoped to distinguish whether release occurred in the first 80° or second 40° portion of a step. To resolve the substeps, we used ATP-γ-S for which the 80° dwell is extended to ∼70 ms presumably because its cleavage on F1 is slow (Shimabukuro et al., 2003Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Catalysis and rotation of F1 motor: cleavage of ATP at the catalytic site occurs in 1 ms before 40° substep rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). At 60 nM Cy3-ATP and 60 nM ATP-γ-S, some of the 120° steps were clearly resolved into 80° and 40° substeps (Figure 5A). When Cy3(-ADP) was released in a resolved 120° step, the release occurred in the 80° substep, after binding of Cy3-ATP and subsequent 240° rotation (between green lines in Figure 5A). Previously we have shown that Cy3-ATP bound at 0° is released in a 120° step between 240° and 360° (Nishizaka et al., 2004Nishizaka T. Oiwa K. Noji H. Kimura S. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Chemomechanical coupling in F1-ATPase revealed by simultaneous observation of nucleotide kinetics and rotation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and now we show that the release occurs between 240° and 320°, consistent with the forced-rotation result above that the angle between binding and release is ∼240°. For the spontaneous rotation at 60 nM Cy3-ATP and 60 nM ATP-γ-S, we observed 297 pairs of binding and release in 23 F1 molecules. Most were consistent with the scheme in Figure 1, but there were exceptions indicative of non-major reaction pathways. In the following statistics, we regard a 120° step to be resolved into substeps when the bead stayed at ∼80° for two video frames (67 ms) or longer: otherwise the step is classified as an unresolved 120° step. We judged binding/release and a step/substep to be coincident when one was within two frames of the other. (i) Of the 297 pairs, 205 (69%) were normal without reservation, in that binding of Cy3-ATP at 0° (an ATP-waiting angle) was coincident with a 80° substep or an unresolved 120° step, and that release of Cy3 occurred in a step or 80° substep starting from 240°. Of the 205, 47 binding events were associated with a resolved substep pair, and all these bindings were in a 80° substep; 59 release events were coincident with a resolved substep, all 80° and none 40°. (ii) In 26 pairs (9%), release occurred after 360° rotation or more. Most of these can be explained by successive binding of two or more Cy3-ATP molecules, and are thus considered normal. (iii) In 66 pairs (22%), binding and release angles were separated by less than 240°, or release occurred at 240° without rotation. (iiia) In 35 cases (12%) out of the 66, either binding or release was not synchronous with rotation. Possible explanations are blinking (momentary disappearance of fluorescence) or photobleaching (irreversible destruction) of Cy3 fluorophore while the F1 still followed the reaction scheme in Figure 1. However, control experiments (see Calibration below) showed blinking was rare and average photobleaching time was 56 s, much longer than the stepping intervals of < 1 s. In addition, (iiib) the rest of 31 pairs (10%) could not be explained by the scheme in Figure 1. We think that these irregular behaviors, together with some or most of the events in iiia, represent non-major reaction pathways that we describe fully in the next section. Briefly, bound Cy3-nucleotide that had undergone 240° of rotation tended to dissociate from F1 before the arrival of a next ATP(-γ-S) that would induce rotation toward 360°; the release at 240° was often, but not always, accompanied by a 40° backward substep to 200°, and rebinding of Cy3 after a 40° backward substep was also observed. We consider that these irregular behaviors are peculiar to low ATP environments where thermal agitations into non-major pathways can compete with infrequent arrivals of ATP. Substeps with ATP-γ-S were not always resolved, and therefore we attempted another experiment with a mutant F1 (β-E190D) which cleaves ATP 100-fold slower (and binds ATP 10-fold slower) than wild-type F1 (Shimabukuro et al., 2003Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Catalysis and rotation of F1 motor: cleavage of ATP at the catalytic site occurs in 1 ms before 40° substep rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). At 100 nM Cy3-ATP and 0.6 or 2 μM unlabeled ATP, most of substeps were resolved, and binding of Cy3-ATP was coincident with a 80° substep, and the release with another 80° substep after 240° rotation (Figure 5B). We observed 59 pairs of binding/release in 24 molecules. About 90% of binding was in a 80° substep, and ∼70% of release was in a substep from 240° to 320°. When this mutant bound Cy3-ATP at 0°, t"

https://openalex.org/W1965854786,"In Drosophila, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which direct RNA interference through the Argonaute protein Ago2, are produced by a biogenesis pathway distinct from microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate endogenous mRNA expression as guides for Ago1. Here, we report that siRNAs and miRNAs are sorted into Ago1 and Ago2 by pathways independent from the processes that produce these two classes of small RNAs. Such small-RNA sorting reflects the structure of the double-stranded assembly intermediates--the miRNA/miRNA( *) and siRNA duplexes--from which Argonaute proteins are loaded. We find that the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer acts as a gatekeeper for the assembly of Ago2 complexes, promoting the incorporation of siRNAs and disfavoring miRNAs as loading substrates for Drosophila Ago2. A separate mechanism acts in parallel to favor miRNA/miRNA( *) duplexes and exclude siRNAs from assembly into Ago1 complexes. Thus, in flies small-RNA duplexes are actively sorted into Argonaute-containing complexes according to their intrinsic structures."

When grown in rich media, single-celled organisms such as yeast and bacteria can be up to twice the size of their slow-growing counterparts. The ability to modulate size in a nutrient-dependent manner requires cells to: (1) detect when they have reached the appropriate mass for a given growth rate and (2) transmit this information to the division apparatus. We report the identification of a metabolic sensor that couples nutritional availability to division in Bacillus subtilis. A key component of this sensor is an effector, UgtP, which localizes to the division site in a nutrient-dependent manner and inhibits assembly of the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ. This sensor serves to maintain a constant ratio of FtsZ rings to cell length regardless of growth rate and ensures that cells reach the appropriate mass and complete chromosome segregation prior to cytokinesis.

Cell size control is a fundamental yet poorly understood aspect of the cell cycle. All organisms coordinate division with growth to ensure that cells are the appropriate size for a given environmental condition or developmental fate. For many single-celled organisms, nutrient availability has the strongest influence on cell size. For example, yeast and bacteria are significantly larger in nutrient-rich media than in nutrient-poor media (Fantes and Nurse, 1977Fantes P. Nurse P. Control of cell size at division in fission yeast by a growth-modulated size control over nuclear division.Exp.

Dependency on medium and temperature of cell size and chemical composition during balanced grown of Salmonella typhimurium.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1958; 19: 592-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, proteins such as Wee1 and Cdc25 are responsible for cell size homeostasis (Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004Jorgensen P. Tyers M. How cells coordinate growth and division.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1014-R1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, Russell and Nurse, 1987Russell P. Nurse P. Negative regulation of mitosis by wee1+, a gene encoding a protein kinase homologue.Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, however, little is known about the regulatory pathways governing cell size. Bacillus subtilis cells growing in rich medium are approximately twice the length of cells cultured under nutrient-poor conditions (Sargent, 1975Sargent M.G. Control of cell length in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 7-19PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium also exhibit similar growth-rate-dependent changes in cell size (Donachie and Begg, 1989Donachie W.D. Begg K. Cell length, nucleoid separation, and cell division of rod-shaped and spherical cells of Eschericia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4633-4639PubMed Google Scholar, Schaechter et al., 1958Schaechter M. Maaloe O. Kjeldgaard N.O. Dependency on medium and temperature of cell size and chemical composition during balanced grown of Salmonella typhimurium.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1958; 19: 592-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell size stabilizes, however, under slow growth conditions. When the time it takes for cells to double in mass increases beyond a certain threshold (∼60 min for B. subtilis), cell size becomes essentially constant (Sargent, 1975Sargent M.G. Control of cell length in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 7-19PubMed Google Scholar). Growth-rate-dependent increases in cell size in bacteria are correlated with increases in DNA content generated by multifork replication. Multifork replication allows rapidly growing cells to sustain division cycle times that are shorter than the period required to complete chromosome replication and division (<55 min for B. subtilis; Sharpe et al., 1998Sharpe M.E. Hauser P.M. Sharpe R.G. Errington J. Bacillus subtilis cell cycle as studied by fluorescence microscopy: constancy of cell length at initiation of DNA replication and evidence for active nucleoid partitioning.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 547-555PubMed Google Scholar). During multifork replication new rounds of DNA replication are initiated prior to completion of the previous round, and cells are “born” with active replication forks (Cooper and Helmstetter, 1968Cooper S. Helmstetter C.E. Chromosome replication and the division cycle of Escherichia coli B/r.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Thus, B. subtilis and E. coli cells grown in rich medium have several rounds of replication proceeding simultaneously, and it is under these conditions that cell size becomes proportional to growth rate. In contrast, in nutrient-poor medium when the mass doubling time exceeds the time required to complete both chromosome replication and division (>55 min for B. subtilis; Sharpe et al., 1998Sharpe M.E. Hauser P.M. Sharpe R.G. Errington J. Bacillus subtilis cell cycle as studied by fluorescence microscopy: constancy of cell length at initiation of DNA replication and evidence for active nucleoid partitioning.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 547-555PubMed Google Scholar), there are never more than two replication forks in a cell, and newborn cells have a single copy of the chromosome. Increasing cell size during rapid growth may be a means of ensuring that division is coordinated with segregation of the fully replicated chromosome or nucleoid. B. subtilis cells maintain a constant ratio of cell mass to DNA content over a wide range of growth rates (Sharpe et al., 1998Sharpe M.E. Hauser P.M. Sharpe R.G. Errington J. Bacillus subtilis cell cycle as studied by fluorescence microscopy: constancy of cell length at initiation of DNA replication and evidence for active nucleoid partitioning.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 547-555PubMed Google Scholar), and both E. coli and B. subtilis cells need to achieve a critical length prior to initiating chromosome segregation (Donachie and Begg, 1989Donachie W.D. Begg K. Cell length, nucleoid separation, and cell division of rod-shaped and spherical cells of Eschericia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4633-4639PubMed Google Scholar, Sargent, 1975Sargent M.G.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 547-555PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for coordinating cell size with growth rate in bacteria likely exert their effect by modulating assembly of the highly conserved, tubulin-like GTPase FtsZ. In bacteria, archaea, chloroplasts, and the mitochondria of certain algae, FtsZ self-assembles into a ring that establishes the location of the division site and serves as a framework for assembly of the division apparatus (Margolin, 2005Margolin W. FtsZ and the division of prokaryotic cells and organelles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Growth rate affects both the timing of FtsZ assembly and the period between FtsZ ring formation and cytokinesis (the Z-period; Den Blaauwen et al., 1999Den Blaauwen T. Buddelmeijer N. Aarsman M.E. Hameete C.M. Nanninga N. Timing of FtsZ assembly in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Weart and Levin, 2003Weart R.B. Levin P.A. Growth rate-dependent regulation of medial FtsZ ring formation.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A handful of proteins modulate the position or stability of the FtsZ ring (Margolin, 2005Margolin W. FtsZ and the division of prokaryotic cells and organelles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, Romberg and Levin, 2003Romberg L. Levin P.A. Assembly dynamics of the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ: poised at the edge of stability.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 125-154Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), none of which appear to play a direct role in controlling either the timing of FtsZ assembly or the coupling of cell division to cell mass. Here we show that a conserved metabolic pathway, glucolipid biosynthesis, functions as a metabolic sensor to coordinate cell size with growth rate in B. subtilis. This pathway transduces nutritional information directly to the division apparatus, delaying division until cells reach the appropriate mass for a given growth rate (defined here as “critical mass”). A key component of this pathway is an effector, the glucosyltransferase UgtP, which inhibits FtsZ assembly in vitro and modulates FtsZ ring formation in vivo. Importantly, both UgtP accumulation and localization to the nascent division site are dependent on nutrient availability, rendering division inhibition sensitive to growth rate. Defects in this metabolic sensor result in the formation of unusually small daughter cells and perturb the coupling of FtsZ ring assembly, cell division, and chromosome segregation. Bacteria control the timing of FtsZ assembly to coordinate division with mass doubling time (Weart and Levin, 2003Weart R.B. Levin P.A. Growth rate-dependent regulation of medial FtsZ ring formation.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Somewhat paradoxically, despite dividing more frequently, fast-growing cells can be up to twice as long as their slow-growing counterparts (Sargent, 1975Sargent M.G. Control of cell length in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 7-19PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we sought to determine if there was a relationship between growth rate, cell length, and FtsZ ring formation. Consistent with previous results (Weart and Levin, 2003Weart R.B. Levin P.A. Growth rate-dependent regulation of medial FtsZ ring formation.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the proportion of cells with FtsZ rings varied inversely with doubling time, ranging from ∼85% in LB to ∼50% in minimal sorbitol (Figure 1A). Cells were significantly longer in rich medium (median = 4.7 μm in LB, n = 524) versus nutrient-poor medium (median = 2.3 μm in minimal sorbitol, n = 163), in agreement with earlier studies (Sargent, 1975Sargent M.G. Control of cell length in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 7-19PubMed Google Scholar, Sharpe et al., 1998Sharpe M.E. Hauser P.M. Sharpe R.G. Errington J. Bacillus subtilis cell cycle as studied by fluorescence microscopy: constancy of cell length at initiation of DNA replication and evidence for active nucleoid partitioning.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 547-555PubMed Google Scholar). In support of previous work (Sharpe et al., 1998Sharpe M.E. Hauser P.M. Sharpe R.G. Errington J. Bacillus subtilis cell cycle as studied by fluorescence microscopy: constancy of cell length at initiation of DNA replication and evidence for active nucleoid partitioning.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 547-555PubMed Google Scholar), we confirmed that B. subtilis cells maintain a constant diameter over a broad range of growth rates (Figures S1A and S1B). Thus, length is directly proportional to cell mass. We next determined the average cell length per FtsZ ring (L/R) at each growth rate. We calculated the sum of lengths from ∼250 cells sampled from each culture condition and counted the total number of FtsZ rings in each population. Dividing the sum of cell lengths by the total number of FtsZ rings gave us the L/R ratio. Remarkably, we found that the L/R ratio remained constant regardless of growth rate (Figures 1B and 1C). The L/R ratio was 6.5 μm/ring for cells grown in either rich or poor media despite an approximately 2-fold difference in both cell size and the incidence of FtsZ ring formation (Figure 1A). These results indicate that cells not only alter the frequency of division in response to changes in mass doubling time, but they also coordinate FtsZ ring formation with cell growth to maintain cell size homeostasis. Maintaining a constant L/R ratio under different growth conditions requires cells to detect when they have reached critical mass for a particular growth rate and transmit this information to the division apparatus. We previously conducted a large-scale, transposon-based screen for inhibitors of FtsZ assembly in B. subtilis (Weart et al., 2005Weart R.B. Nakano S. Lane B.E. Zuber P. Levin P.A. The ClpX chaperone modulates assembly of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 238-249Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). (In vivo FtsZ ring formation most likely involves both the formation of single-stranded polymers and the assembly of these polymers into stable bundles via lateral interactions [Romberg and Levin, 2003Romberg L. Levin P.A. Assembly dynamics of the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ: poised at the edge of stability.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 125-154Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar]. We therefore use “FtsZ assembly” as a general term to refer to both steps in FtsZ ring formation.) We reasoned that some of the mutations isolated in this screen might identify genes responsible for coupling division to cell mass. Accordingly, we examined candidate Tn10 insertion strains to identify those exhibiting significantly altered cell size (wild-type ± 15%) and normal FtsZ localization. This second criterion is important since mutations that disrupt FtsZ localization (e.g., insertions in minCD and ezrA) result in abnormally long cells and distort the L/R ratio without directly affecting the control of FtsZ assembly at midcell (Levin et al., 1998Levin P.A. Shim J.J. Grossman A.D. Effect of minCD on FtsZ ring position and polar septation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6048-6051Google Scholar, Levin et al., 1999Levin P.A. Kurtser I.G. Grossman A.D. Identification and characterization of a negative regulator of FtsZ ring formation in Bacillus subtilis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 9642-9647Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One gene identified in the screen, pgcA, met these criteria. pgcA encodes a phosphoglucomutase (PGM) that catalyzes the interconversion of glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P; Figure 2A). pgcA homologs are found in all domains of life. A Tn10 insertion in the first third of pgcA eliminated PGM activity (Figure 2B) and resulted in cells that were ∼35% shorter than wild-type cells following growth in LB, yet maintained normal FtsZ localization (Figures 1D and 1E). The mass doubling time of pgcA mutants was comparable to wild-type cells, indicating that their reduced size was not due to growth defects (Figure 1A). Based on its loss-of-function phenotype as well as its role in sugar metabolism, we speculated that PgcA might be involved in communicating information regarding nutrient availability to the division apparatus in order to coordinate cell size with growth rate. In the absence of a growth rate defect, the reduced size of pgcA mutants suggests that PgcA normally inhibits FtsZ assembly through direct or indirect interactions. We confirmed this hypothesis in two ways. First, a loss-of-function mutation in pgcA (pgcA::Tn10) suppressed the heat sensitivity of an ftsZts (ftsZ-gfp) allele, restoring both FtsZ ring formation and cell division to ftsZts cells grown at 45°C (Figures 1F and 1G). Second, similar to mutations in other inhibitors of FtsZ assembly (Levin et al., 2001Levin P.A. Schwartz R.L. Grossman A.D. Polymer Stability Plays an Important Role in the Positional Regulation of FtsZ.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5449-5452Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Weart et al., 2005Weart R.B. Nakano S. Lane B.E. Zuber P. Levin P.A. The ClpX chaperone modulates assembly of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 238-249Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a pgcA::Tn10 mutation suppressed the general block in cell division and lethality associated with >12-fold overexpression of the FtsZ assembly inhibitor MinCD (Figure 2D). The loss of pgcA did not interfere with the overexpression of MinCD, as indicated by MinD immunoblot (Figure S2A). FtsZ levels were also unaffected in pgcA::Tn10 cells (Figure S2B), supporting the idea that PgcA modulates FtsZ assembly dynamics rather than ftsZ expression or protein stability. To ascertain whether the size defect of pgcA::Tn10 cells was due to an inability to coordinate FtsZ assembly with cell size, we determined the L/R ratio in pgcA mutant cells under a variety of growth conditions. Strikingly, we found that pgcA::Tn10 mutants had lost the ability to maintain a constant L/R ratio over a range of mass doubling times (Figure 1B). This situation was particularly pronounced during rapid growth, where the L/R value was ∼4.8 μm/ring in pgcA mutants versus ∼6.5 μm/ring for wild-type cells. During slow growth the L/R ratio for pgcA mutants was ∼6.0 μm/ring, suggesting that PgcA's role in cell size homeostasis is largely dispensable in nutrient-poor medium. Significantly, the percentage of cells with an FtsZ ring was unperturbed in pgcA mutants (Figure 1A), indicating that the timing of FtsZ assembly and the duration of the Z-period are normal in a steady-state population (Den Blaauwen et al., 1999Den Blaauwen T. Buddelmeijer N. Aarsman M.E. Hameete C.M. Nanninga N. Timing of FtsZ assembly in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Weart and Levin, 2003Weart R.B. Levin P.A. Growth rate-dependent regulation of medial FtsZ ring formation.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PgcA serves as a bridge between glycolysis and glycosylation by interconverting Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P (Figure 2A). To understand how this metabolic enzyme and its products are involved in coordinating FtsZ assembly with critical mass, we examined FtsZ assembly dynamics and cell size in strains encoding mutations in pgcA and related pathways. We first established that the enzymatic activity of PgcA was required for its ability to modulate FtsZ assembly by engineering a point mutation in the catalytic phosphoserine of PgcA, S146 (Shackelford et al., 2004Shackelford G.S. Regni C.A. Beamer L.J. Evolutionary trace analysis of the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although stably expressed (data not shown), lysates from the pgcA(S146A) strain possessed no detectable PGM activity (Figure 2B). pgcA(S146A) mutants were phenotypically identical to pgcA::Tn10 cells with regard to both reduced cell size (data not shown) and suppression of MinCD-induced lethality (Figure 2D), demonstrating that the catalytic activity of PgcA is important for its role in cell size homeostasis. Given PgcA's role as a link between glycolysis and glycosylation (Figure 2A), we next determined if defects in either pathway were responsible for the pgcA cell division phenotype. We found that defects in pgi, whose gene product phosphohexose isomerase catalyzes the conversion of Glc-6-P to fructose-6-phosophate (Frc-6-P) during the first step of glycolysis, had no detectable effect on FtsZ assembly dynamics (Figure 2D). In contrast, a null mutation in gtaB (gtaB::spc), which is required to convert Glc-1-P to uridine-5′-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc) resulted in reduced cell size and suppressed MinCD-induced lethality (Figures 2C and 2D). The loss of gtaB did not prevent the accumulation of MinCD, as indicated by MinD immunoblot, nor did it affect FtsZ levels (Figures S2A and S2B). These results indicate that the cell division defect associated with mutations in pgcA is due to the loss of an enzyme involved in glycosylation. UDP-Glc is involved in the biosynthesis of the three types of teichoic acids that constitute the major anionic polymers in the Gram-positive cell envelope (Figure 2A; Lazarevic et al., 2005Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Medico N. Pooley H. Bron S. Karamata D. Bacillus subtilis alpha-phosphoglucomutase is required for normal cell morphology and biofilm formation.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 39-45Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To identify the proximal cause of the pgcA::Tn10 cell division defect, we systematically tested null mutations in the three sugar transferases implicated in teichoic acid biosynthesis—ugtP, tagE, and ggaAB—for defects in FtsZ assembly and cell size. Of the three sugar transferases, we found that only ugtP, which encodes the transferase responsible for synthesis of the diglucosyl diacylglycerol (DiGlcDAG) anchor for lipoteichoic acid (LTA), was a genuine inhibitor of FtsZ assembly. Not only did ugtP::cat suppress the lethality associated with MinCD overexpression, but ugtP mutant cells were also ∼20% shorter than wild-type B. subtilis (Figures 2C and 2D). The loss of ugtP did not prevent the accumulation of MinCD, as shown by MinD immunoblot, nor did it affect FtsZ levels (Figures S2A and S2B). Cell length was normal in ggaAB and tagE mutants, and neither mutation suppressed MinCD-induced lethality (Figures 2C and 2D). The reduced size of ugtP::cat cells is consistent with previous data (Price et al., 1997Price K.D. Roels S. Losick R. A Bacillus subtilis gene encoding a protein similar to nucleotide sugar transferases influences cell shape and viability.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4959-4961PubMed Google Scholar). The L/R ratio of ugtP::cat cells during growth in rich medium was intermediate between wild-type and pgcA mutant cells at ∼5.6 μm/ring, and suppression of MinCD overexpression by ugtP::cat was one log unit less efficient than pgcA::Tn10 (Figure 2D). It is therefore likely that an additional UDP-Glc-sensitive factor also modulates FtsZ assembly. Epistasis and complementation experiments indicate that all three genes—pgcA, gtaB, and ugtP—act in concert to regulate FtsZ assembly (Figures S3A and S3B). LTA is still present in ugtP mutants (Lazarevic et al., 2005Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Medico N. Pooley H. Bron S. Karamata D. Bacillus subtilis alpha-phosphoglucomutase is required for normal cell morphology and biofilm formation.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 39-45Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a mutation that altered LTA structure (dlt::spc; Cao and Helmann, 2004Cao M. Helmann J.D. The Bacillus subtilis extracytoplasmic-function sigmaX factor regulates modification of the cell envelope and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1136-1146Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) did not alter FtsZ assembly dynamics (Figure 2D). Defects in LTA structure or stability are thus unlikely to be responsible for the cell division defect associated with mutations in the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway. With the exception of cell length, pgcA, gtaB, and ugtP mutants were morphologically wild-type in our hands (Figure 2C) despite reports of magnesium-dependent defects in cell shape (Lazarevic et al., 2005Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Medico N. Pooley H. Bron S. Karamata D. Bacillus subtilis alpha-phosphoglucomutase is required for normal cell morphology and biofilm formation.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 39-45Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), presumably due to contaminating levels of magnesium in our growth medium. The diameters of pgcA, gtaB, and ugtP mutants were on par with wild-type cells (Figures S1A and S1B). Of the three enzymes in the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway, UgtP is the best candidate for a direct regulator of FtsZ assembly. A membrane-associated protein, UgtP has been shown to localize to the division septum (Nishibori et al., 2005Nishibori A. Kusaka J. Hara H. Umeda M. Matsumoto K. Phosphatidylethanolamine domains and localization of phospholipid synthases in Bacillus subtilis membranes.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2163-2174Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), supporting a model in which it inhibits FtsZ assembly through direct interactions. Consistent with this model, ∼8.5-fold overexpression of a functional UgtP-his allele increased cell length ∼22% (Figures 2E and S2C). To test whether UgtP inhibits FtsZ assembly directly, we examined the effect of UgtP on FtsZ assembly in vitro. For these experiments we employed native B. subtilis FtsZ and a Thioredoxin-UgtP-6XHis fusion protein (Thio-UgtP). FtsZ assembly was measured using a 90° angle light-scattering assay (Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1999Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Analysis of FtsZ assembly by light scattering and determination of the role of divalent metal cations.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach we determined that UgtP inhibited FtsZ assembly in a concentration-dependent manner with ∼90% inhibition at a 1:1 ratio of Thio-UgtP to FtsZ (Figures 3A and 3B). Thio-UgtP was able to inhibit FtsZ assembly at ratios as low as 1:5 (Figure 3B). The absence of UgtP's substrate, UDP-Glc, resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction in its ability to inhibit FtsZ assembly in vitro (Figure 3C). Adding 6 μM Thioredoxin-6XHis (Thio) or BSA had no effect on FtsZ assembly (Figure 3D). Quantitative immunoblotting indicated that there are ∼2400 molecules of UgtP per cell in LB (Figure S2D). FtsZ is estimated to be at a concentration of ∼5000 molecules per cell (Feucht et al., 2001Feucht A. Lucet I. Yudkin M.D. Errington J. Cytological and biochemical characterization of the FtsA cell division protein of Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 115-125Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, UgtP inhibits FtsZ assembly at ratios that are consistent with physiological concentrations. Electron micrographs of FtsZ assembled in the presence and absence of UgtP suggest that UgtP interferes with stabilizing lateral interactions between single-stranded protofilaments. In the absence of UgtP, FtsZ formed large bundled structures, the consequence of lateral interactions between protofilaments (Figure 3E). However, we observed very few bundles at a 1:2 ratio of UgtP to FtsZ, and protofilaments were significantly shorter, consistent with a decrease in polymer stability (Figure 3F). Intriguingly, UgtP itself formed higher order structures in FtsZ assembly buffer (Figures 3G and 3H). These structures, which appear to consist of closely stacked spirals of UgtP monomers (seven or eight per turn), were less prevalent in the presence of FtsZ (Figure 3F), suggesting that UgtP inhibition of FtsZ assembly occurs at the expense of UgtP self-assembly. UgtP oligomerization was independent of UDP-Glc and GTP (data not shown). In vivo the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway exerts its strongest effect on cell size under nutrient-rich conditions (Figure 1B), suggesting it functions as a growth-rate-dependent inhibitor of cell division. To determine the mechanism responsible for nutrient-dependent division inhibition, we first examined UgtP expression under nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor conditions. Quantitative immunoblotting of lysate from cells encoding a functional ugtP-his allele under the control of the native ugtP promoter indicated that full-length UgtP levels are reduced ∼6-fold in nutrient-poor minimal sorbitol relative to nutrient-rich LB (Figure 4A). To further explore the growth rate regulation of UgtP activity, we localized a functional YFP-UgtP fusion in cells cultured in nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor medium. Consistent with previous results (Nishibori et al., 2005Nishibori A. Kusaka J. Hara H. Umeda M. Matsumoto K. Phosphatidylethanolamine domains and localization of phospholipid synthases in Bacillus subtilis membranes.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2163-2174Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), YFP-UgtP was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and concentrated at midcell in exponentially growing cells cultured in nutrient-rich medium (Figure 4B, left). In cells cultured in minimal sorbitol, however, the majority of YFP-UgtP appeared to be sequestered in randomly distributed foci (Figure 4B, right), where it is presumably unable to modulate FtsZ assembly. In contrast to YFP-UgtP, a functional PgcA-GFP fusion was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). Genetic analyses suggested that PgcA and GtaB exert their effect on FtsZ by controlling the synthesis of UgtP's substrate UDP-Glc (Figures 2 and S3B). PGM activity was reduced 2-fold in cells cultured in minimal sorbitol relative to those cultured in LB (Figure 2B). The reduction in PGM activity correlates with reduced UgtP localization to the septum and reduced division inhibition, supporting the idea that UDP-Glc synthesis might modulate UgtP activity. Since UDP-Glc did not have a potent effect on the ability of UgtP to inhibit FtsZ assembly in vitro (Figure 3D), we determined if PgcA and GtaB were required for UgtP production"
https://openalex.org/W2087706354,"Mammalian models of longevity are related primarily to caloric restriction and alterations in metabolism. We examined mice in which type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) is knocked out (AC5 KO) and which are resistant to cardiac stress and have increased median lifespan of ∼30%. AC5 KO mice are protected from reduced bone density and susceptibility to fractures of aging. Old AC5 KO mice are also protected from aging-induced cardiomyopathy, e.g., hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis, and reduced cardiac function. Using a proteomic-based approach, we demonstrate a significant activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and upregulation of cell protective molecules, including superoxide dismutase. Fibroblasts isolated from AC5 KO mice exhibited ERK-dependent resistance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that AC is a fundamentally important mechanism regulating lifespan and stress resistance.

Fibroblasts isolated from AC5 KO mice exhibited ERK-dependent resistance to oxidative stress.

Caloric restriction (CR) is a well-recognized mechanism mediating lifespan extension from yeast to mammals (Sinclair, 2005Sinclair D.A. Toward a unified theory of caloric restriction and longevity regulation.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 987-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Other mammalian models of longevity are related to CR through effects on metabolism, e.g., growth hormone (GH)/GH receptor (Bluher et al., 2003Bluher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Extended longevity in mice lacking the insulin receptor in adipose tissue.Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, Brown-Borg et al., 1996Brown-Borg H.M. Borg K.E.

The current investigation reports a novel mammalian model of longevity based on interruption of beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) signaling at the level of AC, specifically disruption of the AC5 gene, an AC isoform predominantly expressed in the heart and brain. AC is a key enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP from ATP. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA; Walsh et al., 1968Walsh D.A. Perkins J.P. Krebs E.G. An adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-dependant protein kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3763-3765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and regulates the function of multiple proteins and transcriptional factors, such as CREB and ICER (Houslay and Kolch, 2000Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Cell-type specific integration of cross-talk between extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cAMP signaling.Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). AC also plays a pivotal role in β-AR signaling. At least nine membrane-bound isoforms of AC (AC1−AC9) exist, with diverse tissue distribution, biochemical properties, and specific catalytic activities (Hanoune and Defer, 2001Hanoune J. Defer N. Regulation and role of adenylyl cyclase isoforms.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We generated a genetically engineered mouse model in which AC5 is knocked out (AC5 KO; Okumura et al., 2003bOkumura S. Kawabe J. Yatani A. Takagi G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Takagi I. Sadoshima J. Vatner D.E. et al.Type 5 adenylyl cyclase disruption alters not only sympathetic but also parasympathetic and calcium-mediated cardiac regulation.Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, AC5 KO mice live significantly longer than control littermates. The hearts of these mice also demonstrate resistance to stresses, including pressure overload and catecholamine stimulation, in terms of maintenance of cardiac function and protection against apoptosis (Okumura et al., 2003cOkumura S. Takagi G. Kawabe J. Yang G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Vatner D.E. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Ishikawa Y. Disruption of type 5 adenylyl cyclase gene preserves cardiac function against pressure overload.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9986-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another potentially important clinical correlation involves insights into cardioprotection for heart failure since there is considerable current interest in inhibition of β-AR signaling and AC for the treatment of heart failure (Bristow, 2000Bristow M.R. beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in chronic heart failure.Circulation. 2000; 101: 558-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In view of the parallel features of heart failure protection and longevity, it is interesting to speculate that the proteins in the β-AR signaling pathway may be involved in both longevity and stress resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that AC5 KO mice exhibit significantly extended median/maximum lifespan, retarded aging phenotypes in the heart and bone, and increased stress resistance. Using unbiased proteomic approaches, we found that AC5 KO leads to upregulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which in turn mediates upregulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an important mechanism mediating lifespan extension and stress resistance. To determine the lifespan of AC5 KO mice, we first conducted a retrospective study comparing the survival rate of WT and AC5 KO mice, which were all alive at 17 months (Figure 1 insert). Of these, only 16% of WT were still alive at 30 months of age, whereas 92% of AC5 KO mice remained alive at this time. Next we conducted an anterospective study, which is summarized by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. This study revealed that the median lifespan was increased by 8 months (from 25 to 33 months), p < 0.01, and the maximum lifespan was extended by 4 months (from 33 to 37 months), p < 0.02, in AC5 KO mice (Figure 1). Increased lifespan was similar in both males and females. For comparisons of AC5 KO and WT, young mice (3–6 months) and old mice (20–30 months) were studied. Bone integrity was only studied in female mice. Necropsies revealed weakened bone structure with susceptibility to fractures in old WT mice, but not in old AC5 KO mice. Radiographs indicated reduced bone density, healing stress fractures, reduced calcification, and absence of the fibula in old WT mice (Figure 2A). In contrast, bones appeared normal in radiographs of old AC5 KO mice (Figure 2A). The differences in bone structure were quantified by torsional mechanical testing (Manigrasso and O'Connor, 2004Manigrasso M.B. O'Connor J.P. Characterization of a closed femur fracture model in mice.J. Orthop. Trauma. 2004; 18: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Figure 2B shows three indices of (femur) bone strength in WT and AC5 KO mice. The bone peak torque, shear modulus, and shear stress were greater in AC5 KO mice, demonstrating that the bone in aging AC5 KO mice is stronger and more resistant to stress. Reduced body weight (BW) and GH signaling have been observed in CR mice and several other genetic mutations (Al-Regaiey et al., 2005Al-Regaiey K.A. Masternak M.M. Bonkowski M. Sun L. Bartke A.

In order to determine whether knocking out AC5 affects mouse BW and GH signaling, we measured BW and GH levels in AC5 KO mice. Body weights were found to be similar in young AC5 KO and WT mice, but significantly decreased in old AC5 KO compared to old WT mice (p < 0.05). A significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the GH level was also observed in AC5 KO mice (Figures S1A and S1B). In view of the lower body weights in AC5 KO mice, we examined whether CR contributes to the extended lifespan in AC5 KO mice. We measured food intake in young AC5 KO mice and WT controls over a 3 week period. The data demonstrated that AC5 KO mice tend to eat more than WT. Thus, lifespan extension in AC5 KO is not caused by reduced caloric intake in young animals. It is still possible that older AC5 KO eat less (Figure S1C). We measured the key features of aging cardiomyopathy including left ventricular (LV) weight/BW (LVW/BW) ratio, myocyte size, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), apoptosis, and fibrosis. LVW/BW ratio (Figure 3A), an index of LV hypertrophy (LVH), was not different between young WT and AC5 KO mice but was significantly elevated in old WT (p < 0.05) and not in old AC5 KO mice. Myocyte cross-sectional area was significantly less, p < 0.02, in old AC5 KO (259.5 ± 4.9 μm2) than in old WT mice (282.9 ± 5.2 μm2), confirming that less LVH developed in old AC5 KO mice. LVEF (Figure 3B), an index of LV systolic function, was significantly higher in old AC5 KO mice compared to old WT mice (p < 0.05), indicating better LV function. Myocardial fibrosis was increased in old versus young WT, p < 0.05, but was not increased in old AC5 KO mice (Figure 3D). Aging cardiomyopathy is also characterized by increased apoptosis, which was also observed in the present study in the old WT mice, but not in the old AC5 KO mice (Figure 3C). One important signaling pathway mediating cell survival involves ERK signaling (see below). Several downstream apoptosis-related elements of this pathway, e.g., RSK, p-Bad, and Bcl-xl, were significantly increased in heart, kidney, and brain of AC5 KO mice (Figure S2A). Other antiapoptotic markers such as XIAP and Hsp70 were also increased in AC5 KO mice (Figure S2B), consistent with protection from apoptosis in AC5 KO mice. To test the hypothesis that knocking out AC5 renders cells resistant to environmental stresses, we investigated whether neonatal AC5 KO cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts from AC5 KO embryos and adult AC5 KO mice are resistant to oxidative (H2O2) and DNA (UV light) damage. Cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1-day-old neonates of homozygous AC5 KO mice or WT mice. After culture for 48 hr, cells were treated by H2O2 (25, 50, and 100 μM) or UV light (10 and 25 mJ/cm2) for 24 hr. Cell viability was higher in AC5 KO than in WT myocytes (Figure 4A, left upper and lower panels). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from 13 day embryos of homozygous AC5 KO mice or WT mice. The third passage cells were treated by H2O2 (50, 100, 200, and 400 μM) or UV light (25 and 100 mJ/cm2) for 24 hr. The proportion of surviving cells was higher in AC5 KO than in WT MEFs (Figure 4A, right upper and lower panels). Furthermore, fibroblasts were grown from tail skin of adult AC5 KO and WT mice. The third passage cells were exposed to 25 μM H2O2 or 25 mJ/cm2 UV for 24 hr. Similar to MEFs, WT fibroblasts were more sensitive to H2O2 and UV light, whereas AC5 KO fibroblasts displayed increased resistance to both H2O2 and UV light (data not shown). H2O2- or UV-light-treated MEFs and adult fibroblasts were also subjected to apoptosis analysis. Apoptosis was lower in AC5 KO than in WT MEFs (Figure 4B, left) and adult fibroblasts (Figure 4B, right). These results indicate that disruption of AC5 enhances resistance to oxidative stress in vitro. In order to examine the mechanisms which confer resistance to oxidative stress, we examined the levels of the antioxidant MnSOD in heart, kidney, brain, and bone by western blotting. The protein level of MnSOD was increased in the heart, kidney, and brain of aging AC5 KO mice, providing further evidence that the AC5 KO mice are resistant to oxidative damage (Figure 4C). To investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating longevity in AC5 KO mice, we utilized an unbiased proteomic analysis to search for novel proteins that are altered in AC5 KO mice. We initially separated proteins from brain tissue using 2D gel electrophoresis and compared the gel patterns of WT and AC5 KO mice (20 months old). We found that nine proteins were upregulated, five downregulated, and three altered by posttranslational modifications in AC5 KO mice (Table S1). Among these changes, we are interested in the alteration which is shown in Figure 5A; the pattern of spots in the circles was different between WT and AC5 KO. The two spots in WT and one in AC5 KO were observed, and all of them were identified as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1; Figure S3) using peptide mapping by mass spectrometry and sequence database searches, which suggests the alteration of MEK1 posttranslational modification (most likely phosphorylation) in AC5 KO mice. Since we observed alterations of MEK1 in AC5 KO mice from 2D gel electrophoresis, we examined the levels of p-MEK by western blotting in the heart. p-MEK was confirmed to be elevated in the heart of AC5 KO mice (Figure 5B). Furthermore, we examined its upstream molecule, Raf-1, and its downstream molecule, ERK, by western blotting. We found that phosphorylation of ERK was significantly increased in the heart and kidney (Figure 5C). Phosphorylation of Raf-1 was also elevated (data not shown). The phosphorylation of ERK was also elevated in MEFs isolated from AC5 KO mice (Figure 5C, right). Therefore, Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is upregulated in AC5 KO mice. We hypothesized that knocking out AC5 enhances cellular resistance to oxidative stress through activation of ERK. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited ERK with PD98059 (the levels of p-ERK were significantly reduced after treatment; data not shown), a specific inhibitor, to examine whether inhibition of ERK reduces oxidative stress tolerance in AC5 KO mice. AC5 KO MEFs were pretreated with PD98059 (30 μM in 0.04% DMSO and 60 μM in 0.08% DMSO) for 30 min before 24 hr incubation with 50 μM or 100 μM H2O2. The proportion of surviving cells pretreated with PD98059 was lower than the cells with vehicle treatment alone (Figure 5D, left and middle), indicating a possible role of ERK activation in mediating resistance to oxidative stress. To further confirm whether ERK is involved in stress resistance downstream of AC5, we used RNAi to knock down ERK1 and ERK2 in AC5 KO MEFs (the levels of p-ERK were significantly reduced after treatment; data not shown), and then cells were treated with 400 μM H2O2. In an ERK knockdown experiment, cell viability was reduced (Figure 5D, right). As shown in Figure 5D, the reduction of tolerance to oxidative stress was more in AC5 KO than in WT. To further test whether MnSOD could be a downstream enzyme of the ERK signaling pathway, we determined the level of MnSOD in MEFs from WT and AC5 KO mice treated with PD98059 and ERK siRNA. As shown in Figure 5E, the level of MnSOD was reduced in MEFs pretreated with PD98059 (left) and in MEFs with ERK siRNA (right), suggesting that ERK plays an essential role in mediating upregulation of MnSOD. To study the effects of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway on longevity, we overexpressed human ERK2 in yeast (Figure 6A) since expression of human ERK in yeast can partially substitute for the absence of KSS1, the ortholog of ERK (Atienza et al., 2000Atienza J.M. Suh M. Xenarios I. Landgraf R. Colicelli J. Human ERK1 induces filamentous growth and cell wall remodeling pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20638-20646Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that ERK2 overexpressing yeast strains were resistant to heat shock and oxidative stress (Figure 6B), and chronological lifespan was longer compared to a WT strain that does not express ERK2, e.g., the survival at 5 days in the strain with ERK2 overexpression was 62 ± 3.2%, significantly greater, p < 0.05, than WT (51 ± 4.4%; Figure 6C). We expressed ERK2 also in strains that have a mutation in the gene encoding adenylyl cyclase, CYR1 (mutant: cyr1-1; Fabrizio et al., 2001Fabrizio P. Pozza F. Pletcher S.D. Gendron C.M. Longo V.D. Regulation of longevity and stress resistance by Sch9 in yeast.Science. 2001; 292: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The cyr1-1 mutant strain expressing ERK2 was not more resistant to heat shock and oxidative stress compared to the nonERK2-expressing cyr1-1 mutant strain (Figure 6B), and also the chronological lifespan was not increased significantly (Figure 6C). Furthermore, when we deleted KSS1 (ERK homolog gene) from the yeast, the yeast strains lacking Kss1p showed increased sensitivity to heat shock and oxidative stress (Figure 6D) and a shorter lifespan, e.g., the survival at 5 days in the strain lacking Kss1p was 36 ± 1.5%, significantly less, p < 0.05, than WT (53 ± 2.1%; Figure 6E). Lack of Kss1p also increases sensitivity to heat shock and oxidative stress in a mutant cyr1-1 strain (Figure 6D) with a concomitant decrease in chronological lifespan, e.g., the survival at 5 days in a mutant cyr1-1 strain lacking Kss1p was 69 ± 2.5%, significantly less, p < 0.05, than the cyr1-1 strain (90 ± 5.2%; Figure 6E). The data for all survival results at 5 days and statistics are included in Table S2. These results are consistent with the notion that the corresponding Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in yeast (Ste11/Ste7/Kss1) interacts genetically with the Cyr1/cAMP/PKA pathway in mediating regulation of lifespan and stress resistance. It should be noted that our results also suggest that the effect of Cry1-1 mutation could be mediated by Kss1-independent mechanisms as well. The central finding in this work is that AC5 KO mice exhibit extended lifespan. Our observation for the first time indicates that AC is not only a fundamentally important mechanism regulating lifespan in a wide variety of organisms but also provides a novel molecular mechanism by which genetic deletion of AC5 leads to this lifespan extension. AC is the keystone of sympathetic transmission in β-AR signaling in myocardium. The sympathetic nervous system is designed to respond to stress. The activity of the sympathetic nervous system and β-AR stimulation increases with aging and may play a role in the development of aging cardiomyopathy (Lakatta, 1993Lakatta E.G. Cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms in advanced age.Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 413-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, Swynghedauw et al., 1995Swynghedauw B. Besse S. Assayag P. Carre F.

Cardiol. 1995; 76: 2D-7DAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it has been thought that desensitization in the β-AR signaling pathway is protective in aging cardiomyopathy (Asai et al., 1999Asai K. Yang G.P. Geng Y.J. Takagi G. Bishop S.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). β-AR blockers improve survival after myocardial infarction, have salutary effects in patients with heart failure, and may have antiatherosclerosis effects. On the other hand, chronically enhanced β-AR stimulation with age is deleterious to the heart; indeed a number of mouse models of increased β-AR stimulation at the level of the receptor (Du et al., 2000Du X.J.

Res. 2001; 89: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have been shown to have increased mortality and decreased resistance to stress. The effect of chronic inhibition of β-AR signaling upon aging of the heart has not been examined using specific loss-of-function models. The protection of AC5 KO mice from both aging cardiomyopathy (LVH, fibrosis, and apoptosis; this study) and stresses (pressure overload and chronic catecholamine stimulation; our previous studies in Okumura et al., 2003aOkumura S.

USA. 2003; 100: 9986-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) may result from a desensitization of β-AR signaling in the heart since AC5 is a major isoform of AC in cardiac myocardium. It is generally believed that lifespan of the organism is regulated by key, evolutionarily conserved, molecular mechanisms, such as sirtuin family proteins and FOXO family transcription factors. Although it has been shown that the genetic mutations in the cAMP-PKA pathway extend both replicative and chronological lifespan in yeast (Fabrizio et al., 2001Fabrizio P. Pozza F. Pletcher S.D.

Our observation clearly indicates that genetic deletion of AC5, a mammalian homolog of yeast Cyr1, extends the lifespan of mice. To investigate the molecular mechanisms in the regulation of longevity in AC5 KO mice, an unbiased proteomic analysis followed by confirmation by western analysis demonstrated activation in the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Previous findings suggested that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway declines with age (Ajuh et al., 2000Ajuh P. Kuster B. Panov K. Zomerdijk J.C. Mann M. Lamond A.I.

Commun. 2004; 318: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ERK has also been considered as a cardioprotective agent in aged myocardium (Taylor and Starnes, 2003Taylor R.P. Starnes J.W. Age, cell signalling and cardioprotection.Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All of these results are consistent with a notion that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is critical in the aging process. However, a beneficial effect of ERK in longevity has not been investigated previously. We used yeast as a model to investigate the role of Raf/MEK/ERK activation in longevity. Overexpression of human ERK2 in a yeast strain caused extended chronological lifespan and stress resistance, strongly suggesting that the mammalian ERK functions in controlling lifespan. Furthermore, lack of Kss1p, an ERK2 homolog in yeast, significantly reduced the lifespan and resistance to heat and oxidative stress in the cyr1-1 mutant, consistent with the notion that ERK2 homologs play an essential role in mediating lifespan extension in the cyr1-1 mutant. It should be noted, however, that a parallel pathway, presumably another yeast homolog of mammalian ERKs or even ERK-independent mechanisms, may also regulate lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress and heat because the KSS1 deletion generated upon the cyr1-1 mutant showed significantly longer lifespan than the KSS1 deletion alone. Another important finding is that AC5 KO mice are resistant to oxidative stress. Apoptosis, which may result from oxidative damage, was reduced in the myocardium of AC5 KO mice compared to WT mice, and molecular mechanisms to be involved in protection against apoptosis, p-Bad, Bcl-xl, Hsp70, and XIAP, were increased not only in heart but also in kidney and brain. Resistance to oxidative stress has been identified in some longevity mouse models; e.g., IGF-1-receptor-deficient mice (Holzenberger et al., 2003Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P.C. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y.

We describe the crystal structure of the entire ectodomain of KIT before and after SCF stimulation.

Receptor dimerization is followed by conformational changes that enable lateral interactions between membrane proximal Ig-like domains D4 and D5 of two KIT molecules.

Stem cell factor (SCF) is a cytokine that mediates its diverse cellular responses by binding to and activating the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) KIT (also known as SCF receptor). KIT was initially discovered as an oncogene in a feline retrovirus that captured an activated and truncated form of the surface receptor (Besmer et al., 1986Besmer P. Lader E. George P.C. Bergold P.J. Qiu F.H. Zuckerman E.E. Hardy W.D.

Virol. 1986; 60: 194-203Google Scholar). SCF is encoded by the murine steel (SI) locus while KIT is encoded by the dominant white spotting (W) locus in the mouse (Copeland et al., 1990Copeland N.G.

SCF functions as a noncovalent homodimer, and both membrane-anchored and soluble forms of SCF generated by alternative RNA splicing and by proteolytic processing have been described (reviewed in Ashman, 1999Ashman L.K. The biology of stem cell factor and its receptor C-kit.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). KIT is a member of the type III family of RTKs, which also includes PDGF-receptor-α and β, CSF-1 receptor (also known as M-CSF receptor or FMS), and the FLT3 receptor (also known as FLK2) (reviewed in Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990Ullrich A.

Hunter T. Oncogenic kinase signalling.Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). KIT is composed of a glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain (ectodomain) that is connected to a cytoplasmic region by means of a single transmembrane (TM) domain (reviewed in Schlessinger, 2000Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of KIT and other members of type III RTKs all contain five Ig-like domains, in which the second and third membrane distal domains were shown to play a role in ligand recognition (reviewed in Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Signal transduction by receptors with tyrosine kinase activity.Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4514) Google Scholar). Other RTKs whose extracellular ligand-binding domains are composed exclusively of multiple Ig-like repeats include members of the VEGF receptor family (7 Ig-like), CCK4 receptor (7 Ig-like), and FGF receptors (3 Ig-like). The cytoplasmic region of KIT contains a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain with a large kinase-insert region, another hallmark of type III RTKs. Binding of SCF to KIT leads to receptor dimerization, intermolecular autophosphorylation, and PTK activation. It was proposed that the fourth Ig-like domain of KIT is responsible for KIT dimerization in response to either monovalent or bivalent SCF binding (Lev et al., 1992Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D.

However, other studies have demonstrated that ligand-induced dimerization of KIT is driven by bivalent binding of SCF (Philo et al., 1996Philo J.S. Wen J. Wypych J. Schwartz M.G. Mendiaz E.A.

Kit receptor dimerization is driven by bivalent binding of stem cell factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6311-6317Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Characterization of mice mutated at the Scf or Kit loci has shown that SCF and KIT are required for development of hematopoietic cells, melanocytes, germ cells, and intestinal pacemaker cells (reviewed in Ashman, 1999Ashman L.K. The biology of stem cell factor and its receptor C-kit.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in KIT cause the piebald trait that is characterized by depigmentation of the ventral chest and abdomen, white fareflock of hair, deafness, and constipation (Fleischman et al., 1991Fleischman R.A. Saltman D.L. Stastny V. Zneimer S. Deletion of the c-kit protooncogene in the human developmental defect piebald trait.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 10885-10889Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A variety of gain-of-function mutations in KIT were found in different types of human cancers. Activating KIT mutations were found in gastro-intestinal-stromal tumors (GIST), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and mast cell leukemia (MCL), among other cancers. Mutations were identified in the membrane-proximal Ig-like domain (D5) (exons 8 and 9), in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (exon 11), and in the tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain (exon 17) (reviewed in Forbes et al., 2006Forbes S. Clements J. Dawson E. Bamford S. Webb T. Dogan A. Flanagan A. Teague J. Wooster R. Futreal P.A. Stgratton M.R. COSMIC 2005.Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). While there is good evidence that the gain-of-function mutations in the JM and the PTK domains lead to constitutive activation of KIT, by relieving autoinhibitory constraints (Mol et al., 2004Mol C.D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31655-31663Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism underlying the gain-of-function mutations in D5 of the ectodomain is not understood. In this report we describe the crystal structures of the entire ectodomain of KIT in both monomeric and SCF-induced homodimeric (SCF-KIT 2:2 complex) forms. Detailed views of the unoccupied monomeric form at 3.0 Å resolution and SCF-induced homodimeric form at 3.5 Å resolution provide novel insights concerning the activation mechanism of KIT and other RTKs. The entire ectodomain of KIT composed of five Ig-like domains designated D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Purified KIT ectodomain monomers or SCF-induced KIT ectodomain homodimers (SCF-KIT 2:2 complex) were each subjected to extensive screening for crystal growth and optimization followed by determination of their crystal structures (Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Experimental Procedures available with this article online). KIT ectodomain shows an elongated serpentine shape with approximate dimensions of 170 × 60 × 50 Å (Figure 1A). D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 domains of KIT exhibit a typical immunoglobulin super family (IgSF) fold, composed of eight β strands, designated ABCC′DEFG, assembled into a β sandwich consisting of two antiparallel β sheets (Figure 1A). D1, D2, D3, and D5 each contain a conserved disulfide bond connecting cysteine residues at B5 and F5 (Fifth amino acids of strand B and F, respectively), positions that bridge the two β sheets to form the center of the hydrophobic core of the Ig-like fold (Harpaz and Chothia, 1994Harpaz Y. Chothia C. Many of the immunoglobulin superfamily domains in cell adhesion molecules and surface receptors belong to a new structural set which is close to that containing variable domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). D2 and D5 contain two disulfide bonds and D4 does not contain any cysteine residue; nevertheless, the integrity of the Ig-like fold of D4 is maintained even though the conserved cysteine residues at B5 and F5 are replaced by a valine and phenylalanine residues, respectively. The angle between D1 and D2 along the axis of the two domains is 76° (Figures 1A and 1B), resembling the orientation between the first and second Ig-like domains of the interleukin-1β receptor (Vigers et al., 1997Vigers G.P. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Crystal Structure of type-I Interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1βeta.Nature. 1997; 386: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, the angle between D2 and D3 is 150°, between D3 and D4 is 119°, and between D4 and D5 is 162°. The orientation between the ABED and A′GFC β sheets for the different Ig-like domains are ∼180° for D1-D2, ∼180° for D2-D3, ∼90° for D3-D4, and ∼180° for D4-D5 (Figure 1). The superposition of all five Ig-like domains of KIT ectodomain with telokin (Holden et al., 1992Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Raymond I. X-ray structure determination of telokin, the C-terminal domain of myosin light chain kinase, at 2.8Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) used as a standard for Ig-folds reveals root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) of 1.5–2.9 Å for equivalent Cα atoms. D2 is the most divergent among the five KIT Ig-like domains (Figure S1) as revealed by its higher rmsd values when superimposed with telokin. Based on structural conservation of key amino acids in Ig-like domains and their secondary structural topology (Harpaz and Chothia, 1994Harpaz Y. Chothia C.

Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar, Halaby et al., 1999Halaby D.M. Poupon A. Mornon J. The immunoglobulin fold family: sequence analysis and 3D structure comparisons.Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 563-571Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), D1, D2, D3, and D4 belong to the I-subset and D5 is related to the C2 and IgCAM subsets of IgSF (see Supplemental Data). Furthermore, among the structurally conserved 20 finger-print residues of IgSF (Harpaz and Chothia, 1994Harpaz Y. Chothia C. Many of the immunoglobulin superfamily domains in cell adhesion molecules and surface receptors belong to a new structural set which is close to that containing variable domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar), 10–14 residues are conserved in the five Ig-like domains of KIT (Table S1). The interdomain interactions between the five Ig-like domains of KIT are responsible for maintaining the overall topology of KIT ectodomain monomers (Figure 1). The orientation of D1 relative to D2 is determined by the extensive buried surface area that is caused by the numerous interactions between the two Ig-like domains (Figure 1B). The buried surface area of 1240 Å2 in the D1-D2 interface is much larger than the buried surface areas of most inter Ig-like domain interfaces of rod-like multidomain IgSF structures (Su et al., 1998Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of hemolin: a horseshoe shape with implications for homophilic adhesion.Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) including the three other inter Ig-like interfaces in the KIT ectodomain that range between 500 and 800 Å2. This interface is formed primarily by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between strands A′ and G, loops EF and CC′ of D1 with the N-terminal region of strand A, the C-terminal end of strand B, and loops BC and DE of D2 (Figure 1B and Supplemental Data). Moreover, many residues in the D1-D2 interface including amino acids from strands G of D1, the linker region connecting D1 and D2, and the BC loop of D2 are conserved in KIT from different species (Figure 1B). The buried surface area of the D2-D3 interface is approximately 780 Å2. The D2-D3 interface is composed of a small hydrophobic patch surrounded by two electrostatic interactions. This interface is formed by interaction between the EF loop of D2 and the DE loop of D3 and interactions between the D2-D3 linker region and the FG and BC loops of D3 (Figure 1C and Supplemental Data). The buried surface area of the D3-D4 interface is approximately 570 A2. D3 and D4 interact primarily through strands A′ and G of D3 with the BC and DE loops of D4 (Figure 1D and Supplemental Data). The length of the D3-D4 interface is approximately 20 Å due to the angular arrangement of D4 relative to D3 with an angle of 119° along the long axis of the two Ig-like domains. The D4-D5 interface forms a buried surface area of 760 Å2, mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions (Figure 1E). The interface is formed by interactions between strands A, G, and F of D4, with the BC and DE loops of D5, as well as with the D4-D5 linker region (Figure 1E and Supplemental Data). The structure of SCF-KIT complex shows 2:2 stoichiometry, in which two sets of 1:1 complexes in the asymmetric unit are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2). The observed SCF-KIT 2:2 complex in the crystal lattice is consistent with experiments demonstrating that KIT dimerization is driven by the dimeric SCF ligand (Philo et al., 1996Philo J.S. Wen J. Wypych J. Schwartz M.G. Mendiaz E.A. Langley K.E. Human stem cell factor dimer forms a complex with two molecules of the extracellular domain of its receptor, Kit.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6895-6902Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Lemmon et al., 1997Lemmon M.A. Pinchasi D. Zhou M. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kit receptor dimerization is driven by bivalent binding of stem cell factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6311-6317Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The two sets of KIT ectodomains and SCF molecules resemble an upside down “A” letter with approximate dimensions of 170 × 130 × 70 Å (Figure 2A and Figure S2). The overall structure of SCF bound to KIT is similar to the previously described structures of free SCF (Zhang et al., 2000Zhang Z. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Schlessinger J. Kong X.P. Crystal structure of human stem cell factor: implication for stem cell factor receptor dimerization and activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7732-7737Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Jiang et al., 2000Jiang X. Gurel O. Mendiaz E.A. Stearns G.W. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Osslund T.D. Syed R.S. Langley K.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the active core of human stem cell factor and analysis of binding to its receptor kit.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3192-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure of SCF-KIT 2:2 complex shows that an individual SCF protomer binds directly to D1, D2, and D3 of an individual KIT protomer (Figure 2B). Consequently, a single-receptor protomer forms a symmetric complex with a similar 2-fold related surface on an SCF protomer. Dimerization of KIT is also mediated by homotypic interactions between the two membrane-proximal Ig-like domains of KIT, namely by D4-D4 and D5-D5 interactions (Figure 2B). This results in dramatically altered configurations of D4 and D5 relative to the rest of the molecule, and these configurations bring the C termini within 15 Å of each other close to the place where they connect to the transmembrane domain (Figures 2B and S2). The structure is also characterized by the existence of a large cavity at the center of the complex with dimensions of ∼50 × 50 × 15 Å (Figure 2B). The crystal structure demonstrates that each protomer of SCF binds exclusively to a single KIT molecule and that receptor dimerization is driven by SCF dimers that facilitate additional receptor-receptor interactions. SCF is bound to a concave surface formed by D1, D2, and D3 of KIT in a configuration in which the four-helix bundle of SCF is oriented perpendicularly to the long axis of D1, D2, and D3 and the C termini of SCF and KIT are facing opposite directions (Figure 2, Figure 3, and S2). The solvent-accessible surface area buried at the interface between KIT and each SCF protomer is approximately 2060 Å2, a buried surface area that is within the range of known ligand-receptor interfaces. It is possible to divide the SCF-KIT interface into three binding sites (Figures 3A and 3B and Table S2). Site I is located in D1, site II is located in D2 and in the D2-D3 linker region, and site III is located in D3. The buried surface areas of sites I, II, and III are approximately 280, 770, and 1010 Å2, respectively. The αC-β2 loop of SCF is aligned perpendicularly to strand C′ of D1, as presented in Figure 3C. Asp72, Glu73, and Thr74 of D1 and Lys99′, Ser101′, and Phe102′ of SCF are closely located at a Cα distance of 6–8 Å, indicating that these residues could participate in the interactions between D1 and SCF. Due to poor side-chain electron density of the αC-β2 loop, specific interactions could not be defined. SCF binding is mediated, for the most part, by complimentary electrostatic interactions of charged surfaces on KIT (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3D). Salt bridges are formed between the basic amino acids Arg122, Arg181, Lys203, and Arg205 of KIT with the acidic amino acids Asp54′, Asp77′, Asp84′, and Glu88′ on SCF. The conformation of Arg122 is stabilized by the salt bridge between Glu198 of KIT and Asp54′ of SCF. Figure 3D shows that three of the major interacting residues, Tyr125, Arg181, and Lys203, on D2 are aligned on the same plane and form hydrogen bonds with Asp77′, Asn81′, Asp84′, Ser53′, and Thr57′ of αB and αC of SCF. The van-der-Waals contacts between Ser123 and Ile201 of D2 and Val50′ and Thr57′ of SCF also contribute to the formation of a ligand-receptor complex. However, there are notable differences in residues of site II in KIT and SCF from other species (Figures 3, S1, and S3). While Arg181 and Lys203 are invariant as basic amino acids in mammals, Tyr125 is substituted by a phenylalanine in mouse and rat, which most likely results in loss of a hydrogen bond. Arg205 of KIT is a highly conserved amino acid while Glu88′ is substituted for by leucine and alanine residues in mouse and rat, respectively. Furthermore, Arg122 of KIT and Asp54′ of SCF in human are substituted by a leucine or valine in mouse and rat, respectively. These substitutions may account for the reduced affinity of rodent SCF toward human KIT (Lev et al., 1992Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. Dimerization and activation of the kit receptor by monovalent and bivalent binding of the stem cell factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The N-terminal segment of SCF interacts with strand D of D3 (Figures 3A and 3E). Hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain of Asn10′ of SCF and the main-chain amide and carbonyl group of Ser261, as well as with the side chain of Asp260 and Trp262 on D3. In addition, Thr9′ and Asn11′of SCF bind to the side-chain and main-chain amides of Ser261 and His263 of KIT, respectively. Mutational analysis of SCF has shown that replacement of Asn10′ with alanine or glutamic-acid residues reduces the binding affinity of SCF toward KIT by approximately 10-fold and that Asn10′ (or Asp in other species) is necessary for biological activity (Hsu et al., 1998Hsu Y.R. Chang W.C. Mendiaz E.A. Hara S. Chow D.T. Mann M.B. Langley K.E. Lu H.S. Selective deamidation of recombinant human stem cell factor during in vitro aging: isolation and characterization of the aspartyl and isoaspartyl homodimers and heterodimers.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2251-2262Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Comparison of the receptor-binding interface in SCF from different species shows that Asn10′ (or Asp) is a highly conserved residue (Figure S1). Additional important interactions are mediated by Asn6′ and Arg7′ of SCF via van-der-Waals contacts with Tyr259, Thr269, Ser240, Val242, Ser241, and Ser244 on D3 of KIT. Superimposition of the structures of individual D1, D2, and D3 of KIT monomeric form with corresponding structures of the SCF-induced homodimeric form reveals rmsd values of 0.5, 0.8, and 1.1 Å for 82, 92, and 100 aligned Cα residues in D1, D2, and D3, respectively. Similarly, superimposition of the structure of the entire D1-D2-D3 region of KIT monomers with the corresponding structures in the SCF-KIT 2:2 complex reveals an rmsd of 1.1 Å for 274 aligned Cα residues of the D1-D2-D3 region. Remarkably, there are no significant backbone changes in the structures of the SCF-binding pocket of KIT (Figures 3 and S4). However, several minor structural changes were detected in the SCF-binding cleft upon SCF binding. A structural change is seen in the top half of strands G, F, and C (amino acids 167–187 and 143–166) of D2 following SCF binding (Figures 1A and 2A). These strands are located at the side opposite to the SCF-binding interface and are not involved in mediating any direct contacts with SCF. Overall, comparison of the structures of KIT monomers to those of SCF-occupied KIT dimers show that the D1-D2-D3 region of KIT may be viewed as a functional unit that is poised for SCF binding followed by subsequent KIT dimerization driven by dimeric SCF molecules. While the overall structure of SCF bound to KIT is similar to the structure of free SCF, there are notable differences in the angle between the two protomers, in the conformations of the connecting loops, and in the structures of the flexible N terminus of the molecule (Figure 4). Comparison of the published structures of SCF dimers (entries 1EXZ and 1SCF in the Protein Data Bank [PDB]) shows that the angle between the two protomers (the angles between αC helices) of free SCF homodimers may vary by 2° to 6° in the different structures, suggesting that a certain degree of flexibility exists in the SCF dimer. The range of differences in the angles between KIT-bound SCF protomers to those of free SCF was increased by 3°–9°. Figure 4 shows a KIT-bound SCF structure in which the angle between SCF protomers is increased by 5°. Interestingly, it was shown that the flexibility of the cytokine activin plays a role in the assembly of TGF-β receptors (Greenwald et al., 2004Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H. Choe S. A flexible activin explains the membran-dependent cooperative assembly of TGF-β family receptors.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 485-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Figure 4B shows that the N terminus of free SCF from Cys4′ to Asn11′ has a random-coil configuration (Zhang et al., 2000Zhang Z. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Schlessinger J. Kong X.P. Crystal structure of human stem cell factor: implication for stem cell factor receptor dimerization and activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7732-7737Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was also shown that deletion of the first four amino acids leads to approximately 25% reduction in the binding affinity of SCF to KIT, suggesting that the disulfide bridge between Cys4′ and Cys89′ plays a role in maintaining the functional integrity of SCF (Langley et al., 1994Langley K.E. Mendiaz E.A. Liu N. Narhi L.O. Zeni L. Parseghian C.M. Clogston C.L. Leslie I. Pope J.A. Lu H.S. et al.Properties of variant forms of human stem cell factor recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Figure 4B also shows that Thr9′ and Asn10′ of the N terminus region of SCF bound to KIT undergo a conformational change in which their Cα positions become displaced by 3 to 5 Å upon receptor binding (Figure 4B). The disulfide bridge between Cys4′ at the N terminus and Cys89′ at the αC helix appears to play an important role in mediating the conformational change that takes place in the N terminus of SCF. The position of Cys24′ in free SCF is not altered upon receptor occupancy as revealed by an rmsd of 1.2 Å of Cα positions. Finally, The αC-β2 loop of free SCF is either disordered or has a different structure from the structure of the αC-β2 loop in SCF bound to KIT. Figure 4C shows that the αC-β2 loop of SCF undergoes a large conformational change upon receptor binding, a change critical for establishment of site I of the SCF-KIT interface. Superimposition of the structures of individual D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 of KIT monomeric form with corresponding individual Ig-like domains in the SCF-induced homodimeric form reveals minor changes in the structure of KIT Ig-like domains following SCF binding. By contrast, superimposition of the D3-D4-D5 region of KIT monomeric form with the corresponding region in the homodimeric form reveals a large structural change in the orientation of D4 and D5 relative to each other and relative to the ligand-binding region of KIT (Figures 5A and S5). Each of the individual domains D3, D4, and D5 of monomeric KIT can be superimposed with their counterparts in the SCF-occupied KIT with rmsd values of 0.9, 0.9, and 1.9 Å for 98, 101, and 85 Cα atoms of D3, D4, and D5, respectively. However, superimposition of D3 structure of KIT monomers with D3 structure in ligand-occupied homodimeric form reveals a dramatic movement in the orientation of D4 and D5 in SCF-bound KIT (Figure 5A). The reorientations of D4 and D5 relative to the ligand-binding region occurs by a rotation along an axis in the linker connecting D3 to D4 and a rotation along an axis in the linker connecting D4 to D5 running through the D3-D4 and D4-D5 interfaces (Figure 5A), respectively. Comparison of the free and ligand-bound KIT shows that D4 of ligand-occupied KIT rotates relative to D3 by 22°, and D5 of ligand-occupied KIT rotates relative to D4 by 27° (Figure 5A). The rearrangements of D4 and D5 in SCF-occupied KIT result in receptor-receptor interactions that are mediated by D4-D4 and D5-D5 interactions of two neighboring KIT molecules (Figure 5B). The conformation of the DE loop of D5 is altered in SCF-occupied ectodomain. Reorientation of D4 and D5 driven by receptor dimerization imposes upon the DE loop of D5 a new configuration (Figure 5A). Homotypic interactions between D4 of two neighboring KIT molecules are mediated by the D4-D4 interface in the SCF-KIT 2:2 complex. The D4-D4 interface is mediated by two β sheets formed by the ABED strands of D4 of each KIT protomer to form a nearly planar arrangement in which Arg381 of each protomer points toward each other resulting in a buried surface area of 360 A2. Figure 6A shows that Arg381 and Glu386 form salt bridges and"

https://openalex.org/W2116471216,"Bloom's helicase (BLM) is thought to prevent crossing-over during DNA double-strand-break repair (DSBR) by disassembling double-Holliday junctions (dHJs) or by preventing their formation. We show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLM ortholog, Sgs1, prevents aberrant crossing-over during meiosis by suppressing formation of joint molecules (JMs) comprising three and four interconnected duplexes. Sgs1 and procrossover factors, Msh5 and Mlh3, are antagonistic since Sgs1 prevents dHJ formation in msh5 cells and sgs1 mutation alleviates crossover defects of both msh5 and mlh3 mutants. We propose that differential activity of Sgs1 and procrossover factors at the two DSB ends effects productive formation of dHJs and crossovers and prevents multichromatid JMs and counterproductive crossing-over. Strand invasion of different templates by both DSB ends may be a common feature of DSBR that increases repair efficiency but also the likelihood of associated crossing-over. Thus, by disrupting aberrant JMs, BLM-related helicases maximize repair efficiency while minimizing the risk of deleterious crossing-over."

To demonstrate the system's modularity and level of gene silencing, we used the switch to tightly regulate the expression of diphtheria toxin and Cre recombinase, respectively. We also used the switch to tune the expression of a proapoptotic gene and show that a threshold expression level is required to induce apoptosis.

The induction of mGluR-LTD is well characterized, whereas the mechanisms underlying its expression remain largely elusive. mGluR-LTD in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) efficiently reverses cocaine-induced strengthening of excitatory inputs onto dopamine neurons. We show that mGluR-LTD is expressed by an exchange of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors for GluR2-containing receptors with a lower single-channel conductance. The synaptic insertion of GluR2 depends on de novo protein synthesis via rapid messenger RNA translation of GluR2. Regulated synthesis of GluR2 in the VTA is therefore required to reverse cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2126354256,"Regulation of mammalian mtDNA gene expression is critical for altering oxidative phosphorylation capacity in response to physiological demands and disease processes. The basal machinery for initiation of mtDNA transcription has been molecularly defined, but the mechanisms regulating its activity are poorly understood. In this study, we show that MTERF3 is a negative regulator of mtDNA transcription initiation. The MTERF3 gene is essential because homozygous knockout mouse embryos die in midgestation. Tissue-specific inactivation of MTERF3 in the heart causes aberrant mtDNA transcription and severe respiratory chain deficiency. MTERF3 binds the mtDNA promoter region and depletion of MTERF3 increases transcription initiation on both mtDNA strands. This increased transcription initiation leads to decreased expression of critical promoter-distal tRNA genes, which is possibly explained by transcriptional collision on the circular mtDNA molecule. To our knowledge, MTERF3 is the first example of a mitochondrial protein that acts as a specific repressor of mammalian mtDNA transcription initiation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2102217018,"Human X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) is an alternatively spliced transcription factor that participates in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress-signaling pathway that allows cells to survive the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. We have previously demonstrated that XBP1 expression is increased in antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cell lines and is coexpressed with estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in breast tumors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of XBP1 and the UPR in estrogen and antiestrogen responsiveness in breast cancer. Overexpression of spliced XBP1 [XBP1(S)] in ER-positive breast cancer cells leads to estrogen-independent growth and reduced sensitivity to growth inhibition induced by the antiestrogens Tamoxifen and Faslodex in a manner independent of functional p53. Data from gene expression microarray analyses imply that XBP1(S) acts through regulation of the expression of ER, the antiapoptotic gene BCL2, and several other genes associated with control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Testing this hypothesis, we show that overexpression of XBP1(S) prevents cell cycle arrest and antiestrogen-induced cell death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. XBP1 and/or the UPR may be a useful molecular target for the development of novel predictive and therapeutic strategies in breast cancer."

The mechanisms involved in the differential regulation of these highly homologous proteins are unknown. We present evidence that Pax3, but not Pax7, is regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation during adult muscle stem cell activation. Intriguingly, only monoubiquitinated forms of Pax3 could be detected. Mutation of two specific lysine residues in the C-terminal region of Pax3 reduced the extent of its monoubiquitination and susceptibility to proteasomal degradation, whereas introduction of a key lysine into the C-terminal region of Pax7 rendered that protein susceptible to monoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Monoubiquitinated Pax3 was shuttled to the intrinsic proteasomal protein S5a by interacting specifically with the ubiquitin-binding protein Rad23B. Functionally, sustained expression of Pax3 proteins inhibited myogenic differentiation, demonstrating that Pax3 degradation is an essential step for the progression of the myogenic program. These results reveal an important mechanism of Pax3 regulation in muscle progenitors and an unrecognized role of protein monoubiquitination in mediating proteasomal degradation.

Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C.

Vogan K. Gros P. Park M. Expression of the met receptor tyrosine kinase in muscle progenitor cells in somites and limbs is absent in Splotch mice.Development. 1996; 122: 2163-2171Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that Pax3 and its close homolog, Pax7, are expressed in a population of myogenic precursor cells that give rise to a population of adult muscle stem cells (Gros et al., 2005Gros J.

Mansouri A. Buckingham M. A Pax3/Pax7-dependent population of skeletal muscle progenitor cells.Nature. 2005; 435: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells that fail to express Pax3 or Pax7 die or switch to another cell fate (Relaix et al., 2005Relaix F. Rocancourt D. Mansouri A. Buckingham M. A Pax3/Pax7-dependent population of skeletal muscle progenitor cells.Nature. 2005; 435: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In postnatal myogenesis, Pax3 is transiently expressed during muscle stem cell (“satellite cell”) activation in a highly proliferative intermediate progenitor cell population (Conboy and Rando, 2002Conboy I.M. Rando T.A. The regulation of Notch signaling controls satellite cell activation and cell fate determination in postnatal myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The association of enhanced Pax3 activity with a highly proliferative state is consistent with aberrant Pax3 expression with tumors bearing skeletal muscle characteristics (Barr, 2001Barr F.G. Gene fusions involving PAX and FOX family members in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In humans, a severe form of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is due to a chromosomal translocation t(2; 13) that results in a fusion between the Pax3 gene and the forkhead (FKHR) gene and the generation of a Pax3FKHR fusion protein. This protein consists of the DNA-binding domains of Pax3 fused to the transcription activation domain of FKHR. Pax3FKHR is a powerful gain-of-function mutation (Bennicelli et al., 1999Bennicelli J.L. Advani S. Schafer B.W. Barr F.G. PAX3 and PAX7 exhibit conserved cis-acting transcription repression domains and utilize a common gain of function mechanism in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4348-4356Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is thought to exert its role in ARMS through aberrant regulation of Pax3 target genes (Barr, 2001Barr F.G. Gene fusions involving PAX and FOX family members in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It is clear that normal muscle development and postnatal myogenesis depend on the timely and coordinated expression of Pax3 and Pax7. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of Pax3 and Pax7 at the protein level, based on evidence of differential responses to inhibition of proteasomal activity. The data presented support the hypothesis that the levels of Pax3, but not Pax7, are regulated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In addition, the results suggest a unique mechanism of proteasomal degradation involving protein monoubiquitination. Pax3 protein and transcript were expressed transiently during satellite cell activation (Figures 1A–1C), consistent with previous findings (Conboy and Rando, 2002Conboy I.M. Rando T.A. The regulation of Notch signaling controls satellite cell activation and cell fate determination in postnatal myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The percentage of Pax3+ myogenic progenitors was almost zero initially but increased rapidly, peaking around day 3 (Figures 1A and 1B), thus paralleling the appearance of intermediate progenitor cells (Conboy and Rando, 2002Conboy I.M. Rando T.A. The regulation of Notch signaling controls satellite cell activation and cell fate determination in postnatal myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Pax3 protein then declined to undetectable levels as progenitor cells proliferated and progressed along the myogenic lineage pathway (Figure 1A). In established myoblast cultures, Pax3+ cells were rare (Figure 1A). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that Pax3 transcript was nearly undetectable in quiescent satellite cells from hindlimb muscle but was highly induced during satellite cell activation, peaking around day 3. Transcript levels then declined but were maintained at intermediate levels thereafter, even as protein levels declined further (Figures 1A and 1C). Only when myogenic progenitors were induced to differentiate did the levels of Pax3 transcript fall to undetectable levels (Figure 1C). Clearly, a marked discrepancy exists between the levels of Pax3 mRNA and protein during the late stages of the myogenic program, suggesting that Pax3 protein level is regulated posttranscriptionally. To test for the role of protein degradation in regulating levels of Pax3, we treated cultures of activated satellite cells with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. This resulted in a more than 3-fold increase in the percentage of Pax3+ cells (Figure 1D). Likewise, treatment of myoblast cultures with MG132 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Pax3 protein level but no change in the level of Pax7 (Figure 1E). These results suggest that the decline in Pax3 protein levels during myogenic lineage progression, when Pax7 levels are maintained, is due to selective degradation of Pax3 by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). To confirm that the degradation of Pax3 was due to the UPS, we used the ts20b cell line, which carries a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1 (Chowdary et al., 1994Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Accumulation of p53 in a mutant cell line defective in the ubiquitin pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Pax3 levels were stable at a nonpermissive temperature but declined at a permissive temperature (Figure S1). The control cell line (H38-5) demonstrated Pax3 degradation regardless of the temperature (Figure S1). These data show that Pax3 degradation requires a functional UPS. To test directly if Pax3 is susceptible to proteasomal degradation, we used a cell-free ubiquitination/proteasome degradation assay (Bloom et al., 2003Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Proteasome-mediated degradation of p21 via N-terminal ubiquitinylation.Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Under a standard condition in which p21CIP1 that was used as a positive control (Bloom et al., 2003Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Proteasome-mediated degradation of p21 via N-terminal ubiquitinylation.Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was rapidly degraded (Figure S2), Pax7 was stable (Figure 2A), as predicted from the in vivo results (Figure 1E). However, in apparent contradiction of the previous results in vivo (Figures 1 and S1), Pax3 was unexpectedly stable (Figure 2A). This apparent paradox of the MG132-sensitive and E1-ligase-dependent degradation of Pax3 in vivo with its apparent stability in vitro was resolved when the in vitro assays were carried out in the presence of either methylated ubiquitin (UbMe) or mutant ubiquitin containing no lysines (UbK0), both of which allow monoubiquitination but prevent polyubiquitination (Chau et al., 1989Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. A multiubiquitin chain is confined to specific lysine in a targeted short-lived protein.Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, Hershko et al., 1991Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. Methylated ubiquitin inhibits cyclin degradation in clam embryo extracts.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Pax3, but not Pax7, underwent rapid proteasomal degradation (Figures 2B and S3A). Furthermore, this degradation was inhibited by MG132 (Figure 2B). Therefore, in vitro conditions in which protein ubiquitination is limited to monoubiquitination closely resembled the in vivo situation in which Pax3, but not Pax7, was susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation. These findings suggest that one or more components of the assay system that are responsible for ubiquitination and/or degradation of Pax3 may themselves undergo polyubiquitination and degradation in the presence of wild-type (WT) ubiquitin. These results also suggest that a monoubiquitinated form of Pax3 may be susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation, contrary to the canonical views of the consequences of protein monoubiquitination and the necessity of proteins to be polyubiquitinated to be susceptible to proteasomal degradation. To examine Pax3 ubiquitination patterns, we sought to uncouple ubiquitination from proteasomal degradation. We included MG132 throughout the experiment in order to allow ubiquitination to progress but prevent any proteasomal degradation. Under those conditions, Pax3 was monoubiquitinated whether the reaction was carried out in the presence of UbK0 (as expected) or WT ubiquitin (Ub) (Figure 2C). These assay conditions resulted in polyubiquitination of p21CIP1 in the presence of Ub, showing that all components necessary for polyubiquitination were present (Figure 2C). Even after purification by Nickel-agarose beads to pull down all ubiquitinated forms of Pax3, only a monoubiquitinated Pax3 was apparent (Figure S4). We then tested directly our hypothesis that a component of the assay system is both responsible for Pax3 ubiquitination and itself susceptible to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We tested this by comparing Pax3 ubiquitination under two conditions. First, we pretreated the ubiquitin ligase fraction with Ub but in the absence of MG132, thus allowing for degradation of any polyubiquitinated proteins generated. Then, for comparison, we pretreated the ubiquitin ligase fraction with UbK0 to prevent any polyubiquitination of assay components that might then be degraded by the 26S proteasome. Under these two conditions, subsequent addition of Pax3 protein (in the presence of MG132 to prevent degradation of ubiquitinated Pax3) revealed that Pax3 monoubiquitination was enhanced when the reaction components were protected by UbK0 compared to that seen when the ubiquitin ligase fraction was pretreated with Ub (Figure 2D). Furthermore, when reactions were carried out under conditions that permitted the formation of only monoubiquitinated Pax3 but allowed for proteasomal degradation, there was a rapid decline in Pax3 levels (Figure 2E). These results again suggest that our in vitro assay most closely parallels the in vivo conditions when components of the in vitro assay are protected against polyubiquitination and degradation. Together, the results strongly suggest that Pax3 undergoes primarily, if not exclusively, monoubiquitination and that, surprisingly, the monoubiquitinated form of Pax3 is the form targeted for proteasomal degradation. To study further the ubiquitination of Pax3, we sought to identify the lysines in the protein that were targets for ubiquitination. Our first clues came from differential susceptibilities to proteasomal degradation of proteins with high homology to Pax3. We compared stabilities of Pax3, Pax7, and Pax3FKHR in pulse-chase experiments in myoblasts (Figure 3A). In Pax3FKHR, the C-terminal region of Pax3 is replaced by the C-terminal region of FKHR. While Pax3 degradation was inhibited by MG132, Pax3FKHR protein stability was not affected by the inhibitor, consistent with the resistance of Pax3FKHR to degradation in the cell-free assay even in the presence of UbMe (Figure S3B). Since FKHR itself does not confer protein stability (Matsuzaki et al., 2003Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Tanaka K. Fukamizu A. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of FKHR (Foxo1) targets to proteasomal degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11285-11290Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar), this result suggests that the region of Pax3 missing from the fusion protein may contain an important ubiquitination site required for the degradation of Pax3. Pax7 was not susceptible to proteasomal degradation in these pulse-chase experiments (Figure 3A). We thus focused our attention on lysines in the C-terminal region of Pax3 (Figure 3B). Within this region, there is one lysine (lysine 475) specific to Pax3 and another (lysine 437) present in both Pax3 and Pax7 (Figure 3B). Replacement of lysine 475 with arginine (mutant termed Pax3SM) dramatically reduced the degradation of Pax3 in myoblasts (Figure 3C). A double mutant (Pax3DM) in which both lysine 475 and lysine 437 were replaced by arginines stabilized Pax3 even further (Figure 3C). These results suggest that these two lysines are important for the ubiquitination of Pax3 and for its subsequent degradation, even though lysine 437 does not render Pax7 susceptible to these processes. Since Pax3 protein became more stable by the mutation of lysines 475 and 437, we assessed the ubiquitination status of Pax3, Pax3SM, and Pax3DM in myoblasts. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated Pax3 proteins was conducted with an antibody (FK-1) that recognizes only polyubiquitinated proteins or an antibody (FK-2) that recognizes both mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins (Fujimuro et al., 1994Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific to multi-ubiquitin chains of polyubiquitinated proteins.FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). No polyubiquitinated conjugates of any of these proteins were detected with FK-1 (Figure 4A). With FK-2, bands corresponding in molecular weight to monoubiquitinated conjugates of each protein were observed. There was less monoubiquitinated Pax3SM than monoubiquitinated Pax3, and still less monoubiquitinated Pax3DM (Figure 4A). Therefore, mutating these specific C-terminal lysine residues did not abrogate completely the ubiquitination of Pax3, but the relative resistance of the proteins to monoubiquitination paralleled their relative stabilities (compare Figures 4A and 3C). To assess quantitatively the level of monoubiquitination of the immunoprecipitated protein, lysates were subjected to Nickel-agarose pull-down to purify ubiquitinated proteins using a histidine-tagged ubiquitin. Immunoblotting of purified proteins revealed single bands corresponding to monoubiquitinated conjugates (Figure 4B). By contrast, identical analysis of p21CIP1 revealed multiple, high-molecular-weight polyubiquitinated conjugates (Figures S5A and S5B). Quantitation of the level of monoubiquitination of the different forms of Pax3 again showed that Pax3SM was monoubiquitinated to a lesser extent than was Pax3, and that Pax3DM was monoubiquitinated even less (Figure 4B). As a test of the sufficiency of monoubiquitination to drive Pax3 degradation, the stability of each of the Pax3 mutants was assessed when expressed as fusion proteins with UbK0, a modification that does not render protein susceptible to proteasomal degradation nonspecifically (Li et al., 2003Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Mono- versus polyubiquitination: differential control of p53 fate by Mdm2.Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Both Pax3SM-UbK0 and Pax3DM-UbK0 were much more susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation than were the unconjugated forms (Figure 4C), supporting the hypothesis that monoubiquitination is sufficient to mediate the degradation of Pax3 proteins. To examine further whether the difference of a single lysine residue was sufficient to explain the observed differences between Pax3 and Pax7, we introduced a lysine into Pax7 at the residue corresponding to lysine 475 in Pax3 to generate a Pax7A468K mutant (Figure 4D). Unlike WT Pax7, Pax7A468K was susceptible to proteasomal degradation with similar kinetics as seen for Pax3 (Figure 4E). Furthermore, analysis of the ubiquitination status of Pax7A468K revealed that the protein, like Pax3, became monoubiquitinated in vivo (Figure 4F). These results confirm that lysine 475 is a key residue that distinguishes Pax3 from Pax7 and underline differences in these two otherwise highly homologous proteins in terms of protein stability. Proteasomal degradation generally requires polymeric chains of at least four ubiquitins to allow recognition of the substrate by the proteasome through an array of ubiquitin receptor proteins such as the intrinsic receptor S5a (Thrower et al., 2000Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar) or substrate receptors such as Rad23 (Elsasser and Finley, 2005Elsasser S. Finley D. Delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to protein-unfolding machines.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which monoubiquitinated Pax3 is recognized by the proteasome, we first tested for an association between S5a and Pax3 using a pull-down assay, again using p21CIP1 as a positive control (Figure S6). We were able to pull down Pax3 with S5a protein (Figure 5A). Identical studies with the Pax3 mutants, Pax3SM and Pax3DM, revealed that the relative levels of these proteins that could be pulled down with S5a directly correlated with their respective levels of monoubiquitination and protein degradation (Figures 3C, 4A, and 4B). Since S5a binds selectively to polyubiquitinated proteins (Deveraux et al., 1994Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. A 26 S protease subunit that binds ubiquitin conjugates.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Young et al., 1998Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. Characterization of two polyubiquitin binding sites in the 26 S protease subunit 5a.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), we looked for a protein that could bridge S5a and monoubiquitinated Pax3. Given the ability of members of the Rad23 family both to bind monoubiquitin and to shuttle ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome (Bertolaet et al., 2001Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. UBA domains of DNA damage-inducible proteins interact with ubiquitin.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar, Wilkinson et al., 2001Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Proteins containing the UBA domain are able to bind to multi-ubiquitin chains.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar), we tested members of this family as potential mediators of the association of monoubiquitinated Pax3 with S5a. Consistent with previous studies (Hiyama et al., 1999Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Interaction of hHR23 with S5a. The ubiquitin-like domain of hHR23 mediates interaction with S5a subunit of 26 S proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), Rad23A and Rad23B were pulled down with S5a protein (Figure 5A). Interestingly, the amounts of Rad23B, but not Rad23A, that were detected declined in parallel with the amount of Pax3 protein pulled down (Figure 5A), suggesting an obligate Pax3 Rad23B binding for association with the proteasome. We also determined whether Pax3 could be pulled down with the ubiquitin-association domain 2 (UBA2) of Rad23B. The relative amount of Pax3 proteins pulled down using the Rad23B UBA2 domain was in the order Pax3 > Pax3SM > Pax3DM (Figure 5B). These data further support a model of Pax3 being targeted to the proteasome by interactions with Rad23B. We produced recombinant Pax3 and Pax3-Ub proteins and performed in vitro binding assays in order to test the binding between forms of Pax3 and proteins containing UBA domains. Neither Pax3 nor Pax3-Ub bound directly to either S5a or Rad23A, but Pax3-Ub bound to Rad23B (Figure 5C). In addition, Pax3 bound weakly and Pax3-Ub bound strongly to the UBA2 domain of Rad23B (Figure 5C), suggesting that the Rad23B Pax3 interface involves not only the ubiquitin moiety but also the Pax3 protein itself. These data demonstrate the importance and specificity of Rad23B for the interaction of monoubiquitinated Pax3 with the proteasome. As an independent test of the hypothesis that the monoubiquitinated form of Pax3 is the primary form that is targeted to the proteasome, we transfected myoblasts with a Pax3 expression construct, performed immunoprecipitation of Pax3 after S5a pull-down, and analyzed the ubiquitination status of the immunoprecipitated Pax3 protein. In cell extracts, a small fraction of the protein was monoubiquitinated and, again, no polyubiquitination could be detected (Figure 5D). However, if that extract was first subjected to S5a pull-down, then virtually all of the immunoprecipitated Pax3 was monoubiquitinated (Figure 5D). Therefore, Pax3 proteins that bind to the proteasome are monoubiquitinated, further suggesting that monoubiquitination of Pax3 is required for its degradation by the proteasome. Since S5a exists in both proteasome-bound and free forms (van Nocker et al., 1996van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. The multiubiquitin-chain-binding protein Mcb1 is a component of the 26S proteasome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plays a nonessential, substrate-specific role in protein turnover.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the Pax3/Rad23B/S5a complex could be copurified with the 26S proteasome. After transfecting myoblasts with Pax3 constructs, we immunoprecipitated the proteasome using a polyclonal antibody directed against the “core” 20S proteasome subunits. Rad23B coprecipitated with the proteasome core, with higher levels associated with the proteasome in Pax3-transfected cells compared to controls (Figure 5E). In addition, only one form of Pax3 could be detected in association with the proteasome, and this form corresponded to monoubiquitinated Pax3 by molecular weight. These results demonstrate the presence of the trimeric protein complex of S5a/Rad23B/Pax3-Ub in a proteasomal context. To further test the importance of Rad23B for the association of Pax3 with the proteasome, we assessed the binding of Pax3 to S5a in cells with aberrant patterns of expression of Rad23 isoforms. For these studies, we used WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or MEFS deficient in Rad23A, Rad23B, or both isoforms (“double knockout” [DKO]). MEFs were transfected with Pax3 constructs, and extracts were subjected to S5a pull-down assays. Pax3 proteins could be pulled down only in cells expressing Rad23B (Figure 6A). No Pax3 was detected in the Rad23B−/− or DKO cells. In addition, when we assessed the stability of Pax3 proteins in these different cells, Pax3 was degraded only in the cells expressing Rad23B (Figure 6B). Overall, these results show that Rad23B plays an essential role in shuttling Pax3 to the proteasome to mediate its degradation. Since Pax3 is known to inhibit myogenic terminal differentiation in C2C12 (Epstein et al., 1995Epstein J.A. Lam P. Jepeal L. Maas R.L. Shapiro D.N. Pax3 inhibits myogenic differentiation of cultured myoblast cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11719-11722Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the degradation of Pax3 is important for the progression of the myogenic program beyond commitment. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of the expression for Pax3 proteins with differential susceptibility to proteasomal degradation (Pax3, Pax3SM, or Pax3DM) on the differentiation of primary myoblasts. Transfection efficiencies and the levels of expression were similar for all constructs (Figures S7A and S7B). After 48 hr, when Pax3 proteins had degraded according to their respective protein stability (Figure S7C), we induced differentiation for 24 hr. Compared to control cultures, cultures of cells expressing Pax3 proteins showed a marked delay in fusion, with the more stable forms of Pax3 (Pax3DM and Pax3SM) having the largest effect (Figure 7A). The inhibition of fusion was paralleled by a reduction in expression of markers of terminal myogenic differentiation (Figure 7B). Interestingly, when examined by immunofluorescence, the expression patterns of Myosin Heavy Chain and α-Actinin were mutually exclusive with Pax3 (Figures 7C and S7D), suggesting that the expression of Pax3 maintains myogenic progenitors in an undifferentiated state and that the degradation of Pax3 is essential for myogenic differentiation to occur. Previous results suggested that Pax3 is transiently expressed during satellite cell activation ex vivo and that Pax3 expression corresponded to a highly proliferative state of pre-myoblast cells (Conboy and Rando, 2002Conboy I.M. Rando T.A. The regulation of Notch signaling controls satellite cell activation and cell fate determination in postnatal myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). This report adds to these results by demonstrating that after the peak of protein expression, Pax3 protein level is downregulated as the cells become committed myoblasts and that a further decline is necessary for terminal myogenic differentiation, consistent with previous findings (Epstein et al., 1995Epstein J.A. Lam P. Jepeal L. Maas R.L. Shapiro D.N. Pax3 inhibits myogenic differentiation of cultured myoblast cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11719-11722Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar).

The cytoplasm constitutes a protected niche where L. monocytogenes can replicate and spread to cause systemic disease (Hamon et al., 2006Hamon M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Listeria monocytogenes: a multifaceted model.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium forms the first barrier that L. monocytogenes encounters following uptake with contaminated food. Binding of InlA, also called internalin, to E-cadherin exposed at the tip of intestinal villi initiates uptake of bacteria into epithelial cells, enabling them to breach this barrier (Gaillard et al., 1991Gaillard J.L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P.

Colonization of deeper tissues requires the related protein InlB that mediates uptake into a number of cell types including hepatocytes and endothelial cells (Braun et al., 1998Braun L. Ohayon H.

Internalin B is essential for adhesion and mediates the invasion of Listeria monocytogenes into human endothelial cells.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). InlB is a bacterial surface protein of 630 amino acids. It shares with InlA the organization of the N-terminal internalin domain comprising a Cap, a variable number of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a so-called interrepeat (IR) region (Schubert and Heinz, 2003Schubert W.D.

Structural aspects of adhesion to and invasion of host cells by the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.ChemBioChem. 2003; 4: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). A poorly characterized B-repeat is followed by three C-terminal GW domains that noncovalently anchor InlB on the surface of Listeria through interaction with lipoteichoic acid (Braun et al., 1997Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. InlB: an invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes with a novel type of surface association.Mol.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to the bacteria-bound form, a substantial fraction of InlB is released into the medium as a soluble molecule and elicits a cellular response reminiscent of that caused by hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF; Braun et al., 1997Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. InlB: an invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes with a novel type of surface association.Mol.

The Listeria monocytogenes protein InlB is an agonist of mammalian phosphoinositide 3-kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This observation contributed to the identification of the receptor tyrosine kinase Met as receptor for InlB (Shen et al., 2000Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. InIB-dependent internalization of Listeria is mediated by the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Normally, HGF/SF and Met mediate signals critical for cell survival and migration in embryogenesis and tissue regeneration, but deregulation of Met also plays a major role in tumor invasion (Birchmeier et al., 2003Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Met, metastasis, motility and more.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Two further receptors for InlB have been described, the complement receptor gC1qR (Braun et al., 2000Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. gC1q-R/p32, a C1q-binding protein, is a receptor for the InlB invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and heparan sulfate proteo-glycans (HSPGs; Jonquieres et al., 2001Jonquieres R. Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Synergy between the N- and C-terminal domains of InlB for efficient invasion of non-phagocytic cells by Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). While the exact function of gC1qR is still under debate, it is clear now that HSPGs significantly enhance InlB-induced Met signaling (Banerjee et al., 2004Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are required for potentiation of Met activation.Mol.

Internalins from the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes combine three distinct folds into a contiguous internalin domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the interaction sites for all three receptors are known. A fragment comprising Cap and LRR (InlB241; Figure 1A) is sufficient for Met binding (Shen et al., 2000Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. InIB-dependent internalization of Listeria is mediated by the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and InlB321, a fragment further comprising the IR region, is the minimal fragment capable of receptor activation (Banerjee et al., 2004Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are required for potentiation of Met activation.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Met-binding site maps to the concave face of the LRR region where several aromatic amino acids essential for interaction with Met are located (Machner et al., 2003Machner M.P. Frese S. Schubert W.D. Orian-Rousseau V. Gherardi E. Wehland J. Niemann H.H. Heinz D.W. Aromatic amino acids at the surface of InlB are essential for host cell invasion by Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to their interaction with lipoteichoic acid, the highly basic GW domains bind gC1qR and HSPGs, and binding of these receptors to the C terminus of InlB is competitive (Jonquieres et al., 2001Jonquieres R. Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Synergy between the N- and C-terminal domains of InlB for efficient invasion of non-phagocytic cells by Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Marino et al., 2002Marino M. Banerjee M. Jonquieres R. Cossart P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are SH3-like and mediate binding to host ligands.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Less is known about the six domains of the Met ectodomain that comprise some 900 amino acids (Birchmeier et al., 2003Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Met, metastasis, motility and more.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Met is produced as a 1390 amino acid single-chain precursor that is cleaved by the cellular protease furin between residues 307 and 308 to yield a disulfide-linked two-chain heterodimer (Figure 1B). The completely extracellular α chain, together with amino acids 308–514 of the β chain, forms the N-terminal semaphorin (Sema) domain. The β chain further contains a small cysteine-rich (PSI) and four immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig1–Ig4), a transmembrane helix and the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. The Sema domain, a seven-bladed β-propeller, includes the binding site for the HGF/SF β chain (Figure 1C) (Stamos et al., 2004Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. Crystal structure of the HGF beta chain in complex with the Sema domain of the Met receptor.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Two of the five domains within the HGF/SF α chain bind to Sema as well (Holmes et al., 2007Holmes O. Pillozzi S. Deakin J.A. Carafoli F. Kemp L. Butler P.J. Lyon M. Gherardi E. Insights into the Structure/Function of Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scatter Factor from Studies with Individual Domains.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Met Ig domains do not bind HGF/SF and have been proposed to act as a stalk presenting the ligand binding Sema domain (Gherardi et al., 2003Gherardi E. Youles M.E. Miguel R.N. Blundell T.L. Iamele L. Gough J. Bandyopadhyay A. Hartmann G. Butler P.J. Functional map and domain structure of MET, the product of the c-met protooncogene and receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12039-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Sema-PSI fragment in complex with the HGF/SF β chain has been determined (Stamos et al., 2004Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. Crystal structure of the HGF beta chain in complex with the Sema domain of the Met receptor.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and homology models are available for the Met Ig domains (Gherardi et al., 2003Gherardi E. Youles M.E. Miguel R.N. Blundell T.L. Iamele L. Gough J. Bandyopadhyay A. Hartmann G. Butler P.J. Functional map and domain structure of MET, the product of the c-met protooncogene and receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12039-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The InlB-binding site on Met is so far unknown, but it appears to be distinct from that for HGF/SF as no competition for binding to Met was observed (Shen et al., 2000Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. InIB-dependent internalization of Listeria is mediated by the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Here we map the InlB-binding domains of Met and report two crystal structures of a Met-InlB complex. The structures provide a detailed picture of the interaction between the two proteins and, combined with solution studies with full-length InlB, they explain the mechanism by which full-length InlB activates the Met receptor. To map the InlB-binding site on Met we used four recombinant variants of the Met ectodomain (Figures 1B and 1D) purified from conditioned medium of stably transfected, gylcosylation-deficient CHO Lec cells. In solid-phase binding assays, InlB321 did not show high-affinity binding to Met567, a construct comprising only the Sema and PSI domains (Figure 1E). In contrast, InlB321 bound with high- and virtually identical affinity to longer variants of the Met ectodomain (Met741, Met838, and Met928) that contain two, three, or four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, respectively (Figure 1F). Thus, the binding site for InlB321 is fully included in Met741 but not in Met567, implying a critical role of the Ig1 and/or Ig2 domains of Met for binding the bacterial ligand. We crystallized the complex between InlB321 and Met741, the shortest Met construct that retained high-affinity binding, in two different crystal forms. Crystal form I with two complexes in the asymmetric unit contained enzymatically deglycosylated Met and diffracted to 2.8 Å. Crystal form II in a different space group contained Met with truncated N-linked carbohydrate side chains produced by the Lec3.2.8.1 mutant of CHO cells (Stanley, 1989Stanley P. Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants with multiple glycosylation defects for production of glycoproteins with minimal carbohydrate heterogeneity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These crystals diffracted to 4 Å and also contain two complexes in the asymmetric unit. Both crystal forms were solved by molecular replacement. We used crystal form II only to compare the overall domain arrangement with that of the better diffracting and more extensively refined crystal form I discussed below. In crystal form I, we modeled the first three Met domains: Sema, PSI, and Ig1, all of which are in direct contact with InlB (Figures 2A and 2B). Ig2 does not contact InlB, and there is no continuous electron density for this domain. It is, therefore, omitted from the final model. Nevertheless, we could place by molecular replacement an Ig2 homology model (Gherardi et al., 2003Gherardi E. Youles M.E. Miguel R.N. Blundell T.L. Iamele L. Gough J. Bandyopadhyay A. Hartmann G. Butler P.J. Functional map and domain structure of MET, the product of the c-met protooncogene and receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12039-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that is shown in Figures 2A and 2B. InlB interacts with Met via two interfaces. A contact between the concave face of the InlB LRR region and Met Ig1 forms the primary interface (Figure 2C), in agreement with the binding data generated with domain deletion constructs of Met (Figures 1E and 1F) or point mutants of InlB (Machner et al., 2003Machner M.P. Frese S. Schubert W.D. Orian-Rousseau V. Gherardi E. Wehland J. Niemann H.H. Heinz D.W. Aromatic amino acids at the surface of InlB are essential for host cell invasion by Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The secondary, less extensive contact involves the InlB IR region and the Sema domain of Met (Figure 2C) and had not been predicted by binding studies. Like the InlB IR region, the β chain of HGF/SF contacts the Sema domain on the bottom face of the β-propeller (Stamos et al., 2004Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. Crystal structure of the HGF beta chain in complex with the Sema domain of the Met receptor.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the binding sites for the two ligands on the Sema domain are distant and do not overlap (Figure 2D). The HGF/SF β chain contacts the Met α chain at blade 2 and 3 of the Sema domain, whereas InlB contacts the Met β chain at blades 4 to 6. This agrees with the observation that full-length InlB and HGF/SF can bind Met simultaneously (Shen et al., 2000Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. InIB-dependent internalization of Listeria is mediated by the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Apart from the β chain, HGF/SF has additional domains that interact with Met. To test for a potential overlap of other HGF/SF-binding sites on Met with that of InlB, we performed more extensive competition experiments. These revealed a concentration-dependent, partial competition between InlB321 and full-length HGF/SF, but neither ligand could displace the other completely (Figure S1). The structure of InlB321 within the complex with Met is virtually identical to several structures of free ligand (Marino et al., 1999Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Structure of the lnlB leucine-rich repeats, a domain that triggers host cell invasion by the bacterial pathogen L. monocytogenes.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Marino et al., 2002Marino M. Banerjee M. Jonquieres R. Cossart P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are SH3-like and mediate binding to host ligands.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Schubert et al., 2001Schubert W.D. Gobel G. Diepholz M. Darji A. Kloer D. Hain T. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Domann E. Heinz D.W. Internalins from the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes combine three distinct folds into a contiguous internalin domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, Met undergoes major rearrangements in order to bind InlB as demonstrated by the fact that the relative orientation of the Met Sema and PSI domain is radically different in the Met741-InlB321 complex and in the complex of Met567 with the β chain of HGF/SF (Stamos et al., 2004Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. Crystal structure of the HGF beta chain in complex with the Sema domain of the Met receptor.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, upon aligning the Sema domains of the two structures, the C-terminal end of the PSI domain is displaced by some 15 Å (Figure 2D). The movement can be described as a rigid body rotation of roughly 60° around an axis close to the linker between the two domains (Figure 3A). Two closely spaced glycine residues (G517 and G519) provide sufficient flexibility to make this linker an effective hinge region. As both of our crystal forms contain two complexes per asymmetric unit, there are four crystallographically independent copies of the complex. We have applied tight noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints throughout refinement, but each domain was treated as a separate NCS group. This allows us to asses the interdomain flexibility within the Met741-InlB321 complex. The two complexes in crystal form I are almost identical. This is not surprising, as the NCS in crystal form I is very close to a crystallographic symmetry and may merely represent the breakdown of this perfect symmetry. The two copies in crystal form II are truly independent of each other and of the complex from crystal form I. Nevertheless, the overall domain arrangement of the complexes from crystal form II is similar to that of crystal form I, and the secondary interface between the InlB IR region and the Met Sema domain is preserved. An overlay of the complexes performed on InlB shows that the Ig1 domain, the PSI domain, and the InlB-proximal side of the Sema domain overlap very well and that large movements are limited to Ig2 and the InlB-distal side of the Sema domain due to a crystal lattice contact (Figure 3B). Met741 is the largest fragment of the Met ectodomain crystallized to date, and the structure of the Met Ig1 domain has not been reported before, except for a homology model (Gherardi et al., 2003Gherardi E. Youles M.E. Miguel R.N. Blundell T.L. Iamele L. Gough J. Bandyopadhyay A. Hartmann G. Butler P.J. Functional map and domain structure of MET, the product of the c-met protooncogene and receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12039-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ig1 is an immunoglobulin-like domain with a disulfide bridge linking strands D and E. An unusually long B-C loop forms a unique β-hairpin extending from the core (Figure 4A). The hairpin, which we term β-wing, is a key element for InlB binding. The β-wing lies at the center of the primary interface between the concave face of the InlB LRR and Met Ig1 in which some 1700 Å2 of surface area are buried. The LRR-Ig1 contact is reminiscent of InlA that likewise binds the Ig-like domain EC1 of human E-cadherin in the void of its larger, horseshoe-shaped LRR (Schubert et al., 2002Schubert W.D. Urbanke C. Ziehm T. Beier V. Machner M.P. Domann E. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Heinz D.W. Structure of internalin, a major invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes, in complex with its human receptor E-cadherin.Cell. 2002; 111: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, unlike EC1, which is located centrally within the LRR of InlA, the core of Met Ig1 is offset by some 16 Å toward the loops connecting the 310-helices and β strands of the InlB LRR (Figure 4A). Only the β-wing and the top of the Ig fold are in direct contact with the ligand. Two potential glycosylation sites are located at the bottom of Ig1, implying that the carbohydrate side chains present in native Met should neither interfere with nor participate in ligand binding. Overall, the LRR-Ig1 interface has a mixed hydrophobic and polar character. A string of aromatic amino acid side chains is surface exposed on the concave face of the InlB LRR. Acting as paddles, these residues engage in receptor binding. The aromatic ring of the centrally located Y170i (i denoting residues from InlB and M from Met) stacks and packs, laterally, against the aliphatic side chains of lysines K600M and K599M, respectively. Through its hydroxyl group Y170i forms additional polar contacts to the side chain of R602M and the backbone carbonyl of K599M from the base of the β-wing (Figure 4B). K599M also stacks against Y214i. The side chains of K599M and K600M are held in place by an intra- and an intermolecular salt bridge, respectively. Side chains from the β sheet formed by strands CFG of Ig1 shape a hydrophobic pocket for W124i (Figure 4C). The side chains of Phe104i and Phe126i are completely buried upon complex formation, mainly by residues from the F-G loop, especially G643M and G645M. These findings are in good agreement with the results of previous mutational analysis highlighting the functional importance of these aromatic InlB residues for Met binding (Machner et al., 2003Machner M.P. Frese S. Schubert W.D. Orian-Rousseau V. Gherardi E. Wehland J. Niemann H.H. Heinz D.W. Aromatic amino acids at the surface of InlB are essential for host cell invasion by Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Complementary electrostatics between R592M and K600M from the tip and the base of the β-wing, respectively, and a patch of three acidic residues in the LRR region (D128i, E129i, E150i) further contribute to the interaction (Figure 4D). The PSI domain of Met contributes to the primary contact a single hydrogen bond to the LRR of InlB. The second, less prominent contact between InlB IR and Met Sema buries some 870 Å2 and is mainly polar. The overall strength of the interaction between the IR and Sema domains is low, as we did not observe binding of InlB321 to Met567, which can form the secondary, but not the primary, contact (Figure 1E). Moreover, the secondary interface does not measurably contribute to the binding affinity of InlB321 to Met, as the shorter InlB241 (Figure 1A) that is only capable of binding Ig1 has an apparent affinity for Met similar to InlB321 (Figure 5A). This underscores that LRR-Ig1 is the primary, affinity-determining contact. However, InlB241 and InlB321 show clear differences in terms of Met activation. InlB241 cannot induce Met phosphorylation or Met-dependent activation of Erk1/2 (Banerjee et al., 2004Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are required for potentiation of Met activation.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Figure. 5B), whereas InlB321 is active in these assays, highlighting the fact that the interaction between the IR and Sema domains is essential for the ability of InlB to activate Met. Full-length InlB (InlBfl) is much more active than InlB321 in receptor phosphorylation assays and, like HGF/SF, it elicits full cell responses such as cell migration (Banerjee et al., 2004Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. GW domains of the Listeria monocytogenes invasion protein InlB are required for potentiation of Met activation.Mol.

It is now becoming clear that additional or alternative mechanisms involving interactions among cells are also crucial for positional specification. Concentration gradients of small diffusible molecules called morphogens are key regulators of development, specifying position during pattern formation in the embryo. It is now becoming clear that additional or alternative mechanisms involving interactions among cells are also crucial for positional specification. A key event in development of the embryo is the allocation of cell fates according to spatial patterns—for instance cartilage in the vertebrate limb or veins in the insect wing. One mechanism for pattern formation depends on the propagation of small diffusible substances called morphogens, a term coined by Turing to describe molecules whose distribution determines patterns of gene expression as cells respond to different concentrations. In the French Flag model (Wolpert, 1969Wolpert L. J. Theor. Biol. 1969; 25: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar), cells are proposed to acquire, according to their distance from a boundary, a positional value that they then interpret according to their current dynamic state (see Figure 1). The fact that embryonic positional fields are probably small (<30 cell diameters) prompted the proposal that a diffusible morphogen could specify positional values (Crick, 1970Crick F. Nature. 1970; 225: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Morphogens have long been the standard framework for interpreting pattern formation experiments (see, for example, Zhu and Scott, 2004Zhu A.J. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2985-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but it is becoming clear that they are not the whole story. As Gregor et al. suggest in their new studies on the Bicoid morphogen (Gregor et al., 2007aGregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Cell. 2007; 130: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, Gregor et al., 2007bGregor T. Tank D.W. Wieschaus E.F. Bialek W. Cell. 2007; 130: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), even in the relatively simple membrane-free Drosophila blastoderm where a morphogen model seems to work, a whole layer of additional mechanisms are likely to be involved. Can diffusible morphogens by themselves supply positional information with the necessary precision and reliability? Other, equally important, local mechanisms are known to act in position-related cell specification. Thus, while cells are evaluating their position in the embryo, they also must be acquiring directional information, that is, polarity. Most cells acquire one or several types of polarity. For example, specialized epithelia such as the sensory cells of the mammalian ear or hair cells of the fly wing may exhibit planar cell polarity, that is, a polarization in the plane of the epithelium (Lawrence et al., 2004Lawrence P.A. Casal J. Struhl G. Development. 2004; 131: 4651-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Planar polarity is a collective property of the whole tissue that is crucial for ensuring many of its functions, such as the proper orientation of hairs, and implies that cells distinguish among several directions, reacting differently to their neighbors according to relative position. Morphogens are presumed to be involved in planar cell polarity, but none are known for sure to specify it. Proposed mechanisms for planar polarization suggest that complex cell-cell interactions are crucial. Because the two problems of positional and directional information are clearly related, we suggest that cell-cell interactions as well as morphogens may be essential players in directing spatial patterning in the embryo. Two conditions must be met for any mechanism specifying positional information: precision and robustness. Do morphogens on their own meet these conditions? Let us look first at precision, that is, the accurate positioning of boundaries between different cell types. Few studies have addressed this question explicitly at the cellular level. We do not know if the positioning of cells is determined down to the single-cell level. This may be the case during segmentation of the insect embryo as antero-posterior (A/P) parasegment boundaries are determined within a width of a single cell diameter, and this process does not result solely from single cells reading local morphogen concentrations. The requisite level of precision needs to be more fully investigated. It is not known, say, to what degree of precision the two wings of Drosophila are identical at the cellular level. Precision data are available for the blastoderm of Drosophila, which is a syncytium containing many nuclei instead of individual cells. The morphogen Bicoid does not have to cross any cell boundaries in this syncytium, and a beautiful exponential gradient of this transcription factor is observed (Driever and Nusslein-Volhard, 1988Driever W. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1988; 54: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional activation pattern of the Hunchback target gene in response to the Bicoid gradient reveals a problem: the precision of the location of the boundary of Hunchback expression is apparently greater than that of the Bicoid gradient from which it is presumably derived (Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002Houchmandzadeh B. Wieschaus E. Leibler S. Nature. 2002; 415: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It is hard to see how this result could be explained other than by additional mechanisms beyond a simple gradient of the Bicoid morphogen. It is likely that regulatory interactions among target genes in each nucleus are involved (Jaeger et al., 2004Jaeger J. Surkova S. Blagov M. Janssens H. Kosman D. Kozlov K.N. Manu Myasnikova E. Vanario-Alonso C.E. Samsonova M. et al.Nature. 2004; 430: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Indeed, two elegant studies by Gregor et al., 2007aGregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Cell. 2007; 130: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, Gregor et al., 2007bGregor T. Tank D.W. Wieschaus E.F. Bialek W. Cell. 2007; 130: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, recently published in Cell, show that establishment of the Bicoid gradient and readout by Hunchback probably involves nucleus to nucleus communication as well. A second condition morphogens must fulfill in determining spatial patterns during embryogenesis is robustness. This means that the distribution of morphogens must be reproducible and remain reliable in spite of interfering phenomena (Kerszberg, 2004Kerszberg M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has proved problematic even to measure the concentration of morphogens at different sites in the embryo and hence to test various models of morphogen robustness. Experimental difficulties arise because the molecular concentrations involved are small, hence there exists an intrinsic chemical noise that also may affect the action of the morphogen. Candidate morphogen receptors expressed by embryonic cells are also “dilute,” and they operate in a complex physico-chemical environment. This potentially could render morphogens unreliable. The extracellular matrix likely presents a variety of binding sites for morphogens and hence can “trap” these molecules (Zhu and Scott, 2004Zhu A.J. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2985-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the fly embryo, cell-surface glypicans (proteoglycans), such as Dally and Dally-like, have been proposed to shape the gradients of Decapentaplegic (DPP), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, and of Wingless (the fly version of vertebrate Wnt), both of which act as morphogens in a variety of situations (Zhu and Scott, 2004Zhu A.J. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2985-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The early dorsoventral gradient of DPP interacts with factors such as Short Gastrulation, a DPP antagonist, to specify the dorsoventral axis of the fly embryo (Shimmi et al., 2005Shimmi O. Umulis D. Othmer H. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). There is also evidence during Drosophila embryogenesis of a cell-to-cell relay mechanism for transporting the morphogen Hedgehog (Han et al., 2005Han C. Yan D. Belenkaya T.Y. Lin X. Development. 2005; 132: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Yet another active mechanism based on lipoprotein particles has been proposed to transport Hedgehog and Wingless in the developing fly embryo (Panakova et al., 2005Panakova D. Sprong H. Marois E. Thiele C. Eaton S. Nature. 2005; 435: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The extracellular space has a complex shape, and so effective diffusion times may increase as much as five-fold (Lander et al., 2002Lander A.D. Nie Q. Wan F.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) resulting in the introduction of local variations in the morphogen gradient. The process of morphogen diffusion will of course depend on the exact three-dimensional structure of the tissue, including the density and complex topology of cell-cell contacts. Many cellular factors can also be expected to perturb or actively modulate morphogen propagation. Diffusible molecules that bind to cell-surface receptors are, for example, almost always endocytosed to some degree while remaining functional, rendering a precise determination of effective morphogen concentrations problematic. Although propagation of a molecule from a source is called “diffusion,” it would be misleading to use this simple term to describe such numerous and complex processes. How do morphogen gradients remain robust and precise despite (or perhaps with the help of) these complexities? Mathematical models have predicted morphogen gradient robustness, for example, in one-dimensional noiseless models, but such models depend on artificially homogenized properties of the propagation medium and also invoke degradation of morphogen molecules, for which there is not yet clear evidence. If morphogens are to act as graded positional cues then there must exist mechanisms for cells to perceive and interpret concentration-dependent information, and this raises problems. For example, if position is specified on a cell-by-cell basis then many more morphogen concentration thresholds (at which changes in gene activity occur) need to be established than the five or so identified in some tissues. In addition, the binding of morphogens to receptors necessary for the cellular response itself can have a very significant effect on morphogen distribution and can even prevent a gradient of receptor occupation as receptors become saturated (Kerszberg and Wolpert, 1998Kerszberg M. Wolpert L. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 191: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One insufficiently appreciated property of gradients is that they change over time. Freeman and Gurdon, 2002Freeman M. Gurdon J.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 515-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar suggested that what cells do is to record the maximum concentration of the gradient at their location. It may be that a “maximum value rule” or a time integration rule that reads the total signaling amplitude over time delivers a more stable signal for a cell's position than a simple reading of morphogen concentration at that position (Meinhardt, 1978Meinhardt H. J. Theor. Biol. 1978; 74: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Putative morphogens usually have pleiotropic effects on tissues and this will also affect patterning. Of particular interest is a study showing that the slope of a DPP gradient regulates growth during fly wing embryonic development (Rogulja and Irvine, 2005Rogulja D. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2005; 123: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar): growth and positional information are clearly interrelated and if both the concentration of DPP and its slope are involved the situation becomes very complicated. Let us discuss in more detail some well-characterized candidate morphogens: DPP, Sonic hedgehog, and activin. Gradients of BMPs (which belong to the TGFβ superfamily) involve a set of extracellular factors, positive feedback, and heterodimer formation to achieve peak levels of signaling in the dorsal region of the early Drosophila embryo (O'Connor et al., 2006O'Connor M.B. Umulis D. Othmer H.G. Blair S.S. Development. 2006; 133: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These three processes also seem to occur in the fly imaginal wing disc. The disc is divided into anterior and posterior compartments: the diffusible molecule Hedgehog is expressed in the posterior compartment, whereas diffusible DPP is expressed at the compartment boundary. Entchev et al., 2000Entchev E.V. Schwabedissen A. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Cell. 2000; 103: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar found that DPP is indeed distributed in a long-range concentration gradient and moves without preferential direction at a speed of more than 4 cell diameters per hr through the target tissue. Yet extracellular diffusion of DPP alone does not explain its distribution as both a stable gradient and receptor-mediated endocytosis seem to be essential for long-range regulation of DPP. Although there are some indications that at specific DPP thresholds the target genes omb and spalt are turned on (Teleman and Cohen, 2000Teleman A.A. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), it is notable that even in this well-studied case there is little quantitative evidence for gradient-dependent positional gene activation. Neither this nor other studies demonstrate incontrovertibly that different local concentrations of DPP (or Hedgehog for that matter) specify positional information and gene activation with the necessary precision. Proteins of the Hedgehog family are believed to act as morphogens in a variety of tissues including Drosophila's larval cuticle and wing imaginal disc, as well as the vertebrate neural tube (Ingham and McMahon, 2001Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, Briscoe et al., 2001Briscoe J. Chen Y. Jessel T.M. Struhl G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1279-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Numerous molecular interactions are involved in the propagation of Hedgehog (reviewed in Wilson and Chuang, 2006Wilson C.W. Chuang P.T. Cell. 2006; 125: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Patterning along the antero-posterior axis of the vertebrate limb has been suggested to be due to a graded signal from the polarizing region at the posterior margin of the bud where the gene encoding Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed (Tickle, 2003Tickle C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 449-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The best evidence that the signal is graded comes from the observation that manufacturing a reduced signal by grafting anteriorly a small number of polarizing tissue cells results in a reduced response, that is, instead of the signal specifying digits 4, 3, and 2, only digit 2 is specified. Here again, however, there is no direct evidence for a morphogen gradient determining the behavior of the cells that go to form specific digits. Indeed, there seem to be two important mechanisms: first, the total time of contact of a cell with the polarizing region and second, its residence time there, as measured by its exposure to and synthesis of Shh (Harfe et al., 2004Harfe B.D. Scherz P.J. Nissim S. Tian H. McMahon A.P. Tabin C.J. Cell. 2004; 118: 517-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Similar arguments have been made regarding Shh signaling in neural tube patterning in vertebrate embryos (Stamataki et al., 2005Stamataki D. Ulloa F. Tsoni S.V. Mynett A. Briscoe J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 626-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the early Xenopus embryo there is a presumed gradient of activin-like activity. Activin belongs to the TGFβ family (Piepenburg et al., 2004Piepenburg O. Grimmer D. Williams P.H. Smith J.C. Development. 2004; 131: 4977-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At high concentrations of activin, the gene goosecoid is activated, while Xbra is turned on at lower activin levels (both genes encode mesodermal markers). These results have been interpreted in terms of activin binding to its cell-surface receptors (Gurdon and Bourillot, 2001Gurdon J.B. Bourillot P.Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for a well-regulated, diffusion-mediated gradient of activin actually and reliably specifying cell fate by itself in the frog embryo. What about alternative or additional patterning mechanisms? It has been suggested that a mechanism for DPP signaling could involve direct transfer of DPP receptors (not DPP ligand) from cell to cell via cytonemes. Cytonemes are actin-based filopodial extensions. In the Drosophila wing disc, cytonemes are oriented preferentially toward both the antero-posterior and dorsoventral organizers, and their presence and orientation correlate with DPP signaling. The DPP receptor, Thickveins, is present in punctae that move along cytonemes. These observations are claimed to be consistent with a role for cytonemes in signal transduction (Hsiung et al., 2005Hsiung F. Ramirez-Weber F.A. Iwaki D.D. Kornberg T.B. Nature. 2005; 437: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Many of the problems relating to morphogen propagation were clearly recognized by Wilson and Melton, 1994Wilson P.A. Melton D.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 676-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar in relation to patterning of the mesoderm in Xenopus. They found that a variety of mesodermal markers were activated together over a wide range of activin concentrations. They concluded that the initial response to activin is relatively simple. They ascribed the further refinements observed to complex cell-cell interactions. In a study of TGFβ signaling, Reilly and Melton, 1996Reilly K.M. Melton D.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar found evidence of a cell-to-cell relay mechanism whereby cells at high morphogen concentrations would become differentiated first and communicate information to cells that were farther away. However, when Williams et al., 2004Williams P.H. Hagemann A. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Smith J.C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1916-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar labeled the morphogen Xnr2 (a TGFβ family member) and looked in Xenopus embryos, they found evidence for long-range signaling by diffusion of the morphogen but not by its movement via cytonemes, filopodia, argosomes, or transcytosis as had been proposed for TGFβ morphogens. In their two studies of the development and stability of the Bicoid gradient in fly embryos, Gregor et al., 2007aGregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Cell. 2007; 130: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, Gregor et al., 2007bGregor T. Tank D.W. Wieschaus E.F. Bialek W. Cell. 2007; 130: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar suggest that some form of spatial averaging among nuclei is required to suppress noise, explaining the remarkable degree of precision they observe in the readout of Bicoid concentrations by the target gene Hunchback. Thus, it seems that nuclei in syncytia, like cells in multicellular embryos, may do more than merely interpret a morphogen gradient; they may actually help to establish it. As they do so, they may undergo local changes as well as long-range communication, and this process, more than the final morphogen distribution itself, imparts key positional information to them. Specification of positional information may clearly involve a simultaneous polarization of cells and indeed of the system as a whole. Favorite model systems for studying planar cell polarity are the Drosophila wing and eye. It is widely assumed that one or several (some opposing) gradients are involved in wing and eye patterning, although the nature of the signal itself is unclear (even if, as many believe, it ultimately resolves into graded activation of a Frizzled receptor). Graded expression of the molecules Dachsous, Four-jointed, and Fat across the tissue have been reported to regulate Frizzled signaling. Remarkably, these candidate molecules are growth factors (Fat is clearly involved in tissue growth control), and all are atypical cadherins, that is, transmembrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and communication but are unlikely to move from cell to cell and thus cannot be morphogens. Lawrence et al., 2004Lawrence P.A. Casal J. Struhl G. Development. 2004; 131: 4651-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar have proposed a model for establishing polarity in the abdominal epidermis of Drosophila based on cell-cell interactions, which may provide cells with positional information with the morphogen playing a key role. The transmembrane proteins Four-jointed, Dachsous, and Fat are involved in setting up a gradient of an unknown factor X, which determines Frizzled activity. Reading the gradient are Frizzled itself, Prickle, and VanGogh/Strabismus, enabling cells to compare the concentration of X at their position with that of their neighbors and to set their value as an average of these. On the other hand, Ma et al., 2003Ma D. Yang C.H. McNeill H. Simon M.A. Axelrod J.D. Nature. 2003; 421: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar proposed a model for planar cell polarity based purely on cell-cell interactions and local (cell-scale) graded distributions, where factor X is dispensed with, and hence no global positional information is imparted to cells. The model of Le Garrec et al., 2006Le Garrec J.F. Lopez P. Kerszberg M. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar posits that a weak Frizzled activity gradient is read by asymmetric molecular complexes built at cell interfaces around the cadherin Flamingo. Polarization occurs robustly over hundreds of cell diameters even with noise in the Frizzled activation gradient. It is probable that these last two models have the potential, if suitably extended, to provide positional information in wing primordia of the fly embryo. In this context, we note that Baena-Lopez and Garcia-Bellido, 2006Baena-Lopez L.A. Garcia-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 13734-13739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar have proposed that local cell-cell interactions triggered by differences in Vestigial gene expression between neighboring cells could specify positional information in the fly wing. Very different from morphogen gradients is the mechanism specifying position in the proximo-distal patterning of the vertebrate limb and in somite formation along the main body axis of vertebrate embryos (Dubrulle and Pourquié, 2004Dubrulle J. Pourquié O. Development. 2004; 131: 783-793Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this last case, in particular, oscillations in time and space of molecule concentrations play a spectacular role, and cell-cell communication by signaling through the Notch receptor bound by Delta ligand is crucial for synchronizing local oscillators. It should be noted that the Notch-Delta signaling pathway figures prominently in the polarization of the Drosophila eye, providing a possible phylogenetic link between polarization and positional specification. We suggest that, just like the mechanisms involved in polarization and somite formation, those for setting up positional values may involve cell-cell interactions. There might even exist an overlap among the molecular players in these seemingly independent sets of phenomena. Morphogenetic molecules do exist, but it seems improbable that their concentration alone determines the fate of cells regarding their final position in the developing embryo. Wardle and Smith, 2004Wardle F.C. Smith J. Development. 2004; 131: 4687-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar reported that early in development gene expression at the single-cell level is rather variable and only later does it become more precisely linked to cell position. Thus, morphogens may represent a rather crude positional information system, which is then more finely tuned by cell-cell interactions. Clearly, the morphogen gradient does not act alone and is itself specified by a variety of complex cellular mechanisms. Morphogen propagation, signaling, and readout are only the most studied parts of an iceberg of interactions that determine positional value in the embryo."

The present work focuses on the modifications of chromatin architecture induced by MeCP2 and the effects of RTT-causing mutants. hMeCP2 binds to nucleosomes close to the linker DNA entry-exit site and protects ∼11 bp of linker DNA from micrococcal nuclease. MeCP2 mutants differ in this property; the R106W mutant gives very little extra protection beyond the ∼146-bp nucleosome core, whereas the large C-terminal truncation R294X reveals wild type behavior. Gel mobility assays show that linker DNA is essential for proper MeCP2 binding to nucleosomes, and electron microscopy visualization shows that the protein induces distinct conformational changes in the linker DNA. When bound to nucleosomes, MeCP2 is in close proximity to histone H3, which exits the nucleosome core close to the proposed MeCP2-binding site. These findings firmly establish nucleosomal linker DNA as a crucial binding partner of MeCP2 and show that different RTT-causing mutations of MeCP2 are correspondingly defective in different aspects of the interactions that alter chromatin architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2088608003,"In the mushroom body of insects, odors are represented by very few spikes in a small number of neurons, a highly efficient strategy known as sparse coding. Physiological studies of these neurons have shown that sparseness is maintained across thousand-fold changes in odor concentration. Using a realistic computational model, we propose that sparseness in the olfactory system is regulated by adaptive feedforward inhibition. When odor concentration changes, feedforward inhibition modulates the duration of the temporal window over which the mushroom body neurons may integrate excitatory presynaptic input. This simple adaptive mechanism could maintain the sparseness of sensory representations across wide ranges of stimulus conditions."

In this study, the ability of Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) to act as a RET inhibitor was investigated. Sorafenib inhibited the activity of purified recombinant kinase domain of wild type RET and RETV804M with IC50 values of 5.9 and 7.9 nm, respectively. Interestingly, these values were 6–7-fold lower than the IC50 for the inhibition of B-RAFV600E. In cell-based assays, Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity and signaling of wild type and oncogenic RET in MEN2 tumor and established cell lines at a concentration between 15 and 150 nm. In contrast, inhibition of oncogenic B-RAF- or epidermal growth factor-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation required micromolar concentrations of Sorafenib demonstrating the high specificity of this drug in targeting RET. Moreover, prolonged exposure to Sorafenib resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and RET protein degradation. Using lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors, we demonstrate that Sorafenib induces RET lysosomal degradation independent of proteasomal targeting. Furthermore, we provide a structural model of the Sorafenib·RET complex in which Sorafenib binds to and induces the DFGout conformation of the RET kinase domain. These results strengthen the argument that Sorafenib may be effective in the treatment of MEN2 patients.

To date a family of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands, which include GDNF, ARTN, NRTN, and PSPN and a family of GPI-linked co-receptors, GFRα1–4, have been identified (4Airaksinen M.S.

Ligand·co-receptor·RET complex formation results in transient RET dimerization and activation of the RET tyrosine kinase domain, followed by transphosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues. Phosphotyrosine residues 905, 981, 1015, 1062, and 1096 are the docking sites for Grb7/10, c-Src, phospholipase Cγ, and Grb2/Shc/IRS1–2/FRS2/DOK1-4-5, respectively. This docking of adaptor proteins triggers the activation of downstream pathways, which include activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, ERK5, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (5Plaza-Menacho I.

Three mutation-specific disease phenotypes can be recognized: MEN2A, MEN2B, and a familial form of medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the cancer arising from the calcitonin-secreting C cells of the thyroid, is the common clinical feature of the three clinical variants. MEN2A patients develop, in addition to MTC, pheochromocytoma (the tumor arising from the adrenal medulla cells) and hyperplasia of the parathyroid (HPT). MEN2B patients develop MTC and pheochromocytoma; however, instead of HPT, they develop a more complex and aggressive phenotype with neuromas in tongue, lips, and eyelids; intestinal ganglioneuromas; thickening of corneal nerves; and marfanoid habitus. In papillary thyroid carcinoma, the tumor arises from the follicular cells of the thyroid and is caused by chromosomal inversions or translocations in which the 5′-end of various genes are fused in frame with the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET gene (9Nikiforov Y.E. Endocr. Pathol. 2002; 13: 3-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting chimera oncoproteins called RET-PTCs, of which more than 10 variant forms have been identified, display constitutive tyrosine kinase activity caused by formation of homodimers between the N-terminal domains. Surgical resection, radioiodine treatment, and hormone replacement are the standard treatment for papillary thyroid tumors. In the case of MEN2 patients, early diagnosis is crucial because the disease does not respond to standard chemotherapy or conventional radiotherapy. Surgery is at present the only curative treatment for MTC, consisting of a total thyroidectomy. However, more than 50% of patients have persistent or recurrent disease after surgery and are prone to develop distal metastasis, for which there is no systemic treatment (1de Groot J.W. Links T.P. Plukker J.T. Lips C.J. Hofstra R.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).

Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) reported that Sorafenib could inhibit the kinase activity and signaling of wild type and oncogenic RET. Here we have extended these studies to further investigate: (i) the effect of Sorafenib against the enzymatic activity of purified recombinant kinase domain of RETWT and RETV804M, (ii) the specificity of RET inhibition by Sorafenib, (iii) the mechanism of oncogenic RET degradation induced by Sorafenib, and (iv) the structural insights of the mechanism by which Sorafenib inhibits RET kinase activity. Cell Lines and Reagents—HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were transfected with pCMV vector alone or pCMV vector containing wild type RET (RETWT), the MEN2A mutant RETC634R, the MEN2B mutant RETM918T, or the FMTC mutant RETS891A. Transfected cells were selected in 500 μg/ml of G418 (Sigma-Aldrich), screened by Western blotting and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 500 μg/ml of G418. MTC-TT cells (human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line harboring the MEN2A-RETC634W oncoprotein) were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal bovine serum. MZ-CRC-1 (human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line harboring the MEN2B-RETM918T oncoprotein) and TGW-1 (human neuroblastoma cell line expressing wild type RET and GFRα1 co-receptor) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. BAY 43-9006 was provided by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals (West Haven, CT) and made up as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO. STI571 (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and PP1 (Promega, Madison, WI) were made up as 10 and 3 mm stock solutions in Me2SO, respectively. Concanamycin A, lactacystin, and MG132 were purchase from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO to give stock solutions of 5 μm,10mm, and 50 mm, respectively. The following antibodies were used: RET (H-300), RET (C-19), and phospho-Tyr1062RET (Santa Cruz, Palo Alto, CA), ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, New England Biolabs, UK), anti-HisG (Invitrogen), LAMP1 (clone H4A3, Abcam Laboratories), Alexa 488 anti-rabbit Ig, Alexa 555 anti-mouse, and Alexa 647-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cell Proliferation Assays—For cell number assays, MTC-TT (2.5 × 104 cells), MZ-CRC-1 (2.5 × 104 cells), TPC-1 (1 × 104 cells), and established HEK293 cells (1 × 104 cells) were plated in triplicate in 30-mm dishes in the presence of Sorafenib or vehicle (Me2SO 1:1000) on day 0. Cell number was counted after trypsinization using a standard hemocytometer at days 1, 2, 4, and 8. Western Blotting—The cells were lysed on ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 144 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 87% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein lysates (10 μg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed using Western blotting and ECL (Roche Applied Science). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Baculovirus expressed recombinant RET, ALK, and Abl kinases were purified and employed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kinase assay, as described previously (16Mologni L. Sala E. Cazzaniga S. Rostagno R. Kuoni T. Puttini M. Bain J. Cleris L. Redaelli S. Riva B. Formelli F. Scapozza L. Gambacorti-Passerini C. J. Mol.

Confocal Microscopy—The cells were plated on glass coverslips for 24 h, after which cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Immunostaining with primary antibodies for 1 h was followed by incubation with Alexa 486 anti-rabbit Ig and Alexa 555 anti-mouse Ig for 45 min. Alexa 647-phalloidin conjugated was used to stain actin filaments, and 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole was used to stain the nucleus. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Quantitative Real Time PCR—RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) under the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA synthesis, 200 ng of mRNA were used with the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions using oligo(dT)20 primer (Qiagen). 1 μl of cDNA was used per qPCR. Each analysis reaction was performed in triplicate. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an endogenous control throughout all experimental analysis. Gene expression analysis was performed using TaqMan® gene expression assays on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Analysis was performed using the Δ–ΔCt method, which determines fold changes in gene expression relative to a comparator sample (control). qPCR primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The Assayson-Demand references for RET and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are Hs00240887_m1 and 4310884E, respectively. Structural Model Analysis—To generate a model of RET in complex with Sorafenib, we assumed that Sorafenib would bind to the DFGout conformation of the kinase. A model of the RET·Sorafenib complex was therefore derived from the unphosphorylated RET kinase structure (Protein Data Bank code 2IVS) (22Knowles P.P. Murray-Rust J. Kjaer S. Scott R.P. Hanrahan S. Santoro M. Ibanez C.F. McDonald N.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33577-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with its activation segment substituted (DFG to APE motif, Asp892–Ala919) with that of the c-Kit·Gleevec (STI-571) complex (Protein Data Bank code 1T46) (23Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L. Scheibe D.N. Snell G.P. Zou H. Sang B.C. Wilson K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31655-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), with mutations to convert the c-Kit activation segment sequence to that of RET. Superimposing this model onto the B-RAF·Sorafenib complex (Protein Data Bank code 1UWH) (24Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Cell. 2004; 116: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar) allowed a fit of Sorafenib to the RET protein model. Further changes to the model included a small shift of the C-helix and of residues of the Gly loop to conformations observed in the c-Kit-STI-571 crystal structure. The resultant model provides a stereochemically plausible structure of the RET·Sorafenib complex. All modeling work was performed using COOT (CCP4), and the figures were generated with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific; www.pymol.org). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software. The cell number assays were compared using one-way analysis of variance for repeating measures and the Dunnet test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Sorafenib Inhibits RET Enzymatic Activity at Low Nanomolar Concentration in Vitro—To determine the inhibition of RET by Sorafenib, the His-tagged tyrosine kinase domain (amino acids 700–1020) from wild type RET was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using a two-step chromatographic protocol (Fig. 1A, inset). In an in vitro kinase assay, Sorafenib blocked enzymatic activity with an IC50 = 5.9 ± 1.2 nm (Fig. 1A). To compare this potent inhibitory capacity of Sorafenib with other known RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the in vitro kinase assay was repeated in the presence of Gleevec (15de Groot J.W. Plaza Menacho I. Schepers H. Drenth-Diephuis L.J. Osinga J. Plukker J.T. Links T.P. Eggen B.J. Hofstra R.M. Surgery. 2006; 139: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gleevec blocked the kinase activity of wild type RET with an IC50 = 12 ± 2 μm compared with an IC50 = 0.3 ± 0.06 μm for the well characterized Gleevec target, Abl (Fig. 1B). Next, the specificity of Sorafenib was investigated by in vitro kinase assay with recombinant RET, Abl, and ALK kinase domains (Fig. 1C). Sorafenib blocked the enzymatic activity of RET, Abl, or ALK with IC50 = 0.006, 25, and >500 μm, respectively. Finally, to assess the activity of the Sorafenib used in these experiments, an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant B-RAFV600E was performed (Fig. 1D). Sorafenib inhibited B-RAFV600E with an IC50 = 45 nm, which is essentially identical to that previously reported (25Niculescu-Duvaz I. Roman E. Whittaker S.R. Friedlos F. Kirk R. Scanlon I.J. Davies L.C. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Marais R. Springer C.J. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Ki values for Sorafenib inhibition of wild type RET and B-RAFV600E were 0.45 and 5.6 nm, respectively. The lower Ki value for RET indicates a high binding affinity of the drug to the protein. Together with the lower IC50 values, this indicates that in vitro Sorafenib is a more potent inhibitor of RET tyrosine kinase rather than oncogenic B-RAF. In Vivo Inhibition of RET Phosphorylation, Downstream Signaling, and Cell Proliferation by Sorafenib—It has recently been demonstrated that Sorafenib can inhibit RET activation and cell proliferation in tumor cells harboring a MEN2A-RETC634W mutation (MTC-TT cell line) or a RET/PTC1 oncogene (TPC1 cell line) (20Carlomagno F. Anaganti S. Guida T. Salvatore G. Troncone G. Wilhelm S.M. Santoro M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Here we have extended these studies to also examine the effects of Sorafenib on tumor cells expressing a MEN2B-RETM918T mutation (MZ-CRC-1 cell line) or wild type RET together with the GFRα1 co-receptor (TGW-1 cell line). The cells were treated with Sorafenib for 90 min, and the levels of RET phosphorylation were assessed by Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes RET only when phosphorylated at Tyr1062. For the TGW-1 cells expressing wild type RET, GDNF (10 ng/ml) was added 30 min after drug treatment. In all of the tumor cell lines examined, a reduction in RET Tyr1062 phosphorylation was observed at a concentration of Sorafenib between 15 and 150 nm (Fig. 2A). Moreover, this decrease in RET phosphorylation was accompanied by a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In cell growth assays it was demonstrated that Sorafenib treatment at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm resulted in a significant reduction in cell number (Fig. 2B). The in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that RET is more sensitive than oncogenic B-RAFV600E to Sorafenib inhibition (Fig. 1). The tumor cell lines expressing the different oncogenic forms of RET were derived from different patients and will therefore have very different genetic backgrounds. Consequently, to assess whether the observed inhibitor effects of Sorafenib were specific to RET, the assays were repeated using established HEK293 cells expressing wild type or different oncogenic RET variants (RETC634R, RETM918T, and RETS891A). Again an inhibition of RET Tyr1062 phosphorylation was detected at concentrations of Sorafenib between 15 and 150 nm (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected HEK293 cells transfected with vector alone showed no expression of RET and a very low level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Similarly, treatment of cells expressing oncogenic RET variants with 0.1 or 1 μm Sorafenib over an 8-day period resulted in a significant decrease in cell number, whereas no effect of Sorafenib was observed on HEK293 cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3C). Sorafenib Inhibits Oncogenic B-RAF- and EGF-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation at Micromolar Concentrations: Specificity of Sorafenib Inhibition—Sorafenib was first designed as a RAF inhibitor. As a consequence inhibition of RAF by Sorafenib will inhibit downstream ERK1/2 signaling. To demonstrate that the inhibition of RET-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by Sorafenib is not caused by the dual specificity of the compound for RET and RAF, two experiments were performed. First, HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-tagged oncogenic B-RAFV600E were treated with increasing amounts of Sorafenib for 90 min (Fig. 4A). Western blotting analysis revealed that Sorafenib was able to inhibit oncogenic B-RAF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation only at concentrations of 4.5 μm (Fig. 4A). Second, TGW cells, which do not express oncogenic RET, were stimulated with EGF and treated with increasing amounts of Sorafenib (Fig. 4B). Activation of the EGF receptor results in activation of RAF and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Again this ERK1/2 phosphorylation was only inhibited by high concentrations (3 μm) of Sorafenib. Together these experiments demonstrate that inhibition of RET-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at submicromolar concentrations of Sorafenib results from direct inhibition of RET rather than inhibition of other kinase targets. Sorafenib Induces Oncogenic RET Lysosomal Degradation— To further investigate the mechanisms by which Sorafenib impairs proliferation in RET-expressing cells, HEK293 cells expressing RETC634R or RETM918T were treated with Sorafenib for 48 h, and the level of RET protein was monitored by Western blotting. In both cell lines, treatment with Sorafenib resulted in a significant reduction in RET protein levels, and it was noted that this effect was stronger for RETM918T compared with RETC634R (Fig. 5A). Loss of the RET-PTC1 fusion protein following Sorafenib treatment was also observed in the TPC1 cell line (data not shown). Real time quantitative PCR analysis revealed no change in RETC634R or RETM918T mRNA levels following Sorafenib treatment (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the decrease in RET protein levels does not result from transcriptional regulation. To uncover the mechanism of oncogenic RET degradation, the cells were treated with Sorafenib for 48 h, and then lysosome or proteasome inhibitors were added for 8 h prior to cell lysis. In HEK293 cells expressing RETC634R, Sorafenib-induced RET degradation was rescued by the lysosome inhibitor concanamycin A but not by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132. Similarly, Sorafenib-induced degradation of RETM918T was unaffected by treatment with either MG132 or lactacystin, whereas degradation was rescued by concanamycin A, albeit to a lesser extent than observed with RETC634R (Fig. 5C, left-hand panels). Treatment of these established cell lines with the lysosome and proteasome inhibitors in the absence of Sorafenib revealed no effect of MG132 or lactacystin but a significant increase in RET protein levels followed treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor concanamycin A (Fig. 5C, right-hand panels). Again, a greater effect on RETC634R compared with RETM918T was observed. To investigate further this difference in efficiency between RETC634R and RETM918T degradation, the subcellular localization of RET was examined by confocal microscopy. RETC634R was detected at the cell surface and showed substantial co-localization intracellularly with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1). RETM918T was found to localize with intracellular organelles, although the overlap with LAMP1 was less pronounced (Fig. 5D). When cells were treated with the Sorafenib for 48 h, as expected, a reduction in levels of the RET protein was observed by confocal analysis (data not shown). Similarly, treatment of cells with concanamycin A in the absence of Sorafenib resulted in an accumulation of intracellular RET (data not shown). To confirm that these data were not cell type-dependent, Western blotting analyses were repeated with the tumor cell lines MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, which express MEN2A-RETC634W and MEN2B-RETM918T, respectively. As with the transfected cell lines, Sorafenib treatment resulted in RET degradation. In addition, this degradation was reverted with the lysosomal inhibitor concanamycin A (Fig. 6A). Finally, in HEK293-RETWT cells, Sorafenib treatment decreased the level of wild type RET protein, but this was not as dramatic as observed with oncogenic RET and failed to reach statistically significance. This partial decrease was rescued by concanamycin A treatment, and as with oncogenic RET, concanamycin A treatment alone resulted in a significant increase in the levels of RET protein (Fig. 6B). Sorafenib Inhibits RETV804M Kinase Activity with Similar Efficacy as Wild Type RET—Mutations affecting the active domain of tyrosine kinase receptors can confer resistance to small molecule inhibitors (26Lierman E. Folens C. Stover E.H. Mentens N. Van Miegroet H. Scheers W. Boogaerts M. Vandenberghe P. Marynen P. Cools J. Blood. 2006; 108: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the case of RET, mutations at the gatekeeper residue, Val804, have been reported to confer resistance to PP1, PP2, and ZD6474 (11Carlomagno F. Guida T. Anaganti S. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Ryan A.J. Billaud M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6056-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Similarly a novel MEN2B tandem mutation involving Val804 (V804M/E805K) also confers resistance to the PP1 inhibitor (27Cranston A.N. Carniti C. Oakhill K. Radzio-Andzelm E. Stone E.A. McCallion A.S. Hodgson S. Clarke S. Mondellini P. Leyland J. Pierotti M.A. Whittaker J. Taylor S.S. Bongarzone I. Ponder B.A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10179-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated RET, the IC50 for Sorafenib inhibition of RETC634R, which contains a wild type kinase domain, was only two-3-fold lower then for RETV804L or RETV804M (20Carlomagno F. Anaganti S. Guida T. Salvatore G."
https://openalex.org/W2170415773,"Notch is a central regulator of important cell fate decisions. Notch activation produces diverse cellular effects suggesting the presence of context-dependent control mechanisms. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Notch and integrin mutations have related phenotypes in key developmental processes such as vascular development and somitogenesis. We show that the intracellular domain of mammalian Notch-1 activates integrins without affecting integrin expression. Integrin activation is dependent on γ-secretase-mediated intramembranous cleavage of membrane-bound Notch releasing intracellular Notch that activates R-Ras, independent of CSL-transcription. Notch also reverses H-Ras and Raf-mediated integrin suppression without affecting ERK phosphorylation. Membrane-bound Notch mutants that are inefficiently cleaved or intracellular Notch mutants lacking the ankyrin repeat sequence do not activate R-Ras or integrins. Co-expression of Msx2-interacting nuclear target (MINT) protein with Notch or expression of intracellular Notch-1 truncation mutants lacking the C-terminal transactivation/PEST domain suppresses Notch transcriptional activity without affecting integrin activation. Notch ligand, Delta-like ligand-4, stimulates R-Ras-dependent α5β1 integrin-mediated adhesion, demonstrating the physiological relevance of this pathway. This new CSL-independent Notch/R-Ras pathway provides a molecular mechanism to explain Notch, integrin, and Ras cross-talk during the development of multicellular organisms. Notch is a central regulator of important cell fate decisions. Notch activation produces diverse cellular effects suggesting the presence of context-dependent control mechanisms. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Notch and integrin mutations have related phenotypes in key developmental processes such as vascular development and somitogenesis. We show that the intracellular domain of mammalian Notch-1 activates integrins without affecting integrin expression.

This new CSL-independent Notch/R-Ras pathway provides a molecular mechanism to explain Notch, integrin, and Ras cross-talk during the development of multicellular organisms. The diverse biological processes intrinsic to the development of multicellular organisms are coordinated by communication between adjacent cells involving a small number of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways. The Notch signaling pathway is an important mechanism for mediating these intercellular signaling events to direct cell fate decisions (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). The components of the Notch pathway have been identified in a broad range of metazoans and have been extensively studied in insects, nematodes, and mammals (2de Celis J.F. Garcia-Bellido A. Bray S.J.

In addition, the Notch pathway plays a critical role in mammalian immune development and carcinogenesis (7Maillard I. Adler S.H. Pear W.S.

The molecular components of the Notch pathway have been extensively studied and are highly conserved between species. NOTCH encodes a single-pass heterodimeric transmembrane receptor with an extracellular domain that contains epidermal growth factor-like repeats (9Wharton K.A. Johansen K.M. Xu T.

Four NOTCH homologs (NOTCH-1-4) and two groups of ligands (Delta-like (Dll-1, -3, and -4) and Serrate-like (Jagged 1 and 2)) have been identified in mammals (10Lindsell C.E. Boulter J. diSibio G.

Recent genetic studies have indicated important parallels between the developmental processes controlled by Notch and integrin-mediated adhesion. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and have been identified in insects, nematodes, and vertebrates (22Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9022) Google Scholar). A key feature of integrins is their ability to modulate ligand binding affinity in response to intracellular signals, a process called activation (23Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). They are essential for embryogenesis and are involved in neurogenesis, myogenesis, and angiogenesis, processes also controlled by Notch (24Clegg D.O. Wingerd K.L. Hikita S.T. Tolhurst E.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 723-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Darribere T. Skalski M. Cousin H.L. Gaultier A. Montmory C. Alfandari D. Biol.

Med. 2002; 8: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). α6β1 and α5β1 integrins are highly expressed on stem cells and regulate survival, migration, and differentiation (27Nagato M.

Schumm M.A. Archer D.R. LaPlaca M.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Notch has been shown to associate with β1 integrins in neural stem cells and expression of NOTCH 4 in endothelial cells increases adhesion to collagen (29Campos L.S. Decker L. Taylor V. Skarnes W. J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2830-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, data from zebrafish somitogenesis suggests that mutations in the Notch pathway and integrin α5 subunit can produce a complementary disruption in somite formation (31Julich D. Geisler R. Holley S.A. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that Notch may affect integrin activation, modulating important developmental processes by alternating cell-matrix interactions (32Chong S.W. Jiang Y.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 453-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to investigate whether Notch signaling could activate integrins and define the mechanisms of this important interaction using an in vitro model of integrin affinity.

Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3.1 LacZ from Invitrogen. Cell Lines/Transfection—CHO(αβ-py) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids and G418 antibiotic at 400 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of αβ-py cells was performed with JetPEI™ (Polyplus Transfection Agents, UK) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For γ-secretase inhibition, cells were treated with MW167 (50 μm) at 36 and 12 h prior to analysis. K562 cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. K562 cells were transfected by Nucleofector electroporation (Amaxa, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. K562 cells were seeded onto human recombinant Delta-like ligand-4 (Dll-4) (R & D Systems) coated to plastic (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at 37 °C) for 12 h with or without MW167 (50 μm) or Me2SO (Vehicle) (Calbiochem) as indicated. Flow Cytometry—CHO(αβ-py) cells were transfected with test DNA together with 0.75 μg of Tac-α5 transfection reporter construct. After 48 h, cells were sequentially labeled with PAC-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) (5 μg/ml) ±5mm EDTA or 100 μm MnCl2 in HEPES/NaCl buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4), 1:25 (v/v) anti-mouse IgM-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BIOSOURCE), and 1:50 (v/v) anti-Tac-RPE (ACT-1) (Dako). ToPro3 (Molecular Probes) was added to each sample (1 μm) and integrin affinity was analyzed by three-color flow cytometry. PAC-1 binding was determined by gating for live and highly transfected cells. Integrin activation index (AI) was calculated (AI = ((FN - FI)/(FA - FI)) × 100), where FN is geometric mean (GM) fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PAC-1 binding of the native integrin, FI is mean fluorescence intensity of PAC-1 binding in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, and FA is mean fluorescence intensity of PAC-1 binding in the presence of 100 μm Mn2+. AI was used to calculate percentage of integrin suppression ((AI0 - AI)/(AI0) × 100). AI0 is the activation index with the control vector and AI is the activation index with DNA under test. For analysis of β3 integrin surface expression (independent of integrin affinity), anti-CD61 (β3) antibody (Serotec) was used in the above conditions. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, protein balanced by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 8-12% SDS-PAGE gels (10 μg of protein per lane) and transferred onto Hybond C nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting used anti-hemagglutinin (Y-11), anti-Myc (9E10), anti-ERK2 (C-14), anti-β3 integrin (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (ERK-PT115), and anti-β-actin (AC-40), anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma) in 5% nonfat milk, detected with species-specific horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (DAKO) and chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). CSL-luciferase Activity—CSL-luciferase activity was assayed as previously described (14Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). In brief, αβ-py cells transfected with test DNA plus pGl2 4xCSL-luc (0.2 μg) and pcDNA3.1 LacZ (0.1 μg) were lysed after 48 h and luciferase activity was determined using Steady-Glo (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In parallel samples, galactosidase activity was determined using Galacto-Plus (Tropix). Luciferase activity for each transfection condition was normalized for galactosidase activity and expressed as a -fold change from that observed with empty vector. R-Ras Activation Assay—R-Ras activity was determined by binding to the Ras-binding domain of Raf as previously described (38de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In brief, αβ-py cells were transfected with R-Ras(WT) or R-Ras(G38V) (0.25 μg) and test DNA. Cells were quiescenced in serum-free media and lysed 48 h in buffer (200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 20 min. The clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione S-transferase-Raf-Ras-binding domain coupled to glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed and eluted protein separated by SDS-PAGE. Bound R-Ras was detected by Western blotting for Myc. Cell Adhesion Assay—2 × 105 K562 cells were resuspended in HEPES/NaCl buffer and incubated with 4B4 (Beckman Coulter) (10 μg/ml, 45 min at 37 °C), EDTA (5 mm final concentration), or Mn2+ (100 μm final concentration) as indicated. Cells were seeded into plates coated with fibronectin or poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min 37 °C) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Remaining cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (5 min) and stained with 0.4% methylene blue (5 min). Intracellular methylene blue was eluted with 0.1 m HCl and the optical density (630 nm) of each sample was determined using an automated plate reader. Cell adhesion per condition was expressed as a percentage of total cellular adhesion to poly-l-lysine. HES-1 Expression—Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 K562 cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen), contaminating DNA was removed with RQ1 DNase (Promega) and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of 400 ng of RNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). cDNA quality was verified by PCR amplification of β-actin. Real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed with TaqMan reagents and an ABI 7900HT machine as per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The sequences for HES-1 were CATTCTGGAAATGACAGTGAAGCA; HES-1 rev, CAGCGCAGCCGTCATCT; and HES-1 probe, CTCCGGAACCTGCAGCGGGC Fam-labeled. Triplicate measurements were performed and analyzed with ABI sequence detector software (version 2.1) using the 2-ΔΔCt method. HES-1 expression for each condition was normalized for 18S expression and represented as a -fold change from control cells. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and the appropriate posttest analyses were applied. p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Notch-1 Activates Integrins and Reverses H-Ras/Raf-mediated Integrin Suppression—To investigate whether Notch signaling could modulate integrin activation, we used a well established model of integrin affinity (39Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This utilizes a CHO cell line (αβ-py) that stably expresses an active chimeric integrin (αIIb α6β3β1), which has the ligand binding properties of αIIb β3 but is activated through the α6β1 cytoplasmic domains. We assessed the activation status of the chimeric integrin expressed on the αβ-py cells using flow cytometry to detect binding of a monoclonal antibody specific for the active confirmation of αIIb β3 (PAC-1). A cell surface marker encoding the extracellular domain of the interleukin-2 receptor, termed Tac, and the intracellular domain of the α5 integrin (Tac-α5) was used as a marker for DNA transfection. Transfection of αβ-py cells was detected by flow cytometry using an antibody against the interleukin-2 receptor, Tac-R-PE (R-phycoerythrin). We routinely observed transfection efficiencies of 70-80%. Using this model we were able to determine integrin activation status (geometric mean fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PAC-1 binding) in highly transfected cells (Tac-R-PE positive cells) allowing accurate assessment of the effects of transfected test DNA on integrin affinity. For each DNA transfection we compared PAC-1 binding under “native” conditions to those in the presence of EDTA (maximally inhibited integrins) or manganese (maximally activated integrins) allowing calculation of an integrin activation index as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that expression of the intracellular domain of mouse Notch 1 (designated NIC), which constitutively activates the Notch signaling pathway (14Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar), increased integrin activation in αβ-py cells compared with vector control. This was demonstrated by a rightward shift in PAC-1 binding in highly transfected cells (vector 49.8%, NIC 75% cells in right upper quadrant) (Fig. 1a). There was no change in PAC-1 binding in the untransfected cells. Correspondingly, NIC expression increased integrin activation index (88.4 ± 5.7%) compared with expression of vector alone (67.3 ± 2.2%) (Fig. 1b). The chimeric integrin in αβ-py cells is relatively activated in the resting state. Therefore, we sought to suppress integrin affinity and determine whether Notch signaling would reverse integrin suppression. The small GTP-binding protein H-Ras has been shown to suppress integrin activation (39Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We found that transfection of constitutively active H-Ras(G12V) alone caused marked inhibition of PAC-1 binding; however, co-transfection with NIC completely reversed suppression of integrin activation (Fig. 1, a and b). These effects were not produced by alterations in H-Ras(G12V) or NIC expression when the constructs were co-transfected, nor was expression of the chimeric integrin in the αβ-py cells affected (Fig. 1c). Hughes et al. (39Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) have previously shown that H-Ras-mediated suppression of the chimeric integrin in αβ-py CHO-K1 cells is not a consequence of a decrease in integrin expression levels. To confirm that Notch expression did not alter surface integrin expression we used flow cytometry to detect surface expression of β3 integrins. Using an anti-β3 integrin antibody whose binding was not dependent on integrin activation status we found that neither H-Ras(G12V), NIC, nor R-Ras(G38V) expression altered surface expression of β3 integrins in αβ-py cells (Fig. 1d). Thus changes in PAC-1 binding are due to alterations in integrin activation not expression. H-Ras suppresses integrin activation via its downstream effector kinase Raf-1 (39Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of active Notch to reverse integrin suppression by an activated membrane-targeted variant of Raf, Raf-CAAX. Similar results were observed to those found with H-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 2, a-c). Thus NIC reversed the suppressive effect of activated H-Ras or Raf-1 on integrin affinity, suggesting that Notch signaling can override integrin inactivation caused by the H-Ras-dependent suppression pathway. Previous work has suggested that suppression of integrin activation by H-Ras and Raf-1 is dependent upon ERK1/2 function but does not correlate with bulk phosphorylation of ERK (40Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, reversal of integrin suppression by the small death effector domain-containing protein PEA-15 depends upon its capacity to bind ERK1/2 (40Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Notch signaling has previously been shown to have differing effects on ERK phosphorylation depending upon cellular context (42Sriuranpong V. Borges M.W. Ravi R.K. Arnold D.R. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3200-3205PubMed Google Scholar, 43Eagar T.N. Tang Q. Wolfe M. He Y. Pear W.S. Bluestone J.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Notch signaling could reverse suppression of integrin activation by H-Ras through effects on ERK1/2. We found that transfection with NIC alone did not affect ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, NIC did not affect phosphorylation of ERK induced by H-Ras(G12V) or Raf CAAX (Figs. 1c and 2c). In addition, we were unable to demonstrate a physical association between NIC and ERK1/2 by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). This suggests that Notch modulation of integrin affinity is distinct from the Ras/Raf pathway. Activation of β1 Integrins by Notch-1 Requires Intramembrane Cleavage at S3 to Release the Intracellular Domain—Classically, Notch activation requires ligand-induced cleavage of the Notch receptor ∼12 amino acids N-terminal to the transmembrane domain (S2), which allows intramembrane cleavage (S3) by the protease complex γ-secretase (13Mumm J.S.

However, analysis of the role of Notch in patterning of the Drosophila embryo dorsal epidermis suggest that Notch may signal without membrane cleavage (45Zecchini V. Brennan K. Martinez-Arias A.

We therefore determined whether activation of β1 integrins by Notch was dependent on intramembrane cleavage. Mutants of mouse Notch-1 that are membrane-bound and show differing efficiencies of processing by γ-secretase were used (14Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) (summarized in Fig. 3) to assess rescue of H-Ras(G12V)-induced integrin suppression. All subsequent αβ-py assays are represented as levels of integrin suppression. The Notch mutant NΔE consists of transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse Notch-1 with a short extracellular segment and is cleaved by the γ-secretase complex to yield active intracellular Notch. Transfection of αβ-py cells with NΔE yielded a fragment of similar molecular weight to NIC and reversed H-Ras-mediated integrin suppression without affecting H-Ras expression or ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4, a and b). The effect on integrin activity was less pronounced than observed with NIC, presumably as a result of a lower yield of intracellular Notch from NΔE (Fig. 4a). To investigate this, two Notch mutants were used that are inefficiently processed by γ-secretase and do not yield detectable levels of intracellular Notch: an NΔE variant with a point mutation at amino acid 1774, NΔE(V1774K); and NLNG, which has identical transmembrane/intracellular domains to NΔE but an extracellular domain containing LNG repeats. Transfection of αβ-py cells with NΔE(V1774K) or NLNG did not yield detectable intracellular Notch and did not significantly reverse H-Ras suppression of integrins (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, pre-treatment of αβ-py cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor MW167 blocked the processing of NΔE to intracellular Notch and prevented integrin activation without altering H-Ras(G12V) expression or ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4b).FIGURE 4Notch activation of integrins requires intramembranous (S3) cleavage. a, the effect of Notch mutants NIC, NΔE, NΔE(V1744K), and NLNG (1 μg) on H-Ras(G12V) (0.375 μg)-mediated integrin suppression (mean ± S.E., n = 4 independent experiments).

Utilizing mitochondrial and cytosolic versions of the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, we show that mitochondrially targeted fumarase harboring a TEV protease recognition sequence is efficiently cleaved by the mitochondrial but not by the cytosolic TEV protease. Nonetheless, fumarase was readily cleaved by cytosolic TEV when its import into mitochondria was slowed down by either (i) disrupting the activity of the TOM complex, (ii) lowering the growth temperature, or (iii) reducing the inner membrane electrochemical potential. Accessibility of the fumarase nascent chain to TEV protease under such conditions was prevented by low cycloheximide concentrations, which impede translation. In addition, depletion of the ribosome-associated nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) reduced the fumarase rate of translocation into mitochondria and exposed it to TEV cleavage in the cytosol. These results indicate that cytosolic exposure of the fumarase nascent chain depends on both translocation and translation rates, allowing us to discuss the possibility that import of fumarase into mitochondria occurs while the ribosome is still attached to the nascent chain.

The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and imported into mitochondria. Most matrix-targeted proteins are synthesized as precursors carrying an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), 2The abbreviations used are:MTSmitochondrial targeting sequenceTEVtobacco etch virusDTTdithiothreitolTVSTEV recognition sitetstemperature-sensitiveCHXcycloheximideNACnascent polypeptide-associated complexERendoplasmic reticulumCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone.2The abbreviations used are:MTSmitochondrial targeting sequenceTEVtobacco etch virusDTTdithiothreitolTVSTEV recognition sitetstemperature-sensitiveCHXcycloheximideNACnascent polypeptide-associated complexERendoplasmic reticulumCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. which is usually cleaved off by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) upon entry into the matrix. Precursor proteins are recognized by receptors on the mitochondrial surface and are translocated across the outer membrane through the TOM complex. The precursors are then translocated across the inner membrane through the TIM23 complex in a membrane potential-dependent manner (1Mokranjac D. Neupert W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Truscott K.N. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Curr.

According to in vivo and in vitro studies, most mitochondrial proteins can be successfully imported into mitochondria post-translationally (3Harmey M.A. Hallermayer G. Korb H. Neupert W. Eur. J.

Nevertheless, there are indications for the existence of co-translational or translation-coupled import of proteins into mitochondria. For example, under normal growth conditions (in vivo), mitochondrial precursor proteins are essentially not detected in the cytosol even in extremely short pulse labeling experiments (5Ades I.Z. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9925-9935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cycloheximidetreated yeast cells accumulate a large number of cytosolic polysomes on the surface of mitochondria, and these polysomes are enriched with mRNA encoding mitochondrial proteins (6Kellems R.E.

In addition, in vitro, precursors synthesized to completion in reticulocyte lysate could not be imported into isolated mitochondria (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that the MTS of fumarase can be cleaved by externally added mitochondrial processing peptidase en route to mitochondria in an in vitro translation-translocation coupled reaction (14Karniely S.

Additionally, the mitochondrially targeted TEV protease enables us to establish an import kinetics assay to determine in vivo the translation coupled import time frame. These experimental systems allowed us to investigate the kinetics of mitochondrial protein import in vivo and the possible relationship between the translation and translocation systems.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Marc Bonneu. Plasmid pYEGB713, kindly provided by the group of Walter Neupert, encodes the TEV protease preceded by the Su9-ATPase MTS (79 amino acids). The TEV fragment, in frame with this Su9 presequence, was cloned into the yeast expression vector pYeDP1 and resulted in plasmid pYEGB713 encoding the fusion protein Su9-(1–79)-TEV. Plasmids pFum92TVS and pFum488TVS6H are described in this study. To create pFum92TVS, the TEV site was amplified using primers SeqYep (5′-atatggtggtaatgccatg-3′) and TEVBglII (5′-agatctagattgaaaatacaaattttctgggatccaatccccc-3′) and pFT2 (10Stein I. Peleg Y.

The second step product was cut with DraIII and ApaI and cloned into pFT2. Growth Conditions—Strains harboring the appropriate plasmids were grown in synthetic depleted medium containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose or galactose, CSM dropout mix (Qbiogene) and supplemented with the appropriate amino acids (50 μg/ml). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cultures were grown in synthetic depleted medium containing galactose to A600 nm = 1.5. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in fresh galactose synthetic depleted medium lacking methionine. Cultures were labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated for the time indicated in the figure legends. Labeling was stopped by the addition of 10 mm sodium azide. When needed, 20 μm CCCP was included in the reaction mixture to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas 40 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to reestablish the membrane potential after CCCP treatment. In pulse-chase experiments, labeling and translation were stopped by the addition of excess “cold” 0.003% methionine, 0.004% cysteine, and 0.001% cycloheximide. Samples were withdrawn at the times indicated and placed on ice, and 10 mm sodium azide was added to the samples. Labeled cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, broken with glass beads for 2 min, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant fraction. Supernatants were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS. Immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of one-fourth of the total volume of TENN buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 600 mm NaCl), with the appropriate antiserum or monoclonal anti-polyhistidine (Sigma) and protein A magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by visualization with the BAS2000 image-analyzing system (Fuji Corp.) and autoradiography. TEV Protease Can Be Targeted to the Cytosol or to Mitochondria—In order to express the TEV protease in the cytosol or mitochondria, two vectors were used. Plasmid pYEGB713 encodes the TEV protease preceded by the MTS of Su9-ATPase, and plasmid pYeF1-TEV (17Sagot I. Bonneu M. Balguerie A. Aigle M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) encodes the TEV protease without a preceding MTS. The expression of both TEV constructs is under the GAL10 promoter, which allows regulated expression in galactose-containing medium. To test the cellular location of these TEV proteases, yeast strains expressing either one were induced in galactose medium and were subjected to subcellular fractionation. Probing each fraction with antibodies against Hsp60 or Hxk1, mitochondrial and cytosolic markers, monitored the quality of each fractionation. As seen in Fig. 1, the TEV protease can be targeted exclusively to the cytosol (Fig. 1A, right) or to mitochondria (Fig. 1A, left). Two plasmids encoding fumarase derivatives were constructed; Fum92TVS encodes fumarase with a TEV recognition site (TVS) at a position corresponding to amino acid 92 of the fumarase protein sequence, and Fum488TVS6H harbors a TEV recognition site inserted after the last amino acid of fumarase and is followed by six histidines (His6 tag). These two derivatives provide two checkpoints at different stages of fumarase import and translocation. Fum92TVS allows us to investigate the beginning of the process, whereas Fum488TVS6H allows us to investigate its termination. Although the TEV site of the latter is imported post-translationally, it enabled us to test the kinetics of fumarase import, and it allows us to determine the relationship between translation and translocation. Both plasmids harbor the GAL10 promoter; both the TEV protease and the Fum-TVS proteins are induced in galactose medium. It is important to point out that when expressed in yeast, these two fumarase derivatives are fully imported into mitochondria and do not distribute between the cytosol and mitochondria (not shown). This is expected, because, as we have previously reported, changes within the fumarase mature sequence or the addition of certain tags abolishes the fumarase dual subcellular distribution (18Sass E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45109-45116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This has allowed us to examine fumarase in the context of translocation without the complications of dual targeting of the protein. Cleavage of Fum92TVS by the TEV protease should cause the appearance of a shorter form of fumarase, as detected with specific fumarase antiserum, whereas cleavage of Fum488TVS6H should result in disappearance of the His6 tag, as detected with specific His6 monoclonal antibodies (shown in Fig. 1B). Previous studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that fumarase cannot be imported into mitochondria post-translationally (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine whether the same holds true for our fumarase derivatives (and as referred to in the Introduction), we pulse-labeled yeast expressing fumarase in the presence of the ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which dissipates the inner membrane potential, blocks translocation into mitochondria, and thus causes fumarase precursors to accumulate in the cytosol. Upon release of the translocation block using DTT, we were able to examine whether the cytosolic accumulated precursor can be translocated and processed in mitochondria. Both fumarase-TVS derivative precursors, which were accumulated in the presence of CCCP (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 6 with lanes 1 and 5), could not be chased into mitochondria post-translationally following the treatment with DTT and reestablishment of membrane potential (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 7). Thus, mature fumarase molecules were detected only when translation was coupled to import, either in the absence of CCCP or in the control experiment when cells were labeled after being treated with CCCP and incubated with DTT (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 5 and lanes 4 and 8, respectively). As a control, we used aconitase, which can be imported post-translationally, and as seen in Fig. 2, mature aconitase molecules were detected after releasing the translation block (bottom, lane 3). The results indicate that these fumarase derivatives are not distributed as the wild type protein, yet they are fully targeted to mitochondria in a translation-translocation coupled manner, thereby providing an excellent model to investigate the latter. Fumarase Is Not Cleaved during Import by Cytosolic TEV Protease—To examine whether the nascent chain of fumarase is exposed to the cytosol during import into mitochondria, we expressed each of the Fum-TVS derivatives in combination with a TEV protease localized either in the cytosol or in mitochondria. Western blot analysis was performed on cell extracts expressing these combinations employing fumarase antiserum for detection of Fum92TVS and His6 monoclonal antibodies together with fumarase antiserum for Fum488TVS6H. A single band corresponding to the expected 48-kDa fumarase was detected in yeast cells expressing Fum92TVS in the absence of a TEV protease (Fig. 3A, top, lane 1). When yeast cells co-expressed Fum92TVS and a mitochondrially targeted TEV protease, a second band appeared with a relative molecular mass corresponding to fumarase lacking its first 92 amino acids (Fig. 3A, top, lane 2). In contrast, co-expression of Fum92TVS with a TEV protease localized in the cytosol resulted in a single band without any cleavage products (Fig. 3A, top, lane 3). Matching results were obtained with Fum488TVS6H; co-expression of Fum488TVS6H with mitochondrial TEV protease resulted in the disappearance of the His6 tag (Fig. 3A, bottom, lane 2), whereas in the presence of the cytosolic TEV protease, the His6 tag remained intact (Fig. 3A, bottom, lane 3). The disappearance of the His6 tag is not the result of protein degradation, since all of the fumarase bands are similarly retained when probed with fumarase antiserum (Fig. 3A, middle, lanes 1–3). Fum92TVS is only partially cleaved by the protease in contrast to Fum488TVS6H, which is fully cleaved. One explanation for this observation is that amino acid 92 of fumarase, located in the first domain of the protein based on its resolved crystal structure (19Weaver T. Lees M. Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Duke E. Lindley P. McSweeny S. Svensson A. Keruchenko J. Keruchenko I. Gladilin K. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is accessible for cleavage very transiently before becoming buried within the core of the rapidly folding protein. In any case, the proportion of cleaved to uncleaved Fum92TVS appears to be reproducibly constant under the conditions of our experiments. One prediction is that Fum-TVS derivatives, which fail to be cleaved by the cytosolic TEV protease, due to import into mitochondria, should become substrates of the protease upon blocking of import. We blocked import into mitochondria using CCCP and found that both fumarase-TVS derivatives were cleaved by the cytosolic TEV protease. In the presence of a cytosolically disposed TEV, we detected the smaller form of the protein in the case of Fum92TVS (Fig. 3B, top, compare lanes 5 and 6) and observed the disappearance of the His6 epitope in the case of Fum488TVS6H (Fig. 3B, bottom, compare lanes 5 and 11 to lanes 6 and 12). As expected, CCCP treatment prevented the accessibility of the fumarase-TVS derivatives to the mitochondrial TEV, and they accumulate as full-length (non-cleaved) precursors (Fig. 3B, top (compare lanes 3 and 4) and bottom (compare lanes 3 and 9 with lanes 4 and 10)). As a second control, we expressed fumarase-TVS derivatives lacking their MTS, so that they are localized in the cytosol. In this case, again, the fumarase-TVS derivatives were cleaved by the protease in the cytosol (Fig. 3C, top (lane 2 for Fum92TVS) and bottom (compare lanes 2 and 4 for Fum488TVS6H)). In addition we checked aconitase, which, in contrast to fumarase, can undergo post-translational import into mitochondria (20Regev-Rudzki N. Karniely S. Ben-Haim N.N. Pines O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Aconitase harboring a TEV recognition site is cleaved by either the cytosolic or the mitochondrial TEV (not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that targeting to the mitochondria prevents the fumarase-TVS derivatives from being cleaved by the cytosolic TEV and rule out the possibility that the TEV protease is inactive in the cytosol or may not cleave these substrates in this compartment. Slowing Down Translocation Allows Cleavage of Fumarase by Cytosolic TEV—The observation that the fumarase nascent chain is not exposed to the cytosol during import (as measured by cytosolic TEV cleavage) appears to contradict previous in vitro results, which show that at least the presequence of fumarase is exposed to the cytosol before import (14Karniely S. Regev-Rudzki N. Pines O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this could be that in vitro, import into mitochondria is not as efficient and rapid as in vivo. Therefore, we tested the effect of import rate in vivo on cleavage of the fumarase nascent chain in the cytosol during import. Two TOM complex component mutants were used to slow down protein translocation into mitochondria, a tom40 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant and null mim1. Tom40 forms the translocation channel across the outer membrane and is essential for cell viability under all growth conditions (21Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 22Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfannschmidt S. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our notion was to slow down mitochondrial protein import by limiting the function of the Tom complex with these mutations. The yeast tom40 ts mutant strain was grown at the permissive temperature (25 °C), and then the cells were incubated at the partially restrictive temperature of 30 °C for 8 h. The mim1 deletion strain, which is fully viable, was grown at 30 °C. Total cell extracts were prepared from the cells of both strains, which were then analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The activity of Tom40 in the tom40 ts at 30 °C enabled full import and processing of both Fum92TVS and Fum488TVS6H (Fig. 4) (data not shown). Nevertheless, we detected cleavage of fumarase derivatives not only by the mitochondrial TEV but also the cytosol-targeted protease (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 9 in the top and bottom). Similar results (not shown) were obtained in a mim1 knock-out strain, which was shown to be impaired in the assembly of the TOM complex (23Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Waizenegger T. Schmitt S. Zivkovic J. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results argue against the existence of a seal between the ribosome and the translocon during the import of fumarase. Alternatively, we suggest that fumarase is exposed to the cytosol during translation-coupled import and that slowing down import provides the cytosolic TEV with ample time to cleave the nascent chain prior to translocation. To show that import is actually slowed down in our mutant strains, we developed a strategy for following the kinetics of fumarase import into mitochondria. This is based on the cleavage of incoming nascent chains by mitochondrial TEV. Yeast co-expressing fumarase-TVS derivatives and the mitochondrial targeted TEV protease were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 min and chased for 0, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min. Total cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with fumarase antiserum and His6 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5A). In the wild type strain, both fumarase-TVS derivatives were cleaved during or immediately after translation, and there was no further accumulation of the cleaved form during the chase period (Fig. 5A). These results support our previous findings of translation-coupled import. Although both Fum92TVS and Fum488TVS6H provided similar results, the fact that the latter was fully cleaved by the mitochondrially targeted protease made it our tool of choice for import kinetics experiments. Applying this import kinetics assay to the tom40 ts grown at the partially restrictive temperature (30 °C), we found that fumarase was fully cleaved by mitochondrial TEV only after 3 min of chase (Fig. 5B follows the disappearance of the His6 tag in the top panel from 0 to 3 min; compare top and bottom right panels). This result indicates that the translocation of fumarase into mitochondria in the tom40 ts mutant strain under these conditions is slowed down.FIGURE 5A, cleavage of fumarase by TEV protease in mitochondria (Mit) occurs during or immediately after translation. Induced cultures of yeast expressing Fum92TVS or Fum488TVS6H with or without the mitochondrially targeted TEV protease were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 min, cold methionine/cysteine and cycloheximide were added to initiate the chase, and aliquots were taken at the indicated times. Total cell extracts were prepared and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. B, the tom40 ts mutation slows down fumarase translocation into mitochondria. Induced cultures of the tom40 ts mutants or its corresponding wild type (WT), expressing Fum488TVS6H together with a mitochondrial targeted TEV protease, were pulse-labeled and analyzed as described in A. Shown below is a graphic representation of the accumulation of cleaved fumarase forms as a function of the chase period as deduced from the gels above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also slowed down the translocation of fumarase into mitochondria by incubating yeast cells at lower temperatures. Cells co-expressing Fum92TVS or Fum488TVS6H with the TEV protease either in the cytosol or mitochondria were grown at 30 °C and then incubated for an additional 24 h at 22, 20, or 16 °C. Total cell extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed as described above. Fig. 6 shows that lowering the temperature enabled cytosolic cleavage of both Fum92TVS (top, lanes 7–9) and Fum488TVS6H (compare lanes 7–9 in the middle and bottom panels) by TEV. In both cases, lowering the incubation temperature was concomitant with a higher proportion of molecules cleaved by the cytosolic protease (Fig. 6, top and middle, compare lanes 7–9). The membrane potential across the inner membrane is essential for protein translocation into the matrix. CCCP, a proton ionophore, can at the appropriate concentration dissipate this membrane potential and block import in vivo (25Nelson N. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4365-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our notion was that a low concentration of CCCP, which does not fully block the import into mitochondria, should cause a reduction of the inner membrane potential and slow down protein translocation. Following calibration experiments, we determined that 0.25 μm CCCP does not arrest but slows down fumarase translocation. Yeast cells expressing Fum488TVS6H and the TEV protease in the cytosol were grown in glucose medium, washed, resuspended in galactose medium, and then incubated for 8 h in the presence of 0.25 μm CCCP. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B), showing that all the fumarase molecules were processed by mitochondrial processing peptidase to their mature forms in the presence of 0.25 μm CCCP. Nevertheless, under these conditions, almost all fumarase molecules are cleaved by cytosolic TEV protease, indicating that fumarase is exposed to the cytosol during import (Fig. 6B, compare lane 6 in the lower and upper panels). These results strongly support our suggestion that the translocation rate determines the extent to which fumarase nascent chains are exposed to cytosolic cleavage during import. Slowing Down both Translation and Translocation Annuls Fumarase Cleavage by Cytosolic TEV Protease during Import— Since slowing down translocation exposes fumarase to cytosolic TEV, it was important to test whether the rate of translation can affect this co-translational exposure. For this end, we used sublethal concentrations of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). We assumed that these concentrations would allow a slow down rather than a complete block of translation in vivo. Cells co-expressing Fum92TVS or Fum488TVS6H with TEV protease either in the mitochondria or the cytosol were grown in galactose medium, and CHX was added to final concentrations of 0, 100, and 200 ng/ml. Total cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with fumarase antiserum or anti-His6 tag monoclonal antibodies as described above. As shown in Fig. 7A, 100 and 200 ng/ml CHX reduced translation by 17–24 and 29–48%, respectively (lanes 1–3 in both panels). Obviously, slowing down translation did not block cleavage of either Fum92TVS or Fum488TVS6H by mitochondrial TEV (lanes 4–6). Notably, slowing down translation did not enable cleavage by cytosolic TEV (lanes 7–9). These results suggest that the rate of translation does not affect the import rate and therefore under normal conditions does not affect the exposure of fumarase to the cytosol during import. If, however, translocation is slowed down to allow cleavage of fumarase by cytosolic TEV prior to import (as shown above), we hypothesized that lowering the translation rate could eliminate this cleavage. Yeasts were grown in the presence of 0.25 μm CCCP, which slows import, and 100 ng/ml CHX, which slows translation. Total cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot as described above. As shown in Fig. 7B, slowing down the translation of Fum488TVS6H whose translocation had been slowed down abolishes its cleavage by the cytosolic TEV protease (compare bands in lane 6 with those in lane 3). Slowing translation, thereby reversing the effect of slowing down translocation, is expected only when synthesis and transport are functionally linked and therefore strongly supports a translation-coupled mode of fumarase import. Finally, since our results suggest an interplay between translation and import into mitochondria, we questioned whether ribosome-associated factors may affect the accessibility of fumarase nascent chains to cytosolic TEV cleavage. The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) had originally been identified in mammalian cells as a ribosome-associated factor that interacts with nascent polypeptides (26Funfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 27George R. Beddoe T. Landl K. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Further studies had suggested that the ribosome interacts with the mitochondrial surface and that the NAC plays a role in this interaction (28George R. Walsh P. Beddoe T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized a NAC null strain (egd1Δ, egd2Δ) (28George R. Walsh P. Beddoe T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in which we co-expressed the fumarase TVS derivatives (Fum92TVS and Fum488TVS6H) together with the cytosolic or mitochondrial TEV protease. As shown in Fig. 8, a null NAC background enables cleavage of Fum92TVS (top, compare lanes 6 and 3) and Fum488TVS6H (bottom, compare lanes 6 and 3) by cytosolic TEV protease, whereas these substrates remained intact in the isogenic wild type strain (top (lane 3) and middle (lanes 3 and 6)). The kinetics of the import, in the NAC null strain, were examined as described above and found to be slower (not shown). However, a full understanding of what happens in this mutant remains to be determined. The term “co-translational translocation” immediately brings to mind a picture of the ribosome intimately sitting on a translocon, thereby feeding the translating polypeptide into a membrane channel. The coupling between translation and translocation in this ER-like scenario is not accidental, since in this case, translation is arrested until the ribosome is associated with the translocon. Furthermore, the signal recognition particle and signal recognition particle receptor complexes are dedicated to achieving the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and translocon (30Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Whether co-translational import into the ER involves a seal between the ribosome and the translocon is controversial (31Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 33Heinrich S.U. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yet functional coupling between translation and translocation is widely accepted. In contrast to the ER, in which the mechanism of co-translational import has been thoroughly tackled, the same question of cotranslational import into mitochondria remains obscure. Here, we have focused on fumarase import as a model for translation-coupled import into mitochondria. Although fumarase cannot be imported post-translationally, in this study, we show that in vivo fumarase is exposed to TEV protease in the cytosol during import. This result is consistent with the requirement for cytosolic chaperones of the Ssa (Hsp70) family for fumarase import in vivo, suggesting that they interact with the protein in the cytosol prior to or during translocation (14Karniely S. Regev-Rudzki N. Pines O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Sass E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45109-45116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with translation-coupled import in vitro, in which the presequence of fumarase is accessible to cleavage by externally added mitochondrial processing peptidase en route to mitochondria (14Karniely S. Regev-Rudzki N. Pines O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The novel feature that we propose in this study is a time frame for this “translation-coupled import” and a relationship between the translating ribosome and the translocon during in vivo import. Fumarase is not cleaved by cytosolic TEV protease during import (Fig. 9, Normal) unless translocation is slowed down by a mutation in a Tom complex component, by reducing the potential across the inner membrane, or by reducing the growth temperature (Fig. 9, Relaxed). From this, we can conclude that the time frame of import is in the order of TEV enzyme kinetics. We have found that slowing down or even stopping translocation into mitochondria does not affect the translation of fumarase (34Karniely, S. (2006) Yeast Fumarase as a Model for Subcellular Distribution and Co-translational Import of Proteins into Mitochondria, Ph.D. thesis, Hebrew University, JerusalemGoogle Scholar). Here we show that under normal conditions, slowing translation does not affect exposure of fumarase to cytosolic TEV during import. Nevertheless, if translocation is slowed down, this causes exposure of fumarase to cytosolic TEV during import, which can be reversed by slowing down translation (Fig. 9, reversal of relaxed to normal). From this, we learn that the two processes, translation and translocation, are not directly dependent on one another, but the relative rate at which they occur determines the exposure of the translating-translocating polypeptide to TEV in the cytosol during import. In other words, if translation is faster than translocation, the surplus of “not yet” translocated polypeptides can be cleaved by cytosolic TEV protease. One possibility that we favor is that the import of fumarase occurs while the nascent chain is still associated with the ribosome based on (i) the strict requirement of translation coupled import of fumarase in vivo and in vitro, (ii) the extremely fast kinetics of import and processing of fumarase in vivo (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), (iii) the results of this study, in which we show that fumarase cannot be cleaved by cytosolic TEV protease unless translocation is slowed down and that this may be reversed by reduced translation, and (iv) the finding that NAC, a ribosomal associated complex, can affect exposure of fumarase to cytosolic TEV protease during import. This latter finding is consistent with the possibility that NAC mediates the interaction between the ribosome and translocon, which in turn affects translocation efficiency of substrates via translation-coupled import (28George R. Walsh P. Beddoe T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is worth mentioning the known affinity of the ribosome for the TOM complex and the mitochondrial surface (6Kellems R.E. Allison V.F. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3297-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kellems R.E. Allison V.F. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 65: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Marc P.

How is translation-coupled import of fumarase ensured? In other words how is the ribosome (translating fumarase) situated on, or at least in the vicinity of, the translocon in order to guarantee translocation into mitochondria rather than precursor folding into an irreversible import incompetent state in the cytosol? This latter fate in vivo and in vitro indeed occurs rapidly if fumarase is translated in the absence of mitochondrial import (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Karniely S. Regev-Rudzki N. Pines O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms have been suggested to provide the feasibility of translation-coupled import: (i) targeting of mRNA to mitochondria (8Marc P. Margeot A. Devaux F. Blugeon C. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Ades I.Z. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9918-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) efficient MTS-mediated targeting of nascent polypeptides to mitochondria (29Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); and (iii) the existence of unidentified ribosome targeting apparatus like the signal recognition particle/signal recognition particle receptor in the ER. Finally, this study presents an experimental system for determining exposure of nascent chains during import and evaluating mitochondrial protein import kinetics in vivo. We have obtained analogous results for Fum92TEV and Fum488TEV6h, which are situated toward the N terminus and at the C terminus of fumarase, respectively. We have used this experimental approach to describe what appears to be a novel version of translation-coupled import of a protein into mitochondria. We thank M. Bonneu for plasmid pYeF1-TEV and W.

In corin null mice, pro-ANP to ANP conversion was abolished, demonstrating that corin is the long sought physiological pro-ANP convertase (12Chan J.C. Knudson O. Wu F. Morser J. Dole W.P. Wu Q. Proc.

Corin has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and an integral transmembrane domain. In its extracellular region, there are two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains, eight low density lipoprotein receptor repeats, a scavenger receptor-like cysteine-rich domain, and a trypsin-like protease domain at the C terminus (1Hooper J.D.

Like most trypsin-like proteases, corin is made as a single chain zymogen, as shown by Western blots under reducing conditions (1Hooper J.D. Scarman A.L. Clarke B.E. Normyle J.F. Antalis T.M. Eur. J.

Mutant corin R801A, in which Arg-801 was replace by an Ala, had no detectable activity in functional assays, indicating that proteolytic cleavage at Arg-801 is required to convert corin zymogen to an active enzyme (19Knappe S.

For many proteolytic enzymes, zymogen activation is one of the most important steps in regulating their biological activities. To date, however, the physiological corin activator has not been identified. Little is known about how corin activity is controlled in vivo. The calculated mass for human corin protein is ∼116 kDa (3Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol.

In Western blotting analysis, recombinant human corin from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells appeared as a band of ∼150 kDa (19Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol.

Clarke B.E. Normyle J.F. Antalis T.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6931-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The difference between the calculated and actually observed values in molecular mass suggests that corin protein may be extensively glycosylated. This is consistent with 19 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular region of human corin (3Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Most of these N-glycosylation sites are conserved in rat and mouse corin proteins (21Langenickel T.H.

It is possible that carbohydrate moieties may play a similar role in corin. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining corin zymogen activation in HEK 293 cells, mouse atrial cardiomyocyte HL-1 cells (26Claycomb W.C. Lanson N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), and primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Our results showed that a fraction of rat corin zymogen was converted to biologically active enzyme in these cells and that N-glycosylation was required for this activation process. Treatment of HEK 293 and HL-1 cells with tunicamycin or mutations altering the N-glycosylation sites in the protease domain prevented rat corin zymogen activation. Our data indicate that N-glycans are important in regulating corin biosynthesis and activity. Cell Culture-HEK 293 and its derived cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The murine atrial cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1, a generous gift from Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans), was cultured in Claycomb medium with 10% FBS, 100 μm norepinephrine, and 4 mm l-glutamine in gelatin/fibronectin-coated flasks or plates. Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from hearts of 1-day-old rats and cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as described previously (27Liao X. Liu J.M. Du L. Tang A. Shang Y. Wang S.Q. Chen L.Y. Chen Q. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The use of new born rats was approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Institutes of Health. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Corin Expression Vectors-The full-length rat corin cDNA was cloned from a heart library. First, total RNA was isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat hearts using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). First strand cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide primers based on the published rat corin cDNA sequence (21Langenickel T.H. Pagel I. Buttgereit J. Tenner K. Lindner M. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subjected to a second round PCR using Phusion High Fidelity polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) with sense primer 5′-CAG TCA TGG GCA GGG TTT CTT TCA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCC TTG GGA TTT CTT TTG GAG AAA GGT C-3′ to delete the original stop codon. The PCR product was gel-purified and made an overhanging 3′-adenine by a 20-min incubation at 72 °C with Taq polymerase and a dNTP mixture (1 mmol/liter), and cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5-6xHis TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid, pcDNAratCorin, encoded rat corin protein containing a viral V5 tag at its C terminus, which allowed the detection by an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) in Western blotting. Plasmids expressing rat corin mutants R866A, N968S, and N1087S to replace residues Arg-866, Asn-968, and Asn-1087 with Ala, Ser, and Ser, respectively, were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using vector pcDNAratCorin as a template. The oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis (with mutation site underlined) were as follows: R866A-forward, 5′-A ATG AAC AAG GCC ATC CTT GGG GGT CGG AC-3′, and R866A-reverse, 5′-GT CCG ACC CCC AAG GAT GGC CTT GTT CAT T-3′; N968S-forward, 5′-AGT GAT GAT ATC ATC AGT GAG ACA AG-3′, and N968S-reverse, 5′-TGT CTC ACT GAT ATC ATC ACT C-3′; N1087S-forward, 5′-GTG TAC AGC AGT GTG TCT TAC TTT-3′, and N1087S-reverse, 5′-AAA GTA AGA CAC ACT GCT GTA CAC-3′. A human corin cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a human fetal heart library (BioChain, Hayward, CA) using Phusion High Fidelity polymerase with sense primer 5′-AGA GAA AAG CGA CCA AGA TAA A-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AGG CCA TTT TCT TTT AGT GTA GC-3′ based on the published human corin cDNA sequence (3Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into pBS(II)-KS plasmid (Stratagene) and subjected to a second round PCR using sense primer 5′-AGA GAA AAG CGA CCA AGA TAA A-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTT TAG GAG AAA GGT CTG GAT G-3′ to remove the original stop codon. The PCR fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5–6xHis TOPO vector, and the resultant plasmid, pcDNAhumanCorin, encoded human corin with a V5 tag at the C terminus. All expression plasmids used in this study were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. To express recombinant rat corin in primary cardiomyocytes, a lentiviral vector and packaging system, a generous gift from the Stark laboratory (Cleveland Clinic Foundation), was used. The plasmid pcDNAratCorin was digested with HindIII and PmeI to release the cDNA insert, which was blunted with Klenow enzyme and inserted into pLV-puro vector to yield vector pLVratCorin. Lentivirus was packaged in HEK 293T cells by co-transfection of pLVratCorin with packaging plasmid pCMVΔR8.74 and envelope plasmid pDM2G (28Jackson M.W. Agarwal M.K. Yang J. Bruss P. Uchiumi T. Agarwal M.L. Stark G.R. Taylor W.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected twice with the lentivirus in the conditioned medium from transfected 293T packaging cells. Transfection and Western Blotting-HEK 293 and HL-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instruction. Expressed proteins were detected by Western blotting. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), and a protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 dilution; Sigma). Protein samples were mixed with a loading buffer with (reducing) or without (nonreducing) 2% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min before being loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting of recombinant corin and pro-ANP was done using a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-V5 (anti-V5-HRP) antibody, as described previously (5Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). For stable transfection, transfected cells were selected in DMEM containing G418 (500 μg/ml, Sigma). Cell clones expressing corin were identified by Western blotting. To quantify activated corin fragments, x-ray films from Western blotting were scanned by a densitometer (The PharosFx System, Bio-Rad). The optical density of the bands representing corin zymogen and the protease domain was measured, and the percentage of the activated molecules was calculated using the Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). Corin-mediated Pro-ANP Processing-A cell-based assay was used to examine corin-mediated pro-ANP processing, as described previously (20Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 29Wu C. Wu F. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25847-25852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with plasmids expressing human pro-ANP (pcDNAproANP) (20Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and rat or human corin (pcDNAratCorin or pcDNAhumanCorin) and incubated for 16 h. Conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using an anti-V5 antibody against the tag attached to the C terminus of recombinant pro-ANP/ANP followed by Western blotting using the anti-V5-HRP antibody. On Western blots, recombinant human pro-ANP and ANP with the V5 tag appeared as bands of ∼23 and ∼11 kDa, respectively, as described previously (20Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 29Wu C. Wu F. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25847-25852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In some experiments, conditioned medium containing pro-ANP was first prepared in transfected HEK 293 cells, then added (2 ml/well) to HL-1 cells or HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant corin in 6-well plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, as described above. Effects of Small Molecule Inhibitors-Transfected HEK 293 and HL-1 cells expressing recombinant rat corin were grown in DMEM. Small molecule inhibitors, including trypsin-like protease inhibitors (10 mm benzamidine and 100 μm leupeptin), a metalloproteinase inhibitor (20 μm GM 6001) (30Park H.I. Turk B.E. Gerkema F.E. Cantley L.C. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35168-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a cysteine protease inhibitor (100 μm N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methionine (ALLM)) (31Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were added to the cells in separate wells and incubated for 16 h. Recombinant rat corin and its derived fragments were analyzed by Western blotting, as described above. Glycosidase Digestion-To analyze the carbohydrate contents in rat and human corin proteins, glycosidase digestion was done using a deglycosylation kit from Prozyme (San Leandro, CA). Briefly, HEK 293 cells expressing rat or human corin in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected, and lysed in 100 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysate containing ∼100 μg of protein was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min in 42.5 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Denatured and reduced proteins were digested without (control) or with 5 × 10–3 units of N-glycanase, O-glycanase, and sialidase A, either individually or in combination, at 37 °C for 16 h. Protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody. Effects of Tunicamycin-Effects of tunicamycin on corin zymogen activation and pro-ANP processing activity were examined in HEK 293 cells expressing rat corin. Confluent (∼95%) cells in 6-well plates were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without tunicamycin (1 μg/ml; Sigma). After 16 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with serum-free medium. Conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-ANP was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. As a control for potential direct effect of tunicamycin on corin or pro-ANP, tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) was added to pro-ANP containing medium and incubated for 1 h with HEK 293 that were not pretreated with the antibiotic. Pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Recombinant corin expression in HEK 293 cells with or without tunicamycin treatment was verified by Western blotting of cell lysate. Similar experiments were done with HL-1 cells, which appeared to be more resistant to tunicamycin inhibition. As a result, a higher concentration (10 μg/ml) of tunicamycin was used during the 16-h incubation period. Pro-ANP processing was examined as described above. Analysis of Biotin-labeled Cell Surface Protein Expression-HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant rat corin in 60-mm dishes were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 3 ml of PBS, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were quenched by a 10-min incubation in 3 ml of PBS with 100 mm glycine. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min in 300 μl of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), and a protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 dilution). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and protein concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μl using the lysis buffer. Streptavidin-Sepharose beads (50 μl in a 50:50 (beads/buffer volume) slurry) were added to 300 μl of cell lysate, and the mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and boiled in 50 μl of sample loading buffer. Protein eluates were analyzed by Western blotting. Expression of Rat Corin in HEK 293 Cells-The full-length rat corin cDNA was cloned from a Sprague-Dawley rat heart library by PCR based on the published sequence (21Langenickel T.H. Pagel I. Buttgereit J. Tenner K. Lindner M. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A plasmid vector was made to express recombinant rat corin with a V5 tag at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). To test the activity of recombinant rat corin, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with a pro-ANP expression vector and the rat corin expression vector. Western blotting of the conditioned medium indicated that pro-ANP was converted to ANP in cells expressing rat corin (data not shown), confirming that recombinant rat corin was biologically active. N-Linked Glycosylation in Rat and Human Corin-HEK 293 cell lysates containing recombinant rat or human corin were digested with N-glycanase, O-glycanase, and sialidase A and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against the V5 tag at the C termini of recombinant rat and human corin. Under reducing conditions, rat corin appeared as a major band of ∼170 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 1), whereas human corin appeared as two bands of ∼150 and ∼130 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B, lane 7). The result was consistent with rat corin being 69 amino acids longer than human corin (1111 versus 1042 amino acids) (3Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Langenickel T.H. Pagel I. Buttgereit J. Tenner K. Lindner M. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase) F digestion reduced the apparent mass of rat corin to ∼130 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2) and that of human corin to ∼110 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 8). It appeared that the ∼150- and ∼130-kDa species of human corin were differentially N-glycosylated products. Digestion with O-glycanase and sialidase A, either individually or in combination, did not yield noticeable reduction in the apparent mass of rat and human corin (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6, and 9). The results indicate that the majority, if not all, of carbohydrate moieties on corin are N-linked oligosaccharides. Interestingly, a minor band of ∼40 kDa was detected in cell lysate with rat, but not human, corin (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Upon PNGase F, but not O-glycanase or sialidase A, digestion, this band was reduced to ∼35 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–6). Based on its size, this band appeared to be the corin protease fragment produced by activation cleavage (Fig. 1A). Consistently, this domain of rat corin contains two potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-968 and Asn-1087) (21Langenickel T.H. Pagel I. Buttgereit J. Tenner K. Lindner M. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the V5 tag was attached to the C terminus of recombinant corin proteins, the anti-V5 antibody would not detect the cleaved N-terminal propeptide in our experiments. Detection of Cleaved Rat Corin Protease Fragments in HEK 293 and HL-1 Cells, and Neonatal Cardiomyocytes-If the observed ∼40-kDa band in lysate from HEK cells expressing rat corin was the activated corin protease fragment, it is expected to be attached to the propeptide region by a disulfide bond connecting Cys residues 855 and 977 (Fig. 1A) (3Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Langenickel T.H. Pagel I. Buttgereit J. Tenner K. Lindner M. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On Western blots, the propeptide and the activated protease domain should appear as a single band under nonreducing conditions. This was confirmed upon further studies. The ∼40-kDa band was detected by Western blotting under reducing but not nonreducing conditions in HEK 293 cells expressing rat corin (Fig. 2A). To examine if the activation cleavage occurs in physiologically relevant cardiomyocytes, recombinant rat corin was expressed in murine atrial cell line HL-1 and rat primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. Western blotting analysis of cell lysate showed a similar ∼40-kDa band in HL-1 cells and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes under reducing but not nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2A). This band represented a small fraction of overall corin protein in these cells, as estimated by densitometry. In lysate from HEK 293 cells expressing human corin, this ∼40-kDa band was barely visible (Fig. 2B). The results were consistent with our previous observation that only a very low percentage of human corin molecules was activated in HEK 293 cells. Lack of Activation Cleavage in Mutant Rat Corin R866A-To confirm that the observed ∼40-kDa band indeed was generated by cleavage at the conserved activation site, a plasmid construct was made to express mutant rat corin R866A, in which Arg-866 was replaced by an Ala to abolish the activation site (21Langenickel T.H. Pagel I. Buttgereit J. Tenner K. Lindner M. Dietz R. Willenbrock R. Bader M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Here, we identify a new class of heme-binding oxygen sensors, reveal their unusual phylogenetic origin, and propose a sensing mode of a member of this class. We show that heme is bound noncovalently to the central region of AppA, an oxygen and light sensor from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The addition of oxygen to ferrous AppA discoordinated the heme, and subsequent oxygen removal fully restored the heme coordination. In vitro, the extent of heme discoordination increased gradually with the rise in oxygen levels over a broad concentration range. This response correlated well with the gradual decrease in transcription of photosynthesis genes regulated by AppA and its partner repressor PpsR. We conclude that the AppA-PpsR regulatory system functions as an oxygen-dependent transcriptional rheostat. We identified a new domain embedded in the central region of AppA and designated it SCHIC for sensor containing heme instead of cobalamin. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that SCHIC domain proteins form a distinct cluster within a superfamily that includes vitamin B12-binding proteins and other proteins that may bind other kinds of tetrapyrroles.

Oxygen is a dominant environmental factor affecting metabolic, physiological, and behavioral responses in prokaryotes to humans. All life forms have oxygen-sensing proteins that monitor fluctuations in oxygen levels. Proteins containing heme cofactors have evolved to function in oxygen sensing due to the affinity of heme iron for oxygen. Since discovery of the first heme-containing oxygen sensor (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), several new types of such sensors have emerged (reviewed in Ref. 2Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the full spectrum of heme-based sensors is still being uncovered. In this work, we report the identification of a novel class of heme-based oxygen sensory proteins and characterize its first representative, the AppA protein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Oxygen plays a central role in influencing lifestyles in this facultatively phototrophic proteobacterium, which is renowned for its metabolic versatility (3Pappas C.T. Sram J. Moskvin O.V. Ivanov P.S. Mackenzie R.C. Choudhary M. Land M.L. Larimer F.W. Kaplan S. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, R. sphaeroides derives energy by aerobic respiration. Decreased oxygen levels signal potential threats to the energy supplies and induce development of the photosynthetic apparatus: an alternative energy-generating system that operates in sunlight in the absence of oxygen. The formation of the photosynthetic apparatus requires significant up-regulation of expression of numerous photosynthesis genes. The AppA-PpsR system plays a key role in this process. By repressing photosynthesis genes at high oxygen conditions as well as at high light conditions in low oxygen, this regulatory system prevents the wasteful production of a photosynthetic apparatus under inappropriate conditions and protects cells from (photo)oxidative damage (4Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 128-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Braatsch S. Moskvin O.V. Klug G.

It was suggested that AppA senses oxygen indirectly, via its carboxyl-terminal Cys-rich domain (11Masuda S. Bauer C.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This approximately 50-amino-acid long fragment contains 6 Cys residues (4Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J.

Here, we show that the central domain of AppA binds heme noncovalently and is required for oxygen sensing. We find that this heme-binding domain is distantly related to the vitamin B12-binding domain. We investigate effects of oxygen on AppA in vitro and in vivo. Microbiological and Molecular Genetic Methods—The growth conditions for R. sphaeroides, genetic manipulations, and complementation of the anaerobic photosynthetic growth of the appA null mutant, APP11, were performed as described earlier (9Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35319-35325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Plasmid p484-Nco5ΔC expressing the AppA derivative lacking the Cys-rich domain was constructed as follows. Plasmid p484Nco5 (4Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the full-length appA gene was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) to construct a stop codon at the boundary of the Cys-rich domain (between amino acids 396 and 397) followed by an EcoRI restriction site. The following primers were used for mutagenesis: APP-DCYS-F, 5′-GGCCGCCCTCGCCCGTTGAATTCTGCCCGGCCAATGCCG-3′, and APP-DCYS-R, 5′-CGGCATTGGCCGGGCAGAATTCAACGGGCGAGGGCGGCC-3′, where the EcoRI site is shown in bold and the stop codon is underlined. The truncated appA derivative was cut out (using HindIII and EcoRI) from the mutagenized plasmid and cloned into broad host range vector pRK415 (14Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35319-35325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) into the XbaI site of vector pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs). Plasmid pMapp-TEPY for overexpression of the central region of AppA was constructed by cloning of the PCR fragment corresponding to amino acids 197-392 of AppA into pMAL-c2X (digested with EcoRI and XbaI). The following primers were used for fragment amplification: App-TEPY-RI, 5′-CGGAATTCCTCTCCGATCTGCTGAGCAC-3′, and App-TEPY-Spe, 5′-GGACTAGTCAGGCCGGAAGCAGCGCAAGATG-3′, where restriction sites are shown in bold. Protein Overproduction and Purification—AppA and its central region were purified as carboxyl-terminal fusions to MBP using amylose affinity chromatography according to specifications of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Induction of protein expression was done at 24 °C by using isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.25 mm, final concentration) for 4 h. Following elution from the amylose column, the proteins were collected and either used immediately or stored at -70 °C in 20% v/v glycerol (final concentration). Protein-Cofactor Interactions—Protein-hemin reconstitutions in vitro were performed as follows. The freshly purified protein (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm maltose) was transferred into an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI). Residual oxygen was removed by the addition of 4 mm glucose, 0.25% glucose oxidase (Sigma, 200 units ml-1), and 0.125% catalase (Sigma, 10,000 units ml-1) followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature. Then glycerol was added to protein solution to achieve 20% v/v (final concentration), and the solution was put on ice. Hemin solution of known concentration was slowly added in 0.2:1 (hemin:protein) molar aliquots. A spectrum was recorded 10 min after the addition of a hemin aliquot to the protein against a cuvette containing the same concentration of free hemin. The reconstituted protein-hemin complex was separated from the unbound hemin by passing through a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column. The reduced deoxy form of the AppA protein reconstituted with hemin was obtained by reduction with dithionite (10 mm) followed by removal of the reductant by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. The oxidized (FeIII, met) form of AppA was obtained from anoxically reconstituted holo-AppA after incubation with an equimolar amount of potassium ferricyanide and subsequent ferricyanide removal by gel filtration under anoxic conditions. CO, NO, and oxygen were added as gas-saturated buffers prepared by bubbling the degassed buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with corresponding gases for 30 min, under controlled pressure and temperature. Spectroscopy—Electronic absorption UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Cary 4000 spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc). Laser flash photolysis measurements were done with an LKS.60 laser kinetic spectrometer from Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK). The spectrometer was fitted with a Pi-star stopped-flow drive unit for stopped-flow and flow-flash measurements. For sample excitation, the LKS.60 spectrometer was coupled to a Quantel Brilliant B Nd:YAG laser with second harmonic generation. Data acquisition was provided by an Agilent 54830B digital oscilloscope for fast measurements or a 12-bit ADC card within the instrument work station for slow measurements. Kinetic traces of CO binding were fit into exponential models to calculate the observed binding rate. DNA Microarray Experiments—These were performed using R. sphaeroides whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays, GeneChips (Affymetrix), as described earlier (3Pappas C.T. Sram J. Moskvin O.V. Ivanov P.S. Mackenzie R.C. Choudhary M. Land M.L. Larimer F.W. Kaplan S. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from cultures grown under continuous sparging with gas mixtures containing appropriate oxygen concentrations. The growth conditions, protocols for RNA extraction, and processing were described earlier (3Pappas C.T. Sram J. Moskvin O.V. Ivanov P.S. Mackenzie R.C. Choudhary M. Land M.L. Larimer F.W. Kaplan S.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2148-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The GeneChips were hybridized using a fluidics station and scanned using a Gene-Chip scanner (Affymetrix) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility, according to specifications provided by the manufacturer. Expression values were generated using robust multiarray analysis with quantile normalization (15Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Differential gene expression was evaluated as described earlier (3Pappas C.T. Sram J. Moskvin O.V. Ivanov P.S. Mackenzie R.C. Choudhary M. Land M.L. Larimer F.W. Kaplan S. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The DNA microarray data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data base, platform GPL162, series GSE7004. Phylogenetic Analysis—The amino acid sequence of the central domain of AppA was submitted to psi-BLAST protein-protein search. Considering the high GC content of R. sphaeroides (67%), we applied a conditional compositional score matrix adjustment (16Altschul S.F. Wootton J.C. Gertz E.M. Agarwala R. Morgulis A. Schaffer A.A. Yu Y.-K. FEBS J. 2005; : 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), which improved the search sensitivity. Sequences obtained after the second psi-BLAST iteration were aligned using ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). The alignment was restricted to the region conserved in all the tested sequences. A draft phylogenetic tree was constructed from 196 restricted sequences using the neighbor-joining method (18Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Sixty sequences representing all major branches and covering the widest range of taxa were selected. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the minimum evolution method (19Rzhetsky A. Nei M. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with the close neighbor interchange algorithm implemented in the MEGA3 package (20Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief. Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10647) Google Scholar). Robustness of the tree was evaluated using the interior branch test with 50,000 replicates. The overall tree architecture matched the architecture of the draft tree and remained essentially unchanged when the maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood methods were substituted for minimum evolution. Alignments were prepared for presentation using the BioEdit software (21Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). Localization of the Oxygen-sensing Domain in AppA—We knew from our earlier studies that the amino-terminal 190 residues of AppA (including the BLUF domain) (Fig. 1A) were dispensable for oxygen sensing (9Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35319-35325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the Cys-rich domain, we constructed AppAΔC, an AppA derivative lacking this domain (residues 397-450) (Fig. 1A). We tested whether or not AppAΔC would still respond to changes in oxygen levels in vivo. To this end, we introduced this truncated derivative into the R. sphaeroides appA null mutant, which cannot up-regulate photosynthesis genes under anoxic conditions and, therefore, is impaired in phototrophic growth (4Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the expression of AppAΔCinthe appA null mutant rescued photosynthetic apparatus development (not shown) and anaerobic photosynthetic growth (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the Cys-rich domain is either fully or partially dispensable for oxygen sensing. Therefore, the central region of AppA (Fig. 1A) must be involved in oxygen sensing. Central Region of AppA Binds Heme—We overexpressed in Escherichia coli the central AppA region (residues 197-392) as a fusion to the maltose-binding protein, MBP (Fig. 1A). The absorption spectra of the purified protein showed a peak at 415 nm (Fig. 2A, black trace). This peak was small and must have been masked by the spectrum of FAD bound to the BLUF domain in the preparations of the full-length protein studied earlier. The addition of sodium dithionite resulted in a shift of the 415 nm peak to 427 nm, as well as in the appearance of new bands at 560 and 530 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A, red trace). This absorption pattern is characteristic of heme-protein complexes. However, it appeared that only ∼5% of the purified protein contained heme. When we purified the central region of AppA under highly reducing conditions from anaerobically grown E. coli supplemented with a common tetrapyrrole precursor, δ-amino levulinate, the relative amount of bound heme dramatically increased (not shown). We cleaved off the MBP and separated the proteins by ion exchange chromatography. As expected, all the heme was associated with AppA and not with MBP (not shown). This suggests that AppA is a heme-binding protein and that heme may serve as an oxygen-sensing cofactor. Interestingly, the central region of AppA shows no sequence similarity to previously described heme-containing oxygen sensors (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 22Fu R. Wall J.D. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 344-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S.

When we overexpressed the full-length AppA protein (as an MBP fusion), we found that it also contained heme (not shown), as expected. Reconstitution of the Apo-AppA with Hemin—When we reconstituted the apo-MBP-AppA with hemin (iron protoporphyrin IX) in vitro, we could achieve a 1:1 molar hemin:protein ratio if the reconstitution was performed under reducing and anoxic conditions (Fig. 2B). The hemin-protein complex reconstituted under these conditions was relatively stable after subsequent exposure to oxygen. Importantly, all hemin remained protein-bound after gel filtration, indicating a high affinity of AppA for hemin. However, reconstitutions performed on air resulted in unstable heme-AppA complexes. The nature of this instability is not yet fully understood. Under anoxic conditions, hemin bound so rapidly to the AppA that the protein became saturated with hemin within 2 s after mixing with this cofactor in a stopped-flow spectrometer (Fig. 2E). The α (560 nm) and β (530 nm) peaks present in the absorption spectra of deoxy-AppA suggest a hexacoordinate state for the heme iron (Fig. 2C, black trace). As discussed below, the axial heme iron ligand is likely to be a His residue. Ligand Binding by the Holo-AppA Protein—The addition of CO to the deoxy-AppA resulted in a characteristic carbonmonoxy heme spectrum with a sharp Soret peak at 421 nm, as well as broad α and β bands (Fig. 2C, orange trace). The association rate constant for binding of CO to deoxy-AppA, as measured by flash photolysis, was 1.03 ± 0.02 μm-1 s-1 (Fig. 2E), similar to the on-rate constants reported for binding of CO myoglobin and hemoglobins (27Quillin M.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16746-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.E. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) but about 1000-fold faster than the rate constants reported for the oxygen sensor Dos from E. coli that contains a heme-binding PAS domain (30Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The addition of NO to deoxy-AppA did not result in a typical nitrosyl hemeprotein spectrum. Instead, the Soret peak broadened and shifted to 401 nm and decreased in amplitude (Fig. 2C, blue trace). Similar changes occur in the absorption spectra of soluble guanylate cyclase protein on the addition of NO. These changes in guanylate cyclase are due to discoordination of the heme iron from the axial His residue and the formation of a pentacoordinate nitrosyl-heme complex (31Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham R.W. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Yoshimura T. Ozaki T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The similarities in the absorption spectra suggest that AppA undergoes similar changes. The oxidized (FeIII, met) form of holo-AppA was obtained from the deoxy form by oxidation with potassium ferricyanide under the anoxic conditions followed by ferricyanide removal by gel filtration. The met-AppA had a Soret absorption peak at 415 nm (Fig. 2D, black trace). MBP-AppA protein purified from the aerobically grown E. coli showed the same absorption band (Fig. 2A), indicating that it contained an oxidized heme. After the addition of cyanide, a known ligand of ferric heme, to met-AppA, the Soret peak shifted to 420 nm (Fig. 2D, cyan trace), consistent with production of the cyanomet form. Interactions of AppA with Oxygen in Vitro and in Vivo—The addition of oxygen to deoxy-AppA resulted in a decrease in the Soret peak amplitude, a blue shift in its position, and the appearance of a shoulder at 380 nm (Fig. 3A). At the same time, α and β peaks disappeared and were replaced by a new shallow peak at 540 nm (Fig. 3A, inset), which indicated a loss of coordination (i.e. discoordination) of the heme iron at the axial position and the formation of a pentacoordinate oxygenated complex. Importantly, the absorption changes caused by oxygen were fully reversible; the amplitude and the position of the Soret peak as well as the amplitude and positions of α and β peaks were restored upon removal of oxygen by the glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase system (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the response of AppA to oxygen was concentration-dependent. The extent of heme iron discoordination increased gradually as oxygen levels increased over a broad range of concentrations, from trace amounts of oxygen introduced by passing a few air bubbles through the anoxic protein solution to 600 μm, which was the highest oxygen concentration used in this experiment (Fig. 3C). Subsequent removal of oxygen by the glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase system resulted in full restoration of the spectrum of hexacoordinate deoxy form regardless of the initial oxygen concentration (not shown). Therefore, coordination of the axial heme ligand in AppA can apparently be ruptured by binding of either NO or oxygen, but not CO, and heme discoordination is proportional to oxygen concentration. To test whether oxygen binding resulted in the oxidation of the ferrous heme iron to the ferric state, we examined the interactions of the holo-AppA protein with oxygen in a background of potassium cyanide. Since cyanide binds to the ferric iron (Fig. 2D), we expected that it would “freeze” the heme in the cyanomet form whenever oxidation occurred. We found that the absorption changes of holo-AppA in response to varying oxygen concentrations were identical with or without potassium cyanide (data not shown). Since oxygen binding to deoxy-AppA does not result in oxidation of the heme iron, the proposed mechanism of heme discoordination upon oxygen binding appears the most plausible route for oxygen sensing by AppA. The ability of holo-AppA to respond gradually and reversibly to changing oxygen levels place this protein in a good position to function as an oxygen sensor. Heme discoordination is known to result in significant changes in protein conformation (33Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We propose that these regulatory conformational changes in AppA promote dissociation of the AppA-PpsR complexes, thus allowing the released PpsR protein to repress photosynthesis genes. Since the amount of the discoordinated heme is proportionate to the oxygen concentration in vitro (Fig. 3C, inset), one may expect that in vivo, expression of the AppA-PpsR-dependent genes would also respond gradually to changing oxygen concentration. To test this prediction, we measured, using DNA microarrays, gene expression in the R. sphaeroides cultures grown at different steady-state concentrations of oxygen. Fig. 3D shows transcript abundance of several photosynthesis genes, which are directly controlled by the AppA-PpsR system (6Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky L. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2148-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as a function of oxygen concentration. It is apparent that transcript abundance of all these genes indeed changed gradually over the range of 0.5-30% oxygen concentrations. This response was independent of the absolute transcript levels, which varied by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The gene expression measurements revealed that the AppA-PpsR system functions in vivo as a fine-tuned oxygen-dependent transcriptional rheostat as opposed to an on/off switch. We consider the strong correlation between the reversible and gradual heme discoordination in rising oxygen in vitro and gradual gene expression changes in vivo to constitute a physiological verification of the proposed oxygen sensing mechanism by AppA. However, detailed understanding of this mechanism clearly requires further investigation. SCHIC, a Novel Heme-binding Domain—To define the protein module responsible for heme binding and oxygen sensing, we analyzed the sequence of the central region of AppA. We identified a similarity of the fragment encompassing residues 274-392 to the vitamin B12-binding domain (Pfam data base: PF02310). The e-value of 8.90 e-02 indicates low similarity level. We tested whether AppA can bind vitamin B12. Since E. coli does not synthesize cobalt-containing tetrapyrroles, cobalamins, we grew the overexpressing strain in the presence of exogenously added adenosylcobalamin. We found that the purified protein contained no bound adenosylcobalamin. We also tested the ability of AppA to bind adenosylcobalamin and other cyclic (cyanocobalamin, protoporphyrin IX) and linear (biliverdin) tetrapyrroles but detected no specific binding (not shown). These results suggest that AppA readily discriminates between heme and other tetrapyrroles. We designated the protein domain between residues 274 and 392 (Fig. 1A) SCHIC for sensor containing heme instead of cobalamin. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis of the SCHIC domains revealed that they form a cluster that is related to, but distinct from, the cluster of B12-binding domains (Fig. 4A). The SCHIC and B12-binding domains apparently belong to a larger domain superfamily that includes proteins from bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The identities of cofactors for some of the branches of this superfamily remain unknown. The multiple sequence alignment of the SCHIC and B12-binding domains revealed several conserved residues shared by the two groups, among which is the His residue that functions as an axial ligand to cobalt in the B12-binding proteins (Fig. 4B). We therefore predict that the corresponding His residue in the SCHIC domains (His284 in AppA) is a candidate for serving an axial ligand to heme iron. The alignment also revealed sequence motifs that distinguish one domain from another. It will be important to resolve the roles that these motifs play in determining the differential tetrapyrrole specificity of protein members of this superfamily. We described a new class of heme-binding domains involved in oxygen sensing and investigated a sensory mechanism for the first representative of this class, R. sphaeroides AppA. The central region of AppA is required for oxygen sensing in vivo.It contains an ∼120-amino-acid-long SCHIC domain (Fig. 4A) that binds heme and is sufficient for oxygen sensing. To ensure that the uncovered role of the SCHIC domain is applicable to other SCHIC proteins, we recently analyzed the R. sphaeroides PpaA protein (34Gomelsky L. Sram J. Moskvin O.V. Horne I.M. Dodd H.N. Pemberton J.M. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Gomelsky M. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). We found that it also binds heme and responds to changes in oxygen levels in vitro. 3O. V. Moskvin, M. A. Giles-Gonzalez, and M. Gomelsky, unpublished data. The presence of heme in AppA has been overlooked for quite some time by several research groups that study this unique sensor, probably because heme content in the protein purified from aerobically grown E. coli is low. Further, the absorption of the light-sensing cofactor, FAD, bound to the amino-terminal BLUF domain of AppA, confuses the spectrum of heme. In addition, the most efficient heme binding occurs under reducing and anoxic conditions, whether the protein is reconstituted with heme in vitro or expressed in anaerobically grown E. coli. Once formed, the heme-AppA complexes remain relatively stable in the presence of oxygen. SCHIC is the sixth kind of protein module that employs heme for oxygen sensing. These modules are structurally diverse, suggesting that heme has been recruited for this function independently many times over the course of evolution. Four out of five types of heme-based oxygen sensors described prior to SCHIC involve noncovalently bound b-type hemes, i.e. a heme-PAS domain (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R.

Biol. 2005; 353: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this group, only PAS (39Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Dixon R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 2: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and GAF (40Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) domains share some structural similarity. However, these domains can bind various small ligands in addition to heme. Therefore, they may have acquired heme binding properties independently of each other. The fifth member of this group, represented by Desulfovibrio vulgaris DcrA, contains a covalently bound c-type heme (22Fu R. Wall J.D. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 344-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yoshioka S. Kobayashi K. Yoshimura H. Uchida T. Kitagawa T. Aono S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15406-15413Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The diversity of heme-based sensory modules extends further if one considers sensors of gases other than oxygen, e.g. the CO sensor, Rhodospirillum rubrum CooA, binds heme via a modified cAMP-binding domain (42He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of oxygen sensing have been explored in detail for only a limited number of heme proteins. Most commonly, oxygen binding to a heme iron results in the formation of an oxy-heme species, which brings about conformational changes in the protein and initiates a signal transduction cascade (2Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the c-type heme containing DcrA, oxidation of the heme iron is important for oxygen sensing (41Yoshioka S. Kobayashi K. Yoshimura H. Uchida T. Kitagawa T. Aono S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15406-15413Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). AppA appears to sense oxygen by a different mechanism. Oxygen binding to the heme iron discoordinates the heme as evidenced from the loss of the spectral features that characterize protein-coordinated heme and the appearance of features that characterize discoordinated heme (Fig. 3, A-C). Most likely, oxygen binding results in rupture of the bond to the protein. NO binding has the same outcome, whereas CO binding is apparently insufficient to break that axial coordination. This suggested mechanism of oxygen sensing by AppA is reminiscent of NO sensing by HNOX guanylate cyclases (31Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham R.W. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Yoshimura T. Ozaki T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the details of this mechanism will require separate studies. Interestingly, the sensory mechanism employed by AppA allows it to respond to changes in oxygen levels over the full range of ambient concentrations. Thus, AppA, together with its partner repressor, PpsR, can act as an oxygen-dependent transcriptional rheostat, as opposed to an on/off switch, fine-tuning the transcription of photosynthesis genes in R. sphaeroides to changing oxygen concentration. This is precisely what we observed when we measured the transcript abundance of AppA-PpsR-dependent genes at varying oxygen levels. The heme-binding SCHIC domain is evolutionary related to the B12-binding domain and to other protein domains that probably bind tetrapyrrole cofactors (Fig. 4A). The sequence similarities among proteins that bind different tetrapyrrole types are usually insignificant. The relatively high sequence similarity among the heme-binding SCHIC proteins and B12-binding proteins is unique to the protein superfamily described here. Tetrapyrrole-binding proteins are involved in key life processes, e.g. heme-containing cytochromes are central to electron transport; hemoglobins and myoglobins to oxygen transport and storage; chlorophyll-containing proteins to photosynthesis. However, origins of these groups of proteins remain murky. Are any of them evolutionary related, or did tetrapyrrole binding arise independently in different protein lineages? The domain superfamily identified here has a potential to improve our understanding of how protein-tetrapyrrole specificity is determined, how it may have evolved, and how it can be manipulated.

https://openalex.org/W2035307512,"Using targeted mouse mutants and pharmacologic inhibition of alphaCaMKII, we demonstrate that the alphaCaMKII protein, but not its activation, autophosphorylation or its ability to phosphorylate synapsin I, is required for normal short-term presynaptic plasticity. Furthermore, alphaCaMKII regulates the number of docked vesicles independent of its ability to be activated. These results indicate that alphaCaMKII has a nonenzymatic role in short-term presynaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2020372666,"The function and regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) following cerebral ischemia are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2) play a role in stimulation of neuronal NHE1 following in vitro ischemia. NHE1 activity was significantly increased during 10-60 min reoxygenation (REOX) after 2-h oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD/REOX not only increased the Vmax for NHE1 but also shifted the Km toward decreased [H+]i. These changes in NHE1 kinetics were absent when MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126. There were no changes in the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) after 2 h OGD. The p-ERK1/2 level was significantly increased during 10-60 min REOX, which was accompanied by nuclear translocation. U0126 abolished REOX-induced elevation and translocation of p-ERK1/2. We further examined the ERK/90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) signaling pathways. At 10 min REOX, phosphorylated NHE1 was increased with a concurrent elevation of phosphorylation of p90RSK, a known NHE1 kinase. Inhibition of MEK activity with U0126 abolished phosphorylation of both NHE1 and p90RSK. Moreover, neuroprotection was observed with U0126 or genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 following OGD/REOX. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of ERK1/2-p90RSK pathways following in vitro ischemia phosphorylates NHE1 and increases its activity, which subsequently contributes to neuronal damage.

To date, nine NHE isoforms (NHE1-9) have been cloned in mammalian tissues (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is the most abundant NHE isoform in the rat central nervous system (2Ma E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and crucial in regulation of neuronal pHi (3Diarra A. Sheldon C. Brett C.L. Baimbridge K.G. Church J. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that NHE1 activity plays an important role in neuronal damage in both in vitro and in vivo ischemic models (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NHE1 activity during OGD/REOX prevents intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ overload and thus reduces the Ca2+-mediated cascade of deleterious events (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In acutely isolated CA1 neurons, an anoxia-triggered intracellular alkalization depends on activation of NHE1 (5Yao H. Gu X.Q. Douglas R.M. Haddad G.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1205-C1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that NHE1 activity is stimulated in cortical astrocytes following in vitro ischemia (6Kintner D.B. Su G. Lenart B. Ballard A.J. Meyer J.W. Ng L.L. Shull G.E. Sun D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C12-C21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, whether NHE1 activity is over-stimulated in cortical neurons following in vitro ischemia remains unknown.

NHE1 has two large functional domains. The N-terminal transmembrane domain (∼500 amino acids) is responsible for cation translocation, and the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (∼315 amino acids) is the main regulatory site for the NHE1 activity (7Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The distal C-terminal tail of NHE1 contains a number of serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated by several protein kinases, including extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2) and 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) (8Moor A.N. Gan X.T. Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16113-16122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Activation of the ERK/p90RSK pathway is necessary for the increase in sarcolemmal NHE activity induced by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (8Moor A.N. Gan X.T. Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16113-16122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and sustained intracellular acidosis (9Malo M.E. Li L. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6292-6299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether the ERK signaling cascade plays a role in regulation of NHE1 activity in neurons following in vitro ischemia. Many factors released after ischemia may stimulate members of mitogen-associated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, such as ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK), and p38 MAPK. Among these, the ERK signaling cascade is emerging as an important regulator of neuronal responses to the pathologic stimuli (10Chu C.T. Levinthal D.J. Kulich S.M. Chalovich E.M. DeFranco D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). After activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylates several downstream elements, including Elk-1 or p90RSK. It functions as an important intermediate in signal transduction pathways to transmit extracellular signals into key regulatory membrane, cytoplasmic, and/or nuclear targets. However, the role of the activation of the ERK pathway in cerebral ischemia remains equivocal. Whereas activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved in cell survival in programmed cell death (11Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and ischemia (12Saito A. Maier C.M. Narasimhan P. Nishi T. Song Y.S. Yu F. Liu J. Lee Y.S. Nito C. Kamada H. Dodd R.L. Hsieh L.B. Hassid B. Kim E.E. Gonzalez M. Chan P.H. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 31: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), there is growing evidence indicating a role for ERK1/2 in neuronal cell death during cerebral ischemia (13Noshita N. Sugawara T. Hayashi T. Lewen A. Omar G. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7923-7930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such multiple functions of ERK1/2 pathways may result from variation in intensity of stimuli, their subcellular localization, and the interplay with other pathways or cellular energy state. In the current study, we investigated the ERK1/2-mediated regulation of NHE1 activity in cortical neurons following in vitro ischemia. Our results demonstrate that the stimulation of NHE1 in neurons following in vitro ischemia results from activation of ERK1/2-p90RSK signaling pathway. Materials—Hanks' balanced salt solution were from Mediatech Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Neurobasal Medium, B-27 supplement, acetoxymethyl esters of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, were obtained from Invitrogen. Nigericin was purchased from Sigma. U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene) was from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). The antibody for β tubulin type III was from Pro-mega (Madison, WI). The antibody for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was from Dako North America, Inc. (Fort Collins, CO). The following antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA): anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p90RSK, anti-RSK, and anti-phospho-Ser 14-3-3 protein binding motif. HOE 642 was a kind gift from Aventis Pharma (Frankfurt, Germany). G116 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Leong L. Ng (Leicester, UK). Pure Cortical Neuron Cultures—Preparation of NHE1+/+ or NHE1-/- cortical neurons from E14-16 fetuses has been described previously with some modification (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In brief, the cortices were removed from an E14-16 fetus and each mouse fetus was genotyped. The tissues were treated with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for 25 min. The cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 4 min. The cell pellet was diluted in B-27 supplemented Neurobasal medium (2%). The cells from individual fetal cortices were seeded separately at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates or on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. The cultures were maintained in an incubator of 5% CO2 and atmospheric air at 37 °C. Half of the medium was replaced twice a week. 10-15 Days in vitro cultures were used in the study. OGD Treatment—10-15 Days in vitro neuronal cultures were rinsed with an isotonic OGD solution (pH 7.4) containing (in mm): 0 glucose, 20 NaHCO3, 120 NaCl, 5.36 KCl, 0.33 Na2HPO4, 0.44 KH2PO4, 1.27 CaCl2, 0.81 MgSO4. Cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of the OGD solution in a hypoxic incubator (model 3130 from Thermo Forma, Marietta, OH) containing 94% N2,1%O2, and 5% CO2. Because similar cell death rates were found following 2 or 3 h OGD in our previous study (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), 2-3 h OGD was used in the current study. For reoxygenation, cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of B-27 supplemented Neurobasal medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and atmospheric air. For pHi measurements, the OGD incubation was 2 h and REOX was performed on the microscope stage at 37 °C. Normoxic control cells were incubated in 5% CO2 and atmospheric air in isotonic control buffer containing 5.5 mm glucose with the rest of the components identical to the isotonic OGD solution. Measurement of Cell Death—Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) uptake and retention of calcein as described previously (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured neurons were rinsed and incubated with 1 μmol/liter calcein-AM and 10 μg/ml PI in HEPES/minimal essential medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then rinsed and visualized using a Nikon TE 300 inverted epifluorescence (Tokyo, Japan) and ×20 objective lens. Calcein and PI fluorescence signals were obtained using fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red filters, respectively. Images were collected using a Princeton Instruments (Trenton, NJ) Micro-Max CCD camera. In a blind manner, a total of 1000 cells/condition were counted using MetaMorph image-processing software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Cell mortality was expressed as the ratio of PI-positive cells to the sum of calcein-positive and PI-positive cells. Measurement of pHi—pHi measurement and pre-pulse treatment were performed at 37 °C as described previously (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Neurons grown on coverslips were incubated for 2 h with 2.5 μm 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-AM under either normoxic control or OGD conditions at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed and placed in the open bath imaging chamber. The chamber was mounted on the stage of the microscope and visualized by ×40 objective lens. The cells were excited every 10-30 s at 440 and 490 nm and the ratio of the emission fluorescence at 535 nm was recorded. Images were collected using the Princeton Instruments MicroMax CCD camera, and analyzed with MetaFluor image-processing software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The ratio of the fluorescence emissions (F490/F440) was calibrated using the high K+/nigericin technique (14Boyarsky G. Ransom B. Schlue W.R. Davis M.B. Boron W.F. Glia. 1993; 8: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NH4+/NH3 solutions (30 mm, 2 min) were used to induce an acid load as described before (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The pHi recovery rate (ΔpHi/min) was determined from the slope of regression line fit to the 40 s following NH4+/NH3 pre-pulse (average pHi 6.6). As described previously (15Kintner D.B. Look A. Shull G.E. Sun D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C934-C945Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), buffer capacity (βi) was determined over a range of pHi by subjecting the cells to progressively decreasing concentrations of NH4+ in Na+-free HEPES/minimal essential medium, based on βi=ΔNH4+/ΔpHi. H+ flux rates (JH+:mm H/min) were determined by multiplying βi by ΔpHi/Δt for each time interval during pHi recovery (1-2 min) following pre-pulse treatment. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cultured cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After rinsing, cells were incubated with blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After rinsing in PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor™ 488 goat anti-mouse (1:200; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor™ 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were then covered with Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images for GFAP and βIII tubulin staining were captured by the Nikon TE 300 inverted epifluorescence microscope (×40) using a Princeton Instruments MicroMax CCD camera and MetaMorph image-processing software. Fluorescence images for NHE1, β tubulin III, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 were obtained using a Leica DMIRE2 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (×63) and Leica confocal software (Leica Microsystems Inc., Mannheim, Germany). Identical digital imaging acquisition parameters were used in both negative control and experimental images. Polyclonal antibody against ERK1/2 (1:100) and monoclonal antibody against p-ERK1/2 (1: 200) were used for detection of total ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2, respectively. Polyclonal G116 antibody against NHE1 (1:50) (16Kelly M.P. Quinn P.A. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:200), and anti-β tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:200) were used for detection of NHE1, GFAP, and βIII tubulin, respectively. Subcellular Fractionation Preparation—For nuclear fractionation, cells were harvested in PBS (pH 7.4) containing (mm): 10 NaCl, 10 Na2PO4, 5 MgCl2, 10 β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.065, Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors as described previously (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 10 min on ice and homogenized by 20 strokes with a tight-fitting homogenizer. After removing unbroken cells by centrifugation at 150 × g for 2 min, nuclei were collected via centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and prepared for Western blot analysis. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins was also collected for Western blotting. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested on ice in an antiphosphatase buffer (pH 7.4) containing (mm): 150 NaCl, 20 HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 NaF, 10 Na4P2O7, 2 Na3VO4, 5 EDTA, and 0.2 μm microcystin and protease inhibitors as described previously (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After brief centrifugation (300 × g), cell pellet was collected and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After sonication, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected for immunoblotting. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. Protein samples (15 μg/lane) and pre-stained molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were denatured in SDS reducing buffer (1:2 by volume). The samples were then electrophoretically separated on 6 or 12% SDS gels and the resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody. The blots were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG for 1 h. Bound antibody was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Pierce). Polycolonal antibody against ERK1/2 (1:1000) and monoclonal antibody against p-ERK1/2 (1: 2000) were used for detection of total ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against RSK (1:1000) and phosphorylated p90RSK (p-p90RSK, 1:1000) were used for detection of total RSK and p-p90RSK, respectively. Polyclonal G116 antibody against NHE1 (1:1000) and anti-β tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:3000) were used for detection of NHE1 and βIII tubulin, respectively. Measurement of NHE1 Expression in Phosphoprotein and Nonphosphoprotein Fractions—The PhosphoCruz™ Protein Purification System from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) was used to isolate phosphoproteins from neuronal lysates. Cellular lysates were prepared as described by Lehoux (17Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with some modification. Cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in ice-cold antiphosphatase buffer with 1% Triton X-100 as described above. Cell lysates were sonicated at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected. According to the manufacturer's instruction, 5 mg of total protein was incubated with the phosphoprotein affinity resin. Proteins that carry a phosphate group were specifically retained on the resin, whereas the nonphosphorylated proteins flow through the column and were collected. The phosphoproteins retained on the resin were subsequently eluted from the resin to obtain the phosphoenriched protein fraction of interest for analysis. Protein content in elution was concentrated by microconcentrators supplied in the kit. The levels of NHE1 in different fractions were measured using gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. NHE1 recovery rate in normoxic control samples was 40 ± 9% by this technique. Phosphorylated NHE1 was 5% of the total NHE1 proteins and non-phosphorylated was about 95%, which is consistent with the report from other analyses. Analysis of NHE1 Phosphorylation by Immunoprecipitation—In parallel, the phosphorylation level of NHE1 was determined using a method established by Snabaitis et al. (18Snabaitis A.K. D'Mello R. Dashnyam S. Avkiran M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20252-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold antiphosphatase buffer and lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (pH 7.5) containing (mm): 20 Tris-HCl, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 2.5 sodium pyrophosphate, 1 β-glycerophosphate, 1 Na3VO4, 100 NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors as described previously (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Supernatant containing 0.4 mg of solubilized membrane proteins was removed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody against phospho-Ser 14-3-3 protein binding motif (1:15). Immunocomplexes were mixed with protein G (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with ice-cold modified immunoprecipitation lysis buffer not containing SDS. The immunocomplexes were dissociated from beads with the Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 70 °C. Protein samples from crude lysate or the immunocomplex were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal NHE1 antibody as described above. Statistics—Throughout the study, n values represent numbers of cultures used in each experiment. Routinely, parameters for live cell imaging were measured in ∼20 cells on a coverslip from each culture. Statistical significance was determined by the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test at a confidence of 95% (p < 0.05) or by Student's t test (p < 0.05). Error bars in figures represent either standard deviation (S.D.) or standard error of means (S.E.). Expression of NHE1 in Pure Neuron Cultures—The pure neuronal cultures were characterized by triple staining with astrocyte-specific marker GFAP (red, Fig. 1A), neuron-specific marker β tubulin III (green, Fig. 1B), and nucleus marker DAPI (blue, Fig. 1, A and C). As shown in Fig. 1A, no GFAP-staining signal was found in the neuronal cultures. Positive GFAP-staining signal was shown in the mixed neuronal cultures (inset, Fig. 1A). Fig. 1C demonstrates characteristic neuronal morphology in the cultures. Fig. 1, D-F, shows expression of NHE1 in neurons by immunofluorescence staining. Colocalization of NHE1 (red, Fig. 1D) and βIII tubulin (green, Fig. 1E) was found in all neurons (Fig. 1F). Stimulation of NHE1 Activity following OGD/REOX Depends on Activation of MEK-mediated Pathways—Fig. 2A illustrates pHi regulation in response to NH4Cl-mediated pre-pulse in neurons under normoxic or OGD/REOX conditions. In the standard HCO3--free HEPES-buffered solution, basal pHi in cortical neurons was 7.05 ± 0.05 (Fig. 2, A and B). Following the NH4Cl-mediated pre-pulse, pHi was recovered within 5 min in normoxic control cells, which largely reflects NHE1 activity (4Luo J. Chen H. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11256-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In neurons exposed to 2 h OGD and 10 min REOX, basal pHi was reduced moderately (pHi of 6.91 ± 0.08, p > 0.05, Fig. 2, A and B). By 1 h REOX, pHi increased to 7.38 ± 0.18 (p < 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant increase in pHi recovery rate in neurons following 2 h OGD and 10 min REOX (0.49 ± 0.08 unit/min, p < 0.05, Fig. 2C), compared to a control of 0.19 ± 0.02 unit/min. This suggests an increase in NHE1 activity. This H+ extrusion rate remained elevated at 1 h REOX (0.61 ± 0.15 unit/min, p < 0.05, Fig. 2C). Inhibition of NHE1 activity with its potent inhibitor HOE 642 (1 μm) abolished the pHi recovery following 2 h OGD and 10 min REOX (p < 0.05, Fig. 2C). Moreover, the resting pHi was reduced to 6.87 in the presence of HOE 642 (p < 0.05, Fig. 2B). Interestingly, in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126 (10 μm), the OGD/REOX-mediated increase in the pHi recovery rate was abolished (Fig. 2). The alkaline rebound during REOX was absent in the presence of U0126 (pHi of 6.89 ± 0.11). This suggests that the ERK kinase (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2 pathways are involved in activation of NHE1 activity in neurons following OGD/REOX. OGD/REOX Increases the Maximal Velocity (Vmax) and Proton Affinity of NHE1, Which Depends on ERK1/2 Activation—To further investigate NHE1 kinetics in neurons following OGD/REOX, we first examined whether the intrinsic buffer capacity βi of neurons was altered by OGD/REOX. Changes in pHi were induced by applying progressively decreasing concentrations of NH3/NH4+. In normoxic neurons, βi increased linearly from a value of about 12.5 mm/pH at a pHi of 7.0 to about 23.5 mm/pH at a pHi of 6.2. The fitted regression was βi = 109 + (-13.8 × pHi). βi was also determined in neurons following 2 h OGD and 1 h REOX. OGD/REOX did not cause a significant change in the fitted line of βi versus pHi (βi = 98 + (-12.2 × pHi), p > 0.05). We also calculated JH+ during the pre-pulse-induced pHi recovery and plotted it against the corresponding [H+]i (Fig. 3, A and B). In normoxic control neurons, the velocity of H+ efflux from cells increased as [H+]i increased and was best described by a sigmoid fit (Vmax of 8.2 ± 0.8 mm/min, Km of 0.29 ± 0.01 μm; Fig. 3A) with a Hill coefficient of 2.03 ± 0.07. The latter is consistent with other reports and suggests that there might be more than one binding site for H+ on the intracellular face of the protein (19Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). When neurons were exposed to 2 h OGD and 10 min REOX, the kinetics of NHE1 were dramatically changed (Fig. 3A). Vmax was increased about 3 times (23.5 ± 1.9 mm/min, p < 0.05), whereas the Km shifted to a lower concentration of protons (0.21 ± 0.04 μm, p < 0.05). The sigmoid curve fit of the OGD/REOX data were significantly different from the curve fit to the normoxic control data in neurons (p < 0.05). The elevation in Vmax and proton affinity was maintained during 60 min REOX following 2 h OGD (Fig. 3B). The Hill coefficients for the OGD/REOX data were similar to the control (2.26 ± 0.09; 2.58 ± 0.15, respectively). In contrast, inhibition of MEK1/2 activity with 10 μm U0126 significantly attenuated OGD/REOX-mediated changes in NHE1 kinetics (Fig. 3, A and B). Vmax was reduced by ∼50% (p < 0.05 versus OGD/REOX) and Km shifted back to a higher concentration of protons (0.30 ± 0.07 μm, p > 0.05 versus normoxic control) in the presence of 10 μm U0126 (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that the MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathways are involved in stimulation of NHE1 activity following OGD/REOX. Activation of ERK1/2 Pathway in Cortical Neurons following OGD/REOX—We further investigated activation of ERK1/2 in response to OGD/REOX by measuring the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2. p-ERK1/2 levels in NHE1+/+ neurons were not increased at the end of 2 h OGD (Fig. 4, A and B), which is consistent with data in ischemic heart (20Takeishi Y. Abe J. Lee J.D. Kawakatsu H. Walsh R.A. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, 10 min REOX triggered a rapid increase in levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (∼3.4-fold, p < 0.001), which remained elevated during REOX (∼2.7-fold at 30 min REOX, p < 0.001; ∼2.5-fold at 60 min REOX, p < 0.001). Total ERK1/2 protein levels were not significantly altered following OGD/REOX (Fig. 4A). Exposing neurons to U0126 during OGD/REOX abolished ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). It was recently observed in vascular smooth muscle cells that NHE1 activity regulates ERK phosphorylation (21Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Ullian M.E. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1845-1852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We performed additional experiments in NHE1-/- neurons to investigate whether ERK phosphorylation was altered in the absence of NHE1 function. Interestingly, a similar rapid increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was found in NHE1-/- neurons following OGD/REOX (∼3-fold, p < 0.001, Fig. 4, C and D). The NHE1 inhibitor HOE 642 had no effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation either (data not shown). This suggests that ERK phosphorylation does not depend on NHE1 activity in neurons under OGD/REOX conditions. Translocation of Activated ERK1/2 Kinases into Nuclei after OGD/REOX in Cortical Neuron—The OGD/REOX-induced ERK1/2 activation was further examined in cortical neurons by immunofluorescence staining. Constitutive expression of ERK1/2 was found within the cytoplasm and proce"

Studies on GloI from diverse organisms such as man, bacteria, yeast, and different parasites show striking differences among these potentially isofunctional enzymes as far as metal content and the number of active sites per subunit are concerned. So far, it is not known whether this structural variability is linked to catalytic or regulatory features in vivo. Here we show that recombinant GloI from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a high- and a low-affinity binding site for the diastereomeric hemithioacetals formed by addition of glutathione to methylglyoxal. Both active sites of the monomeric enzyme are functional and have similar kcatapp values. Proteolytic susceptibility studies and detailed analyses of the steady-state kinetics of active-site mutants suggest that both reaction centers can adopt two discrete conformations and are allosterically coupled. As a result of the positive homotropic allosteric coupling, P. falciparum GloI has an increased affinity at low substrate concentrations and an increased activity at higher substrate concentrations. This could also be the case for GloI from yeast and other organisms. Potential physiologically relevant differences between monomeric GloI and homodimeric GloI are discussed. Our results provide a strong basis for drug development strategies and significantly enhance our understanding of GloI kinetics and structure-function relationships.

The ubiquitous glyoxalase system comprises two enzymes that catalyze the sequential glutathione (or in rare cases, trypanothione)-dependent conversion of methylglyoxal and other 2-oxoaldehydes to 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this reaction, rate-determining dehydration of hydrated 2-oxoaldehyde is followed by the spontaneous formation of diastereomeric hemithioacetals between GSH and the 2-oxoaldehyde (Fig. 1A) (1Vander Jagt D.L.

The second enzyme, glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6), hydrolyzes the thioester, releasing GSH and 2-hydroxycarboxylic acid (see Ref. 3Vander Jagt D.L.

To date, GloI from different organisms can be roughly subdivided into three different groups according to the type of divalent cation bound at the active site and the number of subunits forming the functional enzyme (Fig. 1B). For example, GloI from human and yeast (4Aronsson A.C. Marmstal E. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Plasmodium falciparum (5Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Chang T. Schirmer H. Becker K.

The N-terminal domain of one subunit interacts with the C-terminal domain of the other subunit (Fig. 1B). Homodimeric GloI consist of four βαβββ domains (which appear to have arisen by a gene duplication event) forming an eight-stranded β-sheet (10Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, GloI from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Frickel E.M. Jemth P. Widersten M. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1845-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the malaria parasite P. falciparum (5Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Chang T. Schirmer H. Becker K.

Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is approximately twice the size of homodimeric GloI and has two potential active sites per monomer (Fig. 1B). An alignment of monomeric (putative) GloI from plants, apicomplexan parasites, and Ascomycetes is shown in supplemental Fig. 9. Frickel et al. (13Frickel E.M. Jemth P. Widersten M. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1845-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated, by site-directed mutagenesis, that both active sites of GloI from yeast are functional. Studies on P. falciparum (PfGloI) support the hypothesis that a second gene duplication and fusion event occurred during evolution of monomeric GloI (5Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Chang T. Schirmer H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 54: 284-288Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). No structure of a monomeric GloI has been solved yet, and according to sequence alignments and partial molecular models, it is quite likely that the structure of PfGloI differs significantly from the analyzed structures of dimeric GloI (14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PfGloI might be suited as a target for novel antimalarial drugs (5Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Chang T. Schirmer H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 54: 284-288Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); however, it is not known which of the potential active sites should be targeted for inhibition. Traditionally, allosteric effects are explained either by the symmetry model of Monod et al. (15Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar) or by the sequential model of Koshland et al. (16Koshland D.E. Nemethy Jr., G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). These classical models of allosteric effects are restricted to oligomeric proteins. However, allostery (allosteric = other space) means that action in one part of a molecule causes an effect at another site (see Ref. 17Kern D. Zuiderweg E.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 748-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar for review). According to this broader definition, allosteric systems are not restricted to oligomeric proteins because the binding of one ligand might affect another binding site of the same monomeric protein. Depending on whether the effector is identical or non-identical to the substrate, homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effectors are distinguished (17Kern D. Zuiderweg E.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 748-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In the case of monomeric proteins, studies on allosteric regulation are usually restricted to heterotropic allosteric interactions. In this study, we address the questions of whether both potential active sites of PfGloI are functional, whether they are identical in terms of their kinetic parameters, and whether they act independently. Using site-directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetic measurements, we show that monomeric PfGloI has two different functional active sites with clearly distinguishable substrate affinities. We suggest that both active sites are able to adopt two different conformations and are allosterically coupled. As a consequence, previous results on monomeric GloI from yeast can be reinterpreted. Our results significantly improve the understanding of GloI kinetics as well as structure-function relationships and extend the knowledge of homotropic allosteric regulation of monomeric proteins in general. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations of the PfGloI gene (E91Q, E161Q, E272Q, E345Q, E91Q/E345Q, E161Q/E272Q, E161Q/E345Q, R22E, R22E/E91Q/E345Q, and E161Q/R186/E272Q) were introduced by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Promega Corp.) using mutated primers (Table 1) and PfGloI (5Iozef R.

Methylated non-mutated template plasmids were digested with DpnI (Fermentas), and competent XL1-Blue cells were subsequently transformed. The correct sequences of the wild-type and mutant PfGloI genes were confirmed by sequencing both strands.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesis of the PfGloI gene Codons with mutated base pairs are underlined.MutationSequenceE91Q Sense5′–GAATACAGTTTGCTTGCAACTTACATATAATC–3′ Antisense5′–GATTATATGTAAGTTGCAAGCAAACTGTATTC–3′E161Q Sense5′–CTAATAATTATTGGATTCAAATTGTAAAAAGATC–3′ Antisense5′–GATCTTTTTACAATTTGAATCCAATAATTATTAG–3′E272Q Sense5′–GGGAACCCGTTCTACAATTAACACACAATC–3′ Antisense5′–GATTGTGTGTTAATTGTAGAACGGGTTCCC–3′E345Q Sense5′–GATAATTATGTCATACAGCTTATACAACGGG–3′ Antisense5′–CCCGTTGTATAAGCTGTATGACATAATTATC–3′R22E Sense5′–CAACAAACAATGTTGGAAATATATGACCCTAAAG–3′ Antisense5′–CTTTAGGGTCATATATTTCCAACATTGTTTGTTG–3′R186E Sense5′–CTTTTCTCAAACAATGATTGAAGTTAAGAACCCTG–3′ Antisense5′–CAGGGTTCTTAACTTCAATCATTGTTTGAGAAAAG–3′ Open table in a new tab Heterologous Expression and Protein Purification—pQE30 constructs of the wild-type and mutant PfGloI genes were expressed in E. coli strain M15 (Qiagen Inc.).

Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) before Tris and phosphate buffers were replaced with MOPS buffers. Bacteria were precultured for ∼8 h at 37 °C in medium containing 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter NaCl, 2 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, and 10 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 mg/liter kanamycin and 100 mg/liter carbenicillin. The preculture was added to fresh medium and grown at 30 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.3. Then, 286 mg/liter ZnSO4·7H2O were added, and the culture was grown for 30 min before induction with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells from 3 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 6000 × g) ∼ 14 h after induction and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer containing 10 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.8), lysozyme, DNase I, and ∼75 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Resuspended bacteria were stirred for 1 h on ice, followed by sonication at 4 °C and centrifugation for 30 min at 30,600 × g. The supernatant was applied to an S-hexylglutathione-agarose column (Sigma), which was equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.8). The column was washed with 8 column volumes of 10 mm MOPS/NaOH and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.8), and recombinant enzyme was eluted with 3 column volumes of 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm S-hexylglutathione (pH 7.8). The eluate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc.), which was equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm MOPS/NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Afterward, the column was washed with 8 column volumes of the same buffer. The purified enzyme was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm MOPS/NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, and 125 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Protein concentrations of the fractions were determined using the Bradford assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the eluate was confirmed by reducing 10% SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Determinations of kcat and Km values were performed right after purification, and the proteolytic susceptibility or the pH profiles were analyzed the next day. Steady-state Kinetics—The steady-state kinetics of the recombinant enzymes were monitored spectrophotometrically using a thermostatted Hitachi U-2001 or a Jasco V-550 UV-visible spectrophotometer. To determine kcat and Km values at 30 °C, experiments were performed as described previously (14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Initial measurements were carried out in assay buffer containing 100 mm KxHyPO4 and 100 mm KCl (pH 7.0) (14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphate buffer was later replaced with buffer containing 50 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0) (see “Results and Discussion”). Stock solutions of 10 mm GSH (Sigma) and 100 mm methylglyoxal (Sigma) in assay buffer were freshly prepared before each experiment. For a desired concentration of hemithioacetal, the concentrations of methylglyoxal and GSH in the assay mixture were calculated and varied using the equation Kd = 3 mm = ([methylglyoxal][GSH])/[hemithioacetal]. The total assay volume was 1 ml. The calculated concentration of free GSH after 5 min of preincubation at 30 °C was 0.1 mm in all assays (14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The calculated initial concentration of the hemithioacetal was 5-500 μm. All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the formation of S-d-lactoylglutathione was followed spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (ϵ = 3.37 mm-1 cm-1). The final assay concentration of the wild-type enzyme and mutants was 2.5-15 nm, with the exception of PfGloI(E161Q/E345Q) (up to 0.1 μm). The kinetic data of the initial reaction velocities were plotted according to Michaelis-Menten, Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes and fitted using the program SigmaPlot 10.0 (Systat Software Inc.). The plots of several PfGloI mutants were biphasic, and as a consequence, two apparent values for Km (Km1app and Km2app) and kcat (kcat1app and kcat2app) were determined by linear regression. The Km and kcat values calculated from the different plots of a single experiment varied by <10%. Hill coefficients (nH) of both phases were determined in a Hill plot by linear regression (using Vmax = [E]·kcat2app to calculate the maximum reaction velocity of mutants with biphasic kinetics). An equation describing the steady-state reaction velocity according to the scheme shown in Fig. 8 was computed using the program ALBASS 1.0 (20Varon-Castellanos R. Garcia-Moreno M. Garcia-Sevilla F. Ruiz-Galea M.M. Garcia-Casanovas F. Computerized Derivation of the Steady-State Equations of Enzyme Reactions. Albacete, Spain1995Google Scholar). pH Profiles—The initial velocities of the formation of S-d-lactoylglutathione were measured at pH values ranging from 5.5 to 9.0 at 25 °C. Stock solutions of 100 mm GSH and 1.0 m methylglyoxal in Millipore water were freshly prepared before each experiment. The calculated initial concentration of the hemithioacetal between methylglyoxal and GSH in the assay was 400 μm, and the calculated concentration of free GSH after 5 min of preincubation was 0.1 mm. Assays were performed using three different buffers containing 50 mm MES (pH 5.5-6.75), 50 mm MOPS (pH 6.5-8.0), or 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4-9.0). Gel Filtration Chromatography—The apparent molecular mass of the wild-type enzyme was studied by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 preparation grade column, which was connected to an ÁKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated with a gel filtration standard (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm MOPS/NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 μm ZnCl2 (pH 7.0). Fast protein liquid chromatography fractions were detected photometrically, and peak areas and kav values were evaluated using the software UNICORN 4.11 (Amersham Biosciences). Proteolytic Susceptibility—The wild-type enzyme and PfGloI(E161Q/E345Q) were concentrated in a Centricon YM-10 device (Millipore Corp.) and treated with subtilisin (Sigma), and the time-dependent protein degradation in the presence or absence of ligands at 25 °C was analyzed by reducing 15% SDS-PAGE. All protease assays were performed in 50 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0) and started by the addition of subtilisin (50-200 milliunits/ml). The pH of the assay solutions containing either 20 mm S-hexylglutathione or 5 mm hemithioacetal and 0.1 mm GSH was readjusted before the addition of 10-15 μm PfGloI. GSH and methylglyoxal were preincubated for 5 min without PfGloI to allow formation of the hemithioacetal. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn from the digestion mixture (90 μl) after 0, 1, 5, and 10 min and incubated with 4 μl phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (final concentration of 17 mm) for 2 min on ice before the addition of 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Generation of PfGloI Active-site Mutants—Each active site of GloI enzymes contains two highly conserved glutamate residues that are most likely involved in acid-base catalysis during substrate enediolate formation and reprotonation (21Ridderström M.

According to a previously proposed structural model of PfGloI (14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the pairs Glu91/Glu345 and Glu161/Glu272 are these critical residues at the two putative active sites, which we will refer to as sites A and B, respectively (supplemental Fig. 10). To study their role in catalysis, we generated a set of three different mutants per active site by replacing Glu91 and/or Glu345 with glutamine at putative active site A and Glu161 and/or Glu272 at putative active site B. In a seventh mutant, both active sites were subjected to mutation by substituting glutamine for Glu161 and Glu345. All of the recombinant proteins were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE) by two consecutive affinity chromatographic steps (supplemental Fig. 11). The wild-type enzyme and all seven mutants were soluble and stable. The average final yield of the purified proteins strongly depended on the amino acid replacement and differed between 0.3 nmol (PfGloI(E161Q/E345Q)) and 25 nmol (PfGloI(E272Q)) per liter of E. coli culture. Phosphate Buffers Inactivate PfGloI Active-site Mutants during Catalytic Turnover but Not During Storage—The standard buffers used to measure GloI activity contain (di)hydrogen phosphate for historical reasons (24Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cliffe E.E. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1961; 79: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In previous studies, recombinant wild-type PfGloI was also purified and assayed in (di)hydrogen phosphate-containing buffers (5Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Chang T. Schirmer H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 54: 284-288Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, our initial steady-state kinetic measurements of recombinant PfGloI(E91Q) (Fig. 2) and of other mutants (data not shown) revealed that these enzymes were rapidly inactivated during the assay when a phosphate buffer was used. Determination of reaction velocities right after the addition of enzyme was difficult, whereas smaller reaction velocities after 60 s could be accurately reproduced (see, for example, first pair of error bars in Fig. 2, A and B). This observation was surprising because PfGloI(E91Q) was stable for several days with only slight loss of activity when stored at 4 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium (di)hydrogen phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, and 125 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Inactivation during the assay was decelerated, and the overall reaction velocity was increased by the addition of zinc chloride to the assay mixture or by using an alternative assay buffer containing MOPS instead of phosphate. The addition of zinc chloride to the MOPS-buffered assay mixture did not further increase the activity or slow down the inactivation (Fig. 2, A and B). The wild-type enzyme also had a slightly increased activity with MOPS buffer compared with phosphate buffer (Fig. 2C), and PfGloI(E91Q) had a decreased activity at high concentrations of sodium or potassium chloride (Fig. 2D). We suggest that an interaction between (di)hydrogen phosphate anions and Zn2+ at the active site leads to loss or shielding of the cation during catalytic turnover, resulting in decreased activity and rapid inactivation of PfGloI(E91Q) and other active-site mutants. In the absence of substrate, the zinc cations seem to be protected from an interaction with (di)hydrogen phosphate, explaining the stability of the mutants during storage and pointing to a conformational change during catalysis (see below). As a consequence, the expression and purification protocol was modified (see “Experimental Procedures”), and all following assays for determination of the Km and kcat values for wild-type PfGloI and mutants were performed in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0) without additional salt (supplemental Fig. 12). Analyses of the Steady-state Kinetics Reveal Two Functional Active Sites with Different Substrate Binding Properties—In contrast to previous reports (5Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Chang T. Schirmer H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 54: 284-288Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Akoachere M. Iozef R. Rahlfs S. Deponte M. Mannervik B. Creighton D.J. Schirmer H. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we found that the steady-state kinetics of PfGloI did not follow typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The unusual kinetics were probably overlooked because fewer data points were determined and because the evaluation was based solely on Lineweaver-Burk plots. Our plots of the kinetic data are biphasic for the wild-type enzyme and, to a lesser degree, for the PfGloI mutants. Without postulating a mechanism and a model that results in complex equations, the data were fitted empirically by two straight lines (Fig. 3). Accordingly, two apparent values for Km (Km1app and Km2app) and kcat (kcat1app and kcat2app) were determined by linear regression (Table 2). At this point, these values were not attributed to active site A or B. The Km1app and kcat1app values determined at lower substrate concentrations (5-50 μm hemithioacetal) are smaller than the Km2app and kcat2app values determined at higher substrate concentrations (0.2-0.5 mm hemithioacetal). Hill plots (Fig. 3) reveal a Hill coefficient (nH1) < 1 for lower substrate concentrations. The wild-type enzyme and all seven mutants can be divided into four different groups (Table 2). PfGloI(E161Q/E345Q) is almost completely inactivated, whereas kcat2app for the wild-type enzyme is ∼2-fold larger than kcat2app for the remaining six glutamate mutants. These six mutants can be further subdivided into two groups depending on Km1app, Km2app, and the maximum catalytic efficiency (kcat2app/Km1app). In both groups, Km2app is about twice as high as Km1app; however, the Kmapp values for the two groups differ by roughly an order of magnitude: Km1app for the wild-type enzyme increases by 5-fold upon replacement of Glu91 and/or Glu345, whereas Km2app for the wild-type enzyme decreases by ∼5-fold upon replacement of Glu272 and/or Glu161. As a result, the maximum catalytic efficiency of PfGloI(E91Q), PfGloI(E345Q), and PfGloI(E91Q/E345Q) is 7% of the wild-type enzyme compared with 60% for PfGloI(E272Q), PfGloI(E161Q), and PfGloI(E161Q/E272Q).TABLE 2Mutation of glutamate residues at both active sites of PfGloI affects the kinetics The apparent steady-state kinetic constants of PfGloI were determined from Hanes plots (for example, see Fig. 3). Very similar constants were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots. All values given were averaged from at least three independent transformation/expression/purification experiments.

After being translocated or inserted into the ER, they fold and undergo post-translational modifications. Within the ER, proteins are also subjected to quality control checkpoints, during which misfolded proteins may be degraded by proteasomes via a process known as ER-associated degradation. Molecular chaperones, including the small heat shock protein αA-crystallin, have recently been shown to play a role in this process. We have now found that αA-crystallin is expressed in cultured mouse collecting duct cells, where apical Na+ transport is mediated by epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC). ENaC-mediated Na+ currents in Xenopus oocytes were reduced by co-expression of αA-crystallin. This reduction in ENaC activity reflected a decrease in the number of channels expressed at the cell surface. Furthermore, we observed that the rate of ENaC delivery to the cell surface of Xenopus oocytes was significantly reduced by co-expression of αA-crystallin, whereas the rate of channel retrieval remained unchanged. We also observed that αA-crystallin and ENaC co-immunoprecipitate. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that small heat shock proteins recognize ENaC subunits at ER quality control checkpoints and can target ENaC subunits for ER-associated degradation.

Within the ER, proteins are also subjected to quality control checkpoints to ensure that only properly folded proteins mature beyond the ER. If folding is inefficient, the misfolded protein may be degraded by proteasomes via a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This prevents the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the ER, which, left unchecked, may form toxic protein aggregates.

ENaC is expressed at the apical membranes of Na+ absorptive epithelia. There, in conjunction with the basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase, ENaC facilitates transepithelial Na+ transport (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). ENaC is found in a variety of tissues, including the lung airway and alveoli and the distal nephron, where ENaC influences mucociliary clearance and extracellular fluid Na+ and volume regulation, respectively (1Garty H.

ENaC is comprised of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ, although the stoichiometry of the functional channel remains controversial (4Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R.

Each subunit has short cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (50-110 residues), two transmembrane segments, and a large extracellular domain (∼450 residues) (8Kellenberger S. Schild L.

Like most other molecular chaperones, small heat shock proteins (sHsps) can bind unfolded, aggregation-prone substrates to retain them in solution. In addition, sHsps have been implicated in proteasome function and the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. We recently observed that α-crystallin domain-containing sHsps facilitate the ERAD of CFTR (11Ahner A. Nakatsukasa K. Zhang H. Frizzell R.A. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 18: 806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the structure and assembly of CFTR and ENaC are distinct, we hypothesized that these chaperones may also be involved in ENaC quality control. To this end, we established an ENaC expression system in yeast and discovered that sHsps facilitate ENaC α subunit degradation. We also found that the sHsp αA-crystallin is expressed in a cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell line and that αA-crystallin and the ENaC α subunit form stable complexes. Finally, we determined the functional effect of αA-crystallin expression on ENaC in a heterologous system and found that αA-crystallin lowered the number of functional channels because of a decrease in the rate of channel delivery to the cell surface. These data demonstrate a broader role for sHsps in ERAD and represent only the second chaperone class that has been found to impact ENaC biogenesis. Vectors and Antibodies—Mouse ENaC α subunits with either carboxyl-terminal HA or V5 epitope tags (αHA, αV5), amino-terminal HA and carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tags (HAαV5), β subunit with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope tag (β), and γ subunit with a carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope tag (γ) were previously characterized (12Hughey R.P.

The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence as described below and quantified with a Versadoc (Bio-Rad). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Mouse kidney total RNA was from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Mountain View, CA). Total RNA from cultured CCD cells was isolated using an RNAqueous 4PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). One microgram total RNA was reverse transcribed using either random hexamers or oligo(dT) as primers using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Nested PCR was performed on control “no reverse transcriptase” template and random-primed or oligo(dT)-primed cDNA templates. Immunoblotting—CCD and MDCK cells were maintained as previously described (17Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc.

Briefly, cytoplasmic extracts of CCD cells were produced by scraping cells into phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 15.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4) with protease inhibitor mixture set III (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and passing them 20 times through a 22-gauge needle. Whole cell lysates were produced by scraping cells into 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.6, and protease inhibitor mixture set III followed by the addition of SDS (Bio-Rad) to 0.5% (w/v) and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min as described previously (19Breitfeld P.P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Triethanolamine (final concentration, 75 mm) and Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1.25% (v/v)) were then added, after which samples were agitated for 15 min at 4 °C. MDCK cells were extracted into 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 63 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) supplemented with protease inhibitor set III and phosphatase inhibitor set I (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The extracts were centrifuged to remove insoluble material. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel with antibodies as indicated and 25 μl of protein A immobilized on Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., S. San Francisco, CA). Immunoprecipitates on beads were washed and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (4-15% gradient gel) and transferred to an Immobilon-NC membrane. The membranes were incubated with antibody as indicated overnight at 4 °C, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody when needed. Purified bovine αA-crystallin (Assay Designs) and Precision Protein Standards (Bio-Rad) were used as markers. The blots were developed using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Science) and visualized with either BioMax MR film (Kodak, New Haven, CT) or using a Versadoc (Bio-Rad). ENaC Activity Measurements—ENaC mediated Na+ currents were measured in Xenopus oocytes by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (TEV). Stage V and VI oocytes free of follicle cell layers were injected with cRNA encoding wild type α, β, and γ ENaC subunits and varying amounts of cRNA encoding αA-crystallin (11Ahner A. Nakatsukasa K.

TEV was performed 24 h after injection using a DigiData 1320A interface and a GeneClamp 500B Voltage Clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA).

The oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber (Automate Scientific, San Francisco, CA) with 20 μl of bath solution and continuously perfused with bath solution at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min. The bath solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. All of the experiments were performed at 20-24 °C. ENaC exocytosis rates were determined as previously described (23Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. J. Biol.

After removal of MTSET from the bath, Na+ current was measured by TEV at -100 mV every 30 s for 10 min to monitor current recovery. The initial rates of reappearance of amiloride-sensitive currents were determined from the linear portion of the current recovery curve (0-2 min). ENaC endocytosis rates were determined from oocytes injected with cRNA for wild type α, β, and γ ENaC subunits either in the presence or absence of 6 ng of cRNA for αA-crystallin. 24-36 h after injection, amiloride-sensitive currents were determined by TEV before and after 2, 4, and 6 h of incubation with 5 μm brefeldin A. Amiloride-sensitive currents were expressed relative to the initial amiloride-sensitive current, and data for the current declines were compared. ENaC Surface Expression Measurements—The experiments were performed essentially as described (25Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were injected with varying amounts of cRNA encoding αA-crystallin and 2 ng each of an extracellular FLAG epitope-tagged β ENaC subunit (βF) and wild type α and γ ENaC subunits. Negative controls utilized wild type ENaC β subunit with no epitope tag (no tag). Two days after injection, the oocytes were blocked for 30 min in MBS supplement with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (MBS/BSA) and then incubated for 1 h with MBS/BSA supplement with 1 μg/ml of a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C. The oocytes were then washed at 4 °C for 1 h in MBS/BSA and incubated with MBS/BSA supplemented with 1 μg/ml secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′2) fragment goat anti-mouse IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The oocytes were extensively washed (12 times over 2 h) at 4 °C and transferred to MBS without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 100 μl of SuperSignal Elisa Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical Analysis—Normalized data from oocytes were normalized within an individual batch of oocytes as previously described (26Goldfarb S.B. Kashlan O.B. Watkins J.N. Suaud L. Yan W. Kleyman T.R. Rubenstein R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5817-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. p values were determined by a Student's t test performed with Excel 2003 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) or a one-way ANOVA with a Newman-Keuls post hoc test performed with Igor Pro 5.05A (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), as indicated. A p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. Hsp26 and Hsp42 Facilitate ENaC α Subunit Degradation in Yeast—We recently demonstrated that α-crystallin domain-containing sHsps select aberrant forms of CFTR in both yeast and mammalian cells for ERAD (11Ahner A. Nakatsukasa K. Zhang H. Frizzell R.A. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 18: 806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This chloride channel is co-expressed with ENaC in lung epithelia. Together these channels regulate lung fluid volume, which affects mucociliary clearance (27Knowles M.R. Olivier K.N. Hohneker K.W. Robinson J. Bennett W.D. Boucher R.C. Chest. 1995; 107: 71S-76SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that chaperones with α-crystallin domains may also be involved in ENaC quality control. To test this hypothesis, we inserted the α subunit of mouse ENaC into a yeast vector engineered for constitutive expression. Degradation in both wild type yeast and a variety of yeast mutants was measured by a cycloheximide chase, and the results were quantified after Western blot analysis. The first mutant examined lacked two members of the sHsp family, Hsp26 and Hsp42. Although these two proteins largely recognize the same target proteins, Hsp42 is constitutively present at high levels, whereas Hsp26 expression is temperature-sensitive (28Haslbeck M. Braun N. Stromer T. Richter B. Model N. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Haslbeck M. Ignatiou A. Saibil H. Helmich S. Frenzl E. Stromer T. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found that degradation of α-ENaC was reduced in the hsp26Δhsp42Δ mutant strain compared with wild type yeast (Fig. 1, p < 0.05 at 20 and 60 min). To verify that the ENaC α subunit is an ERAD substrate, we examined the effect on ENaC α subunit degradation when Ufd1p was mutated. Ufd1p is a component of the Cdc48p/Ufd1p/Npl4p AAA ATPase complex that actively transfers ubiquitinated substrates from the ER to the proteasome (30Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The absence of functional Ufd1p significantly decreased α subunit degradation (Fig. 1, p < 0.05 at 60 min). To confirm this observation, we examined the effect of mutating a component of the proteasome “cap,” Cim3p, on ENaC α subunit degradation. Cim3p (also known as Rpt6p) is also a AAA ATPase, and the proteasome cap is thought to drive substrates into the proteasome core for degradation (31Adams J. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2003; 29: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the degradation of the ENaC α subunit in the cim3-1 mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild type yeast (Fig. 1, p < 0.05 at 90 min). These results indicate that the ENaC α subunit is a bona fide ERAD substrate in yeast and that the sHsps promote ENaC α subunit clearance in this organism. αA-crystallin Is Expressed in the Kidney and in Cultured Collecting Duct Cells—In addition to its function in the lung, the role of ENaC in the distal nephron of the kidney remains a focus of research and clinical interest. Because ENaC is expressed in the CCD of the distal nephron (32Ciampolillo F. McCoy D.E. Green R.B. Karlson K.H. Dagenais A. Molday R.S. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1303-C1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because αA-crystallin is the closest mammalian homolog to Hsp26 in yeast, we determined whether αA-crystallin is also expressed in mouse kidney and specifically in the CCD. Reverse transcription-PCR using RNA isolated from both whole mouse kidney and a mouse CCD cell line demonstrated a product at the predicted size of 175 bp using nested αA-crystallin primers (Fig. 2, A and B). The identity of the 175-bp product was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. We confirmed that αA-crystallin protein was present in CCD cells by Western blot analysis. Cell lysates of cultured murine CCD cells were probed with anti-αA-crystallin, and a product at ∼20 kDa was evident (Fig. 2C). This species was similar to the molecular masses of purified bovine αA-crystallin protein alone or when added to lysate. This result confirms that CCD cells endogenously express αA-crystallin. αA-crystallin and ENaC Form Complexes—To determine whether αA-crystallin and ENaC subunits interact, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. MDCK cells were used for these experiments because of the absence of endogenously expressed ENaC (18Morris R.G. Schafer J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In experiments where untransfected cells were both immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with an anti-αA-crystallin antibody, we found that MDCK cells endogenously expressed αA-crystallin (Fig. 2C). We performed experiments where αA-crystallin along with the β, γ, and HA epitope-tagged α (αHA) ENaC subunits were co-transfected. When lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-αA-crystallin antibody, we observed that αA-crystallin co-immunoprecipitated with the αHA ENaC subunit (Fig. 2C). In control experiments in which either (i) ENaC subunits were not co-transfected, (ii) antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation, or (iii) a V5 epitope-tagged α subunit was used, little or no αA-crystallin was apparent in the precipitate. We also examined whether endogenous αA-crystallin co-immunoprecipitated with the ENaC αHA subunit. When lysates of cells co-transfected with β, γ, and αHA ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated with anti-αA-crystallin antibody and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody, we found that the αHA ENaC subunit co-immunoprecipitated with endogenously expressed αA-crystallin (Fig. 2D). In control experiments where a V5-epitope tagged α subunit was used or antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation step, no ENaC α subunit was observed in the precipitate. Both the furin-mediated cleaved and uncleaved bands of the αHA subunit were co-immunoprecipitated with αA-crystallin. We have recently shown that proteolytic processing of ENaC by furin in the trans-Golgi network is required for channel activation (12Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A.

This result suggests that αA-crystallin could associate with the α subunit of ENaC before and after trans-Golgi network-dependent processing events. αA-crystallin Reduces ENaC Expression in Oocytes—To determine whether αA-crystallin affects the functional expression of ENaC, we examined the effect of co-expressing human αA-crystallin with mouse ENaC on channel activity in Xenopus oocytes. Like other sHsps, αA-crystallin associates with unfolded proteins to prevent their aggregation and maintain solubility, but continued association may target the bound protein for ERAD (11Ahner A. Nakatsukasa K. Zhang H. Frizzell R.A. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 18: 806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We injected cRNAs encoding the α, β, and γ mouse ENaC subunits into Xenopus oocytes along with water or various amounts of cRNA encoding αA-crystallin or with cRNA encoding γ-glutamyl transpeptidase as a control. 24 h after injection, we measured the amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents for each group by TEV (Fig. 3A). We found that co-expression of αA-crystallin with ENaC in oocytes reduced ENaC-mediated Na+ currents in a dose-dependent manner, whereas γ-glutamyl transpeptidase cRNA had no effect. We then tested our hypothesis that αA-crystallin inhibition of ENaC currents results from enhanced ERAD in Xenopus oocytes. Using the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (34Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), we determined whether proteasomal activity was required for the inhibitory effect of αA-crystallin on ENaC currents (Fig. 3B). We found that currents from oocytes expressing ENaC alone were not affected by MG-132. However, in oocytes expressing ENaC and αA-crystallin, MG-132 abolished the inhibitory effect of αA-crystallin on ENaC current. This result demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of αA-crystallin on ENaC current depends on the activity of the proteasome, an essential ERAD component. Because of the role of αA-crystallin in facilitating the ERAD of CFTR, we hypothesized that αA-crystallin reduced ENaC current in oocytes by decreasing the number of channels at the cell surface. We therefore measured ENaC surface expression with β subunit having a FLAG epitope tag in the extracellular loop (βF) co-expressed with wild type α and γ subunits using a chemiluminescence-based assay (24Carattino M.D. Hill W.G. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36202-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We found that co-expression of αA-crystallin with ENaC reduced channel surface expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the extent of ENaC surface expression reduction when each amount of the injected αA-crystallin was used paralleled the extent of the reduction in ENaC-mediated Na+ currents (Fig. 3C).

It is well known that chronic TNFα exposure can lead to insulin resistance both in vitro and in vivo and that elevated blood levels of TNFα are observed in obese and/or diabetic individuals. TNFα has many acute biologic effects, mediated by a complex intracellular signaling pathway. In these studies we have identified new G-protein signaling components to this pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that β-arrestin-1 is associated with TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), an adaptor protein of TNF receptors, and that TNFα acutely stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 with an increase in Gαq/11 activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of β-arrestin-1 inhibits TNFα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 by interruption of Src kinase activation. TNFα stimulates lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and β-arrestin-1 knockdown blocks the effects of TNFα to stimulate ERK activation and glycerol release. TNFα also led to activation of JNK with increased expression of the proinflammatory gene, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 3, and β-arrestin-1 knockdown inhibited both of these effects. Taken together these results reveal novel elements of TNFα action; 1) the trimeric G-protein component Gαq/11 and the adapter protein β-arrestin-1 can function as signaling molecules in the TNFα action cascade; 2) β-arrestin-1 can couple TNFα stimulation to ERK activation and lipolysis; 3) β-arrestin-1 and Gαq/11 can mediate TNFα-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and inflammatory gene expression.

TNFα binds to the TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) and receptor-2 (TNF-R2) and stimulates the NFκB pathway through complexes that includes the TRAF, RIP (receptor-interacting protein), and TRADD (TNF-R-associated death domain) families (1Barnes P.J.

Numerous studies have reported TNFα signaling to NFκB activation; however, the mechanisms underlying TNFα stimulates ERK, cdc42, or PI 3-kinase actually remain incompletely understood. It is well known that chronic TNFα treatment can lead to insulin resistance both in vitro (3Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) and in vivo (4Miles P.D. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and elevated levels of TNFα have been reported in obese and/or diabetic individuals. Thus, further insights into the mechanisms of TNFα signaling are of interest. Recent findings reported that TNF-R1 is observed in plasma membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts and/or caveolae (5Feng X. Gaeta M.L. Madge L.A. Yang J.H. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 7654-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in which various G-proteins, 7-transmembrane (TM) receptors (7-TMRs), and many other signaling components are collected. For example, the endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor ETAR, a Gq-coupled 7-TM receptor, is detected in caveolae, and insulin receptors are also found in this membrane structure (7Gustavsson J. Parpal S.

Interestingly, it has been shown that the insulin receptor can couple into the heterotrimeric G-protein Gαq/11 (8Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S.

Based on these facts, we sought to determine whether TNFα signaling could couple with G-protein components to mediate biologic effects. In this report we show that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TNFα signals through the TNF-R1·TRAF2 receptor complex and that this can couple into a trimeric G-protein Gαq/11 and an adaptor protein β-arrestin-1 to mediate TNFα activation of ERK, lipolysis, and stimulation of the proinflammatory pathway.

Cell culture materials and other radioisotopes were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. siRNA Transfection—3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 8 after differentiation) were transiently transfected by electroporation (GENE PULSER, Bio-Rad) with 2 nmol of siRNA duplex, as previously described (11Liao W. Nguyen M.T. Imamura T. Singer O. Verma I.M. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2245-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 24–120 h after electroporation, the efficiency of each siRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR or Western blotting every 24 h, and the time point for the maximum efficiency of each siRNA was determined. All experiments with siRNA were performed 48–96 h after electroporation or microinjection. SiGENOME SMARTpool siRNA against TRAF2 and all other custom siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The target sequences of the siRNAs were follows: β-arrestin 1-A, 5′-GGCCTGTGGTGTGGATTAT-3′; β-arrestin 1-B, 5′-AGCCTTCTGTGCTGAGAAC-3′; Gαq-A, 5′-GCTGGTGTATCAGAACATC-3′;Gαq-B, 5′-TCCATATGTAGATGCAATA-3′;Gα11-A, 5′-ACTCACACTTGGTCGATTA-3′;Gα11-B, 5′-GTTGGTGTACCAGAACATC-3′; cdc42, 5′-GTTATCCACAGACAGATGT-3′; TNF-R1, 5′-GTATGTCCATTCTAAGAAC-3′; TNF-R2, 5′-ACTCCAAGCATCCTTACAT-3′. Each one of the paired siRNAs (A and B) was used separately, and this confirmed the absence of off-target effects. All sequences were confirmed to have no homology to any other genes by BLAST search (NCBI, National Institutes of Health). Photoaffinity GTP-loading Assay—Photoaffinity GTP-labeling of membrane-associated G-proteins was performed as we described previously (12Imamura T. Huang J. Usui I. Satoh H. Bever J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Membrane fractions were semi-purified from scraped 3T3-L1 adipocytes (1 × 108 cells) by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation (18,000 × g, 10 min) in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 15 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then immediately incubated with 10 μm [γ-32P]GTP-azidoanilide (12.2 mCi/μmol) for 3 min followed by UV irradiation (254 nm) for 1 min on ice. Samples were lysed with the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentrations, 1%), then immunoprecipitated with anti-Gαs, Gαq/11, or Gαi antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Inositol Phosphate Production Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with myo-[3H]inositol (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) (2 μCi/ml) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h before assay. After washing cells twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were stimulated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 15 min. The accumulation of total 3H-labeled (IP1 and IP2 plus IP3) was measured as previously described (13Shimizu N. Guo J. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49003-49012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cdc42 Assay—cdc42 activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 16 h and stimulated with 17 nm insulin or 20 ng/ml TNFα for the indicated time periods, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mm NaF for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. For a negative control cell lysate was incubated with 1 mm GDP for 15 min at 30 °C. 5 μg of p21-activated kinase 1-agarose beads, which specifically bound to active cdc42, were added to the cell lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed with lysis buffer three times and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cdc42 antibody. Lipolysis Assay—Triglyceride hydrolysis (lipolysis) was measured using free glycerol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice and incubated with L-buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin) then stimulated with or without TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 16 h. To measure lipolysis, 150 μl of free glycerol assay reagent was incubated with 10 μl of culture supernatants and glycerol standards for 15 min, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. A standard curve constructed from the glycerol standards was used to calculate the concentration of glycerol in the culture supernatants.

A. 2003; 100: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were performed as we previously described. The G-protein Signaling Component β-Arrestin-1, Couples with the TNF Receptor Complex—β-Arrestin-1 is a scaffold protein that functions in a number of 7-TMR (typical G protein-coupled receptor) signaling pathways, and TRAF2 serves as an adaptor protein for TNFα signaling. To assess the relationship between these systems, we examined the association between β-arrestin-1 and TRAF2 in FLAG-tagged β-arrestin-1 expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 1A, β-arrestin-1 was detected in anti-TRAF2 antibody immunoprecipitates in the basal state, and this was greatly reduced after TNFα stimulation (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). This result indicates that β-arrestin-1 associates with TNF receptor complexes in the basal state and dissociates from this complex after TNFα stimulation. In the 7-TMR systems, β-arrestin-1 binds to Src kinase, and ligand stimulation results in Src-kinase activation (18Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To see if this was also the case for TNFα, we measured Src-kinase activity, and we detect that, like ET-1, TNFα acutely stimulated Src-kinase activity (2.5-fold above basal), as shown in Fig. 1B. Using RNA interference, electroporation with siRNA against β-arrestin-1 (βar1-A or βar1-B) decreased protein expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1C), and we found that acute stimulation of Src kinase activity with TNFα was inhibited by siRNA knockdown of β-arrestin-1 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that TNFα-induced Src-kinase activation is dependent on β-arrestin-1, similar to 7-TMR signaling. Umemori et al. (19Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that the activation of Gαq/11 is coincident with phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 356 in the C terminus of Gαq/11. In response to ET-1 stimulation, we have previously reported that Src kinase plays a key role, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 (14Imamura T. Huang J. Dalle S. Ugi S. Usui I. Luttrell L.M. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43663-43667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the effects of TNFα on Gαq/11 and found that TNFα acutely induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 at 3 min after stimulation and that this effect was inhibited by siRNA-mediated β-arrestin-1 knockdown (Fig. 1E). Because two different siRNA against β-arrestin-1 (βar1-A or βar1-B in the upper panel) showed quite comparable results, this confirms that off-target effects do not contribute to our results. Furthermore, the Src-kinase inhibitor, PP2, also inhibited TNFα-induced Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1F), similar to its effects to block ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation (14Imamura T. Huang J. Dalle S. Ugi S. Usui I. Luttrell L.M. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43663-43667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PP2 did not inhibit insulin-induced Gαq/11 phosphorylation, suggesting that the insulin receptor kinase itself can phosphorylate Gαq/11 independent of Src kinase activity. These results indicate that β-arrestin-1 mediates the effect of TNFα to phosphorylate Gαq/11 via the activation of Src-kinase. TNFα Stimulates Gαq/11 Activity without Leading to Phospholipase Cβ (PLC-β) Activation—To confirm the activation of Gαq/11, we performed a GTP-loading assay using photoaffinity GTP labeling method, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2A, TNFα stimulation increased the amount of GTP bound to Gαq/11 (3-fold) but had little effect on GTP loading of Gαi or Gαs. Consistent with this, TNFα stimulation did not lead to changes in the cellular cyclic AMP level (Fig. 2B). It is generally thought that activated Gαq/11 stimulates PLC-β, leading to the induction of diacylglycerol, inositol phosphate-3, and subsequent arachidonic acid release. We measured the total amount of inositol phosphates (Fig. 2C, left panel) and arachidonic acid release (Fig. 2C, right panel) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and found that TNFα stimulation interestingly did not increase either of these metabolites, suggesting that TNFα does not activate PLC-β. This is also observed in insulin receptor signaling (Fig. 2C), in which Gαq/11 is activated (8Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and importantly, both receptors do not have a 7-TM type structure. Several studies have revealed that the second and/or third intracellular loops of 7-TM receptors are required for PLC-β activation (20Wang H.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1728-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Thompson J.B. Wade S.M. Harrison J.K. Salafranca M.N. Neubig R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 216-222PubMed Google Scholar), and these motifs are not present in the insulin and TNF receptors. Therefore, we hypothesized that non-7-TM type receptor cannot associate with PLC-β. We tested the co-immunoprecipitation with receptor antibody and found no co-immunoprecipitation of PLC-β3 (the main isoform of the PLC-β family in 3T3-L1 adipocytes) with anti-TNF-R1 antibody, although PLC-β3 was modestly co-immunoprecipitated with anti-ETAR-Ab after ET-1 treatment (Fig. 2D). Biological Roles of β-Arrestin-1-Gαq/11 as Signaling Mediators for TNFα Action—To investigate which biological effects of TNFα are mediated by β-arrestin-1/Src kinase and Gαq/11, we first focused on JNK, a proinflammatory pathway mediator, since the mechanism of JNK activation is still unclear. Using RNA interference-induced knockdown of TNF-R1, TNF-R2, or TRAF2 (Fig. 3, A and B, left panel), we found that TNFα (20 ng/ml, 8 min) stimulated JNK phosphorylation and that this effect was strongly inhibited by TNF-R1 or TRAF2 knockdown but not by TNF-R2 knockdown (Fig. 3C), consistent with the view that a TNF-R1·TRAF2 complex mediates TNFα signaling to JNK activation. It has been reported previously that activation of JNK is mediated by cdc42 (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) and PI 3-kinase (23Lopez-Ilasaca M. Li W. Uren A. Yu J.C. Kazlauskas A. Gutkind J.S. Heidaran M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and that TNFα can stimulate cdc42 (24Puls A. Eliopoulos A.G. Nobes C.D. Bridges T. Young L.S. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PI 3-kinase activities (25Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms for activation of these kinases are unclear. Because activated Gαq/11 can lead to stimulation of cdc42 and cdc42-associated PI 3-kinase (26Usui I. Imamura T. Huang J. Satoh H. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13765-13774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we assessed this pathway with respect to TNFα stimulation. Using RNA interference showing in Figs. 1C and 3B, we found that TNFα-stimulated JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by β-arrestin-1, Gαq/11, or cdc42 knockdown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3D). Two different siRNAs against β-arrestin-1 (βar1-A in Fig. 3D, left panels, and βar1-B in rightside panels) or Gαq/11 (Gq-A + G11-A in Fig. 3D, left panels, and Gq-B + G11-B in right side panels) showed quite similar results, indicating that there were no off-target effects in these siRNAs. To confirm these signaling events, we tested the effect of kinase inhibitors on TNFα signaling. Consistent with the above results, TNFα-stimulated JNK activation was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with the Src inhibitor (PP2), the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002, LY), or the cdc42 inhibitor (toxin-B, TB) but not by MEK inhibitor (PD98059, PD) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we confirmed that TNFα stimulates cdc42 activity (Fig. 4B) and cdc42-associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 4C), and these effects were inhibited by PP2 treatment (*, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, these data indicated that TNFα signaling goes through the TNF-R1·TRAF2 → β-arrestin-1-Src-kinase → Gαq/11 → cdc42/PI 3-kinase pathway to activate JNK, a proinflammatory pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It has been reported that TNFα-induced ERK activation was regulated by Src kinase (27van Vliet C. Bukczynska P.E. Puryer M.A. Sadek C.M. Shields B.J. Tremblay M.L. Tiganis T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), although the full mechanisms of ERK activation remain unclear. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes TNFα-induced ERK phosphorylation was maximal at 15 min after stimulation, and this effect was significantly inhibited by TNF-R1 or TRAF2 knockdown but not the results for TNF-R2 knockdown (Fig. 5A), similar to the results for JNK activation (Fig. 3B). Previous reports showed that human TNFα can bind to mouse TNF-R1 but not to mouse TNF-R2 (28Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and this is fully consistent with the results in Fig. 5A, showing that the effects of human TNFα on ERK phosphorylation are also blocked by siRNA-mediated TNF-R1 knockdown. As seen in Fig. 5B, TNFα-induced ERK phosphorylation was decreased 68% by β-arrestin-1 knockdown (*, p < 0.01), indicating that β-arrestin-1 mediates the effect of TNF-R1 signaling. Interestingly, neither Gαq/11 knockdown nor inhibition of Gαi with pertussis toxin treatment inhibited TNFα-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that this signaling pathway does not utilize these G-protein components. This is of particular interest since Figs. 1E and 2A showed that TNFα can lead to Gαq/11 phosphorylation and activation, indicating a separation of signaling pathways which flow through β-arrestin-1 versus β-arrestin-1-Gαq/11. In other systems we (29Dalle S. Imamura T. Rose D.W. Worrall D.S. Ugi S. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6272-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and others (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) have shown that β-arrestin-1 is an upstream regulator of ERK activity, and recent reports by Kang et al. (31Kang J. Shi Y. Xiang B. Qu B. Su W. Zhu M. Zhang M. Bao G. Wang F. Zhang X. Yang R. Fan F. Chen X. Pei G. Ma L. Cell. 2005; 123: 833-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) revealed that β-arrestin-1 can be translocated to the nucleus after ligand stimulation, where it participates in regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, we measured mRNA expression levels of two TNFα target genes, MMP3 and MCP-1, and found that expression of these genes was strongly stimulated by TNFα treatment (Fig. 5C). Because TNFα stimulation of both ERK and JNK1 appears to be β-arrestin-1-dependent and because both ERK and JNK1 can regulate gene expression, we investigated the effects of β-arrestin-1 knockdown and found that TNFα-induced MCP-1 and MMP3 expression was inhibited by depletion of β-arrestin-1 (*, p < 0.03). Another biologic effect of TNFα in adipocytes is stimulation of lipolysis. We found a role for β-arrestin-1 signaling in this process by showing that TNFα-induced lipolysis was partially inhibited by β-arrestin-1 knockdown (*, p < 0.05) but not by Gαq/11 knockdown, as seen in Fig. 5D, left panel. Because β-arrestin-1 mediates TNFα-induced ERK activation, we treated the cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and found that this also partially inhibited TNFα-induced lipolysis (*, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5D, right panel), consistent with a previous report (32Greenberg A.S. Shen W.J. Muliro K. Patel S. Souza S.C. Roth R.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45456-45461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). TNFα stimulation induces a wide range of biologic effects related to innate immunity, inflammation, insulin resistance/diabetes, and other conditions. Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major cause of decreased insulin sensitivity. By activating pro-inflammatory pathways (33Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar), TNFα can cause insulin resistance in vitro (3Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) and in animals treated with TNFα (4Miles P.D. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of TNFα action have been extensively studied, and many elements of this pathway have been defined (2Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). In this study we have identified new elements of a novel TNFα signaling pathway in adipocytes, which flows through a TNF-R1·TRAF2 complex and includes the use of the classical 7-TMR signaling components, β-arrestin-1, and Gαq/11. We found that β-arrestin-1 can mediate TNFα effects on Src kinase and ERK activation and that Gαq/11 can couple TNFα action to cdc42, PI 3-kinase, and JNK activation, leading to the induction of lipolysis and proinflammatory gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It is well known that β-arrestin-1 plays several roles in 7-TMR function, including receptor desensitization and internalization (34Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has also been reported that β-arrestin-1 interacts with non-7-TM type receptors, such as the insulin-like growth factor-I, epidermal growth factor, and insulin receptors (35Dalle S. Ricketts W. Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and here we show that the TNF-R1·TRAF2 complex can signal through β-arrestin-1 to mediate TNFα biological effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As such, these studies further demonstrate the diverse functions of β-arrestin-1 as an adaptor protein mediating the signaling properties of receptor systems distinct from its classical role in 7-TMR action. Our studies also show that the G-protein component, Gαq/11, can also function in the TNFα signaling pathway. To accomplish this task, TNFα signaling uses β-arrestin-1 effects to activate Src kinase, causing Gαq/11 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Together these effects can mediate downstream signaling events such as activation of ERK, PI 3-kinase, and lipolysis. We investigated the downstream TNFα effects transduced by β-arrestin-1 and/or Gαq/11, and one of them is JNK activation. It is well known that JNK can propagate the effects of TNFα to induce proinflammatory gene expression, and this can result in insulin resistance. Previous studies have shown that TNFα-induced JNK activation is mediated by TRAF2 (36Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), cdc42 (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), Src (37Tateno M. Nishida Y. Adachi-Yamada T. Science. 2000; 287: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase (38Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). There may be multiple ways in which TNFα can cause JNK activation, and consistent with these reports, our findings show that TNFα can signal through β-arrestin-1/Src-kinase → Gαq/11 → cdc42/PI 3-kinase to activate JNK. Similarly, previous studies revealed multiple mediators for TNFα-induced ERK activation, including TRAF2, MADD, and Src kinase (27van Vliet C. Bukczynska P.E. Puryer M.A. Sadek C.M. Shields B.J. Tremblay M.L. Tiganis T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39Schievella A.R. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ligand stimulation can induce diverse signaling pathways leading to ERK activation; e.g. insulin-like growth factor-I receptor can signal through β-arrestin-1/Gαi as well as SHC to activate ERK (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 40Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22583-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Consistent with this formulation, siRNA-induced β-arrestin-1 knockdown did not completely inhibit TNFα-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), indicating the presence of another pathway(s) from the TNF receptor to this biologic end point. Because NFκB pathway may also be involved in lipolytic effects (41Laurencikiene J. van Harmelen V. Arvidsson Nordstrom E. Dicker A. Blomqvist L. Naslund E. Langin D. Arner P. Ryden M. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), this may also explain why β-arrestin-1 knockdown only partially inhibits TNFα-stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 5D). Previous studies have shown that β-arrestin-1 is an upstream mediator of ERK activation in various receptor signaling systems (42Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar) and that β-arrestin-1 can translocate into the nucleus to exert transcriptional effects (31Kang J. Shi Y. Xiang B. Qu B. Su W. Zhu M. Zhang M. Bao G. Wang F. Zhang X. Yang R. Fan F. Chen X. Pei G. Ma L. Cell. 2005; 123: 833-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, activated JNK stimulates c-Jun, which translocates into the nucleus as a transcription factor activating pro-inflammatory gene expression (43Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that β-arrestin-1 might play a role in TNFα-induced gene expression. Consistent with this, our results show that siRNA-knockdown of β-arrestin-1 exerts inhibitory effects on TNFα-stimulated MCP-1 and MMP3 gene expression. TNFα stimulation induces a wide range of biologic effects related to innate immunity, inflammation, insulin resistance/diabetes, and other conditions. Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major cause of decreased insulin sensitivity, and by activating proinflammatory pathways (33Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Last, it is well known that elevated circulating free fatty acid levels can be a cause of insulin resistance (44Groop L.C. Bonadonna R.C.

In this study we have identified new elements in TNFα signaling pathways in adipocytes, which can lead to inflammatory pathway activation and lipolysis (Fig. 6). This pathway flows through a TNF-R1·TRAF2 receptor complex and includes the use of classical 7-TMR signaling components, β-arrestin-1 and Gαq/11, showing a novel signaling paradigm for these molecules distinct from their traditional functions mediating signals from an array of 7-TMRs.

https://openalex.org/W2042206377,"Due to the ever changing environmental conditions in soil, regulation of osmotic homeostasis in the soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is critical. AQP-8 is a C. elegans aquaporin that is expressed in the excretory cell, a renal equivalent tissue, where the protein participates in maintaining water balance. To better understand the regulation of AQP-8, we undertook a promoter analysis to identify the aqp-8 cis-regulatory elements. Using progressive 5′ deletions of upstream sequence, we have mapped an essential regulatory region to roughly 300 bp upstream of the translational start site of aqp-8. Analysis of this region revealed a sequence corresponding to a known DNA functional element (octamer motif), which interacts with POU homeobox transcription factors. Phylogenetic footprinting showed that this site is perfectly conserved in four nematode species. The octamer site's function was further confirmed by deletion analyses, mutagenesis, functional studies, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Of the three POU homeobox proteins encoded in the C. elegans genome, CEH-6 is the only member that is expressed in the excretory cell. We show that expression of AQP-8 is regulated by CEH-6 by performing RNA interference experiments. CEH-6's mammalian ortholog, Brn1, is expressed both in the kidney and the central nervous system and binds to the same octamer consensus binding site to drive gene expression. These parallels in transcriptional control between Brn1 and CEH-6 suggest that C. elegans may well be an appropriate model for determining gene-regulatory networks in the developing vertebrate kidney.

Res. 1983; 82: 156-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The excretory system is comprised of four cells: the excretory duct cell, the binucleate excretory gland cell, the excretory pore cell, and the excretory (canal) cell. The excretory cell is a large fluid-filled cell consisting of a cell body, which is located ventral to the isthmus worm pharynx. From the cell body, two long canals extend posteriorly and two shorter canals extend anteriorly; the four canals are joined at the cell body forming an H-shape. The surface areas of the four canals are greatly increased by a system of canaliculi, which also provides exposure to the extracellular fluid-filled pseudocoelomic cavity (2Buechner M. Hall D.H. Bhatt H. Hedgecock E.M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Developmental outgrowth of the excretory cell has been shown to be modulated by many of the same mechanisms that dictate neuronal guidance (3Buechner M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both of these tissues extend long cellular processes between their cell membranes and the epidermal basal lamina during development. Indeed, mutations in many genes, including lin-17, unc-5, unc-6, unc-34, unc-53, and unc-73, affect both neuronal and excretory cell development either by disrupting circumferential growth or by causing premature migrational termination of cellular processes (4Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Hall D.H. Stern B.D. Development. 1987; 100: 365-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, excretory cell tubulogenesis occurs in vitro using conditions intended for neuronal cell culturing (2Buechner M. Hall D.H. Bhatt H. Hedgecock E.M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with the excretory cell's role in osmoregulation, previous experiments have shown that the excretory duct cell pumping rates in dauer larvae (a nematode diapause state induced by adverse environmental pressures) were inversely proportional to environmental osmotic pressures (5Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Laser ablation of the excretory cell, duct cell, or pore cell leads to fluid retention within the worm (5Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These two examples clearly demonstrate that the nematode excretory system is an osmoregulatory organ and therefore functionally analogous to the vertebrate kidney (1Nelson F.K. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1983; 82: 156-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The constrained developmental processes for such a unique structure and the physiological properties of the excretory cell make it an ideal tissue for studies on transcriptional regulation and how they relate to both renal and neuronal development. In addition, the excretory cell is the largest single cell in the worm making it ideal for studies of gross morphological defects. To maintain fluid homeostasis between an organism and its environment and between tissues, members of the aquaporin (AQP) 6The abbreviations used are: AQPaquaporinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTESSTranscriptional Element Search SystemEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPESTdegradation signal consisting of a Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr rich sequenceSAGEserial analysis of gene expressionPOUpit, oct, and uncRNAiRNA interferencedsRNAdouble strand RNAESTexpressed sequence tagTFtranscription factor.6The abbreviations used are: AQPaquaporinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTESSTranscriptional Element Search SystemEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPESTdegradation signal consisting of a Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr rich sequenceSAGEserial analysis of gene expressionPOUpit, oct, and uncRNAiRNA interferencedsRNAdouble strand RNAESTexpressed sequence tagTFtranscription factor. family of water channels are expressed in various tissues and developmental stages in all forms of life to facilitate water movement across biological membranes. The existence of AQPs in virtually all cells allows for bidirectional passive flux of water across lipid bilayers, which in the absence of these proteins are essentially impermeable barriers. In addition, many cell types incorporate multiple different AQPs per cell and/or tissue. The spatial and temporal expression redundancy of AQPs may explain the relative lack of resultant gross phenotypes in AQP knock-out studies. AQPs have been discovered in all types of organisms, from mammals to a recently discovered 270-amino acid homolog, AQPV1, in the Chlorella virus MT325s (6Gazzarrini S. Kang M. Epimashko S. Van Etten J.L. Dainty J. Thiel G. Moroni A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first AQP cloned, the 28-kDa protein AQP1, is a common protein in human red blood cell plasma membranes occurring at a level of ∼120,000-160,000 copies per cell (7Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Agre P. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Jung J.S. Raina S. Moon C. Guggino W.B. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F463-F476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides transporting water, many AQP members have the capacity to transport other small non-charged molecules. Selectivity of the channel for different uncharged solutes is derived from a proton filter region in the protein characterized by a pore-associated arginine residue in association with neighboring aromatic amino acids (9de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Due to these different channel specificities, AQPs are grouped into two functionally distinct classes: the aquaporins, which are exclusively water channels, and the aquaglyceroporins, which also have the ability to transport small non-ionic molecules such as glycerol and urea (10Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). AQPs contain a pair of signature domains, the NPA motifs (asparagine-proline-alanine, or in some cases, asparagine-proline-valine), which are essential for the pore structure and function (10Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The locations of the NPA amino acid residues allow passage of water through the pore. Due to hydrogen bonding interactions, the molecules travel through the pore in a single file manner (11Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Overall, each AQP1 unit has the capacity to allow the passage of three billion molecules of water per second (11Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). An additional requirement for a functional aquaporin is a conserved fold in the protein, which has been observed in both AQP1 and the bacterial aquaglyceroporin, GlpF (11Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Some AQPs can be blocked by Hg2+ at a pore-associated cysteine residue (12Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, 7 of 13 identified AQPs are expressed in various parts of the kidney to maintain osmotic balance and to prevent excessive fluid loss (13Castle N.A. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The C. elegans genome contains eleven AQPs (aqps 1-11) (14The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3588) Google Scholar). Like their mammalian counterparts, C. elegans AQP-4 (F40F9.9) and AQP-2 (C01G6.1), have been shown to be involved in fluid homeostasis. These results were obtained by physiological experiments determining changes in water flux as a result of the insertion of AQPs into Xenopus laevis oocyte membranes (15Huang C.G. Lamitina T. Agre P. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 292: C186-C1873Google Scholar, 16Kuwahara M. Ishibashi K. Gu Y. Terada Y. Kohara Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Am. J.

Acta. 2000; 1517: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, AQP-4 was shown to be inhibited by Hg2+, much like other aquaporins (12Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kuwahara M. Ishibashi K. Gu Y. Terada Y. Kohara Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Am. J.

Acta. 2000; 1517: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The expression patterns for the C. elegans AQPs 1-8 have been determined previously (15Huang C.G. Lamitina T. Agre P. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 292: C186-C1873Google Scholar). Three of the eight AQPs studied were demonstrated to be expressed in the excretory cell (aqp-2, aqp-3, and aqp-8) (15Huang C.G. Lamitina T. Agre P. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 292: C186-C1873Google Scholar). Prior studies have identified DNA regions containing functional cis-regulatory elements of various AQPs. Areas containing positive acting cis-regulatory elements for human AQP1 have been determined by analyzing the transcriptional activity of various length gene-upstream fragments (18Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1998; 47: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Regions containing negative transcriptional regulators of mouse AQP2 have also been determined (19Rai T. Uchida S. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F264-F273PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, human AQP4, which has two splice variants that lead to isoforms with distinct N termini and pore permeability properties, has been shown to be under the control of alternate upstream regulatory sequences directly upstream of each splice variant (20Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1998; 50: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Studies in plants have also revealed regions containing cis-regulatory elements, which modulate AQPs. An analysis of the AthH2 (PIP1b), an Arabidopsis AQP, upstream regulatory region revealed two phytohormone-induced enhancer-containing regions (21Kaldenhoff R. Kolling A. Meyers J. Karmann U. Ruppel G. Richter G. Plant J. 1995; 7: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study we have determined a cis-regulatory element that is required for the expression of an aquaporin in the excretory cell of C. elegans. Information pertaining to AQP expression and regulation in the excretory system of C. elegans will provide complementary information to previous studies on transcriptional regulation of aquaporins and to also perhaps provide a basis for determining mechanisms controlling transcription in mammalian renal and neuronal tissues. Nematode Strains and Maintenance—Strains were maintained at 20 °C, and all manipulations were conducted using standard methods (22Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains used in these studies are shown in Table 1. We generated a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing line by subjecting (BC6835) aqp-8-711::GFP-PEST P0 worms to 1,500-rad X-irradiation.

BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Promoter-containing sequences were fused upstream of the GFP coding region. The reverse promoter associated primer includes a segment complementary to the forward primer used for amplification of the GFP-reporter cassettes. GFP-coding cassettes used for expression pattern analysis are as follows: pPD95.67 (GFP), pPD95.75 (GFP), pAF207 (GFP-PEST), and pPD97.78 (Δpes-10::GFP). All GFP variants used are modified by the addition of a 5′-nuclear localization, 3′-unc-54-untranslated region, S65C mutation, and additional synthetic introns. Site-directed mutagenesis of the motif site was carried out via nucleotide substitutions corresponding to residue changes in the motif in the forward primer. In all cases except the Δpes-10::GFP fusion construct and the AQP-8::GFP translational fusion construct, the reverse primer for upstream regulatory region amplification is aqp-8R: agtcgacctgcaggcatgcaagcttagaaacggatcgcagaaaa. The forward primers used for amplification of deletional constructs are shown in supplemental Table S1. The forward primers used for mutagenesis of the cis-regulatory element are as follows (mutated residues are underlined): aqp-8 oct G→A: ttgccaaaatttacatactggaat and aqp-8 oct C→G: ttgccaaaatttggatactggaat. Primers used for tandem motif fusion to Δpes-10::GFP are as follows: 4XOCTR: agtcgacctgcaggcatgcaagcttatgcaaatttatgcaaattta. 4XOCTL: aatttgcataaatttgcataaatttgcataaatttgcata. The reverse primer used for generating the translational AQP-8::GFP construct was AQP-8protB: TTTCTACCGGTACCCTCAAGGGtccactactgtcactatactctctgtca. The forward primer used for the translational construct corresponds to aqp-8-1.6kb (supplemental Table S1). PCR constructs were co-injected with the Dpy-5 rescuing construct, pCeh361 (24Thacker C. Sheps J.A. Rose A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), into the syncitial gonad of late L4 dpy-5(e907) worms. Wild-type F1 worms were plated individually. Wild-type F2 worms were selected to start the lines. In the case of generating multiple independent lines, each were analyzed separately and designated as individual segregants (Table 1). Microscopy—A Zeiss Axioscope equipped with a QImaging camera and the appropriate optical filter sets were used for GFP expression pattern analysis. Worms were immobilized with 100 mm sodium azide (in water) immediately prior to imaging. All images were taken at 400× with identical camera settings for all images (exposure times are indicated in the figures). Images were captured using QCapture software and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS. Sequence Analysis—DNA and peptide sequence alignments were carried out using ClustalX (25Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35300) Google Scholar) with default settings. The DNA sequence spanning the bases -283 to -234 upstream of the C. elegans aqp-8 translational start site was used as a query in the Transcriptional Element Search System (TESS) to identify potential conserved transcription factor binding sites. Default parameters were used. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated from N2 worms harvested in M9 buffer. The extracts were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents Kit (Pierce). The synthetic biotinylated oligonucleotides used in this study include the consensus octamer oligonucleotide, 5′-ATTGCCAAAATTTGCATACTGGAAT-3′ and its complement 5′-ATTCCAGTATGCAAATTTTGGCAAT-3′. EMSA reactions were carried out using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce). Samples were then loaded into an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5× Tris/Borate buffer at 100 V for 1 h. The entire gel electrophoresis apparatus was chilled using an ice-bath during operation. RNAi—Adult BC6925 (AQP-8::GFP-expressing) worms were injected with 200 ng/μl dsRNA corresponding to either eri-1 (control) or a mixture of both eri-1 and ceh-6 dsRNA (experimental). The progeny of the injected worms were scored 48 h post-injection for the presence of GFP fluorescence in the excretory cell using a standard image exposure time of 1 s with identical camera settings for all images. Bioinformatic Analysis—To identify genes that are potentially regulated by CEH-6 and the POU homeobox transcription factor DNA binding site (ATTTGCAT) in C. elegans, we carried out a bioinformatics search. We searched the putative upstream regions (in this analysis defined as 1000 bp upstream of the translational start site (ATG)) of all C. elegans protein-coding genes, as well as the gene-upstream regions of genes in the related nematodes C. briggsae and C. remanei, for the motif ATTTGCAT. A C. elegans gene is considered if its C. briggsae and C. remanei orthologs both contain one or more octamer motifs as well. To achieve this, genome sequences of these three Caenorhabditis species and the predicated motifs were loaded into a MySQL data base using the GFF3 format. Comparative analysis is done by Perl using a Bio::DB::GFF module (26Stein L.D. Mungall C. Shu S. Caudy M. Mangone M. Day A. Nickerson E. Stajich J.E. Harris T.W. Arva A. Lewis S. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Candidate C. elegans CEH-6-regulated genes were examined for their expression patterns by searching a C. elegans GFP expression data base. 7Hunt-Newbury, R., Vivieros, R., Johnsen, R., Mah, A., Anastis, D., Fang, L., Halfknight, E., Lee, D., Lin, J., Lorch, A., McKay, S., Okada, H., Pan, J., Schultz, A., Tu, D., Wong, K., Zhao, Z., Alexeyenkor, A., Burglin, T., Sonnhammer, E., Schnabel, R., Jones, S., Marra, M., Baillie, D., and Moerman, D. PLOS Biol., in press. Statistical significance was determined by 10,000 random selections of the number of candidate genes with expression pattern and calculating the probability of the observed number of genes in the excretory cell. The probability was calculated by counting the number of times, out of 10,000, that a value is greater than or equal to the observed value over the total number of trials. Mathematically, this can be represented by letting v be the observed value and letting N be the set of excretory cell observations from random selections. S is the largest subset of N such that ∀ σ ∈ S, σ ≥ v. The resulting probability is |S|/|N|. Identification of an Excretory System Expressed AQP—Gene transcriptional patterns were determined for each of the eleven C. elegans aqp members (aqps 1-11) by assaying expression patterns derived from promoter::GFP fusions in vivo (data not shown). Consistent with previous evidence (15Huang C.G. Lamitina T. Agre P. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 292: C186-C1873Google Scholar), aqp-8 is the only AQP that had its expression localized exclusively to the excretory system of the worm (Fig. 1). The intergenic region between aqp-8 and its closest upstream gene neighbor, K02G10.1, is 2,220 bp. Our initial aqp-8 upstream region was defined as the 1,556-bp region from -1575 to -20bp immediately upstream of the K02G10.7 translational start site (Fig. 1A). Expression of aqp-8 also appears to be localized to an additional cell. We presume, by the location of the additional cell, that this cell may be the excretory gland cell. Because many genes are transiently expressed for specific physiological functions and processes, we assayed for the temporal activity of the upstream regulatory region of aqp-8 using the GFP-PEST reporter (pAF207, kindly provided by A. Frand) (27Frand A.R. Russel S. Ruvkun G. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e312Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The PEST sequence (Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr) is a signal for rapid degradation of proteins, which was discovered as a conserved sequence from multiple alignments of known short-lived proteins (28Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the PEST sequence was inserted directly upstream of the 3′-untranslated region toward the C-terminal portion of GFP, producing a GFP variant with an in vivo half-life of less than 1 h (27Frand A.R. Russel S. Ruvkun G. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e312Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The aqp-8p::GFP-PEST-expressing worms displayed an identical spatial pattern to the worms carrying the usual aqp-8::GFP construct, but due to the short half-life of the GFP-PEST construct, we were able to determine that aqp-8 is transcribed only in the interval between the first larval stage and early adulthood. The relative levels of expression in the excretory cell and the excretory gland cell appeared to be similar to each other (Fig. 1, A and B). Expression patterns derived from extrachromosomal arrays may be confounded by somatic loss of the transgene (leading to mosaically expressing transgenes). Therefore, we confirmed the expression pattern of aqp-8 by generating a genome-integrated aqp-8p::GFP transgenic line to prevent the sporadic loss of the transgene in somatic tissue (Fig. 1C). These expression data are consistent with the C. elegans developmental Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) profiles of aqp-8 (29McKay S.J. Johnsen R. Khattra J. Asano J. Baillie D.L. Chan S.

Herein we show that glycine substitution of the VAVIM motif in CaV2.3 produced whole cell currents with inactivation kinetics that were either slower (A1719G ≈ V1720G), similar (V1718G), or faster (I1721G ≈ M1722G) than the wild-type channel. The fast kinetics of I1721G were observed with a ≈+10 mV shift in its voltage dependence of activation (E0.5,act). In contrast, the slow kinetics of A1719G and V1720G were accompanied by a significant shift of ≈-20 mV in their E0.5,act indicating that the relative stability of the channel closed state was decreased in these mutants. Glycine scan performed with Val 349 in IS6, Ile701 in IIS6, and Leu1420 in IIIS6 at positions predicted to face Val1720 in IVS6 also produced slow inactivating currents with hyperpolarizing shifts in the activation and inactivation potentials, again pointing out a decrease in the stability of the channel closed state. Mutations to other hydrophobic residues at these positions nearly restored the channel gating. Altogether these data indicate that residues at positions equivalent to 1720 exert a critical control upon the relative stability of the channel closed and open states and more specifically, that hydrophobic residues at these positions promote the channel closed state.

Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) 3The abbreviation used is: VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. 3The abbreviation used is: VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. are membrane proteins that play a key role in promoting Ca2+ influx in response to membrane depolarization in excitable cells. VDCCs arise from the multimerization of distinct subunits: CaVα1, CaVβ, and CaVα2δ, and sometimes CaVγ (1Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To this date, molecular cloning has identified the primary structures for 10 distinct calcium channel CaVα1 subunits (2Snutch T.P. Reiner P.B. Curr. Opin.

The CaVα1 subunit is the main pore-forming subunit that carries the channel activation gating among other functions. The CaVα1 subunits of VDCCs are evolutionarily related to the α subunit of Kv channels with a single polypeptidic chain carrying four domains of six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) (9Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, Third Ed. 2001; Google Scholar). Although the overall identity at the primary sequence level is very low between CaV and Kv channels, it goes up to 10–25% when comparing the S6 transmembrane segments. As in Kv channels, the S6 transmembrane segments of CaVα1 are believed to line the channel pore and form the channel inner vestibule. It was inferred from the three-dimensional structures of KcsA, MthK, KvAP, KirBac, and Kv1.2 channels that the M2/S6 transmembrane segments include the activation gate that controls channel opening (10Doyle D.A.

In the Shaker K+ channels, the residue hydrophobicity in this region could alter the channel closed-open equilibrium (15Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To study the functional importance of S6 residues in the gating of CaV2.3, we searched for conserved motifs of hydrophobic residues. The VAVIM motif is conserved in the S6 transmembrane segment of domain IV (IVS6) of high voltage-activated CaV1 and CaV2 families (Fig. 1A). Numerous algorithms align the PVPVIV activation locus in Shaker Kv channels with the FVAVIM (50% identity) (Fig. 1B) suggesting that this locus could play a role in the activation gating of HVA VDCCs. Precious clues regarding the role of the VAVIM motif in channel function came from genetic diseases. Mutation of the conserved Ile to Leu in CaV2.1 was identified in patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine (17Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S. Striessnig J. J. Biol.

I1811L altered the channel gating properties by shifting the voltage dependence of activation by -5 to -12 mV, depending upon the expression system (17Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S.

Herein we show that substitutions of the Ile1721 residue in the human CaV2.3, corresponding to Ile1811 in the human CaV2.1, by residues of different structural properties (hydrophobicity, charge, polarity, and size) yielded whole cell currents with altered gating properties. Mutations of Ile1721 (Ala, Glu, Gly, His, Leu, Pro, Thr, and Val) including the conservative I1721L mutation, shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation to more negative potentials (up to -30 mV shifts) compared with the wild-type CaV2.3 channel. Glycine mutants A1719G, V1720G, I1721G, and M1722G within the VAVIM motif significantly altered the channel whole cell kinetics as well as the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation. The equilibrium between the channel closed and open states was modified in favor of the closed state in I1721G and M1722G. In contrast, A1719G and V1720G shifted the open/closed equilibrium toward the channel open state. Glycine mutations introduced at positions equivalent to Val1720 in S6 of Domains I (Val349), II (Ile701), and III (Leu1420) yielded similar results prompting the suggestion that the open state was stabilized in these mutants. Altogether our findings identify S6 hydrophobic residues in Domains I to IV that play a unique role in controlling the relative stability of the open and closes states in CaV2.3.

Data Acquisition and Analysis-PClamp software 8.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for on-line data acquisition and analysis. A series of 450-ms voltage pulses (5 mV steps) were applied at a frequency of 0.2 Hz from a holding potential of -120 mV to take into account the negative shift of the Ile1721 mutants in the inactivation curve. Activation parameters were estimated from the peak I-V curves obtained for each channel combination and are reported as the mean of individual measurements ± S.E. Briefly, the I-V relationships were normalized to the maximum amplitude and were fitted to a Boltzmann equation with E0.5,act being the mid-potential of activation as described elsewhere (25Raybaud A.

The estimation of E0.5,act using non-stationary measurements rests upon the assumption that the transition to the open state is much faster than the transition to the inactivated state. The measure of E0.5,act yields an estimation of the free energy differences between closed (C) and open (O) states as explained previously (16Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Changes in E0.5,act can thus be interpreted as a modification of the ratio between the open and closed states. Time constants of whole cell current traces were estimated with the predefined Equation 1 in Clampfit 8.2 that uses the Chebyshev routine and a 4-point smoothing filter with n = 1 for deactivation time constants and n = 3 for inactivation time constants. Under the latter, the inactivation time course requires two time constants τinact,fast and τinact,slow. f(t)=nΣi=1Aie−t/τi+C (Eq. 1) As the number of exponential functions needed to account for the inactivation process varied between mutants, inactivation kinetics were quantified using r50 values. The r50 ratio is defined as the ratio of peak whole cell currents remaining 50 ms later (I50 ms/IPeak). The voltage dependence of inactivation was obtained after a series of 5-s prepulses (h5000 for h measured at 5000 ms) that varied from -120 to +30 mV at a frequency of 0.02 Hz with E0.5,inact being the mid-potential of inactivation (25Raybaud A.

Most mutations inactivated completely within the 5-s pulse with less than 2% of the peak currents remaining at the end of the inactivating pulse. However, the phrase “isochronal inactivation” is more accurate when estimating the voltage dependence of inactivation of the I701G mutant that displayed 15% residual currents. Statistical analyses were performed using the one-way analysis of variance fitting routine for two independent populations included in Origin 7.0. Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.01. Homology Modeling of S6 Regions in CaV2.3-An analysis based on the SAMT02 algorithm confirmed Kv1.2 as a suitable template to model the S5 and S6 segments in each of the 4 domains of CaV2.3. The identity of Kv1.2 with CaV2.3 at the primary sequence varies from 11% for IIIS6 to up to 25% for IVS6 with values of 17% for IS6 and 22% for IIS6. The primary sequence of each of the four S6 segments of CaV2.3 was aligned with the S6 segment of Kv1.2 by using LALIGN without any gap in the structure. Introducing gaps in the alignment could in certain cases (such as in IIS6) improve local alignments while decreasing the overall homology. For each S6, the score for the alignment of the distal S6 was systematically higher than for the beginning of the S6 segment. A Kv1.2-based model of the selectivity filter and pore helix could not, however, be generated as the linkers were generally longer in CaV than in Kv1.2. Hence, the computer-based molecular model of these regions without the selectivity filter and the pore helix was achieved with Modeler 9v1 (salilab.org/modeler) using the molecular coordinates of Kv1.2 (Protein Data Bank 2A79). 100 models were built and the models with the lowest objective function were further checked for internal consistency using Procheck (biotech.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sendquery). The precision of the models decreased significantly for the residues located at the C-terminal end in the absence of structural constraints. The global score of the final model was 0.10, whereas values higher than -0.50 are generally considered to be acceptable. The model was minimized with the DISCOVER module of INSIGHTII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) with a dielectric constant of 80 to simulate the presence of solvent. The three-dimensional representations were generated with the INSIGHTII software as described elsewhere (34Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen.

The Role of IVS6 in the Gating of CaV2.3-The I1811L mutation is one of the four original mutations of the CaVα1 subunit of the human CaV2.1 that is associated with familial hemiplegic migraine (17Kraus R.L.

Cell. 1996; 87: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). As the Ile residue is conserved in HVA VDCCs, we hypothesized that it might be important for the normal gating properties of HVA channels such as CaV2.3. Most Ile1721 mutants yielded high voltage-activated inward Ba2+ currents (Fig. 2, supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1) with the exception of I1721D, I1721R, and I1721K that failed to express functional channels. The observation that Ile1721 tolerated a wide range of point mutations suggests a minimum of structural constraints in its local environment. Other than I1721L and I1721A, functional Ile1721 mutants produced currents with faster inactivation kinetics than the wild-type channel (supplemental Fig. S1). At +10 mV, r50 decreased from wild-type ≅I1721L ≅ I1721A > I1721H > I1721E > I1721V ≅ I1721T ≅ I1721P > I1721G. This is the first report of mutations speeding up the inactivation kinetics of CaV2.3 because mutations in the I-II linker decreased the inactivation kinetics (33Berrou L. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results with I1721T in CaV2.3 contrast with reports that the equivalent mutation I1475T in IVS6 of the L-type CaV1.2 did not markedly alter the kinetics of whole cell current inactivation (37Shi C. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6813-6821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Charged residues at position 1721 produced non-functional mutants save for I1721E that showed little difference in activation and inactivation potentials despite faster inactivation kinetics. I1721T displayed faster inactivation kinetics without any significant changes in E0.5,act or E0.5,inact. Both the activation and inactivation gating of I1721L and I1721A were significantly shifted by ≅-5 to -10 mV as compared from the wild-type channel (supplemental Table S1) but inactivated with kinetics similar to the wild-type channel. In the case of I1721V, I1721P, and I1721G, the activation potentials were significantly shifted toward positive voltages, whereas inactivation potentials were shifted in the negative direction. These observations coupled with the faster inactivation kinetics of these mutants suggest that the fraction of channels in the open state at any given voltage was decreased in I1721V, I1721P, and I1721G. This conclusion holds true even when taking into account the changes in the slope factor Z. As estimated from the ΔGappaa scale calculated by the group of Stephen White (38Hessa T. Kim H. Bihlmaier K. Lundin C. Boekel J. Andersson H. Nilsson I. White S.H. Nature. 2005; 433: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), hydrophobicity decreases in the following order: Ile ≅ Leu > Val > Ala > Thr > Gly > His > Pro > Glu, whereas volume decreases from Ile ≅ Leu > His > Val ≅ Glu > Thr > Pro > Ala > Gly. As a result, no single parameter such as hydrophobicity, charge, or volume can account for the altered channel gating of Ile1721 mutants. V1720G and I1721G Yield Clues Regarding the Position of the Channel Activation Gate in IVS6-With I1721V and I1721P, I1721G produced the strongest changes in channel gating. To minimize steric and structural constraints, we chose to identify residues that are critical for channel activation gating by performing a glycine scan of the conserved VAVIM locus in the distal portion of IVS6 (Fig. 3A). Glycine mutants decreased the inactivation kinetics of neighboring A1719G and V1720G residues but sped up the kinetics of I1721G and M1722G as compared with the wild-type and V1718G channels. The r50 values thus decreased from A1719G ≅ V1720G > wild-type ≅ V1718G > I1721G ≅ M1722G (Fig. 3B). The fast inactivation kinetics of the latter were accompanied by a faster recovery from inactivation, suggesting that the inactivated state was not more stable in I1721G and M1722G (supplemental Fig. S2A). The activation potentials of the latter were either not significantly different (M1722G) or more positive (I1721G, p < 0.001) than the wild-type channel. Coupled with the fact that these 2 mutants inactivated at potentials ≈-30 mV more negative than the wild-type channel (Fig. 3C), these observations altogether indicate that glycine mutations introduced at positions 1721 and 1722 result in a decreased channel open state. In all these mutants, activation and inactivation potentials were typically shifted toward negative voltages by CaVβ3 (supplemental Fig. S2B). For I1721G, this means that E0.5,act = 6.9 ± 0.4 mV (n = 6) and E0.5,inact = -64 ± 3 mV (n = 3) in the absence of CaVβ3, values that remain significantly different from E0.5,act = -1.4 ± 0.4 mV (n = 29) and E0.5,inact = -33.7 ± 0.8 mV (n = 36) for the wild-type channel under the same conditions. The faster kinetics of I1721G and M1722G contrast with the slower kinetics produced by G352A in IS6 and R378E mutations in the I-II linker (33Berrou L. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Bernatchez G. Berrou L. Benakezouh Z. Ducay J. Parent L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1514: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was then proposed that the slow kinetics of these mutants resulted from either a disruption of the fast inactivated state or from a stabilization of the channel open state. To investigate whether the increased inactivation gating of I1721G and M1722G could antagonize the effects of the slow mutants, the double mutants G352A/M1722G and R378E/I1721G were produced. Unfortunately, neither double mutant expressed functional whole cell currents, leaving this question unanswered. In contrast to I1721G and M1722G, A1719G and V1720G displayed slow inactivating kinetics accompanied with negative shifts of ≈-20 mV in their activation potentials. This change in gating departs from our observations with G352A in IS6 (25Raybaud A. Dodier Y. Bissonnette P. Simoes M. Bichet D.G. Sauve R. Parent L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39424-39436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the charged mutations of Arg378 in the I-II linker (33Berrou L. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys.

Acta. 2001; 1514: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) where the decreased inactivation kinetics occurred without any change in the channel activation potential of CaV2.3. The significant shifts in the E0.5,act toward negative voltages were accompanied by similar increases in the slope factor Z. Hence, introducing glycine residues at positions 1719 and 1720 appears to shift the open/closed equilibrium toward the open state. Mutations of Val1720 to Ala and Ile nearly restored the normal channel gating with smaller shifts in the mid-potentials of activation and inactivation than measured with V1720G (Fig. 4; supplemental Table S1) suggesting that hydrophobic residues at this position could shift the closed/open state equilibrium toward the channel closed state. Glycine Mutations in Positions Equivalent to Val1720 Promote the Channel Open State-As the primary structure of VDCCs identifies 4 distinct S6 domains, domain-specific effects were investigated at positions equivalent to Val1720 (Fig. 5) and Ile1721 (L350 in IS6, Ala702 in IIS6, and Ile1421 in IIIS6) (supplemental Fig. S3). As seen for I1721G (IVS6), I1421G (IIIS6) displayed inactivation kinetics significantly faster than the wild-type channel at all voltages (supplemental Fig. S3). Unlike I1721G, however, the activation potential of I1421G was not significantly altered, which suggests that the mutation did not affect the relative stability of the open and closed states. L350G (IS6) behaves mostly like the wild-type channel, whereas the slower inactivation kinetics of A702G (IIS6) were observed in the absence of significant shifts in its activation and inactivation potentials (supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, glycine mutations at positions Val349 (IS6), Ile701 (IIS6), and Leu1420 (IIIS6) equivalent to Val1720 (IVS6) significantly altered the biophysical properties of the channel. In particular, all mutations slowed down the channel inactivation kinetics (Fig. 5B). At 0 mV, the r50 values decreased from wild-type ≅ V349G (IS6) < L1420G (IIIS6) ≅ V1720G (IVS6) < I701G (IIS6). The decrease in channel kinetics in these mutants was achieved through the progressive elimination of the fast inactivation time constant up to the point where the contribution of the fast time constant becomes negligible in I701G. The mutations also significantly hyperpolarized the activation potentials by -5 to -35 mV and the inactivation potentials by -18 to -24 mV (supplemental Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S4). The most spectacular alterations in channel properties were, however, observed for I701G in IIS6. Indeed, the hyperpolarization of its activation curve was stronger than the negative shift in its mid-potential of inactivation"

From these observations, we propose that this substitution affects the structural integrity of CRB1 in the inter-photoreceptor matrix of the retina, where it is expressed. Furthermore, we identify disease-causing substitutions in other cbEGF-containing proteins that are likely to result in similar disruption of interdomain packing, supporting the hypothesis that the tandem cbEGF domain linkages are critical for the structure and function of proteins containing cbEGF domains.

In the absence of bound Ca2+, this interface does not exist, and the rigidity of the molecule is lost (42Jensen S.A. Corbett A.R. Knott V. Redfield C. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). The interdomain interface involves the conserved aromatic residue located between cysteines 5 and 6 of the N-terminal domain (Phe-1289 in EGF18 of CRB1) and two residues located in the turn in the major β-hairpin between cysteines 3 and 4 of the C-terminal domain (Leu-1316 and Asn-1317 in cbEGF19 of CRB1) (see Fig. 2a). The proper formation of this interdomain interface has been implicated in high affinity calcium binding (42Jensen S.A. Corbett A.R. Knott V. Redfield C. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar, 43Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that alteration or disruption of this interface may have some involvement in disease (38Saha S. Boyd J.

In CRB1, missense mutations that might affect this putative interdomain interface are observed (Fig. 1). Here, we have undertaken an investigation to assess the effect of a disease-causing missense mutation in CRB1 on calcium binding and the interface between tandemly linked domains. The calcium binding properties of the 19th EGF module (cbEGF19) were studied in the minimum structure approximating native conditions (the tandemly linked domain pair EGF18-cbEGF19) both for the wild-type fragment and for a fragment into which the LCA-associated N1317H missense mutation (15Lotery A.J. Jacobson S.G. Fishman G.A. Weleber R.G. Fulton A.B. Namperumalsamy P. Heon E. Levin A.V. Grover S. Rosenow J.R. Kopp K.K. Sheffield V.C. Stone E.M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) has been introduced. The data reveal a site of moderate affinity for Ca2+ in the wild-type fragment and reveal that this affinity is significantly reduced in the mutant construct. The effect of this particular substitution can be further exacerbated by changes in the protonation state of His-1317, providing further evidence of the nature and importance of the native interdomain interface. We consider these results in the context of the calcium environment in the region of the retina to which CRB1 has been localized and propose a model for the molecular basis of the effects of this substitution. Production of Wild-type and N1317H Variant Recombinant Fragments EGF18-cbEGF19—A cDNA fragment (nucleotides 3898-4143, numbering according to GenBank™ accession AY043325 (6den Hollander A.I.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2767-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)), encoding CRB1 domains EGF18 and cbEGF19 (residues 1255-1336), was amplified from a plasmid derived from a human fetal brain cDNA library using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and was cloned into bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Recombinant protein was expressed as a His6 affinity-tagged fusion in Escherichia coli NM554 and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The protein fragment was then reduced with dithiothreitol, purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and refolded in vitro, and the His6 affinity tag was removed by cleavage with Factor Xa as has been described for production of similar cbEGF-containing protein fragments (44Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of the final oxidized product were confirmed by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The missense mutant N1317H was created from the corresponding wild-type plasmid described above. Protein expression, refolding, and purification were carried out as described above for the wild-type protein. Limited Proteolysis of the Wild-type EGF18-cbEGF19 Domain Pair—Proteolysis with elastase (1:5, w/w) was performed as described previously (45Whiteman P. Smallridge R.S. Knott V. Cordle J.J. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17156-17162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0 with 150 mm NaCl. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at time intervals up to 4 h; the reaction was stopped by the addition of reducing protein-loading dye with boiling for 5 min, and samples were kept on ice until SDS-PAGE analysis and staining with Coomassie Blue. The identification of cleavage sites was performed by N-terminal sequencing of aliquots taken after 2.5 h of incubation with elastase and purified under non-reducing conditions by reverse phase HPLC. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR spectroscopy contained 300 μm protein in a 600-μl volume of matrix solution (99.9% D2O containing 5 mm Tris-DCl and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.0 or 7.5). All NMR experiments were performed at 35 °C on a home-built 500-MHz spectrometer in the Department of Biochemistry NMR facility. Calcium titrations were performed by adding small aliquots (1-5 μl) of CaCl2 solutions in D2O. The pKa of His-1317 in the EGF18-cbEGF19 mutant fragment in the absence of Ca2+ was determined by measuring the chemical shifts of the Hδ2 and Hϵ1 peaks arising from His-1317 in the aromatic region of one-dimensional spectra as a function of pH. One-dimensional NMR spectra were collected with a spectral width of 5494.51 Hz, 4096 complex points, and 512 scans. Data were zero-filled to 8192 points, resulting in a digital resolution of 0.67 Hz/point. Two-dimensional DQFCOSY were collected with a spectral width of 5494.51 Hz in F2 and F1, with 1024 complex points in F2, with 512 complex t1 increments, and with 48 scans per increment. Two-dimensional NOESY were collected with 1024 complex points in F2, with 256 complex t1 increments, 96 scans per increment, and a mixing time of 150 ms. All spectra were processed using Felix 2.3 (Accelrys, Inc.). DQFCOSY and NOESY spectra were zero-filled to 2048 points in each dimension, yielding a digital resolution of 2.68 Hz/point. Assignment of peaks in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra was performed by analysis of the DQFCOSY and NOESY spectra in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis (F1289Y) and comparison of wild-type and N1317H-mutant spectra. Determination of Calcium Dissociation Constants—Changes in chemical shifts of intra- and interdomain markers for Ca2+ binding were measured in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra and fitted to the equation Δ/Δo = [Ca2+]free/([Ca2+]free + Kd), where Δ is the observed chemical shift change at each value of [Ca2+]free and Δo is the maximum observed chemical shift change (44Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For the wild-type EGF18-cbEGF19 fragment, changes in the chemical shift of the Hϵ resonance of the aromatic packing residue Phe-1289 from EGF18 were monitored in two-dimensional DQFCOSY spectra. The uncertainty in the calculated Kd value for the single Ca2+-binding site in wild-type cbEGF19, arising from errors in chemical shifts, was determined using standard error propagation formulae and Monte Carlo simulations. For the mutant N1317H fragment, changes in the chemical shifts of the Hϵ1 and Hδ2 peaks arising from the substituted His-1317 residue were monitored by one-dimensional spectra in addition to changes in the Phe-1289 Hϵ peak from two-dimensional DQFCOSY spectra. The Kd value was determined by averaging the values obtained for each of these three markers; the uncertainty in the Kd is defined by the standard deviation from the mean. Expression and Characterization of EGF18-cbEGF19 Wild-type and N1317H Missense Mutant Fragments—The EGF18-cbEGF19 wild-type and mutant constructs of CRB1 were expressed and purified using established methods (44Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The addition of Ca2+ was found to be essential for the in vitro refolding of the fragments to form the disulfide bond-stabilized fold. After removal of the His6 affinity tag by cleavage with Factor Xa, a single peak was observed after HPLC purification. Masses determined experimentally using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (9132.00 ± 0.07 Da for the EGF18-cbEGF19 wild-type and 9154.46 ± 0.08 Da for the N1317H mutant) were in good agreement with the predicted masses for the oxidized form of each protein (9132.12 and 9155.20 Da, respectively). NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of a stably folded single conformation for both wild-type and mutant proteins; peaks in the one-dimensional spectrum were well dispersed and at significantly different positions from those expected for an unstructured protein. In two-dimensional NOESY spectra, downfield shifted Hα-Hα cross-peaks confirmed the presence of antiparallel β-sheet, a structural feature common to all EGF domains (37Suk J.Y. Jensen S.

The effect of Ca2+ binding in the wild-type EGF18-cbEGF19 fragment was assessed by limited proteolysis with elastase; a time course of proteolysis shows cleavage both in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+, but significant protection is observed in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2c). Edman degradation of digested protein reveals four sites of elastase cleavage (Fig. 2a). The majority of these occur in the non-calcium-binding domain EGF18, with a single site observed in cbEGF19. It is interesting to note that differences in the degree of proteolysis between the Ca2+-free (10 mm EGTA) and Ca2+-saturated (10 mm Ca2+) samples were observed for the sites in both EGF18 and cbEGF19 (Fig. 2a). This indicates that Ca2+ binding in cbEGF19 leads to a more stable structure throughout the molecule. NMR Reveals Formation of an Interdomain Interface Associated with Moderate Affinity Calcium Binding in Wild-type EGF18-cbEGF19—NMR spectroscopy has been used very successfully in previous studies of cbEGF domains of fibrillin-1 to probe changes in structure associated with calcium binding at the level of individual residues. It has also been used to determine calcium affinity by following changes in chemical shift of consensus aromatic residues (37Suk J.Y. Jensen S. McGettrick A. Willis A.C. Whiteman P. Redfield C.
