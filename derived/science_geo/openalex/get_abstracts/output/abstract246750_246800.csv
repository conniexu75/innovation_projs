Here, we show that depletion of myocyte NAD levels and the subsequent reduction of Sir2α deacetylase activity are the sequential steps contributing to PARP-mediated myocyte cell death. In both failing hearts and cultured cardiac myocytes, the increased activity of PARP was associated with depletion of cellular NAD levels and reduced Sir2α deacetylase activity. Myocyte cell death induced by PARP activation was prevented by repletion of cellular NAD levels either by adding NAD directly to the culture medium or by overexpressing NAD biosynthetic enzymes. The beneficial effect of NAD repletion was seen, however, only when Sir2α was intact. Knocking down Sir2α levels by small interfering RNA eliminated this benefit, indicating that Sir2α is a downstream target of NAD replenishment leading to cell protection. NAD repletion also prevented loss of the transcriptional regulatory activity of the Sir2α catalytic core domain resulting from PARP activation. We also show that PARP activation and the concomitant reduction of Sir2α activity in failing hearts regulate the post-translational acetylation of p53. These data demonstrate that, in stressed cardiac myocytes, depletion of cellular NAD levels forms a link between PARP activation and reduced Sir2α deacetylase activity, contributing to myocyte cell death during heart failure.

Heart failure is a pathological state in which the heart is unable to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissue. It is usually associated with heart enlargement and chamber dilation, in which contractile functions deteriorate. Although several abnormalities involving calcium homeostasis, contractile protein function, energetics, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and loss of viable myocytes have been identified, the basic molecular and cellular mechanism that mediates the pathogenesis of heart failure remains poorly understood (1Katz A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) 2The abbreviations used are: PARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1AIFapoptosis-inducing factor(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingGal4DBDGal4 DNA-binding domainsiRNAsmall interfering RNABicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycineMNNGN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidineAng-IIangiotensin II. is a multifunctional DNA-bound enzyme located in the nuclei of various cells, including cardiac myocytes (2Burkle A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). PARP is activated in response to DNA single-stand breaks, which could develop as a response to free radical and oxidant cell injury (3Virag L. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). In addition, nuclear accumulation of Ca2+, Mg2+, and polyamines has been shown to trigger PARP activation (4Kun E. Kirsten E. Mendeleyev J. Ordahl C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Once activated, it catalyzes transfer of ADP-ribose moieties from NAD+ to the target proteins, with the concomitant formation of nicotinamide (2Burkle A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Virag L. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, mild activation of PARP regulates many cellular processes, including DNA repair, gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell survival, chromatin remodeling, and genome stability (2Burkle A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Virag L. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). PARP has also been shown to physically bind to cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcription factors, TEF-1 and MyoD, and to regulate their muscle gene activation potential (5Butler A. J Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, overactivation of PARP represses gene transcription and threatens cell survival (2Burkle A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and others (7Xiao C.Y. Chen M. Zsengeller Z. Li H. Kiss L. Kollai M. Szabo C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown recently that robust activation of PARP occurs under conditions of pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. PARP overactivation in the heart induces muscle gene dysregulation and myocyte cell death, without activation of caspases (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism behind PARP-mediated myocyte cell death is not known. Although one possibility is that PARP overactivation depletes cellular NAD content during addition of extended chains of ADP-ribose moieties on cellular proteins, including PARP itself (poly-(ADP-ribosylation)), thereby suppressing the activity of other NAD-dependent cellular processes. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 apoptosis-inducing factor(s) phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting Gal4 DNA-binding domain small interfering RNA N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine angiotensin II. In addition to protein ribosylation, other NAD-dependent cellular processes include energy metabolism, ADP-ribose cyclase synthesis, and class III histone deacetylase activity (8Bai N. Lee H.C. Laher I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 105: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Kobayashi K. Neely J.R. Circ. Res. 1979; 44: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As NAD is essential for the mitochondrial electron transport reaction, depletion of NAD by PARP overactivation has been shown to repress mitochondrial function, leading to energy deficit, release of apoptosis-inducing factors (AIF), and eventually cell death (10Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G, G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 11Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In non-proliferating cells (such as neurons and cardiac myocytes), however, NAD has been shown to be compartmentalized, and the mitochondrial NAD pool is not easily depleted by PARP activation (9Kobayashi K. Neely J.R. Circ. Res. 1979; 44: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Ying W. Alano C.C. Garnier P. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In these cells, PARP overactivation is likely to threaten cell survival by inhibiting the activity of other NAD-dependent pathways. One group of factors that are greatly affected by changes in cellular NAD levels is the class III histone deacetylases, also called sirtuins and SIRT proteins (13Imai S.-i. Armestrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2817) Google Scholar). They are homologous to the yeast SIR2 gene, which has been implicated in chromatin silencing, cell survival, and aging (14North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biology. 2004; http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/5/224PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, seven different SIRT isoforms have been identified. Human SIRT1, an ortholog of mouse Sir2α, is primarily located in the cell nucleus, whereas other SIRT isoforms are located within the cytoplasm and mitochondria (14North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biology. 2004; http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/5/224PubMed Google Scholar). The deacetylase activity of SIRT proteins is dependent upon the availability of cellular NAD content. They catalyze a unique reaction in which NAD is broken into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose. The acetyl group that is removed from the substrate is transferred to an ADP-ribose moiety, giving rise to formation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, a novel metabolite (15Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). SIRT proteins are considered nuclear targets of redox signaling and function as energy sensors (16Fulco M. Schiltz L. Iezzi S. King M.T. Zhao P. Kashiwaya Y. Hoffman E. Veech R.L. Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. deCabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Reduced cellular levels of NAD attenuate the SIRT deacetylase activity, and this increases the activity of many apoptotic effectors, e.g. p53 and Ku70, causing cells to become senescent or apoptotic (18Smith J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 404-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sir2α is also considered a longevity factor inasmuch as the life span of the organism is shortened by a null mutation of the sir2 gene, and it is extended by the presence of an extra copy (19Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 20Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). In mice, deletion of the sir2 gene is lethal, and the rare surviving animals exhibit developmental defects of the retina and heart (21Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S.I. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). A protective role of Sir2α has also been demonstrated in the brain, where overactivation of Sir2α was shown to protect the brain against axonopathy and neurodegeneration (22Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PARP activation in cardiac myocytes during heart failure results in myocyte cell death by decreasing the cellular NAD levels, consequently reducing the activity of Sir2α deacetylase. PARP-mediated myocyte cell death is protected by replenishing cellular NAD levels as well as by activation of Sir2α. These results are the first to demonstrate a link between poly(ADP-ribosylation) and Sir2α-mediated deacetylation pathways and document a novel mechanism of nuclear signaling contributing to myocyte cell death during heart failure. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from 2-day-old neonatal rat hearts as described previously (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Myocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Typically 1 × 105 myocytes were transfected 48 h after plating using the Tfx™-20 reagent (Promega). Enrichment of cardiac myocytes in cultures was analyzed by immunostaining with monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin (1:100 dilution; Sigma catalog no. A-7811) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500 dilution; Sigma catalog no. F-2012). The expression of PARP and Sir2α following transfection was analyzed by immunostaining cells with anti-PARP (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-7150) and anti-Sir2α (1:100 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology catalog no. 07-131) primary antibodies and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-3739). Myocytes were maintained under serum-free conditions, and cell death was induced by treatments with angiotensin (20 μm) and H2O2/FeSO4 (0.1 mm each). Treatment with resveratrol (0.5 μm) was performed under serum-free conditions for 18 h before transfection. H9C2 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected with the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) 24 h after plating. The luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Aortic Banding—Aortic banding was carried out in adult mice to produce pressure overload hypertrophy/heart failure as described (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Adult mice weighing ∼30 g were anesthetized and ventilated. The chest was opened at the second intercostal space. The aorta was isolated from the adjacent tissue and banded between carotid arteries over a 27-gauge needle, which was immediately removed. Animals with sham surgery underwent the identical procedure with the exception of band placement. Animals were killed 6 weeks post-surgery, and their hearts were removed and analyzed for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. In 6-week banded mice, the heart weight/tibia length ratio increased by 70% compared with control mice, and they had clear signs of ventricular dilation, a clinical symptom of heart failure. The expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and β-myosin heavy chain hypertrophy marker genes was elevated in the hearts of banded mice. These hearts were also analyzed by immunohistochemical analysis to determine the extent of fibrosis, and massive fibrosis was detected in the hearts of banded mice compared with the sham-operated control mice. The detailed characterization of the hypertrophy of these mice has been published previously (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts from mouse and human left ventricles were made in 2 volumes of extraction buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue, and protein inhibitors. The samples were then sonicated for 20 s (Microtipsat limit 40% duty cycle sonicator, Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and samples were either stored frozen in a -80 °C freezer or analyzed the same day. Typically, 75 μg of protein sample (unless otherwise specified) was heated at 65 °C for 15 min and resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures described previously (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used for the analysis were as follows: mouse anti-poly(ADP-ribose) monoclonal antibody (Alexis Biochemicals catalog no. ALX-804-220), rabbit anti-Sir2α antibody, anti-Lys373/Lys382 p53 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology catalog no. 06-758), rabbit anti-p53 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-6243), rabbit anti-PARP antibody, and goat anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-20357). Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were used at 1:3000 dilution. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cells (or tissue) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed (homogenized) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors). Protein (500 μg) from each group was incubated overnight with rabbit anti-p53 antibody (1:150 dilution) at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (50 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-2003) were added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with PBS, and analyzed by Western blotting. Measurement of Myocyte Cell Death—Myocytes were washed three times with PBS and then stained with two DNA-binding dyes, Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hoechst 33342 readily penetrates the cell membrane and stains the nuclei of all (both live and dead) cells. Propidium iodide does not penetrate the cell membrane and stains the nuclei of dead cells only. Cells were incubated for 5 min with the dye reagent, washed with PBS, and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. To determine the extent of death in both the adherent and detached populations of cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed. For this analysis, cells were trypsinized, and the enzyme was inactivated by addition of an equal volume of fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and a single cell suspension of myocytes was prepared in PBS and stained with both Hoechst 33345 and propidium iodide for 5 min. Cells that detached spontaneously were also collected and included for the analysis. Cells were washed twice, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by FACS analysis (LSR II, BD Biosciences). Cell debris was gated out using forward scatter versus side scatter, and propidium iodide versus Hoechst 33345 fluorescence was analyzed by gating propidium iodide-negative and propidium iodidepositive cells. Human Failing Heart Samples—Left ventricular samples were obtained from patients with end stage heart failure at the time of heart transplantation. Control samples were obtained from patients with non-failing hearts who underwent valve surgery. The patients studied suffered from ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 7), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 5), or restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 2). Control myocardial specimens were obtained from five patients with non-failing hearts who underwent valve surgery. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. Patients received different combinations of the following pharmacological agents; digoxin, dobutamine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, β-adrenergic blockers, and diuretics. These heart samples were also analyzed previously to detect the activity of PARP (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA—The luciferase reporter plasmid with multiple Gal4 DNA-binding sites in the promoter region and the expression plasmids encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD), Gal4DBD fused to the Sir2α catalytic core domain (Gal4DBD-mCORE), Gal4DBD fused to the catalytic core domain with a mutation that eliminates deacetylase activity (Gal4DBD-mCORE(H355A)), Nampt, and Nmnat have been described (23Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S.-i. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The PARP expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. V. Dawson (Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The wild-type Sir2α and mutant Sir2α(H355A) expression plasmids were provided by Dr. W. Gu (Department of Pathology, College of Physician and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY). His-tagged pcDNA3.1-Nmnat1 and His-tagged pcDNA3.1-Nmnat1(W170A) were provided by Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of Sir2 was carried out by transfection using the pSUPER RNAi System™ (Oligo-Engine catalog no. VEC-PBS-0003/0004) with incorporation of 20 nucleotides of Sir2α (gaagttgacctcctcattgt) (22Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). NAD and ATP Estimation—The NAD levels were measured according to the method described previously by Jacobson and Jacobson (24Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with slight modification. An average of 1 × 105 cells or 50 mg of frozen crushed tissue was suspended in 200 μlof0.5 m perchloric acid. The cell extract was neutralized with an equal volume of 1 m KOH and 0.33 m KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.5) and centrifuged to collect the supernatant and to remove the KClO4 precipitate. The supernatant (50 μl; or NAD standard) was added to 200 μl of NAD reaction mixture (600 mm ethanol, 0.5 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 2 mm phenazine ethosulfate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 120 mm Bicine at pH 7.8) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by addition of 25 μl of alcohol dehydrogenase (0.5 mg/ml in 100 mm Bicine at pH 7.8) and incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, and it was stopped by addition of 250 μl of 12 mm iodoacetate. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at a wavelength of 570 nm. The NAD content was measured from the standard curve and normalized to the protein content of the sample. The cellular ATP levels were measured using a bioluminescence assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells (1 × 105) or frozen crushed tissue (50 mg) was lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis reagent (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase reagent (100 μl) and dilution buffer (50 μl) were added to 50 μl of lysate, and the luminescence was analyzed after a 1-s delay with a 10-s integration on a luminometer. A standard curve was generated from known amounts of ATP and used to calculate the ATP content of the sample. Values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample. PARP Activation Depletes Cellular NAD Levels—Robust PARP activation in both animal and human failing hearts has been implicated as a major cause of caspase-independent myocyte cell death during heart failure (6Pillai J.B. Russell H.M. Raman J. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H486-H496Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of PARP-mediated myocyte cell death, we first measured the NAD content in mouse failing hearts, in which massive poly(ADP-ribosylation) of nuclear proteins was observed. We found that the increased PARP activity was associated with a significant reduction (30%) of the NAD content in each of the seven failing heart samples analyzed (Fig. 1, A and B). To demonstrate a direct link between PARP activation and the change in cellular NAD content, we transfected primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes or H9C2 myocytes with varying amounts of PARP expression plasmid. Cells transfected with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid were used as a reference control. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were harvested and ATP, and the NAD content was measured. As shown in Fig. 1C, the cellular NAD content declined gradually with increasing amounts of PARP, but not with β-galactosidase expression in the cells. However, the cellular ATP content declined at a much slower rate (Fig. 1D). When massive PARP expression was introduced, both NAD and ATP levels declined significantly compared with their respective controls. Data obtained from the time course study with the PARP expression plasmid indicated that the maximum decline in NAD levels (∼50%) occurred within the first 24 h, with the remaining NAD levels maintained even up to 4 days after cell transfection (data not shown). Hoechst 33345 and propidium iodide staining of cells indicated that PARP overexpression resulted in concentration-dependent cell death. More than 50% of the cells died at 48 h following administration of 2.0 μg of PARP expression plasmid, when a nearly 50% reduction of NAD content was observed (Fig. 1E). To test the effect of endogenous PARP activation, we analyzed the effect of an alkylating DNA-damaging agent, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which is known to stimulate PARP activity (12Ying W. Alano C.C. Garnier P. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, cells treated with 10 μm MNNG showed a nearly 15% decline in cellular NAD levels; however, no significant cell death could be detected at this dose of MNNG even after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 2B). When cells were treated with a higher dose of MNNG (100 μm), cellular NAD levels reduced gradually in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Almost 50% of the NAD level dropped by 4-8 h of MNNG treatment, and thereafter, most of the remaining NAD level was maintained. In these plates, cell death reached a plateau following 16 h of MNNG treatment, when nearly 60% of the cells were found dead (Fig. 2B). To examine whether PARP was indeed involved in MNNG-mediated cell death, one batch of cells was pretreated with a PARP inhibitor (3-aminobenzamide). The results indicated that 3-aminobenzamide treatment markedly reduced the MNNG-induced cell death, thus confirming a role of PARP in this type of cell death. These results together demonstrate that PARP activation in cardiac myocytes leads to fast depletion of cellular NAD levels, and this might contribute to PARP-mediated myocyte cell dysfunction and death. NAD Repletion Protects Myocytes against PARP-mediated Cell Death—Knowing that PARP-mediated myocyte cell death is associated with reduced NAD content, we next investigated whether repletion of NAD could offer cell protection. Previous reports have indicated that, similar to neuronal cells, cardiac myocytes express membrane channels that can bind and transport extracellular NAD (25Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. Flora A.D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This encouraged us to examine whether exogenously added NAD could prevent cardiac myocyte cell death. To test this possibility, we added different concentrations of NAD (0.1-0.5 mm) to the culture medium immediately following treatment of cells with MNNG or transfection of cells with the PARP expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3A, inclusion of 100 μm NAD in the culture medium significantly reduced (50%) MNNG-mediated myocyte cell death. Likewise, cell death induced by PARP overexpression was found to be significantly less (∼50%) in culture plates with varying amounts of NAD (0.1-0.5 mm) compared with control cells receiving vehicle (Fig. 3B). Maximum protection against PARP-mediated cell death was observed at 0.5 mm NAD. Increasing the amounts of NAD added to the culture medium provided no additional benefit to the cells. To substantiate these findings and to investigate whether additional cell protection could be achieved by increasing the endogenous synthesis of NAD, we analyzed the effect of two enzymes (Nampt and Nmnat) of NAD biosynthetic pathways. In the mammalian cell system, nicotinamide is the precursor of NAD biosynthesis. The enzyme Nampt (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) catalyzes the reaction of nicotinamide conversion into NMN, which is then converted to NAD with the help of another enzyme, Nmnat (nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase) (23Revollo J.R.

To examine the effect of these enzymes on myocyte cell death, cells were cotransfected with the PARP expression plasmid together with a plasmid encoding Nampt, Nmnat, or mutant Nmnat (which encodes a catalytically inert enzyme). On the second day following transfection, the extent of cell death was determined by Hoechst 33345/propidium iodide staining of cells, followed by FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, myocyte cell death induced by PARP overexpression was completely eliminated by overexpressing either enzyme (Nampt or Nmnat) of the NAD biosynthetic pathway, but not by the mutant plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W1989076425,"ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Mutations in human ABCA1 cause severe HDL deficiencies characterized by the virtual absence of apoA-I and HDL and prevalent atherosclerosis. Recently, it has been reported that the lack of ABCA1 causes a significant reduction of apoE protein level in the brain of ABCA1 knock-out (ABCA1-/-) mice. ApoE isoforms strongly affect Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and risk. To determine further the effect of ABCA1 on amyloid deposition, we used APP23 transgenic mice in which the human familial Swedish AD mutant is expressed only in neurons. We demonstrated that the targeted disruption of ABCA1 increases amyloid deposition in APP23 mice, and the effect is manifested by an increased level of Aβ immunoreactivity, as well as thioflavine S-positive plaques in brain parenchyma. We found that the lack of ABCA1 also considerably increased the level of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and exacerbated cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related microhemorrhage in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice. Remarkably, the elevation in parenchymal and vascular amyloid in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the level of soluble brain apoE, although insoluble apoE was not changed. The elevation of insoluble Aβ fraction in old APP23/ABCA1-/- mice, accompanied by a lack of changes in APP processing and soluble β-amyloid in young APP23/ABCA1-/- animals, supports the conclusion that the ABCA1 deficiency increases amyloid deposition. These results suggest that ABCA1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of parenchymal and cerebrovascular amyloid pathology and thus may be considered a therapeutic target in AD.

Experiments with any of those genetic variants or complex AD model systems (APP transgenic/ABCA1 knock-out animals for example) have not been reported, and so there is no definitive conclusion about the role of ABCA1 in AD. To determine further the effect of ABCA1 on amyloid deposition, we used APP23 transgenic mice in which APPsw is expressed only in the brain. These mice develop compact amyloid plaques in brain parenchyma and CAA, reminiscent of the pathological features of AD (22Van Dam D. Vloeberghs E. Abramowski D. Staufenbiel M. De Deyn P.P. CNS.

In this study APP23 mice were bred to ABCA1 knock-out mice, and Aβ-related pathology was evaluated in APP23 mice with intact (APP23/ABCA1+/+) or disrupted (APP23/ABCA1-/-) ABCA1 gene. Our results demonstrate that in APP23 mice the lack of ABCA1 increases Aβ deposition. Transgenic Mice—This study fully conformed to the guidelines outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the United States Department of Health and Human Services and was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We used APP23 transgenic mice expressing human familial AD mutant APP751 with Swedish double mutation at positions 670/671 (APPK670N, M671L) (23Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Duke M.

A. 1997; 94: 13287-13292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The expression of human APPsw is driven by the murine Thy-1 promoter and is restricted to neurons. APP23 (C57BL/6 background) were cross-bred to ABCA1+/- heterozygous mice (DBA/1-Abca1tm1Jdm/J; The Jackson Laboratory) to generate APP23/ABCA1+/- progeny (C57BL/6 × DBA/1). The progeny was identified by PCR, and APP23/ABCA1+/- mice were bred to ABCA1+/- littermates (F1, no APP transgene, mixed C57BL/6 × DBA/1 background) to yield APP23/ABCA1-/-, APP23/ABCA1+/-, and APP23/ABCA1+/+ bigenic littermate mice. All mice used in this study are hemizygous APP23. At weaning, a distortion in the Mendelian inheritance of the APP23/ABCA1-/- genotype was observed that was three times less than expected, suggesting a perinatal lethality of APP23/ABCA1-/- pups. APP23/ABCA1-/- mice appeared normal and weighed slightly less (statistically insignificant) compared with APP23/ABCA1+/+ littermates. APP23/ABCA1-/- developed similarly to APP23/ABCA1+/+, and no gross anatomical abnormalities were observed until 13 months of age. Animal Tissue Processing—Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and perfused transcardially with 100 ml of PBS (0.1 m, pH 7.4). Brains were rapidly removed; the olfactory bulb and cerebellum were deleted and divided in hemibrains. One hemibrain was snap-frozen on dry ice and the other was drop-fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 48 h. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). The 6E10 monoclonal antibody (Signet, Dedham, MA) recognizes the first 17 amino acids of the Aβ peptide. 6E10 antibody was used for Western blotting (WB) to detect full-length human APP and sAPPα. Rabbit C8 polyclonal antibody (25Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Staufenbiel M. Wolfe D. Huang S. Glorioso J.C. Walter M. Roth M.G. Lazo J.S. J. Biol.

This antibody does not recognize full-length APP but recognizes the neoepitope generated after cleavage by β-secretase. Murine-specific apoE antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). TAU-5 antibody (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) is a phospho-independent antibody that recognizes total tau protein. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—HistoPrep (Fisher)-embedded hemibrains were cut in the coronal plane at 30 μm on a cryostat. Sections were selected 300 μm apart, starting from a randomly chosen section about 300 μm caudal from the first appearance of CA3 and the dentate gyrus. The immunostaining procedure was performed on floating sections as described by Matsuoka et al. (26Matsuoka Y. Picciano M. Malester B. LaFrancois J. Zehr C. Daeschner J.M. Olschowka J.A. Fonseca M.I.

Briefly, after washing in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST), nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the sections in PBST, 3% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h before the incubation in biotinylated 6E10 at 4 °C overnight. Sections were then washed in PBST and incubated in ABC Elite reagent (Vector Laboratories), and immunoreactivity was visualized by using diaminobenzidene/nickel (DAB/Ni). The specificity of immunoreactivity was confirmed by the lack of signal when applying the same protocol on brain sections from nontransgenic wild type littermates. For thioflavine S (Thio-S) staining, floating sections were washed in PBST, mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher), coated with Vectabond (Vector Laboratories), and processed essentially as described previously (27Bussiere T. Bard F. Barbour R. Grajeda H. Guido T. Khan K. Schenk D. Games D. Seubert P. Buttini M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 987-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Sections mounted on the slides were post-fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, washed in PBS, incubated in 0.25% potassium permanganate for 10 min, treated with 2% potassium metabisulfite, 1% oxalic acid until they appeared white, and finally stained for 10 min in 0.015% Thio-S in 50% ethanol. After washing in 50% ethanol and water, the slides were dried and dipped into Histo-Clear before being coverslipped with Permount. All chemicals were from Sigma at the highest recommended grade of purity. Parenchymal and cerebrovascular amyloidoses were evaluated on the same sections but were recorded and presented separately. Microscopic examinations were carried out using Leica DM fluorescent microscope and images captured by CCD camera (DG 300F, Leica). For quantitative analysis, Aβ and amyloid deposition in the neocortex and hippocampus was defined as the percent area covered by Aβ immunoreactivity (% Aβ load) and Thio-S positivity (% Thio-S load), respectively. For each mouse, Aβ immunoreactivity or Thio-S-positive plaques were counted in 6–7 sections per hemibrain 300 μm apart at a magnification of 50. The percentage of area covered by Aβ-IR or Thio-S positivity was determined by examining the entire area of the section using IPLab 3.1 software. Cerebrovascular amyloidosis was evaluated on Thio-S-stained slides in pia, cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, using the same approach and presented as % vascular amyloid. A qualitative rating scale of CAA severity, similar to that reported previously for APP23 mice was used (28Calhoun M.E. Burgermeister P. Phinney A.L. Stalder M. Tolnay M. Wiederhold K.H. Abramowski D. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Jucker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14088-14093Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) as follows: severity grade 1, with amyloid confined to the vessel wall; severity grade 2, vascular amyloid with amyloid infiltrating the surrounding neuropil; and severity grade 3, dyshoric amyloid with amyloid deposition within the vessel wall and with a thick and complete amyloid coat around the vessel wall. A set of seven coronal sections/mouse equally spaced throughout the brain was evaluated, and Thio-S-positive vessel surface area was measured in each of four regions (pia, cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus). It should, however, be stated that because coronal sections were used in all cases, this value may be influenced by vessel orientation (e.g. if vessels that run perpendicular to the plane of section were more likely to contain fibrillar amyloid, the reported percentage would be an underestimate of the total affected surface area). Quantitation of Cerebral Hemorrhage—30-μm sections were mounted on microscopic slides, fixed for 10 min in 10% freshly prepared formalin, and processed according to Carson (29Carson F.L. Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text. 2nd Ed. ASCP, Chicago1996Google Scholar). The slides were well rinsed in distilled water, incubated in Perl's solution, equal parts of 2% potassium ferrocyanide and 2% hydrochloric acid, and rinsed again. The sections were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Laboratories) for 5 min, rinsed under running tap water for 5 min, and coverslipped. All sections were scanned using 5× objective and focal hemorrhages analyzed and counted at ×250. The numbers of Perl's Berlin blue-stained clusters of hemosiderin staining (or Prussian blue-positive sites) were counted on all sections, and the average number of sites per section was quantified. A set of six equally spaced sections throughout the neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus were examined, and the number of positive profiles was determined and averaged to a per section value. Tissue Homogenizing and Western Blotting—The frozen hemibrains (only cortices and hippocampi) were homogenized in tissue homogenization buffer (THB) (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 ml per 150 mg of tissue) and protease inhibitors essentially as described before (25Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Staufenbiel M. Wolfe D. Huang S. Glorioso J.C. Walter M. Roth M.G. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4079-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared by 1:1 dilution of the initial homogenate with 2× RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.25% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and sonication. WB for ABCA1, APPfl, and CTFα/β were made as described previously (25Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Staufenbiel M. Wolfe D. Huang S. Glorioso J.C. Walter M. Roth M.G. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4079-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). sAPPα and sAPPβ were determined by WB in soluble extracts prepared from brain homogenate using cold 0.4% diethylamine in 100 mm NaCl, centrifuged at 135,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and neutralized by adding 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Aβ ELISA—Soluble Aβ was extracted with 2× RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 135,000 × g. Insoluble Aβ was extracted from the resulting pellet using 70% ice-cold formic acid. The soluble and insoluble Aβ extracts were additionally diluted in EC buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.4% Block Ace, 0.05% NaN3, pH 7.0), and Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 concentrations were measured by sandwich ELISA as described previously (25Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Staufenbiel M. Wolfe D. Huang S. Glorioso J.C. Walter M. Roth M.G. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4079-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, ELISA for Aβ was performed using 6E10 as the capture antibody, and anti-Aβ40 (G2-10 monoclonal antibody) and anti-Aβ42 (G2-13 monoclonal antibody) monoclonal antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Genetics Co., Schlieren, Switzerland) were used as the detection antibodies. The reaction was developed by TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate system (Kierkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The final values of Aβ were based on Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptide standards (Bachem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA). The amount of Aβ was normalized either to the total protein or to the expression of APPfl as measured by WB and was expressed as picomoles/mg. WB for insoluble Aβ was performed using 10 μl of formic acid-extracted Aβ. The solvent (formic acid) was evaporated, and the pellet was resuspended in 2× NuPAGE loading buffer. The proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gels and transferred on the nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were boiled for 5 min in PBS, and Aβtotal was detected with 1:1000 dilution of 6E10 antibody. WB for Soluble and Insoluble ApoE—The soluble apoE was extracted from brain homogenates using 2× RIPA buffer and sonication and was centrifuged at 135,000 × g. The insoluble pellet was dissolved in 70% formic acid, sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged at 135,000 × g. WB for soluble and insoluble apoE were made using 30 μg of total protein. For insoluble apoE, formic acid was evaporated (as for Aβ WB), and the pellet was resuspended in 2× NuPAGE loading buffer. For soluble and insoluble apoE, the proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gels and transferred on the nitrocellulose membranes. Insoluble apoE was detected with a 1:100 dilution of anti-mouse apoE antibody, and soluble apoE was detected with 1:500 dilution of the same antibody. To avoid stripping and re-probing of the membranes for a loading control, we used anti-tau antibody Tau5, which is phospho-independent and recognizes total tau (55–65 kDa). Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test or Mann-Whitney test. We used Spearman correlations to determine the unadjusted relationships between continuous variables (GraphPad Prism software, Windows version 3.0, San Diego). ABCA1 Deficiency Does Not Affect the Expression of Human APP but Substantially Decreases Brain ApoE Level in APP23 Mice—To determine the effect of genetically engineered disruption of ABCA1 on Aβ deposition in APP23 transgenic mice, we generated APP23/ABCA1-/- animals. In this study we examined the following 13-month-old bigenic animals: APP23/ABCA1-/- (9 mice, 5 females and 4 males), APP23/ABCA1+/- (16 mice, 13 females and 3 males), and their wild type APP23/ABCA1+/+ littermates (14 mice, 7 females and 7 males). We first evaluated the expression of ABCA1 and full-length human amyloid precursor protein (hAPPfl) by Western blotting in aliquots of SDS extracts of cortices and hippocampi. As expected, the results proved that ABCA1 protein expression in APP23/ABCA1-/+ mice is reduced by 50% as compared with APP23/ABCA1+/+ and is absent in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice (Fig. 1A, upper panel). ABCA1 deletion did not influence human APPsw transgene expression (751 amino acids, “Swedish” isoform) (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Because ABCA1 deficiency as reported considerably decreases the amount of endogenous apoE protein in the brains of ABCA1-/- mice (7Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A.

In confirmation of the previous studies, we found that the level of soluble apoE in 13-month-old APP23/ABCA1-/- mice was reduced more than 70% when compared with APP23/ABCA1+/+ (Fig. 1B). The same decrease was observed in 3-month-old APP23/ABCA1-/- mice (data not shown). Lack of ABCA1 Increases the Level of Insoluble Aβ in 13-Month-old APP23 Mice—Next we examined whether the deficiency of ABCA1 could alter brain Aβ levels in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice. We measured levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in both RIPA-soluble and -insoluble brain homogenates of APP23/ABCA1-/- mice, and we compared the values to those in APP23/ABCA1+/+ and APP23/ABCA1-/+ mice. We found that in APP23/ABCA1-/- versus APP23/ABCA1+/+ mice, the lack of ABCA1 resulted in an increase of soluble (RIPA-extractable) Aβ40 and Aβ42, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2A). We also examined the level of insoluble (formic acid extractable) Aβ by WB using 6E10 antibody, which recognizes both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (referred as Aβtotal in Fig. 2B). The level of Aβtotal showed very high variability among all mice, with male mice (except one animal) having less Aβtotal than the female mice. Fig. 2B shows that insoluble Aβtotal in APP23/ABCA1-/- was increased more than 2-fold (p < 0.015 versus APP23/ABCA1+/+). The level of insoluble Aβ total in APP23/ABCA1-/+ mice was intermediate to that in APP23/ABCA1-/- and APP23/ABCA1+/+. To assess specifically the proportion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the increased insoluble Aβ, we evaluated their levels by ELISA. The results demonstrated a less than 2-fold increase of insoluble Aβ42 in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice (p < 0.035 versus APP23/ABCA1+/+) and a more than 2-fold increase of insoluble Aβ40 (p < 0.025 versus APP23/ABCA1+/+, Fig. 2C). We concluded that the disruption of ABCA1 in APP23 mice significantly increases the level of insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42. To determine which of the two Aβ forms (soluble or insoluble) is predominantly increased in APP23/ABCA1-/-, we measured the percentage of soluble Aβ in the total Aβ (soluble plus insoluble). Fig. 2D demonstrates that when compared with APP23/ABCA1+/+ mice, the proportion of soluble Aβ40 in APP23/ABCA1-/- mice was considerably decreased, suggesting that more Aβ converts from the soluble to the insoluble state in the absence of ABCA1.

Different apoE isoforms may alter AD pathogenesis via their interactions with the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Mice lacking the lipid transporter ABCA1 were found to have markedly decreased levels and lipidation of apoE in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that if Abca1-/- mice were bred to the PDAPP mouse model of AD, PDAPP Abca1-/ mice would have a phenotype similar to that of PDAPP Apoe+/- and PDAPP Apoe-/- mice, which develop less amyloid deposition than PDAPP Apoe+/+ mice. In contrast to this prediction, 12-month-old PDAPP Abca -/- mice had significantly higher levels of hippocampal Aβ, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was significantly more common compared with PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments were not different between Abca1 genotypes prior to plaque deposition in 3-month-old PDAPP mice, suggesting that deletion of Abca1 did not affect APP processing or Aβ production. As expected, 3-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had decreased apoE levels, but they also had a higher percentage of carbonate-insoluble apoE, suggesting that poorly lipidated apoE is less soluble in vivo. We also found that 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had a higher percentage of carbonate-insoluble apoE and that apoE deposits co-localize with amyloid plaques, demonstrating that poorly lipidated apoE co-deposits with insoluble Aβ. Together, these data suggest that despite substantially lower apoE levels, poorly lipidated apoE produced in the absence of ABCA1 is strongly amyloidogenic in vivo.

Evidence suggests that the mechanism by which different apoE alleles affect the pathogenesis of AD and CAA is by modifying interactions between apoE and the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), which aggregates and deposits into the amyloid plaques that are thought to initiate AD and CAA pathogenesis (5Holtzman D.M.

ApoE may act as a chaperone for Aβ by binding the peptide and altering its conformation, thereby influencing its clearance and ability to aggregate (7Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci.

Studies have also shown a profound effect of apoE on Aβ deposition and conformation in vivo. The PDAPP and Tg2576 transgenic mouse models of AD, which overexpress the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing AD-causing mutations, develop several aspects of AD-like pathology beginning at 6–9 months of age, including diffuse and fibrillar Aβ deposits, neuritic plaques, gliosis, and CAA (12Games D.

These findings demonstrate that murine apoE strongly promotes Aβ-related pathology in vivo. The influence of apoE type and the levels on Aβ behavior in many different systems supports the hypothesis that apoE affects the risk for AD via chaperone-like interactions with Aβ. ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette A1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters, transfers cellular cholesterol and phospholipids onto lipid-poor apolipoproteins to form pre-HDL (18Schmitz G.

ABCA1-mediated transport of cellular cholesterol onto apolipoproteins is the rate-limiting step in the anti-atherosclerotic reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which allows the removal of excess cholesterol from tissues by HDL followed by delivery of cholesterol to the liver for excretion into bile acids (20Van Eck M.

In vitro studies revealed that the primary cultures of astrocytes, the major producers of apoE in the central nervous system, secrete apoE in small, very poorly lipidated lipoprotein particles if they are derived from Abca1-/- mice (28Wahrle S.E.

Particles derived from Abca1-/- mice contained only 0.69 μg of total cholesterol/μg of apoE, whereas particles from Abca1+/+ mice contained 2.3 μg of total cholesterol/μg of apoE. The decreased central nervous system apoE levels seen in the Abca1-/- mice likely result from rapid catabolism of the poorly lipidated apoE-containing HDL particles. The dramatic alterations in central nervous system of apoE produced by Abca1 deletion provide an opportunity to determine how changes in apoE levels and lipidation influence Aβ metabolism in vivo. In the present study, we bred Abca1-/- mice to a well characterized APP transgenic mouse model of AD (PDAPP) that develops age- and region-dependent AD-like pathology (15Bales K.R. Verina T. Dodel R.C. Du Y. Altstiel L. Bender M. Hyslop P. Johnstone E.M. Little S.P. Cummins D.J. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Paul S.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Because Abca1-/- mice have a greatly decreased apoE, we hypothesized that PDAPP Abca1-/- mice would develop similar levels of pathology as aged PDAPP mice with either no apoE or 50% less apoE (PDAPP Apoe-/- or Apoe+/- mice), both of which have significantly lower levels of nonfibrillar and fibrillar Aβ deposits as well as less CAA. Most interestingly and contrary to our hypothesis, 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had increased parenchymal Aβ levels, amyloid deposition, and CAA. These results suggest that the poorly lipidated apoE formed in the absence of ABCA1 facilitates amyloidogenesis, even when present at low levels. Animals and Tissue Collection—Mice heterozygous for an Abca1 deletion gene on a DBA background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME (strain name, DBA/1-Abca1tm1Jdm). Transgenic mice overexpressing human APP containing the V717F familial Alzheimer disease mutation on a C57Bl/6 background, referred to as PDAPP mice (12Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R.

The Abca1+/- and PDAPP mice were bred to one another for three generations to produce mice of all Abca1 genotypes that were hemizygous for the PDAPP transgene. All mice were genotyped by PCR. Animals used for experiments were either 3 or 12 months old and were of the same generation. At the appropriate ages, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and CSF was collected from the cisterna magna as described (30DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Parsadanian M. O'Dell M.A. Foss E.M.

The hippocampi and cortices were dissected from the brains and frozen on dry ice. Aβ and ApoE ELISAs—Hippocampi were subjected to a serial extraction method using carbonate and guanidine buffers as described previously (31DeMattos R.B. Cirrito J.R. Parsadanian M. May P.C.

Levels of Aβ and apoE in all hippocampal samples were normalized to total protein, which was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Histology—Frozen hemibrains from the 12-month-old mice were cut in 50-μm coronal sections from the genu of the corpus collosum to the caudal end of the hippocampus by using a sliding microtome. Sections were incubated with 3D6, an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, to detect Aβ deposits, and immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (33Holtzman D.M. Bales K.R. Tenkova T.

To examine whether apoE and amyloid were co-localized, slides were incubated with an anti-apoE antibody (Calbiochem) and then stained with thioflavine S. The area of the cingulate cortex and hippocampus covered by Aβ immunoreactivity and thioflavine S staining in sections 19, 25, and 31 (from rostral to caudal) were quantified by using stereological techniques (area fraction fractionator) as described previously (33Holtzman D.M.

Western Blots—Cortices were sonicated in 10 μl/mg RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors, and the homogenate was spun at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was collected, and total protein levels were measured by BCA assay (Pierce). 15 μg of total protein was loaded per lane. Samples were run on 4–12% BisTris gels with MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked in 4% milk in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with an antibody to the C-terminal 22 amino acids of APP (Invitrogen). For a loading control, the blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Densitometric analyses used the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software. Statistical Analysis—All analyses were performed using PRISM version 3.00 (Graphpad, San Diego). Error bars in figures represent the means ± S.E. For all tests of significance between genotypes, an analysis of variance was performed followed by Tukey's post hoc repeated measures testing between all groups. The p values listed are the Tukey's post hoc result. Values not listed are not significant. For testing the significance of CAA frequency in the three genotypes, a 2 degrees of freedom χ2 test was performed. Aβ Levels in CSF and Hippocampus—Levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the CSF and hippocampi of 3- and 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1+/+, Abca1+/-, and Abca1-/- mice were measured using a highly sensitive ELISA. Levels of Aβ in the CSF of the mice did not vary significantly by Abca1 genotype in either 3- or 12-month-old PDAPP mice (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that multiple pools of Aβ exist in the brain that can be differentiated via serial extraction of the tissue in various buffers. We chose to perform carbonate extraction of the brain tissue followed by re-extraction with 5 m guanidine because similar methods have been used in publications relevant to the current study (31DeMattos R.B.

The carbonate-soluble Aβ probably represents Aβ that is normally soluble in vivo or is loosely associated with membranes. Aβ that requires 5 m guanidine for extraction is likely more strongly bound to membranes or, in the case of the 12-month-old PDAPP mice, deposited into relatively insoluble amyloid plaques. At 3 months of age, PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had significantly higher levels of carbonate-soluble Aβ40 than PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice (Fig. 1A), but levels of carbonate-soluble Aβ42 and carbonate-insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 did not vary by Abca1 genotype (Fig. 1, A and B). To investigate whether this increase of carbonate-soluble Aβ40 in PDAPP Abca1-/- mice was a result of increased Aβ generation, we examined levels of APP and C-terminal fragments of APP (APP-CTFs) that are produced during the process of Aβ generation. We found that levels of APP and APP-CTFs, including CTF-γ, were not significantly different in 3-month-old PDAPP Abca1+/+ and PDAPP Abca1-/- mice (Fig. 1E and data not shown). This suggests that the Aβ generation is not affected by the Abca1 genotype. Instead, the increase of carbonate-soluble Aβ40 in 3-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice may be because of decreased clearance of Aβ40 by poorly lipidated apoE. In fact, recent in vivo data suggest that apoE plays a role in Aβ40 transport and clearance (31DeMattos R.B. Cirrito J.R. Parsadanian M. May P.C. O'Dell M.A. Taylor J.W. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J.

Sullivan P.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2803-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). At 12 months of age, Aβ deposition had begun to occur in PDAPP mice of all genotypes. The amount of carbonate-soluble Aβ increased ∼10-fold in 12-month-old mice as compared with 3-month-old mice but did not vary by Abca1 genotype (Fig. 1C). Moreover, there was a >100-fold increase in carbonate-insoluble Aβ42 levels that was because of the deposition of large amounts of Aβ42 in amyloid plaques, which require extraction in 5 m guanidine (Fig. 1D). Most interestingly, at this time point PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had >3-fold higher levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 than PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice (Fig. 1D, note changes in units and scales). Additionally, the average percentage of total Aβ that was carbonate-insoluble was significantly higher in PDAPP Abca1-/- mice (92% in Abca1+/+ mice and 98% in Abca1-/- mice, p < 0.001). This suggests that more of the Aβ deposits in Abca1-/- mice were contained within insoluble plaques, potentially as a result of increased Aβ fibrillogenesis caused by poorly lipidated apoE. Histological Analysis of Brains—Brain sections from the 12-month-old mice were immunostained for total Aβ and stained with thioflavine S for detection of fibrillar Aβ in amyloid plaques. PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had a higher average percentage of their cortex and hippocampus covered by Aβ immunoreactive and thioflavine S-positive deposits (Fig. 2A). However, stereological quantification of the Aβ and thioflavine S-positive plaque load did not show a significant difference between genotypes (Fig. 3). Brains were also examined for the presence of CAA with thioflavine S staining (Fig. 2B). Of 12 PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice, none had observable CAA, whereas 1 of 9 PDAPP Abca1-/- and 4 of 11 PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had observable CAA (p = 0.05).FIGURE 3Stereological analysis of Aβ immunoreactivity and thioflavine S-positive amyloid in 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1 mice.

N.S., not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ApoE Levels in Brain—Levels of apoE in the hippocampi of the mice were measured by ELISA. As expected, the 3-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice had markedly decreased apoE levels, which were ∼25% the level found in PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice (Fig. 4A). Most interestingly, even prior to plaque formation and despite the fact that Abca1-/- mice have much lower levels of total tissue apoE, Abca1-/- mice had a higher percentage of apoE in the carbonate-insoluble fraction from the hippocampus (Fig. 4B). This suggests that poorly lipidated apoE is less soluble in vivo. After plaque deposition began, tissue-associated apoE increased in PDAPP mice of all Abca1 genotypes and became less soluble. In 12-month-old PDAPP mice, ∼40% of the apoE was not soluble in carbonate buffer and required 5 m guanidine for extraction (Fig. 4B), which is characteristic of proteins in amyloid plaques. More importantly, 12-month-old PDAPP mice of all Abca1 genotypes had approximately equal levels of total apoE, which indicates that PDAPP Abca1-/- mice accumulate large amounts of apoE between 3 and 12 months of age. Additionally, the apoE accumulated by the 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice contained a higher percentage of carbonate-insoluble apoE than found in the PDAPP Abca1+/+ and PDAPP Abca1+/- mice. In vivo, apoE normally co-deposits with Aβ into plaques. To confirm that apoE from both PDAPP Abca1+/+ and PDAPP Abca1-/- mice was present in plaques, sections of brain were double-stained with anti-apoE and thioflavine S. The apoE deposits co-localized with the thioflavine S staining in both the PDAPP Abca1+/+ and PDAPP Abca1-/- mice, showing that apoE was associated with amyloid plaques (Fig. 4C). These findings show that despite the fact that PDAPP Abca1-/- mice initially have much lower levels of apoE, the apoE that is present efficiently binds to and becomes associated with the deposited Aβ. Together, our findings suggest that the poorly lipidated apoE in PDAPP Abca1-/- mice promotes Aβ fibrillogenesis to a greater extent than normally lipidated apoE-containing HDL in the brain. Despite initially having much lower levels of apoE in the brain, PDAPP Abca1-/- mice developed increased Aβ levels and CAA in the brain. Further supporting our findings, two other groups have observed a similar phenotype using completely independent lines of APP transgenic mice with different APP mutations and different promoters (48Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Maia L.F. Burgess B.L. Blain J.-F. Naus K.E. McIsaac S.A. Parkinson P.F. Chan J.Y. Tansley G.H. Hayden M.R. Poirier J. Van Nostrand W. Wellington C.L. J. Biol.

Although the increases in Aβ levels and CAA were significant but not dramatic in PDAPP Abca1-/- versus PDAPP Abca1+/+ mice at 12 months of age, these results were counter to what we expected because previous studies showed an ∼50% decrease in apoE levels in Apoe+/- mice resulted in a >50% decrease in Aβ levels and amyloid deposition in both PDAPP Apoe+/- and Tg2576 Apoe+/- mice (14Bales K.R. Verina T. Cummins D.J. Du Y. Dodel R.C. Saura J. Fishman C.E. DeLong C.A. Piccardo P. Petegnief V. Ghetti B. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The demonstration that PDAPP Abca1-/- mice, which have ∼25% of normal apoE levels at 3 months of age, develop increased Aβ deposition by 12 months of age suggests that poorly lipidated apoE formed in the absence of ABCA1 strongly promotes Aβ fibrillogenesis in an age-dependent manner relative to normally lipidated murine apoE. We considered three possible mechanisms by which Abca1 deletion could affect Aβ levels. First, we hypothesized that because ABCA1 exports cholesterol and phospholipids from cells and alterations of cellular lipids have been shown to modulate APP processing (36Wolozin B. Neuron. 2004; 41: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), it was possible that Abca1 deletion could have modified brain Aβ levels via the effects on production of Aβ from APP. However, we found that Abca1 deletion had no effect on levels of APP or APP-CTFs prior to Aβ deposition, which suggests that ABCA1 is not influencing Aβ production. Additionally, in our previous work we found no differences in brain total cholesterol or brain neutral lipid distribution between Abca1+/+ and-/- mice (28Wahrle S.E. Jiang H. Parsadanian M. Legleiter J. Han X. Fryer J.D. Kowalewski T. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40987-40993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that lipid levels could be altered in certain subpopulations of cells (astrocytes or microglia) within the brain that could influence Aβ metabolism. This needs to be assessed in future experiments. A second possible mechanism by which Abca1 deletion could increase Aβ deposition is that the lipid-poor apoE in Abca1 Abca1-/- mice may impair receptor-mediated clearance of Aβ. This hypothesis is based on data showing that lipid-poor apoE is a poor ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein, the major apoE receptors in brain (37Ruiz J. Kouiavskaia D. Migliorini M. Robinson S. Saenko E.L. Gorlatova N. Li D. Lawrence D. Hyman B.T. Weisgraber K.H. Strickland D.K. J.

Previous data from our laboratory have shown increased soluble Aβ in the brains of 3-month-old PDAPP mice lacking apoE, which is possibly due to a lack of receptor-mediated clearance of apoE-Aβ complexes (31DeMattos R.B. Cirrito J.R. Parsadanian M. May P.C. O'Dell M.A. Taylor J.W. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Neuron. 2004; 41: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found increased soluble Aβ40 in the brains of PDAPP Abca1-/- mice, also possibly a result of impaired receptor-mediated clearance of apoE-Aβ complexes. However, PDAPP mice lacking apoE, and therefore lacking receptor-mediated clearance of apoE-Aβ complexes, have decreased Aβ deposition, whereas PDAPP Abca1-/- mice have increased Aβ deposition. This strongly suggests that receptor-mediated clearance of Aβ is not the main reason for the increase in Aβ we observed in 12-month-old PDAPP Abca1-/- mice. Finally, we think the most likely mechanism by which Abca1 deletion increases Aβ deposition is by affecting the lipidation state of apoE. Experiments have shown that apoE lipidation affects interactions with Aβ in vitro that is likely to influence the probability that Aβ will aggregate. De-lipidated apoE3 and apoE4 form similar amounts of SDS-stable complexes with Aβ (2Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In contrast, cell-secreted, lipidated apoE2 and apoE3 interact with Aβ and form a much greater amount of SDS-stable complex than apoE4 (41LaDu M.J. Pederson T.M. Frail D.E. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S.

Calero M. Matsubara E. Vidal R. Kumar A. Permanne B. Zlokovic B. Smith J.D. Ladu M.J. Rostagno A. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although the effect of altering the relative amount of apoE lipidation on Aβ clearance and fibrillogenesis has not been assessed in vitro, these previous findings suggest that lipidation state of apoE can markedly influence its interactions with Aβ.

LXR dimerizes with retinoid X receptor to transcriptionally induce a group of lipid-related genes including Abca1. It was recently shown that the LXR agonist T0901317 decreased brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels when given over several days to 3-month-old APP transgenic mice (APP23) prior to plaque deposition (46Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Staufenbiel M. Wolfe D. Huang S. Glorioso J.C. Walter M. Roth M.G. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4079-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for this effect is that the LXR agonist modulated cellular cholesterol levels and directly affected APP processing into Aβ (36Wolozin B. Neuron. 2004; 41: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although the authors found a difference in secreted APP fragments, they did not see any differences in APP-CTFs that would support this mechanism. An alternative hypothesis to explain these data is that the induction of ABCA1 increases lipidation of apoE, which could affect Aβ levels and ultimately Aβ deposition. Because a decrease in ABCA1 results in more amyloid deposition, increasing ABCA1 protein or function might be predicted to decrease amyloid deposition via increasing apoE lipidation. This hypothesis needs to be tested directly. If ABCA1 influences amyloid deposition by altering the level and lipidation state of apoE, it will be important to assess the effects of ABCA1 on both murine and human apoE. This is because murine apoE appears to increase amyloid deposition, whereas human apoE appears to delay and decrease amyloid deposition (34Fagan A.M. Watson M. Parsadanian M. Bales K.R. Paul S.M.

In sum, the absence of ABCA1 resulted in an increase in amyloid deposition and CAA in PDAPP mice. This effect appears likely because of promotion of Aβ fibrillogenesis by the poorly lipidated apoE particles produced in the brains of Abca1-/- mice. These results emphasize the potential importance of ABCA1 not only in regulating apoE levels and lipidation but also the consequences of its absence on Aβ deposition and conformation. As such, ABCA1 can be hypothesized to be a potential therapeutic target in AD, and this hypothesis can be tested in future studies. We thank Dr. John Cirrito and Mary Beth Finn for helpful comments. We also thank Cheryl Wellington and Iliya Lefterov for sharing their results prior to submission of this manuscript."

Here we have examined a possible association of Rab proteins with lipid droplets (LDs), neutral lipid-containing organelles surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, also known as lipid bodies, which have been traditionally considered relatively inert storage organelles. Although we found close apposition between LDs and endosomal compartments labeled by expressed Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 constructs, there was no detectable labeling of the LD surface itself by these Rab proteins. In contrast, GFP-Rab18 localized to LDs and immunoelectron microscopy showed direct association with the monolayer surface. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab18-labeled LDs underwent oscillatory movements in a localized area as well as sporadic, rapid, saltatory movements both in the periphery of the cell and toward the perinuclear region. In both adipocytes and non-adipocyte cell lines Rab18 localized to a subset of LDs. To gain insights into this specific localization, Rab18 was co-expressed with Cav3DGV, a truncation mutant of caveolin-3 shown to inhibit the catabolism and motility of lipid droplets. GFP-Rab18 and mRFP-Cav3DGV labeled mutually exclusive subpopulations of LDs. Moreover, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, stimulation of lipolysis increased the localization of Rab18 to LDs, an effect reversed by β-adrenergic antagonists. These results show that a Rab protein localizes directly to the monolayer surface of LDs. In addition, association with the LD surface was increased following stimulation of lipolysis and inhibited by a caveolin mutant suggesting that recruitment of Rab18 is regulated by the metabolic state of individual LDs.

Several recent studies have undertaken proteomic analyses of LDs from a number of different cell types, under conditions of lipolysis or lipid deposition. These analyses identified numerous members of the Rab family of small GTPases associated with the LDs (11Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23699-23709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The Rab family of proteins are essential regulators of vesicular traffic. Described as molecular switches, Rab proteins undergo conformational changes through cycles of GTP binding and hydrolysis (15Seabra M.C. Wasmeier C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound active form interacts directly with downstream effectors and indirectly with other components of the transport machinery controlling cargo selection, vesicle fusion, cytoskeletal transport, and integration of vesicle traffic with signal transduction pathways. Although the novel nature of the LD hemi-membrane makes it unlikely that proteins spanning the bilayer could associate with this organelle, this would not preclude association of Rab proteins whose attachment to membranes is regulated through prenylation at the C terminus, and protein-protein interactions (15Seabra M.C. Wasmeier C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). Indeed, ten Rab GTPases have been found associated with LDs (11Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 12Liu P. Ying Y. Zhao Y. Mundy D.I. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

On the one hand, this complexity is not unusual, as several distinct Rab proteins can be associated with a single organelle undertaking multiple sorting functions, such as early endosomes and the Golgi complex (16Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). The predicted association of multiple Rab proteins with the lipid droplet suggests a dynamic interaction between this and other organelles in the cell. On the other hand, out of the Rab proteins associated with LDs, only five, i.e. Rab5c, Rab7, Rab10, Rab14, and Rab18, have been identified independently in at least two separate studies. In the present study we have analyzed the localization of Rab5, Rab7, Rab11, and Rab18, all previously identified in the endosomal system, with respect to LDs under conditions of neutral lipid synthesis. We have identified Rab18 as a major component of lipid droplets and further explored its role in lipid dynamics and lipid storage activities. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine, and differentiated using insulin, dexamethasone, biotin, and isobutyl-methylxanthine as described previously (17Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were used between days 6 and 12 post-differentiation, or at 2-day intervals during the differentiation process as described in the results section. BHK-21 cells (baby hamster kidney cells) and Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) Serum-Supreme (BioWhittaker) and 2 mm l-glutamine. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Reagents—Mouse anti-GM130 (catalog no. 610823), monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (catalog no. 610406), and monoclonal anti-caveolin-2 (catalog no. 610684) were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (BD Biosciences). Rabbit anti-perilipin A (catalog no. P1998) and mouse anti-α-tubulin (catalog no. T9026) were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-Rab18 (18Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Murphy C. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Alexa488- and Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Oleic acid was obtained from Calbiochem and conjugated to fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) prior to use. Bodipy493/503 and Nile Red were obtained from Molecular Probes and prepared as saturated solutions in ethanol (working dilution, 1:200) and acetone (working dilution, 1:2000), respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. GFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab11 have been described previously (20Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). GFP-Rab7 was obtained from Dr.Lucas Pelkmans, Max-Planck Institute, Dresden, Germany. mRFP-Cav3DGV was constructed using Cav3DGV-HA (21Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as a template to amplify a fragment using the following primers: 5′-GGGGTACCCGACGGTGTATGGAAGGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTAGCCTTCCCTTCGCAG-3′. The PCR product was A-tailed and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently excised using BamHI and KpnI, and ligated into linearized mRFP-C3. mRFP-C3 was constructed from pRSETb-mRFP1 (supplied by Prof. Roger Tsien, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California (22Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar)). To generate GFP-Rab18, the mouse Rab18 ORF was excised from myc-Rab18 using NdeI and BamHI (removing the myc tag), ligated into pSL1180 (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequently excised with BamHI and PstI and ligated into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), resulting in an N-terminal GFP tag. All constructs were sequenced using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Australian Genome Research Facility, University of Queensland. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Real-time Video Microscopy—For immunofluorescence microscopy cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% saponin (w/v) for 10 min, quenched for 10 min using 50 mm NHCl4, and blocked for 10 min using 0.2% bovine serum albumin/0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the cells for 30 min at room temperature. Finally the coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Labeling was analyzed using an Axiovert 200M SP LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) under oil, using either 100× or 63× oil immersion objectives. The data were processed using the LSM 510 Meta (Zeiss) software, and images were assembled using Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Quantitation of LD Rab18 labeling was performed on fluorescence images collected with identical settings, using ImageJ 1.33 to measure the mean pixel intensity of individual LDs. For each individual experiment between 20 and 70 LDs were analyzed. Cells for real-time microscopy were plated onto glass-bottom tissue culture dishes (MatTek Corp.) and transferred into CO2-independent medium supplemented with 0.1% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml oleic acid. Time series were collected at 37 °C using an Axiovert 200M SP LSM 510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a heated stage and a 100× oil immersion objective. Cells were used for real-time data collection for a maximum of 1.5 h. Time series images were collected using a 488 nm excitation laser line at <20% maximum power using the Zeiss LSM510 Meta software. Images were converted to 8-bit TIFF files and further analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). QuickTime movies were assembled using ImageJ 1.33, and still images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. LD Isolation—LDs were isolated using a modification of the procedure of Yu et al. (23Yu W. Cassara J. Weller P.F. Blood. 2000; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into dissociation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and lysed by sonication for 10 s. LDs were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation through 18.5%, 9%, and 4.1% sucrose steps and through top buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Gradients were analyzed by Western blotting or by electron microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as described previously (24Morrow I.C. Rea S. Martin S. Prior I.A. Prohaska R. Hancock J.F. James D.E. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48834-48841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors. Equal volumes of lysates were immunoprecipitated using either Rab18 antiserum, GFP antiserum, or a non-immune rabbit serum and collected using protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized directly into Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (25Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Immunolabeled proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using the Supersignal ECL reagent (Pierce). Electron Microscopy—Immunoelectron microscopy of ultrathin cryosections was performed essentially as described previously (26Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Vero cells transfected with GFP-Rab18 were incubated overnight in the presence of 100 μg/ml oleic acid and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA), pH 6.9, for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were embedded in 10% gelatin, cryoprotected using PVP-sucrose, and snap frozen onto specimen holders in liquid N2. Ultracryomicrotomy was performed by a slight modification of the Tokuyasu technique (28Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) as described previously (27Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and sections were picked up with a 1:1 mixture of 2.3 m sucrose and 2% methyl cellulose (29Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Grids were viewed using a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope. To perform immunoelectron microscopy on isolated LDs, BHK cells were transfected with GFP-Rab18 or GFP and subsequently incubated in 100 μg/ml oleic acid overnight. LDs were isolated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described above, and the top fractions, containing the LDs, were fixed in 4% PFA. Isolated LDs were applied to Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids and immunolabeled as described previously (25Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Localization of GFP-Rab18 to Lipid Droplets and Apposition of Endosomal Compartments—To investigate the localization of Rab GTPases potentially involved in LD function in relation to LDs we expressed fluorescently tagged Rab5, Rab7, Rab11, and Rab18 in Vero cells. To increase LD formation, cells were incubated overnight in 100 μg/ml oleic acid conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Fatty acid concentrations higher than physiological levels have been used previously to induce the rapid formation of LDs in cultured cells (3Pol A. Martin S. Fernandez M.A. Ferguson C. Carozzi A. Luetterforst R. Enrich C. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Lower concentrations of oleic acid induced a similar formation over a longer period of time (results not shown). GFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab11 were identified in punctate structures distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 1A) consistent with localization to early and recycling endosomes, respectively (20Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In contrast, GFP-Rab7 was present in both small punctate vesicles and in larger endosomal vacuoles, consistent with localization to late endosomes (30Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). All isoforms also showed varying levels of a cytosolic pool, frequently observed when Rab proteins are over-expressed (31Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). When cells were counterstained with Nile Red to identify lipid droplets, both GFP-Rab5- and YFP-Rab11-containing structures were occasionally identified in close apposition to Nile Red-positive structures, whereas GFP-Rab7-labeled endosomes were frequently observed in close apposition to LDs (Fig. 1A). However, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11 were not observed to label the LD surface itself. In contrast, GFP-Rab18 showed specific and intense labeling of a subset of LDs (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, GFP-Rab18 labeled the ER and small, possibly ER-associated, puncta distributed throughout the cells, as well as weak labeling in the region of the Golgi complex (Figs. 1B, 1C, and 4). In a small number of cells with very high levels of GFP-Rab18 expression there was a very strong labeling of the perinuclear region, and in these cells labeling for the Golgi marker GM130 suggested that the Golgi complex was disrupted in a similar manner to brefeldin A (results not shown). However, the predominant localization of GFP-Rab18 was to the LDs. GFP-Rab18 consistently labeled smaller sized LDs usually at the periphery of larger, unlabeled LDs, or a cluster of LDs (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, in fixed cells GFP-Rab18 labeling was often observed to partially surround a LD, forming a crescent-shaped profile by fluorescence microscopy, suggestive of a partial enfolding of the LD surface by the Rab18 compartment (arrowheads, Fig. 1B). However, when live cells were imaged in real-time (Fig. 1C), the GFP-Rab18 profile was invariably ring-shaped, suggesting that PFA fixation altered the surface structure of the LDs. Differences between LD size between live and fixed, labeled cells have been described previously (4Targett-Adams P. Chambers D. Gledhill S. Hope R.G. Coy J.F. Girod A. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an additional observation in live cells, not detectable in fixed cells, was the presence of a single persistent brighter spot of Rab18 labeling occasionally observed on the LD surface, reminiscent of GFP-Rab5 on endosomal membranes (32Roberts R.L. Barbieri M.A. Pryse K.M. Chua M. Morisaki J.H. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 4Localization of GFP-Rab18 to LDs and the ER. Vero cells expressing GFP-Rab18 were incubated with 100 μg/ml oleic acid overnight and fixed for immunoelectron microscopy (A-C) or immunofluorescence microscopy (D and E). For immunoelectron microscopy, cryosections were labeled using anti-GFP antibodies and labeling detected using 10 nm protein A-gold. LDs were defined as large, electron-lucent structures that lacked a limiting membrane bilayer. GFP-Rab18 was highly localized to the surface of LDs (A and C), to the peripheral ER (A and D) and nuclear envelope (B), as well as groups of small, non-clathrin-coated tubulovesicular elements (TVE) adjacent to the LD surface (A) and distributed throughout the cell (B). C, in thicker cryosections Rab18 labeled a thin membrane layer adjacent to the ER, assumed to correspond to the surface of the LD itself (arrows). Localization of GFP-Rab18 to the ER was confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopic labeling for calnexin (D-E). Calnexin-positive structures were seen surrounding the GFP-Rab18-labeled LDs (D-E), and in a punctate reticular pattern throughout the cell, contiguous with, but not co-localizing with, a punctate reticular GFP-Rab18 labeling pattern (D). Note that as fluorescence intensity of GFP-Rab18 at the LD surface was frequently much brighter than the surrounding ER, simultaneous visualization of the two localizations was impracticable.

A rabbit anti-serum raised against Rab18 (18Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Murphy C. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Valencia A. Simons K. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3437-3448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was found to immunoprecipitate endogenous Rab18 and heterologously expressed GFP-Rab18 (Fig. 2, A and B), and to detect heterologously expressed GFP-Rab18 by immunofluorescence microscopy (results not shown). In addition, anti-Rab18 antiserum detected GFP-Rab18 immunoprecipitated using an anti-serum raised against GFP. Both endogenous Rab18 and heterologously expressed GFP-Rab18 often resolved as a doublet by Western blotting, presumably corresponding to both prenylated and non-prenylated forms. Fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lysates into membrane and cytosol fractions demonstrated that at steady state Rab18 was predominantly membrane associated (Fig. 2C). Expression of Rab18 was found to be higher in 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates than in BHK or Vero cells by Western blotting (results not shown). We therefore hypothesized that expression could be directly related to LD formation. However, no change in expression of Rab18 was observed during differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes (results not shown). We next examined the localization of endogenous Rab18 in 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation to adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, Rab18 labeling was only clearly detectable in a subset of cells containing endogenous LDs, where it was observed to localize to the LD surface (Fig. 3A). In addition, there was a low, dispersed, punctate labeling, not observed with a nonspecific anti-serum. During the differentiation process a more pronounced perinuclear labeling was detectable consistent with Golgi localization (Fig. 3A). Conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to an adipocyte phenotype, characterized by the accumulation of large amounts of neutral lipid, coincided with the localization of endogenous Rab18 to the LD surface. Rab18 was observed to label LDs with a distinct, punctate labeling pattern (Fig. 3A). A similar labeling pattern was observed in oleic acid-treated Vero cells, in which a small subset of LDs were labeled heavily for Rab18, whereas a large number of LDs had a single punctate dot of Rab18 labeling associated with the surface (Fig. 3A). Thus in both adipocytes and non-adipocyte cell lines endogenous Rab18 associates with a distinct subset of LDs. Rather than a spectrum of different labeling densities on different LDs, distinct LDs are either very strongly labeled or show negligible labeling. In conclusion, Rab18 was the only Rab protein that appeared to show specific localization to the surface of LDs as judged by light microscopy. Whether this repr"
https://openalex.org/W2115060917,"In oncological research, there is a great need for imaging techniques that specifically identify angiogenic blood vessels in tumors on the basis of differences in the expression level of biomolecular markers. In the angiogenic cascade, different cell surface receptors, including the αvβ3-integrin, are strongly expressed on activated endothelial cells. In the present study, we aimed to image angiogenesis by detecting the expression of αvβ3 in tumor bearing mice with a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence microscopy. To that end, we prepared MR-detectable and fluorescent liposomes, which carry ∼700 αvβ3-specific RGD peptides per liposome. RGD competition experiments and RAD-conjugated liposomes were used as controls for specificity. In vivo, both RAD liposomes and RGD liposomes gave rise to signal increase on T1-weighted MR images. It was established by the use of ex vivo fluorescence microscopy that RGD liposomes and RAD liposomes accumulated in the tumor by different mechanisms. RGD liposomes were specifically associated with activated tumor endothelium, while RAD liposomes were located in the extravascular compartment. This study demonstrates that MR molecular imaging of angiogenesis is feasible by using a targeted contrast agent specific for the αvβ3-integrin, and that the multimodality imaging approach gave insight into the exact mechanism of accumulation in the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2151049459,"ABCA1, a cholesterol transporter expressed in the brain, has been shown recently to be required to maintain normal apoE levels and lipidation in the central nervous system. In addition, ABCA1 has been reported to modulate β-amyloid (Aβ) production in vitro. These observations raise the possibility that ABCA1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Here we report that the deficiency of ABCA1 does not affect soluble or guanidine-extractable Aβ levels in Tg-SwDI/B or amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, but rather is associated with a dramatic reduction in soluble apoE levels in brain. Although this reduction in apoE was expected to reduce the amyloid burden in vivo, we observed that the parenchymal and vascular amyloid load was increased in Tg-SwDI/B animals and was not diminished in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the proportion of apoE retained in the insoluble fraction, particularly in the APP/PS1 model. These data suggested that ABCA1-mediated effects on apoE levels and lipidation influenced amyloidogenesis in vivo.

Clinically, AD is characterized by severe impairments in memory and executive cortical functions as well as difficulties in language, calculation, visuospatial perception, behavior, and judgment (1Price D.L. Tanzi R.E. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 461-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Characteristic neuropathological hallmarks of AD include intraneuronal fibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and amyloid deposits that are composed largely of Aβ peptides, apolipoprotein E (apoE), lipids, and other proteins that accumulate in the neural parenchyma and the cerebrovasculature (2Morris J.C.

Most affected individuals have late onset AD that typically manifests after 70 years of age. However, a number of families develop the disease in their 4th or 5th decades (8Sherrington R. Rogaev E.

Other APP mutations, including the Dutch (E693D) and Iowa (Q694N) mutations, alter the charge of the Aβ peptide and result in amyloid deposition predominantly in the cerebral blood vessels rather than in the parenchyma (13Levy E.

In addition to mutations in APP, over 100 different mutations have been identified in presenilin-1 alone (17Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11039-11041Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, less than 5% of the overall clinical burden of AD is caused by mutations in APP and presenilins combined. To date, the only well established risk factor for late-onset AD is apoE (18Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Wellington C.L. Clin. Genet. 2004; 66: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the human population, apoE exists as three major alleles (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), and inheritance of an apoE4 allele increases the risk of developing AD at an earlier age, whereas inheritance of apoE2 delays the age of onset of AD (20Poirier J.

Genet. 1994; 7: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). How apoE functions in the pathogenesis of AD is a subject of intense investigation. ApoE is a component of several lipoprotein subclasses, including very low density lipoprotein and HDL particles in the peripheral circulation, where apoE acts to mediate their uptake by apoE receptors (23Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genom. Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 507-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 24Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, apoE is synthesized and secreted by astrocytes and microglia and serves as the major cholesterol carrier in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (25Ladu M.J. Reardon C.

In the brain, apoE expression is increased under conditions of chronic or acute neuronal damage, where it is believed to acquire lipids from damaged neuronal processes and rede-liver these lipids to neurons during reinnervation (30Poirier J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 924: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Poirier J.

ApoE binds avidly to Aβ peptides and is found within amyloid plaques (34Atwood C.S. Martins R.N. Smith M.A. Perry G. Peptides (N. Y.). 2002; 23: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Burns M.P. Noble W.J. Olm V. Gaynor K. Casey E. LaFrancois J. Wang L. Duff K. Brain Res. Mol.

ApoE is believed to play a major role in the conversion of Aβ peptides from soluble to fibrillar form, based on the observation that apoE-deficient animals are unable to form mature amyloid in vivo (36Bales K.R.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6271-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although Aβ is deposited in the brains of apoE-deficient mice, the deposits do not contain structural amyloid as defined by the ability to bind thioflavine or Congo Red dyes (36Bales K.R. Verina T.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6271-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amyloid deposition is similar in distribution but less extensive in apoE heterozygous mice, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of apoE level on amyloid formation (41Holtzman D.M. Fagan A.M. Mackey B. Tenkova T. Sartorius L. Paul S.M. Bales K. Ashe K.H. Irizarry M.C. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, factors that affect apoE abundance may also affect amyloid deposition and influence the onset or progression of AD. The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 has recently been shown to modulate apoE levels in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma (42Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L.

In peripheral tissues, the primary biochemical function of ABCA1 is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from the plasma membrane to lipid-free apoAI, a reaction that constitutes the first step in HDL biogenesis (44Hayden M.R. Clee S.M. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest Jr., J. Attie A. Kastelein J.J.P Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The pre-β-HDL particles generated from this reaction circulate in the bloodstream and acquire additional lipids to form mature HDL particles. ABCA1-dependent lipid transport to apoAI is the major pathway by which excess sterols from peripheral tissues are transported to the liver where they are converted into bile acids and excreted from the body. Mutation of one ABCA1 allele causes familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, a mild disorder of peripheral lipid metabolism characterized by reduced plasma HDL levels (45Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O.F Loubser O. Ouellette B.F.F Fichter K. Ashbourne Excoffon K.J.D Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M.

Mutation of both alleles of ABCA1 results in Tangier disease, which is characterized by a nearly complete absence of plasma HDL, deposition of intracellular cholesterol esters, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (45Brooks-Wilson A.

Although the functions of ABCA1 in the brain are not completely understood, it is likely that ABCA1 participates in the regulation of lipid trafficking among the various cell types within the brain. We and others have shown that ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux to apoE and regulates the secretion of apoE from astrocytes and microglia (42Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L.

The observation that ABCA1 is a critical modulator of apoE abundance and lipidation in the central nervous system raises the possibility that ABCA1 may influence the onset or progression of AD through its effects on apoE.

Although these results support a role for neuronal ABCA1 in Aβ production in vivo, TO901317 induces the expression of several other genes in addition to ABCA1. For example, TO901317 has been reported to stimulate the expression of apoE in glial cell lines and in mice (61Liang Y. Lin S. Beyer T.P. Zhang Y. Wu X. Bales K.R. DeMattos R.B. May P.C. Li S.D.

TO901317 also induces other members of the ABC-cassette transporter superfamily that may also participate in central nervous system lipid homeostasis. Because ABCA1 is expressed in several cell types in the brain, ABCA1 may play multiple roles in the pathogenesis of AD. For example, neuronal ABCA1 may play a prominent role in regulating intraneuronal cholesterol content, thereby influencing the production of Aβ peptides. From this perspective, the deficiency of ABCA1 would be predicted to increase intraneuronal lipids and lead to elevated Aβ levels. On the other hand, glial ABCA1 is crucial for normal apoE levels and lipidation (42Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A. Chan J.Y. Tansley G.H. Cohn J.S. Hayden M.R.

Therefore, the lack of ABCA1 could theoretically result in opposite outcomes in amyloid deposition depending upon whether the major role of ABCA1 is on Aβ production or Aβ clearance and deposition via apoE. Determining whether deficiency of ABCA1 increases, decreases, or has no net effect on Aβ and amyloid burden will therefore require investigating the effect of ABCA1 deficiency on Aβ and amyloid deposition in vivo where the physiological interactions among neurons and glia during the process of amyloid deposition are preserved. We therefore crossed ABCA1-deficient mice to two independent murine models of AD to determine the impact of ABCA1 on amyloid burden, Aβ levels, and apoE levels in vivo. Here we report that elimination of ABCA1 has no measurable impact on the steady-state levels of soluble or guanidine-extractable human Aβ when crossed to either model, and no effect on endogenous murine Aβ levels in the parental ABCA1-deficient mice. Lack of ABCA1 did result in the expected reduction in soluble apoE levels, consistent with previous results (42Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A. Chan J.Y. Tansley G.H.

To examine the mechanisms mediating Epo's neuroprotective activity in vivo, we made use of our transgenic mouse line tg21 that constitutively expresses human Epo in brain without inducing excessive erythrocytosis. We show that human Epo is expressed in tg21 brains and that cortical and striatal neurons carry the Epo receptor. After middle cerebral artery occlusion, human Epo potently protected brains of tg21 mice against ischemic injury, both when severe (90 min) and mild (30 min) ischemia was imposed. Histochemical studies revealed that Epo induced an activation of JAK-2, ERK-1/-2, and Akt pathways in the ischemic brain. This activation was associated with elevated Bcl-XL and decreased NO synthase-1 and -2 levels in neurons. Intracerebroventricular injections of selective inhibitors of ERK-1/-2 (PD98059) or Akt (wortmannin) pathways revealed that both ERK-1/-2 and Akt were required for Epo's neuroprotective function, antagonization of either pathway completely abolishing tissue protection. On the other hand, ERK-1/-2 and Akt blockade did not reverse the neuronal NO synthase-1/-2 inhibition, indicating that Epo down-regulates these NO synthases in an ERK-1/-2 and Akt independent manner. On the basis of our data, the dual activation of ERK-1/-2 and Akt is crucial for Epo's neuroprotective activity."

Here we report that CREB is present in the mitochondrial matrix of neurons and that it binds directly to cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) found within the mitochondrial genome. Disruption of CREB activity in the mitochondria decreases the expression of a subset of mitochondrial genes, including the ND5 subunit of complex I, down-regulates complex I-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and increases susceptibility to 3-nitropropionic acid, a mitochondrial toxin that induces a clinical and pathological phenotype similar to Huntington disease.

Overexpression of constitutively active CREB prevents cell death induced by growth factor deprivation, while expression of a dominant negative form of CREB leads to apoptosis in both sympathetic neurons and cerebellar granule cells (4Riccio A.

Confocal Microscopy—Indirect labeling methods were used to determine the levels of CREB, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), and neurofilament (200 kDa) in cortical neuronal cultures and human and rat brain tissues as described previously (7Ryu H. Lee J. Olofsson B.A. Mwidau A. Dedeoglu A. Escudero M. Flemington E. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Ferrante R.J. Ratan R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4281-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Immunogold Labeling and Electron Microscopy— Frozen samples were sectioned at -120 °C, and the sections were transferred to Formvar/carboncoated copper grids. Samples were incubated with antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. After rinsing the samples four times with PBS, protein A-gold (10 nm) in 1% bovine serum albumin was added for 20 min. Contrasting stain procedures were carried out using 2% methyl cellulose: 3% uranyl acetate (9:1) for 10 min on ice. To dry the samples, grids were picked up with a loop and excess liquid was removed using filter paper. DNase I Footprinting Analysis—The mitochondrial DNA fragment encompassing 15858/16063 bp (GenBank™ accession number J01420) was prepared by PCR and used as a probe in the DNase I footprinting experiment (8Kim C.H. Hwang D.Y. Park J.J. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—We performed EMSAs on mitochondrial extracts from rat brain tissues and cortical neurons using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a wild-type CREB-binding site as described previously (7Ryu H.

Supershifts were performed with pCREB-specific antibody for the Ser-133 residue (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), ATF-1/CREB (25C10G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or CREB-1 (24H4B and 240; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mitochondrial DNA and Protein Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Mitochondrial DNA and protein cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis for CREB binding to mitochondrial DNA was performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Mitochondrial fraction pellets or HT-22 cells transfected with pDs-Red2-Mito empty vector, pDs-Red2-Mito-wt-CREB, and pDsRed2-A-CREB for 24 h were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles, and PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. Three primers were used to amplify the segment flanking the three or two CRE-like sites in the D-loop of mitochondria. The forward primers were 5′-GTGGTGTCATGCATTTGGTATCT-3′ and 5′-ATCAACATAGCCGTCAAGGCATG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TCACCGTAGGTGCGTCTAGACTGT-3′. Normal rabbit IgG served as a negative control. Construction of Plasmids—To generate mitochondrially targeted fusion proteins, wt-CREB and A-CREB (9Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pECFP-Mito and pDs-Red2 Mito vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Real-time PCR and Conventional RT-PCR—To quantify the copy number of mRNA of the ND5 and ND6 genes, real-time PCR was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon System (MJ Research Inc., Las Vegas, NV). For the detection of mitochondria-encoded gene expression, total cellular RNA digested with RNase-free DNase was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The probe and primers designed to amplify mitochondrial transcripts were as follows: human ND2, 4704-5103; human ND4, 11479-11929; human ND5, 13569-13917, human cytochrome b, 15494-15748; human ATPase 6, 8854-9087; human complex IV, 6188-6377, human mitochondrial 12 S rRNA, 576-422; human 18 S RNA, 5′-CCGAGATTGAGCAATAACAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTTCGACCGTCTTCTCAGG-3′ (reverse). Measurement of Mitochondrial Enzyme Activities—Respiratory activities were measured polargraphically as described previously (10Jazayeri M. Andreyev A. Will Y. Ward M. Anderson C.M. Clevenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9823-9830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot was performed using subcellular fractions and cell or tissue lysates as described previously (7Ryu H. Lee J. Olofsson B.A. Mwidau A. Dedeoglu A. Escudero M. Flemington E. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Ferrante R.J. Ratan R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4281-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the neurons of the adult rat cortex, we found that CREB and pCREB (Ser-133) were partially extranuclear. Furthermore, the extranuclear CREB colocalized with the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c (Fig. 1A, panels a-f). In cultured immature embryonic cortical neurons, CREB and pCREB partially colocalized with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker and were found within the proximal segments of dendrites (Fig. 1A, panels g-i). CREB staining was most prominent in neurofilament-200 (NF-200)-positive cells (data not shown). Moreover, both nuclear and extranuclear CREB and pCREB immunoreactivity was absent in neurons derived from CREB null mice (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that CREB-binding protein is not localized in the mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 1). To pinpoint the subcellular localization of extranuclear CREB, we performed immuno-electron microscopy using cultured cortical neurons. This analysis demonstrated that pCREB is present within both the nucleus and the mitochondrial matrix of these neurons (Fig. 1C). We further verified the localization of CREB to the mitochondrial fraction using subcellular fractionation of adult rat brain tissue by sucrose density centrifugation (Fig. 1D). The presence of complex I (NADH oxidoreductase) immunoreactivity, together with the absence of immunoreactivity of the endoplasmic reticulum marker Bip (GRP78) or the nuclear marker Sp1, confirmed that the fractions contained only mitochondria. Mitochondrial pCREB was resistant to proteinase K treatment in the absence of detergent, suggesting that pCREB is located within the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1, C and E). We employed EMSA to determine whether mitochondrial CREB is capable of binding to a canonical CRE DNA sequence (5′-TGACGTCA-3′). Consistent with the immunoblot and immunolocalization experiments, mitochondrial extracts from rat embryonic cortical neurons and adult rat brain tissue revealed the presence of CRE-binding activities (Fig. 1F). Although CREB lacks a classical mitochondrial targeting sequence, alternative pathways exist for targeting proteins to the mitochondria (11Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 12Merrick B.A. He C. Witcher L.L. Patterson R.M. Reid J.J. Pence-Pawlowski P.M. Selkirk J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether chaperone molecules may play a role in the mitochondrial targeting of CREB, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using lysates from the mitochondrial fraction to assess the degree of association of CREB and mitochondria (mt) HSP70 (GRP 75) (11Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 12Merrick B.A. He C. Witcher L.L. Patterson R.M. Reid J.J. Pence-Pawlowski P.M. Selkirk J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that CREB coprecipitated with mtHSP70 in human and rat brain tissues and in embryonic neurons (supplemental Fig. 2). The data support the possibility that chaperone molecules are involved in delivering CREB to the mitochondria. The D-loop is the control site for both transcription and DNA replication in the mitochondrial genome. Within this region, we identified variant CRE-like sequences by in vitro footprinting analysis (Fig. 2, A and B) and observed that these sites formed specific DNA-protein complexes with CREB (Fig. 2C) and that complex formation by mitochondrial CRE elements did not compete with NFκB, Sp1, or USF-1 cis-elements (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation with a CREB antibody to demonstrate that CREB is bound to these mitochondrial DNA sites in the intact cell (Fig. 2E) (supplemental Fig. 3). To evaluate the role of CREB in mitochondrial gene expression and survival, we expressed a mitochondrially targeted form of either CREB (mito-wt-CREB-ECFP) or its dominant negative (mito-A-CREB). Transiently expressed mito-wt-CREB-ECFP protein colocalized with mitotracker staining, confirming that the heterologous protein is localized in the mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting verified that mito-wt-CREB (∼80 kDa), mito-A-CREB (∼30 kDa), and mito-ECFP (∼28 kDa) fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3B). EMSA analysis demonstrated that the dominant negative mito-A-CREB disrupts the mitochondrial DNA-binding activity of CREB (Fig. 3, C and D). To more definitively address the function of CREB targeted to mitochondria, we prepared cell lines that stably express either mito-wt-CREB or mito-A-CREB. We used real-time PCR and RT-PCR to determine to what extent mitochondrial gene expression was altered in the stable cell lines (Fig. 3E and supplemental Table 1). We found that mito-wt-CREB and mito-A-CREB inversely regulate the expression of some mitochondrial genes. Mito-wt-CREB increased levels of transcripts of the ND2, ND4, and ND5 mitochondrial genes, while mito-A-CREB decreased them. Interestingly, ND5 expression was significantly reduced in mito-A-CREB cells. Consistent with reduced expression of ND5 (a complex I subunit), we also observed a relative reduction of complex I activity in mito-A-CREB cells (Fig. 3F). We monitored levels of the c-fos gene, a transcript regulated by nuclear CREB levels, to verify that mito-A-CREB does not affect nuclear CREB activity. As expected, we found that neither mito-wt-CREB or A-CREB influences c-fos expression as compared with control (supplemental Fig. 4). Our results that mito-A-CREB down-regulates several of the mitochondrial genes, in part, likely reflect diminished mito-CREB transcriptional activity. However, the failure to detect a decrease in levels of some mitochondrial genes, such as the cytochrome b or ATPase 6 genes that are also encoded on the H strand, could be due to other factors, such as differences in mRNA stability. Indeed, mutations in the mitochondrial RNA binding protein, LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat cassette) are responsible for a French Canadian form of Leigh's syndrome. In this syndrome, cytochrome c oxidase mRNAs are selectively decreased as compared with other mRNAs encoded in the mitochondrial H-strand (13Xu F. Morin C. Mitchell G. Ackerley C. Robinson B.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that decreasing ND5 expression corresponds with decreasing complex I-dependent respiration, suggesting that ND5 transcript levels may tightly control mitochondrial respiration rate (14Bai Y. Shakwley R.M. Attardi G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Indeed, mitochondrial DNA mutations in the genes encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I are associated with mitochondrial myopathy and Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy, which show defects in complex I activity (14Bai Y. Shakwley R.M. Attardi G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Bentlage H.A. Janssen A.J. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Walker J.E. Schagger H. Sengers R.C.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, CREB regulation of expression of the ND5 and/or ND6 subunit may influence mitochondrial respiration (17Enriquez J.A. Fernandez-Silva P. Garrido-Perez N. Lopez-Perez M.J. Perez-Martos A. Montoya J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, intracellular ATP levels were not decreased by mito-A-CREB expression (supplemental Table 2). There are a number of mitochondrial inhibitors that affect complexes of the electron transport chain by reducing cellular levels of ATP, resulting in energy deficiency and mimicking HD pathogenesis (18Ludolph A.C. Seelig M. Ludolph A.G. Sabri M.I. Spencer P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 648: 300-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2642-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One such naturally occurring plant toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase and both the Krebs cycle and complex II activity of the electron transport chain (19Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3-NP is associated with HD-like symptoms in both humans and animals and, as such, has been used as an experimental model for HD (20Bogdanov M.B. Ferrante R.J. Kuemmerle S. Klivenyi P. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2642-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We further hypothesized that mitochondria may be more susceptible to mitochondrial toxins in the presence of a dominant negative or mutant mitochondrial CREB. To begin to address this possibility, we examined the effect of 3-NP on cell lines stably expressing either mito-wt-CREB or mito-A-CREB. Mito-wt-CREB cells were relatively resistant to 3-NP-induced cytotoxicity, whereas mito-A-CREB cells were more susceptible (Fig. 4, A and B). Increased 3-NP cytotoxicity in mito-A-CREB cells was associated with an increase of cytochrome c release compared with mito-wt-CREB and mito-ECFP cells (Fig. 4C). These results support the hypothesis that defects in mitochondrial transcription are associated with increased vulnerability to mitochondrial toxins. We further found atrophy of striatal neurons in the CREB-/- mice measured by Nissl staining (1Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The data directly support a survival and/or trophic role for CREB in striatal neurons (supplemental Fig. 5A) (21Mantamadiotis T. Lemberger T. Bleckmann S.C. Kern H. Kretz O. Martin Villalba A. Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Gau D. Kapfhammer J. Otto C. Schmid W. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a decreased level of mitochondrial CREB proteins was found to correlate with the shrinkage of the striatum in R6/2 mice (supplemental Fig. 5B). Because the striatal phenotype of CREB-/- mice is reminiscent of HD (21Mantamadiotis T. Lemberger T. Bleckmann S.C. Kern H. Kretz O. Martin Villalba A. Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Gau D. Kapfhammer J. Otto C. Schmid W. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), our data are consistent with a loss of function of mitochondrial CREB as a determinant of striatal neuron atrophy and/or loss in HD. To determine whether there is an alteration of mitochondrial transcription in a transgenic mouse HD model, we examined mitochondrial transcript levels in R6/2 mice. Mitochondrial ND5 and ND6 mRNA were significantly decreased in R6/2 mice, similar to the changes induced by a dominant negative CREB targeted to the mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 6, A and B, and Fig. 3). Furthermore, striatal cell damage and neuronal loss in R6/2 mice were greater than in control mice in response to 3-NP injection (supplemental Fig. 6C). These results support the notion that defects in mitochondrial transcription are associated with increased vulnerability to mitochondrial toxins in vivo as well as in vitro (Fig. 4). In concert with previous studies demonstrating defective mitochondrial function in HD patients and transgenic mice (19Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M.

Our data demonstrate that CREB is present within the mitochondria and functions to regulate mitochondrial gene expression in neurons. Other transcription factors, such as p53 and the orphan receptor TR3, localize, in part, to mitochondria and exert pro-apoptotic effects with or without affecting the expression of the mitochondrial genes (27Mihara M.

In the present study, mitochondrial CREB appears to regulate pro-survival effects, at least in part, by regulating mitochondrial genes whose expression may be controlled by CRE-like elements within the D-loop of the mitochondrial genome (29Casas F.

Our data also suggest that CREB-mediated modulation of mitochondrial gene expression plays an important role in determining vulnerability to cell death upon expressing a defective CREB (A-CREB) and a mitochondrial toxin known to induce a phenotype similar to HD. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that overexpression of a dominant negative CREB transgene induces apoptosis (4Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D.

We show that mutant huntingtin (mtHtt) can bind CREB (supplemental Fig. 7). Thus, mutant huntingtin has the potential to sequester CREB and decrease CREB-mediated mitochondrial transcriptional activity (32Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S.

Silymarin and silibinin (50-100 microg/ml) inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell death, and caused G1 and G2-M cell cycle arrest in a dose/time-dependent manner. Molecular studies showed that G1 arrest was associated with a decrease in cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4, CDK6 and CDK2 protein levels, and CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activity, together with an increase in CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) Kip1/p27 and Cip1/p21. Further, both agents caused cytoplasmic sequestration of cyclin D1 and CDK2, contributing to G1 arrest. The G2-M arrest by silibinin and silymarin was associated with decreased levels of cyclin B1, cyclin A, pCdc2 (Tyr15), Cdc2, and an inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity. Both agents also decreased the levels of Cdc25B and cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C) phosphatases with an increased phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser216 and its translocation from nucleus to the cytoplasm, which was accompanied by an increased binding with 14-3-3beta. Both agents also increased checkpoint kinase (Chk)2 phosphorylation at Thr68 and Ser19 sites, which is known to phosphorylate Cdc25C at Ser216 site. Chk2-specific small interfering RNA largely attenuated the silymarin and silibinin-induced G2-M arrest. An increase in the phosphorylation of histone 2AX and ataxia telangiectasia mutated was also observed. These findings indicate that silymarin and silibinin modulate G1 phase cyclins-CDKs-CDKIs for G1 arrest, and the Chk2-Cdc25C-Cdc2/cyclin B1 pathway for G2-M arrest, together with an altered subcellular localization of critical cell cycle regulators. Overall, we observed comparable effects for both silymarin and silibinin at equal concentrations by weight, suggesting that silibinin could be a major cell cycle-inhibitory component in silymarin. However, other silibinin stereoisomers present in silymarin also contribute to its efficacy, and could be of interest for future investigation."

In this study, we have shown that erythropoietin (Epo) activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and promotes migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Epo-stimulated MCF-7 cell migration was blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD098059 and by dominant negative MEK-1, indicating an essential role for ERK. When MCF-7 cells were exposed to hypoxia (1.0% O2) for 3 h, the Epo mRNA level increased 2.4 ± 0.5-fold, the basal level of ERK activation increased, and cell migration increased 2.0 ± 0.1-fold. Soluble EpoR and Epo-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced MCF-7 cell migration, suggesting a major role for autocrine EpoR cell signaling. MCF-7 cell migration under hypoxic conditions was also inhibited by PD098059.

Eckardt K.U. Ratcliffe P.J. Kidney Int. 1991; 40: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Epo expression is stimulated by hypoxia as a result of activation of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) (6Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Epo is well characterized for its ability to promote proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells and also inhibit apoptosis in these cells (7Krantz S. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, Epo is active outside the hematopoietic system as well. In the nervous system, Epo inhibits neuronal apoptosis resulting from hypoxia or ischemia (8Masuda S. Okano M. Yamagishi K. Nagao M. Ueda M. Sasaki R. J. Biol.

Epo also regulates angiogenesis by multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration (12Anagnostou A. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl.

EpoR is expressed by several human tumor types, including breast carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, endometrial carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma (13Acs G. Acs P. Beckwith S.M. Pitts R.L.

Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, EpoR is observed at high levels by immunohistochemistry, whereas normal mammary tissue is typically EpoR negative (18Acs G. Zhang P.J. Rebbeck T.R. Acs P. Verma A. Cancer. 2002; 95: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Many tumors are also strongly Epo positive (13Acs G. Acs P. Beckwith S.M. Pitts R.L. Clements E. Wong K. Verma A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3561-3565PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in at least one study, Epo and EpoR were observed at increased levels in hypoxic regions of breast cancers (13Acs G. Acs P. Beckwith S.M. Pitts R.L. Clements E. Wong K. Verma A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3561-3565PubMed Google Scholar). Lai et al. (19Lai S.Y. Childs E.E. Xi S. Coppelli F.M. Gooding W.E. Wells A. Ferris R.L. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2005; Google Scholar) demonstrated increased Matrigel invasion by squamous cell carcinoma cells after treatment with Epo and attributed this increase to activation of the Janus kinase-2-STAT signaling pathway. In a separate study, reagents that inhibit Epo binding to EpoR, or that block Janus kinase-2 signaling, reduced growth of breast cancer cells in tumor Z-chambers implanted subcutaneously in rats (20Arcasoy M.O.

Cancer cells may be exposed to Epo in patients not only due to local synthesis but also as a result of Epo therapy, which is used to treat anemia secondary to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (21Blackwell K. Gascon P. Sigounas G. Jolliffe L. Oncologist. 2004; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Possible problems associated with Epo therapy in cancer were highlighted by a recent clinical trial in which patients with metastatic breast cancer received chemotherapy, with or without Epo. The trial was terminated early because of increased mortality in the Epo-treated patients (22Leyland-Jones B. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 459-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that Epo activates ERK in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro. Epo also promotes MCF-7 cell migration, and this effect is ERK dependent. Under hypoxic conditions, the Epo mRNA level and the basal level of ERK activation are increased. These changes are accompanied by an increase in the rate of MCF-7 cell migration, which is significantly inhibited by Epo-neutralizing antibody, soluble EpoR, and by the MEK inhibitor, PD098059. Our results demonstrate that Epo may promote breast cancer cell motility by activating ERK under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. In hypoxia, EpoR autocrine signaling assumes a dominant role and determines the basal level of MCF-7 cell migration. Antibodies and Reagents—Recombinant human Epo (287-TC), recombinant human EpoR (963ER), and Epo-neutralizing antibody 287 were obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Phospho-EpoR-specific antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK and total ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA), respectively. The MEK inhibitor, PD098059, and the Janus kinase-2 inhibitor, AG490, were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Nonspecific murine IgG was from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection Methods—Low passage MCF-7 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Sarah J. Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, with 5% CO2. The expression construct encoding dominant negative MEK1 (S217→A) (dn-MEK1) in pBABE is previously described (23Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In some experiments, MCF-7 cells (106) were co-transfected with dn-MEK1 (3.2 μg) and pEGFP (0.8 μg) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Transfection efficiencies were 20-30% as determined by fluorescence microscopy to detect green fluorescent protein (GFP). Co-transfection efficiencies were determined as previously described (24Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and were nearly 100%. Immunoblot Analysis of ERK Activation—MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) and cultured in phenol red-free, serum-free medium for 4 h before treatment with Epo (1.7 nm) for up to 120 min. In some experiments, the Janus kinase-2 inhibitor, AG490 (50 μm), or vehicle was added to cultures for 2 h prior to adding Epo for 15 min. Cell extracts were prepared in 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. To assess the effects of hypoxia on the basal level of MCF-7 cell ERK activation, cells were transferred to an incubator equilibrated at 1% O2 for 3 h or kept under normoxic conditions as a control. The protein concentration in each extract was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Equal amounts of cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% slabs, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK and total ERK. EpoR Phosphorylation—MCF-7 cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 6-cm plates and cultured in phenol red-free, serum-free medium for 4 h prior to treatment with Epo (1.7 nm) for 1 min. Cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Equal amounts of cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis, using phospho-EpoR-specific antibody. Membranes were reprobed for total ERK as a loading control. Cell Migration Assays—Migration of MCF-7 cells was studied using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers with 8-μm pores (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) as previously described (25Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The bottom surface of each membrane was coated with 20% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. Under these conditions, the major protein that adsorbs to the membrane is vitronectin (26Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells in serum-free, phenol red-free medium were treated with Epo, Epo-neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml), nonspecific murine IgG (10 μg/ml), soluble EpoR (2.5 μg/ml), or PD098059 (50 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reagents were added at the same concentration to the medium in the Transwells. The bottom chamber contained 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (105) were transferred to the top chamber of each Transwell and allowed to migrate under normoxic conditions or in an incubator equilibrated at 1% O2. After 6 h, membranes were stained with Diff-Quik (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL). Membranes were cut from each Transwell and transferred to microscope slides. Cells that migrated through the membrane to the lower surface were counted by light microscopy. To study migration of GFP-expressing cells, translucent Biocoat cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences) were used. Cells were transfected to express either GFP and dn-MEK or GFP alone. After allowing cells to migrate for 6 h, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min. The number of GFP-expressing cells that transferred to the underside of each membrane was counted by fluorescent microscopy. Taqman Real-time qPCR—MCF-7 cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 6-cm plates and cultured for 4 h in serum-free medium. The cultures were transferred to 1% O2 for 3 h or kept under normoxic conditions. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase1 (Qiagen). cDNA libraries were generated using oligo(dT) primers and the Superscript First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Epo mRNA was measured by real-time qPCR (ABI 7300; Applied BioSystems) using a one-step program: 50 °C, 2 min; 95 °C, 10 min; 95 °C, 15 s, 60 °C, 1 min for 50 cycles. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA was measured as a normalization control. The hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase probe, primers, and Taqman 2× qPCR master mix were purchased from Applied BioSystems (Foster City, CA). Epo primer and probes were previously described (11Li X. Gonias S.L. Campana W.M. Glia. 2005; 51: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Samples without cDNA were analyzed as “no template” controls. Samples were also studied without adding reverse transcriptase to confirm the absence of contamination with genomic DNA. Epo Activates ERK in Breast Cancer Cells—MCF-7 breast cancer cells typically demonstrate limited motility; however, agents that have been implicated in breast cancer progression, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), epidermal growth factor, and heregulin activate ERK in MCF-7 cells and promote MCF-7 cell migration (25Nguyen D.H.

Cancer Lett. 2004; 214: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, to begin, we examined cell signaling in response to exogenously added Epo in MCF-7 cells. Phosphorylated EpoR was increased within 1 min of exposure to Epo (1.7 nm), as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Within 2 min, ERK also was phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). Both isoforms of ERK (p42 and p44) were observed with phospho-ERK-specific antibody. The largest signal was observed at 15-60 min; however, ERK activation was transient. Phosphorylated ERK returned to baseline by 120 min. The Janus kinase-2 inhibitor, AG490, inhibited ERK phosphorylation in response to Epo in MCF-7 cells by 63 ± 12% (p < 0.05, n = 5). These results suggest that ERK activation occurs, in part, downstream of Janus kinase-2 (Fig. 1C). Equivalent results were reported previously by us in studies with primary Schwann cell cultures (11Li X. Gonias S.L. Campana W.M. Glia. 2005; 51: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Epo Promotes Cell Migration—MCF-7 cells that were treated with 1.7 nm Epo migrated across serum-coated Transwell membranes at a rate that was increased by 2.1 ± 0.1-fold (p < 0.005, n = 7) compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2A). We previously reported a similar increase in MCF-7 cell migration in response to uPA (25Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The effects of uPA on MCF-7 cell migration reflected activation of ERK and, downstream of ERK, myosin light chain kinase (24Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 25Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To test the role of ERK in Epo-stimulated MCF-7 cell migration, we treated cells with the highly specific MEK inhibitor, PD098059. In the absence of Epo, PD098059 had no effect on MCF-7 cell migration (Fig. 2A); however, PD098059 inhibited the Epo-induced increase in migration by 80 ± 10% (p < 0.005, n = 7). To confirm the role of ERK as a critical effector of Epo-stimulated MCF-7 cell migration, cells were transfected to express dn-MEK1 and GFP or GFP alone. Cell migration was studied using Biocoat inserts, which allowed selective monitoring of fluorescent cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, dn-MEK1 had no effect on the basal level of MCF-7 cell migration but inhibited the pro-migratory activity of Epo by 90 ± 18% (p < 0.05, n = 9), confirming the results obtained with PD098059. The KD for Epo binding to EpoR dimer is ∼0.1 nm in erythrocyte precursors (30Masuda S. Nagao M. Takahata K. Konishi Y. Gallyas Jr., F. Tabira T. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11208-11216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although binding affinities for Epo are different in various cell types. In concentration dependence experiments, 13 pm Epo was sufficient to significantly increase MCF-7 cell migration (Fig. 2C); however, the curve was bimodal. Epo concentrations exceeding 10 nm were less efficacious. The reason for the bimodal response is unclear; however, similar results have been observed with uPA receptor-derived chemokinetic peptides, which also stimulate MCF-7 cell migration by activating ERK (31Nguyen D.H. Webb D.J. Catling A.D. Song Q. Dhakephalkar A. Weber M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19382-19388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hypoxia Activates ERK and Promotes MCF-7 Cell Migration—When MCF-7 cells were exposed to 1.0% O2 for 3 h, Epo mRNA increased 2.4 ± 0.5-fold, as determined by real-time qPCR (p < 0.05, n = 9) (Fig. 3A). A modest but statistically significant increase in the basal level of phosphorylated ERK was also observed (p < 0.005, n = 6) (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we examined the effects of hypoxia on MCF-7 cell migration. MCF-7 cells were added to Transwell chambers, which were immediately transferred to a 1.0% O2 environment. Migration was measured 6 h later. Fig. 4 shows that cell migration was increased by 2.0 ± 0.1-fold (p < 0.001, n = 9) in the low oxygen atmosphere compared with cells that were maintained under normoxic conditions. The increase in cell migration was inhibited by >70% by PD098059 (p < 0.001, n = 11), again suggesting an essential role for ERK. The hypoxia-induced increase in endogenously produced Epo suggested that autocrine EpoR signaling may be responsible for the increase in the basal level of MCF-7 cell ERK activation and migration in 1% O2. Hypoxia also has been reported to increase autocrine signaling though other receptors capable of activating ERK and promoting migration in cancer cells, including uPA receptor and c-Met (32Lee K.H. Choi E.Y. Hyun M.S. Kim J.R. Exp. Mol. Med. 2004; 36: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). To test the role of autocrine EpoR signaling, MCF-7 cell migration was studied in 1% O2 in the presence of soluble EpoR (2.5 μg/ml). The increase in cell migration associated with hypoxia was inhibited by 53 ± 5% (p < 0.005, n = 9) (Fig. 5). A number of experiments were performed with higher concentrations of EpoR (up to 8 μg/ml); however, the degree of inhibition was not increased. Soluble EpoR had no effect on MCF-7 cell migration under normoxic conditions. Epo-neutralizing antibody also blocked the hypoxia-induced increase in MCF-7 cell migration. In this case, the degree of inhibition was 98 ± 18% (p < 0.005, n = 5). Epo-neutralizing antibody did not affect MCF-7 cell migration under normoxic conditions. Furthermore, nonspecific murine IgG, at the same concentration, did not affect cell migration under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Under normal physiologic conditions, mammalian cells in vivo are exposed to PO2 levels of 40-100 torr (6-16%), well below the standard PO2 used in cell culture (150 torr) (34Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that PO2 levels may be much lower in poorly perfused regions of cancers. The resulting hypoxia has an incompletely understood effect on cancer cell physiology; however, there are studies that correlate cancer hypoxia with poor prognosis (35Brizel D.M. Scully S.P.

Mitze M. Schaffer U. Vaupel P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4509-4515PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular level, hypoxia is associated with substantial changes in the pattern of gene expression (38Bando H. Toi M. Kitada K. Koike M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2003; 57: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Many changes occur downstream of HIF-1 (reviewed in Ref. 39Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is localized primarily in the cytoplasm, where it undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; however, in hypoxia, these processes are inhibited and HIF-1α enters the nucleus where it is available to dimerize with HIF-1β to form the active transcription factor (40Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epo is among the many gene products that are transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1 (41Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), providing one explanation for the increase in Epo mRNA observed when MCF-7 cells are exposed to 1.0% O2, as reported here and elsewhere (29Acs G. Chen M. Xu X. Acs P. Verma A. Koch C.J. Cancer Lett. 2004; 214: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Epo may be viewed as orchestrating the response to hypoxia. In addition to its effects on erythroid development, Epo has pro-angiogenic activity (42Ribatti D. Presta M. Vacca A. Ria R. Giuliani R. Dell'Era P. Nico B. Roncali L. Dammacco F. Blood. 1999; 93: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that may be disadvantageous in cancer. In this study, we focused on the signaling activity of Epo and its effects on cell migration, which represents a critical component of the cancer metastasis cascade (43Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, ERK activation is associated with increased cell migration, and this is at least partially due to activation of the downstream kinase, myosin light chain kinase (24Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase plays an important role in focal adhesion turnover in the migrating cell (44Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that uPA induces highly transient activation of ERK in MCF-7 cells, accompanied by an increase in cell motility that is sustained for over 24 h (25Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that Epo has similar effects on MCF-7 cells. Under normoxic conditions, exogenously added Epo activated ERK and promoted cell migration by a pathway that was dependent on ERK, as demonstrated in experiments with PD098059 and dn-MEK1. ERK activation by Epo was transient (<2 h); however, the response was actually sustained for a longer time than what was previously observed with uPA (25Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, the basal level of MCF-7 cell ERK activation and cell migration was increased, suggesting the establishment of autocrine signaling pathways that support these processes. To identify the responsible autocrine signaling pathway, it was necessary to consider a number of receptor systems. Hypoxia increases uPAR expression in cancer cells (32Lee K.H. Choi E.Y. Hyun M.S. Kim J.R. Exp. Mol. Med. 2004; 36: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Met tyrosine kinase is up-regulated and activated in cancer (33Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results with Epo-neutralizing antibody indicate that EpoR autocrine signaling plays a principal role in stimulating MCF-7 cell migration in hypoxia. Supporting results were obtained in experiments with soluble EpoR. The degree of inhibition of cell migration achieved with soluble EpoR was >50% but still less than that observed with Epo-neutralizing antibody. The reason for this is unclear but under investigation. From these studies, a model emerges in which multiple extracellular factors contribute to activation of common signaling pathways involved in cancer cell migration and perhaps other processes that support cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that Epo is a potentially important signal for promoting cell migration. The relative importance of Epo, compared with other factors such as uPA and EGF receptor ligands, may depend on the PO2 and thus vary within different locations of a single tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2012529328,"Mutations in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with clinical responsiveness to gefitinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Recently, we have identified many novel EGFR mutations in NSCLC tissues. In this study, we found that gefitinib could suppress the tyrosine phosphorylation of most EGFR mutants better than the wild-type receptor. However, gefitinib had quite variable growth-suppressive effects on different EGFR mutant-expressing cells. All tested EGFR mutants have high basal phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues. Upon EGF stimulation, the mutated EGFRs did not have apparently stronger phosphorylation at tyrosines 845, 992, 1,068, and 1,173 than the wild-type receptor. However, stronger phosphorylation at tyrosine 1,045 was observed in the S768I, L861Q, E709G, and G719S mutants. The E746-A750 deletion mutant was less responsive to EGF than the wild-type and other mutant receptors. The S768I, L861Q, E709G, and G719S mutants were refractory to EGF-induced ubiquitination and had more sustained tyrosine phosphorylation. E709G and G719S also lacked EGF-induced receptor downregulation. Our results indicate that, in addition to sensitivity to gefitinib, EGFR mutations also caused various changes in EGFR's regulatory mechanisms, which may contribute to the constitutive activation of EGFR mutants and oncogenesis in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2082523839,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce apoptosis in cancer cells and this effect is involved in their antitumor activity. We recently demonstrated that NSAIDs upregulate GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, in gastric mucosal cells in primary culture. In the present study, induction of ER chaperones by NSAIDs and the effect of those chaperones on NSAID-induced apoptosis were examined in human gastric carcinoma cells. Celecoxib, an NSAID, upregulated ER chaperones (GRP78 and its cochaperones ERdj3 and ERdj4) but also C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CHOP), a transcription factor involved in apoptosis. Celecoxib also upregulated GRP78 in xenograft tumors, accompanying with the suppression of tumor growth in nude mice. Celecoxib caused phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) and production of activating transcription factor (ATF)4 mRNA. Suppression of ATF4 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) partially inhibited the celecoxib-dependent upregulation of GRP78. Celecoxib increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, inhibited the upregulation of GRP78 and ATF4. These results suggest that the Ca2+-dependent activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway is involved in the upregulation of ER chaperones by celecoxib. Overexpression of GRP78 partially suppressed the apoptosis and induction of CHOP in the presence of celecoxib and this suppression was stimulated by coexpression of either ERdj3 or ERdj4. On the other hand, suppression of GRP78 expression by siRNA drastically stimulated cellular apoptosis and production of CHOP in the presence of celecoxib. These results show that upregulation of ER chaperones by celecoxib protects cancer cells from celecoxib-induced apoptosis, thus may decrease the potential antitumor activity of celecoxib."
https://openalex.org/W2037471767,"Recent work has underscored the importance of membrane trafficking events during cytokinesis. For example, targeted membrane secretion occurs at the cleavage furrow in animal cells, and proteins that regulate endocytosis also influence the process of cytokinesis. Nonetheless, the prevailing dogma is that endosomal membrane trafficking ceases during mitosis and resumes after cell division is complete. In this study, we have characterized endocytic membrane trafficking events that occur during mammalian cell cytokinesis. We have found that, although endocytosis ceases during the early stages of mitosis, it resumes during late mitosis in a temporally and spatially regulated pattern as cells progress from anaphase to cytokinesis. Using fixed and live cell imaging, we have found that, during cleavage furrow ingression, vesicles are internalized from the polar region and subsequently trafficked to the midbody area during later stages of cytokinesis. In addition, we have demonstrated that cytokinesis is inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked using a series of dominant negative mutants. In contrast to previous thought, we conclude that endocytosis resumes during the later stages of mitosis, before cytokinesis is completed. Furthermore, based on our findings, we propose that the proper regulation of endosomal membrane traffic is necessary for the successful completion of cytokinesis.

Cytokinesis completes the process of cell division and gives rise to two new daughter cells, each with a complete array of chromosomes and intracellular organelles as well as an intact plasma membrane and cytoskeleton. Throughout mitosis and cytokinesis, cytoskeletal elements are required to mediate both nuclear and cellular division events. Microtubules reorganize to form the mitotic spindle that facilitates chromosome separation, whereas actin filaments build the contractile ring that physically separates the cytoplasm of the dividing cell (1Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although cytokinesis requires the action of the cytoskeleton, membrane components, such as intracellular membrane vesicles and the plasma membrane, are not simply passive participants in this process. In fact, recent work has highlighted a role for membrane remodeling events during cytokinesis in animal cells (2Straight A.F. Field C.M. Curr.

In addition to secretory membrane traffic, it is clear that endosomal traffic is also important during cytokinesis (reviewed in Refs. 6Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. Exp.

However, recent work has shown that proteins known to regulate endocytosis in interphase cells, such as clathrin and dynamin, also influence the process of cytokinesis (18Gerald N.J. Damer C.K.

Recent studies have also shown that proteins that govern recycling endosome function (Rab11 and Nuf/FIP3) localize near the furrow and are required during cellularization in Drosophila and cytokinesis in mammalian cells (21Riggs B. Rothwell W. Mische S. Hickson G.R. Matheson J. Hays T.S. Gould G.W. Sullivan W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Wilson G.M. Fielding A.B. Simon G.C.

Furthermore, work from our laboratory has shown that the ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) 3The abbreviations used are: ARF6ADP ribosylation factor 6FITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinAPassembly protein. GTPase, a key regulator of endocytosis and endosomal recycling, plays a role during cytokinesis in mammalian cells (23Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, endocytosis and endosomal membrane trafficking events during cytokinesis have not been well studied in mammalian cells. ADP ribosylation factor 6 fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein assembly protein. In this study, we have investigated endocytic membrane trafficking during mammalian cell cytokinesis. Consistent with previous studies, we have found that endocytosis ceases during early mitosis. However, we have shown that endocytosis resumes during late mitosis in a spatially and temporally regulated manner, describing for the first time endocytic events that occur during mammalian cell cytokinesis. We have found that endocytosis occurs from the plasma membrane at the polar region of dividing cells during cleavage furrow ingression and from the midbody area during late cytokinesis. In addition, we have found that vesicles endocytosed from the polar region during cleavage furrow ingression are trafficked to the midbody region during late cytokinesis. Finally, we have shown that cytokinesis is inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked via expression of the GTPase-defective ARF6 mutant or other dominant negative proteins. The latter findings suggest that endocytosis is required for cytokinesis and that ARF6-GTP induces cytokinesis defects, at least in part by its effect on endosomal trafficking during cytokinesis.

A mammalian expression plasmid containing FLAG-tagged assembly protein (AP)180 was kindly provided by Lois Greene (National Institutes of Health), and the GFP-tagged Eps15 constructs were a gift from Alexander Benmerah. The pEYFP-Golgi plasmid (Clontech) encodes a fusion protein consisting of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and the N-terminal 81 amino acids of human β 1,4-galactosyltransferase, which targets the fusion protein to the trans-medial region of the Golgi apparatus. For plasmid transfection, HeLa cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of DNA using 12 μl of FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For immunofluorescence analysis, collected mitotic cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde during cytokinesis. To analyze mitotic cells transfected with the plasmids described above, synchronization was begun 12-18 h after transfection. Endocytosis Assays—Isolated mitotic cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in serum-free medium. At various times throughout mitosis and cytokinesis, the cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled markers for 5-7 min. Internalization was performed in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without 5 μm Draq5. Human transferrin conjugates were used at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and dextran at 1 mg/ml. After incubation with endocytic markers, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Time-lapse Microscopy—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP bearing α-tubulin ∼24-48 h before imaging. For imaging, cells were incubated in Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red (Invitrogen) and placed on the microscope stage that was prewarmed in a 32 °C room. Cells were observed using epifluorescent illumination (HQ-Endow-GFP and HQ-Cy3 filters; Chroma) on an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U; Nikon) with a 60× oil immersion lens plus a 1.5× Optivar. Images were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph 6.2r4 (Universal Imaging Corp.) and a Cascade 512B camera (Photometrics). To monitor transferrin internalization and trafficking, dividing cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml transferrin-AlexaFluor-546 (Molecular Probes) for 3 min either during cleavage furrow ingression or after the furrow was maximally ingressed. After the 3-min incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS (total time 1 min) and incubated in serum-free medium for the remainder of the imaging session. To visualize both transferrin and tubulin-GFP, images were acquired sequentially in each fluorescent channel every 30-60 s. Endocytosis Resumes during Cytokinesis—To examine endosomal traffic during cytokinesis, we first monitored the endocytic uptake of extracellular ligands in mitotic HeLa cells. For these experiments, we collected cells arrested at G2/M, released them into mitosis, and performed short incubations with endocytic markers throughout mitotic progression. To examine receptor-mediated endocytosis, we used FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated human transferrin. After a 7-min incubation with transferrin, the cells were washed, fixed, and analyzed using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Consistent with the current understanding that endocytosis ceases during mitosis, we found that mitotic cells at prometaphase and metaphase exhibited no detectable ligand internalization (data not shown). However, as cells progressed through anaphase and telophase, we observed substantial internalization of transferrin (Fig. 1A). We found that, as cells progressed from anaphase to cytokinesis, endocytosis resumed in a distinct manner. During anaphase and early telophase, cells displayed prominent pools of internalized transferrin near the mitotic spindle poles or polar region (Fig. 1A, top row). In these cells, internalized transferrin was seen near the plasma membrane at the polar region and in juxtanuclear pools near the mitotic spindle poles, but there was little to no transferrin label at the cleavage furrow or equatorial region. However, cells at late telophase and cytokinesis (in which the furrow was fully ingressed) displayed transferrin labeling in both the polar and equatorial or midbody regions (Fig. 1A, bottom row). These results suggest that receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs first from the plasma membrane near the polar region and then from the plasma membrane at the equatorial region as mitotic cells progress from anaphase to cytokinesis. To further confirm that receptor-mediated endocytosis resumes predominantly from the polar region of dividing cells during the early stages of cleavage furrow ingression, we incubated dividing cells with FITC-transferrin very briefly (2 min) and then washed and fixed them. As expected, we found that transferrin labeling was observed prominently on the polar region of the plasma membrane of anaphase and early telophase cells (Fig. 1B, top row), whereas there is strong labeling at the ingressed cleavage furrow in cells at late telophase/cytokinesis (Fig. 1B, bottom row). Finally, we assessed the localization of the transferrin receptor in dividing cells. Consistent with our transferrin internalization uptake results, we found that transferrin receptor was localized predominantly at the polar region of late anaphase cells (Fig. 1C, top row) but was present at both the polar and equatorial regions in late telophase cells (Fig. 1C, bottom row). We also analyzed transferrin uptake during cytokinesis in the U-2OS cell line and found an identical pattern of endocytosis during cleavage furrow ingression and cytokinesis (supplemental Fig. 1). This finding suggests that endocytosis resumes during cytokinesis in a similar way in mammalian cells in general. During cytokinesis, Golgi fragments also coalesce in two juxtanuclear pools at the polar and equatorial regions of dividing cells (25Dunster K. Toh B.H. Sentry J.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we used pEYFP-Golgi to label the Golgi and determined that the Golgi pools were distinct from the transferrin-positive compartments during cytokinesis (supplemental Fig. 2). Next, we examined the uptake of a fluid phase marker, dextran conjugated to AlexaFluor-594, during mitosis. Similar to our transferrin results, we found that early mitotic cells exhibited no dextran uptake, whereas cells at telophase and cytokinesis displayed substantial dextran internalization (Fig. 1D). In anaphase cells, the amount of dextran internalization was less significant and more variable than what we observed for transferrin uptake. Nonetheless, the general pattern of uptake was the same for both ligands. When late mitotic cells were incubated with dextran and transferrin simultaneously, we observed a similar pattern of internalization for both ligands as well as partially overlapping cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 1E). In sum, these results demonstrate that endocytosis of both receptor-mediated and fluid phase markers resumes during cytokinesis in a spatially and temporally regulated manner. Endocytosed Vesicles Are Trafficked to the Midbody Region—Our results revealed a strong labeling of endocytic markers at the cleavage furrow during late telophase and cytokinesis. However, we questioned whether or not the label at the cleavage furrow resulted exclusively from active endocytosis at the ingressed cleavage furrow or from the traffic of endocytosed vesicles from the polar region to the equatorial region. To answer this question, we “pulsed” mitotic cells with transferrin for 5 min during early cleavage furrow ingression (85-90 min after mitotic entry) and then fixed them after a 30-min “chase” (120 min after mitotic entry). Cells fixed immediately after the 5-min uptake were predominantly in anaphase and early telophase. As shown in Fig. 2A, these cells contained internalized transferrin near the spindle poles. However, when these cells were incubated for an additional 30 min before fixation, most of them had progressed to late telophase and cytokinesis and displayed transferrin labeling at both the spindle poles and the cleavage furrow (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that transferrin internalized from the polar region during anaphase and telophase is trafficked to the midbody region during late telophase and cytokinesis. To confirm the traffic of endocytosed vesicles from the polar region to the ingressed cleavage furrow, we performed live cell imaging analysis using cells transiently transfected with tubulin-GFP. For these experiments, cells undergoing cleavage furrow ingression were incubated with AlexaFluor-546-transferrin for 3 min and then the ligand was washed out. Pictures of the dividing cells were captured before, during, and after transferrin addition. In these experiments, we found that initially transferrin was internalized prominently from the plasma membrane at the periphery of the dividing cell and trafficked to the mitotic spindle pole region. Subsequently, after cleavage furrow ingression was complete, there was further traffic of transferrin-positive vesicles to the cleavage furrow, flanking each side of the midbody. Images from representative time-lapse videos (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4), showing both transferrin labeling and tubulin-GFP, are shown in Fig. 3A. We also determined whether or not there was additional endocytosis at the midbody during late cytokinesis. For this experiment, we pulsed mitotic cells with Texas Red-transferrin during early anaphase and telophase as described above, but before fixation at 120 min, we incubated the cells with a second ligand, FITC-transferrin, for 5 min. We reasoned that, if there is new endocytosis at the ingressed cleavage furrow, we would see internalized FITC-transferrin at the midbody in addition to Texas Red-transferrin that was internalized during anaphase and telophase and trafficked to the midbody. As shown in Fig. 2C, cells at late telophase displayed FITC-transferrin at the midbody as well as Texas Red-transferrin that was internalized earlier during anaphase and telophase. This result suggests that, in addition to the traffic of endocytosed vesicles from the polar region of dividing cells to the cleavage furrow, new endocytosis occurs at the ingressed cleavage furrow as well. Furthermore, we found that in the late telophase cells, the Texas Red-transferrin label (added during anaphase and early telophase) was stronger at the spindle poles than at the furrow, whereas the FITC-transferrin label (added after cleavage furrow ingression) was more intense near the ingressed furrow (Fig. 2C), supporting our contention that endocytosis resumes first at the polar region during cleavage furrow ingression and then at the midbody region during late cytokinesis. To further confirm that endocytosis occurs in the midbody region after cleavage furrow ingression, we performed live cell imaging analysis using cells transiently transfected with tubulin-GFP. Cells at late cytokinesis (that had already undergone cleavage furrow ingression) were incubated with AlexaFluor-546-transferrin for 3 min and then the ligand was washed out. Pictures of the dividing cells were captured before, during, and after transferrin addition and still images from representative time-lapse videos (supplemental Figs. 5 and 6) are shown in Fig. 3B. In these experiments, we found that internalized transferrin was present in the midbody region immediately after transferrin washout, suggesting that endocytosis occurs at the ingressed cleavage furrow. In addition, we found that several minutes after transferrin washout, there was a further concentration of the internalized transferrin label on either side of the forming midbody. Together, these results indicate that endocytosis occurs in the region of the ingressed furrow and that, even at this late stage of cytokinesis, endosomal vesicles are trafficked at the midbody area in a distinct manner. Inhibition of Receptor-mediated Endocytosis Induces Cytokinesis Defects—ARF6 is a small GTPase that regulates endocytosis and endosomal recycling as well as actin rearrangements during interphase (26D'Souza-Schorey C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21050-21057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that endogenous ARF6 is transiently activated during cytokinesis. In addition, we found that overexpression of a GTP hydrolysis-defective mutant, ARF6(Q67L), in mitotic cells led to a variety of cytokinesis defects without affecting actin polymerization at the cleavage furrow (23Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27210-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to investigate a role for ARF6 in the regulation of endocytic traffic during cytokinesis. For these experiments, we monitored the receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin during cytokinesis in cells transfected with ARF6(Q67L)-pIRES-EGFP. As shown in Fig. 4, cells transfected with ARF6(Q67L) displayed little to no transferrin internalization during cleavage furrow ingression and cytokinesis. When compared with neighboring non-transfected cells, ARF6(Q67L)-transfected cells consistently exhibited dramatically reduced transferrin labeling throughout anaphase to cytokinesis (Fig. 4). Using laser confocal sectioning, we found few to no transferrin-positive vesicles throughout the Z-axis of dividing ARF6(Q67L)-transfected cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Next, we examined the endocytosis of dextran during cytokinesis in ARF6(Q67L)-expressing cells. In general, dividing ARF6(Q67L) cells displayed a low amount of dextran uptake during cytokinesis (data not shown), but the effect was more variable and less conclusive than our findings with transferrin. In sum, our results indicate that ARF6(Q67L) overexpression profoundly inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis during cytokinesis. Our results are consistent with recent reports that ARF6-GTP inhibits transferrin internalization during interphase (36Paleotti O. Macia E. Luton F. Klein S. Partisani M. Chardin P. Kirchhausen T. Franco M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21661-21666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Tanabe K. Torii T. Natsume W. Braesch-Andersen S. Watanabe T. Satake M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ARF6(Q67L) induces cytokinesis defects, at least in part, via an inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis. To further investigate the importance of endocytosis during cytokinesis, we sought to examine how an inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis would affect the process of cytokinesis. Eps15 is an accessory protein that is found in clathrin-coated pits, binds AP-2, and is essential for early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Expression of a dominant negative form called Eps15-EH29 blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inhibiting coated pit formation (38Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To this end, we transfected cells with GFP-tagged Eps15-EH29 and assessed its impact on cytokinesis. We found that mitotic cells expressing Eps15-EH29 progressed through mitosis at the same pace as non-transfected cells observed in the same experiment (data not shown). However, along with a block in transferrin internalization, we found that, on average, over 95% of mitotic cells expressing Eps15-EH29 exhibited cytokinesis defects, such as excessive cell blebbing throughout the cleavage furrow region and binucleated cell formation (Fig. 5, A and C). It is possible that the cell blebbing phenotype we observed may not be a specific cytokinesis defect; however, we only observed this type of aberrant cell morphology during cytokinesis and not during interphase and earlier mitotic stages. Transfection with the control construct, GFP-tagged Eps15DIIIΔ2, had no effect on mitotic progression or cytokinesis (data not shown). Next, we wanted to confirm the effect of inhibiting endocytosis on cytokinesis by using a different endocytic protein. Assembly proteins bind clathrin and stimulate the formation of clathrin triskelions during coated pit formation. Overexpression of APs, such as the neuronal-specific proteins AP180 and auxilin, has been shown to markedly inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis by mislocalizing clathrin away from nascent pits (40Zhao X. Greener T. Al-Hasani H. Cushman S.W. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 353-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this experiment, we transfected cells with FLAG-tagged AP180 and monitored their progression through mitosis. We found that mitotic cells expressing AP180 progressed through mitosis at the same pace as non-transfected cells observed in the same experiment (data not shown). However, similar to our findings with Eps15-EH29-expressing cells, we found significant cytokinesis defects in AP180-transfected cells. Along with a block in transferrin internalization, we found that, on average, over 85% of mitotic cells expressing AP180 exhibited cytokinesis defects, such as excessive cell blebbing throughout the cleavage furrow region and binucleated cell formation (Fig. 5, B and C). We have classified the cell division defects in Eps15-EH29- and AP180-transfected cells as cytokinesis defects, because we did not notice any defective phenotypes in transfected cells during the earlier stages of mitosis. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that problems occur during late mitotic stages just prior to cytokinesis that prevent the completion of cytokinesis in Eps15-EH29- and AP180-transfected cells. It is important to note that, in some experiments with mitotic Eps15-EH29- and AP180-transfected cells, we observed chromosome segregation failures in which all the genetic material segregated to one daughter cell. This was a rare phenotype (<2% of the cells) that we only observed in some repetitions of the mitotic experiments. Because AP180 can bind to clathrin and Eps15 to AP-2 (a clathrin-binding protein), this chromosome segregation failure phenotype may be due to a mislocalization of clathrin away from the mitotic spindle poles, as clathrin has recently been shown to have a role in maintaining the integrity of the mitotic spindle (41Royle S.J. Bright N.A. Lagnado L. Nature. 2005; 434: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To confirm that each method of inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis effectively blocked transferrin uptake, we monitored the inhibition of transferrin uptake (10-min incubation) in interphase cells overexpressing AP180, Eps15-EH29, or ARF6(Q67L). We found that each method resulted in equivalent inhibition of transferrin uptake as observed by confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. 7). Taken together, our results support the notion that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for the successful completion of cytokinesis and point toward an essential role for endocytosis during the process of cytokinesis. Cytokinesis relies upon the elegant regulation of both cytoskeletal and membrane elements. Although membrane fusion events have been shown to accompany the successful completion of cytokinesis, the involvement of new membrane internalization, or endocytosis, has not been thoroughly examined. In the past, it was thought that endocytosis and endosomal trafficking does not occur during mitosis but instead resumes during the G1 phase (17Berlin R.D. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 660-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42Sager P.R. Brown P.A. Berlin R.D.

Biol. 2001; 11: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous work asserts that fluid phase endocytosis begins after cells exit cytokinesis, especially because endocytic marker internalization is not observed in early or late mitotic cells (17Berlin R.D. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 660-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, other studies have shown that the mitotic phosphorylation of epsin and Eps15 by CDK1 prevents their efficient interaction with α-adaptin, providing one mechanism by which clathrin-dependent endocytosis is specifically inhibited during mitosis (45Chen H. Slepnev V.I. Di Fiore P.P. Camilli De P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our current studies revealed that, although endocytosis ceases during early mitosis, it resumes during late mitotic stages and occurs throughout the process of cytokinesis. Our findings support recent reports demonstrating the requirement for endocytic proteins during cytokinesis and the localization of endocytic markers at the cleavage furrow in zebrafish eggs (18Gerald N.J. Damer C.K. O'Halloran T.J. De Lozanne A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 48: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Thompson H.M. Skop A.R. Euteneuer U. Meyer B.J. McNiven M.A. Curr.

Altogether, these results point toward an important role for endocytosis and endosomal trafficking during the process of cytokinesis. In this study, we showed that, during late mitosis, endocytosis begins again in a distinct manner, first from the polar region of a dividing cell as cleavage furrow ingression commences and then from the equatorial region after furrow ingression is complete (Fig. 6). We propose that there are at least two different ways in which endocytosis and endosomal traffic may participate in the process of cytokinesis. First, we find that vesicles endocytosed from the polar region during cleavage furrow ingression are trafficked to the midbody region during late cytokinesis. The traffic of endocytosed vesicles and their cargo to the cleavage furrow may represent a mechanism by which membrane or protein components needed for cytokinesis can be moved to the cleavage furrow. Second, we find that endocytosis occurs at the ingressed cleavage furrow, perhaps providing a means for terminating cytokinesis through the internalization of cytokinesis components that are no longer needed. In addition, endocytosis at the ingressed cleavage furrow may help to physically seal off daughter cell membranes, facilitating the final completion of cytokinesis. It is also likely that endocytosis at the midbody helps to balance membrane delivery and retrieval and thereby maintain proper plasma membrane surface area. Previously we have shown that the ARF6 GTPase, which regulates endosomal membrane traffic in interphase cells, plays a role during mitosis and is essential for the proper completion of cytokinesis. We have demonstrated that endogenous ARF6 localizes near the cleavage furrow and is transiently activated during cytokinesis. Although a dominant negative ARF6 mutant, ARF6(T27N), did not impact mitotic progression, we have found that overexpression of a GTPase defective ARF6 mutant, ARF6(Q67L), induced cytokinesis defects (23Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27210-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that ARF6(T27N) is likely not dominant negative for ARF6 function during cytokinesis, as depletion of endogenous ARF6 levels does block the completion of cytokinesis (47Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that ARF6(Q67L) also inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis during cytokinesis in mammalian cells. This finding is consistent with recent reports that describe direct roles for ARF6 during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, i.e. its interaction with SMAP1, an ARF6-GAP that is essential for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and its recruitment of AP-2 to membranes (36Paleotti O.

Haucke K.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis via overexpression of dominant negative Eps15 or AP180 also leads to pronounced cytokinesis defects. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis, mediated in part by ARF6, is essential during cytokinesis. Further work in this area will help to elucidate the details by which ARF6 regulates endosomal traffic during cytokinesis and how these membrane trafficking events contribute to the successful completion of cytokinesis.

The original hypothesis was that analogue induction of the rate-limiting spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) provided substrate for the peroxisomal acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAO), resulting in a decrease in polyamine pools through catabolism, oxidation, and excretion of acetylated polyamines and the production of toxic aldehydes and H2O2. However, the recent discovery of the inducible spermine oxidase SMO(PAOh1) suggested the possibility that the original hypothesis may be incomplete. To examine the role of the catabolic enzymes in the response of breast cancer cells to the polyamine analogue N1,N1-bis(ethyl)norspermine (BENSpm), a stable knockdown small interfering RNA strategy was used. BENSpm differentially induced SSAT and SMO(PAOh1) mRNA and activity in several breast cancer cell lines, whereas no N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase PAO mRNA or activity was detected. BENSpm treatment inhibited cell growth, decreased intracellular polyamine levels, and decreased ornithine decarboxylase activity in all cell lines examined. The stable knockdown of either SSAT or SMO(PAOh1) reduced the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to BENSpm, whereas double knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells were almost entirely resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of the analogue. Furthermore, the H2O2 produced through BENSpm-induced polyamine catabolism was found to be derived exclusively from SMO(PAOh1) activity and not through PAO activity on acetylated polyamines. These data suggested that SSAT and SMO(PAOh1) activities are the major mediators of the cellular response of breast tumor cells to BENSpm and that PAO plays little or no role in this response.

Consequently, the polyamine metabolic pathway has become an attractive target for the development of antineoplastic agents (5Davidson N.E. Mank A.R. Prestigiacomo L.J. Bergeron R.J. Casero Jr., R.A.

Although early work focused on developing drugs that inhibited polyamine biosynthesis, more recent attention has been given to polyamine analogues that, in addition to down-regulating biosynthesis, also upregulate polyamine catabolism (9Gabrielson E.W.

Until recently, mammalian intracellular polyamine catabolism was considered to be a consequence of two enzymes, the rate-limiting and inducible cytosolic spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) 3The abbreviations used are: SSATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferaseSMO(PAOh1)spermine oxidaseBENSpmN1,N11-bis(ethyl)norspermineODCornithine decarboxylaseAdoMetDCS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylasePAON1-acetylpolyamine oxidaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterCM-H2DCFDA5-(and -6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateAT3-amino-1,2,4-triazoleMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. 3The abbreviations used are: SSATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferaseSMO(PAOh1)spermine oxidaseBENSpmN1,N11-bis(ethyl)norspermineODCornithine decarboxylaseAdoMetDCS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylasePAON1-acetylpolyamine oxidaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterCM-H2DCFDA5-(and -6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateAT3-amino-1,2,4-triazoleMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and a relatively constitutively expressed, peroxisomal N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAO) (1Huang Y. Pledgie A. Casero Jr., R.A. Davidson N.E. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The products of SSAT/PAO activities on spermine and spermidine are the reactive oxygen species, H2O2, spermidine, and putrescine, respectively (depending on the starting substrate), and 3-acetoaminopropanol. The activity of the SSAT/PAO pathway has been linked previously with the cytotoxic response of several tumor types to specific polyamine analogues (10Casero R.A. Wang Y. Stewart T.M. Devereux W. Hacker A. Smith R. Woster P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 361-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15McCloskey D.E. Yang J. Woster P.M. Davidson N.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Clin.

However, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that an additional enzyme exists in the mammalian polyamine catabolic pathway, an inducible spermine oxidase (SMO/PAOh1) (18Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SMO(PAOh1) is a cytosolic protein that is selectively active on spermine producing H2O2, spermidine, and the aldehyde 3-aminopropanol (20Wang Y. Murray-Stewart T. Devereux W. Hacker A. Frydman B.

Zelli M. Federico R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More importantly, the expression of this enzyme is induced by some of the same agents that induce SSAT, suggesting that induction of both of the polyamine catabolic pathways can lead to the production of H2O2 (22Devereux W. Wang Y. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Smith R. Frydman B. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Ward T.D. Woster P.M. Casero R.A. Cancer Chemother.

Because the production of H2O2 through polyamine catabolism has been implicated in the cytotoxic response of several tumor types to multiple polyamine analogues, the purpose of this study was to determine the origin of H2O2 in response to cellular exposure to the antitumor polyamine analogue, N1,N11-bis(ethyl)norspermine (BENSpm) (an agent that has been evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials), and thereby to determine the role of each of the polyamine catabolic enzymes in the BENSpm response (23Hahm H.A.

Bender J.F. Casero Jr., R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5922-5928PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies implicating PAO in H2O2 production in response to analogue exposure were performed with the polyamine oxidase inhibitor, MDL72527, thought to be specific for PAO. With the recognition that MDL72527 is also a potent inhibitor of SMO(PAO1), the results of earlier studies may require reexamination (25Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2004; 26: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Seiler N. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2004; 26: 317-319PubMed Google Scholar, 27Seiler N. Duranton B. Raul F. Prog. Drug Res. 2002; 59: 1-40PubMed Google Scholar). Also, previous attempts to examine directly the role of SSAT in cellular response through the use of siRNA strategies were limited by a transient transfection approach, thus making it difficult to assess long term effects of extended SSAT knockdown in response to analogue treatment (28Chen Y. Kramer D.L. Jell J. Vujcic S. Porter C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To overcome the limitations of transient knockdown, a stable transfection strategy was used to constitutively express siRNAs targeting the rate-limiting steps of polyamine catabolism, SSAT and SMO(PAOh1), either alone or in combination. This study represents the first use of stably expressed siRNAs directed against multiple key polyamine metabolic enzymes and demonstrates that SSAT and SMO(PAOh1) induction contribute significantly to the antiproliferative effects of BENSpm in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, the experimental results confirm that SMO(PAOh1) enzyme activity, not PAO enzyme activity, is the source of cytotoxic H2O2 produced followed exposure to BENSpm in specific breast cancer lines, whereas SSAT induction results in a decrease in intracellular polyamine levels through the acetylation of polyamines that are then exported from the cell. With a better understanding of the relative contribution made by each of the independent polyamine catabolic pathways to the cytotoxic activity of polyamine analogues, it is hoped that more selective and effective agents can be designed for use against breast cancer. Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Reagents—The acquisition and maintenance of the breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, Hs578t, MCF-7, and T47D, have been described previously (29Hahm H.A. Dunn V.R. Butash K.A. Devereux W.L. Woster P.M. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar). BENSpm and MDL72527 were synthesized as described previously (14Bergeron R.J. Neims A.H. McManis J.S. Hawthorne T.R. Vinson J.R. Bortell R. Ingeno M.J. J. Med.

Chem. 1985; 28: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 5-(and -6)-Chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), mixed isoforms, was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Catalase and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) were purchased from Sigma. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Real Time PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured cell lines using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). Conventional PCR was performed using the cDNA as a template with the following primers: SSAT forward, 5′-ATCTAAGCCAGGTTGCAATGA, and SSAT reverse, 5′-GCACTCCTCACTCCTCTGTTG; SMO(PAOh1) forward, 5′-CGCAGACTTACTTCCCCGGC, and SMO(PAOh1) reverse, 5′-CGCTCAATTCCTCAACCACG; SMO(PAOh1) isoform 1 forward, 5′-CGACCACAATCACGACACTG, and SMO(PAOh1) and isoform 1 reverse, 5′-GCCGAGGGCAAGATTCGCCG; SMO(PAOh1) isoform 2 forward, 5′-GCCCCGGGGTGTGCTAAAGAG, and SMO(PAOh1) and isoform 2, reverse 5′-CGGAAAACAGCACCTGCATGG; SMO(PAOh1) isoform 3 forward, 5′-CGCAGACTTACTTCCCCGGCTCAG, and SMO(PAOh1) isoform 3 reverse, 5′-CTGCATGGGCTCGTTGTATAAATC; SMO-(PAOh1) isoform 4 forward, 5′-CCAGGCCTCAGCCCGCCCCAG, and SMO(PAOh1) isoform 4 reverse, 5′-GCTGTTCTGGGAACTTGGAAGAG; PAO forward, 5′-CCTACAGTTTGTGTGGGAGGA, and PAO reverse, 5′-ATGAATAGGAGCCACGGAAGT; actin forward, 5′-ACCATGGATGATGATGATATCGC and actin reverse, 5′-ACATGGCTGGGGTCTGAAG. PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For real time PCR, cDNA was amplified by using SYBR green (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR data were acquired and analyzed using Sequence Detector version 1.7 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were normalized to the GAPDH house-keeping gene. Analysis of Intracellular Polyamine Levels and Enzyme Activities—The polyamine content of treated and untreated cells was determined by using the precolumn dansylation, reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography method as described previously using 1, 7-diaminoheptane as the internal standard (31Kabra P.M. Lee H.K. Lubich W.P. Marton L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 380: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). SSAT and ODC activities were determined by using 14C-labeled substrates and scintillation counting of end products produced as described previously (12Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activities of SMO(PAOh1) and PAO in cell lysates were assayed as described previously by using 250 μm spermine (Sigma) or N1-acetylspermine (Sigma), respectively, as the substrate (18Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Cell Growth and MTT Assays—Cells were plated at a cell density of 5,000 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. After attachment overnight, the medium was replaced, and cells were incubated with or without 10 μm BENSpm for up to 96 h. Every 24 h, cells were detached by trypsinization and counted using a Coulter particle counter. MTT assays were performed as described previously (29Hahm H.A. Dunn V.R. Butash K.A. Devereux W.L. Woster P.M. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following attachment overnight, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of BENSpm in the presence or absence of 25 μm MDL72527 for 96 h. All of the experiments were plated in quadruplicate and were performed three times. The results from the MTT assays were validated by direct comparison to a conventional cell growth assay. Flow Cytometry—MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were plated at a cell density of 100,000 cells in 10-cm culture dishes and were treated with 10 μm BENSpm for up to 96 h. Adherent and nonadherent cells were collected, sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4.44% formaldehyde (Sigma), and stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). BD-LSR (BD Biosciences) was used to perform FACS, and the cell cycle was analyzed using Cell-Quest software (BD Biosciences). RNA Interference and Transfections—The SMO(PAOh1) stable siRNA clones were generated by annealing and inserting the following oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) into the pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo expression vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions: SMO(PAOh1) forward, 5′-GAT CCG CAC TTC TTG AGC AGG GTT TTC AAG AGA AAC CCT GCT CAA GAA GTG CTT TTT TGG AAA, and SMO(PAOh1) reverse, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA GCA CTT CTT GAG CAG GGT TTC TCT TGA AAA CCC TGC TCA AGA AGT GCG. The following oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) targeting the SSAT gene were annealed to form the hairpin siRNA template insert that was then ligated into the pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro expression vector (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions: SSAT forward, 5′-GAT CCG TGA TCC TCC CAC CTC AGC TTC AAG AGA GCT GAG GTG GGA GGA TCA CTT TTT TGG AAA, and SSAT reverse, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA GTG ATC CTC CCA CCT CAG CTC TCT TGA AGC TGA GGT GGG AGG ATC ACG. Lipofectamine was used to transfect 4 μg of the targeting plasmid or provided nonsense control plasmid (Ambion) into MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Single clones representing MDA-MB-231 nonsense vector control, MDA-MB-231 ΔSMO(PAOh1) (SMO(PAOh1) stably knocked down alone), MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT (SSAT stably knocked down), MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT/ΔSMO(PAOh1) (both SMO(PAOh1) and SSAT stably knocked down), MCF-7 nonsense vector control, MCF-7 ΔSMO(PAOh1) (SMO(PAOh1) stably knocked down), MCF-7 ΔSSAT (SSAT stably knocked down), and MCF-7 ΔSSAT/ΔSMO(PAOh1) (both SMO(PAOh1) and SSAT stably knocked down) were chosen. Clones were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech), 1% glutamine (Mediatech), and 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) or 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science) as required. All data presented here are the average of multiple, independent experiments performed using at least three clones for each cell type. Measurement of H2O2—Cells were treated for 24 h with 10 μm BENSpm with or without co-treatment of 25 μm MDL72527 or 500 units/ml catalase, and intracellular H2O2 was detected by FACS. Following treatment, adherent cells were harvested with trypsin and were combined with nonadherent cells. Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Mediatech), and 1 × 106 cells were treated with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C. Ten thousand cells were then analyzed by FACS on a BD-LSR (BD Biosciences) as reported previously (33Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 75: 241-251Google Scholar). Statistical Methods—For cell growth assays, the longitudinal data were analyzed using a mixed effects model that accounts for the correlation among repeated measurements (Fig. 2). An exchangeable covariance structure was assumed in the mixed effects model, and cell growth data were fit with a quadratic growth curve model (Fig. 2). Analysis of variance was used to examine the changes in SSAT and SMO(PAOh1) mRNA and activity in BENSpm-treated cell lines (Figs. 3 and 4). Bonferroni adjustment was applied for multiple comparisons. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the difference in the sensitivity to BENSpm among the treated cell lines while controlling for treatment concentration effect (Fig. 5). Pairwise least square means were compared when the overall difference among cell lines was observed. p values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons in the analysis of this experiment (Fig. 5). A p value of ≤0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference between compared groups. All analyses were conducted with SAS System software (version 9.1).FIGURE 3siRNA directed against SMO(PAOh1) and SSAT specifically and efficiently reduces respective SSAT and SMO(PAOh1) mRNA and activity induction by BENSpm. Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells (black bars) and MCF-7 cells (white bars) were treated with 10 μm BENSpm for 24 h. Real time PCR for SSAT mRNA (A) and real time PCR for SMO(PAOh1) mRNA (C) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”; all values were normalized to the GAPDH housekeeping gene. Values are the means ± S.D. of four independent experiments performed in duplicate. B, SSAT enzyme activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, SMO(PAOh1) enzyme activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 250 μm spermine as the substrate. Enzyme activity values are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Analysis of variance demonstrated that the induction of SSAT mRNA and activity with BENSpm in MDA-MB-231 vector and MDA-MB-231 ΔSMO(PAOh1) cells was significantly different from BENSpm-treated MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT cells and MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT/ΔSMO(PAOh1) cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). BENSpm-induced SSAT mRNA and activity in MCF-7 vector and MCF-7 ΔSMO(PAOh1) cells were significantly different from BENSpm-treated MCF-7 ΔSSAT and MCF-7 ΔSSAT/ΔSMO(PAOh1) cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). BENSpm-treated MDA-MB-231 vector and MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT cells had a similar induction of SMO(PAOh1) mRNA and activity (p =0.069 and p = 0.114, respectively) that was significantly different from BENSpm-treated MDA-MB-231 ΔSMO(PAOh1) and MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT/ΔSMO(PAOh1) cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Effects of SMO(PAOh1) and SSAT knockdown on the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to BENSpm. Transfected MDA-MB-231 (A) and transfected MCF-7 (B) cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (0.1–25 μm) of BENSpm for 96 h. The effect on cell growth was assayed using the MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that for BENSpm ≥5 μm, MDA-MB-231 ΔSMO(PAOh1) and MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT cells were statistically less sensitive to BENSpm than MDA-MB-231 vector cells (p = 0.020 and p =0.005, respectively). MDA-MB-231 ΔSSAT/ΔSMO(PAOh1) cells were statistically less sensitive to BENSpm than either of the single knockdowns (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the growth of cells between any of the MCF-7 cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Effects of BENSpm-induced fluorescence in MDA-MB-231 cells detected by CM-H2DCFDA.

Following treatment with 10 μm BENSpm for 24 h, real time PCR was used to examine changes in SSAT, PAO, and SMO(PAOh1) mRNA (Fig. 1A). SSAT mRNA was induced in all four cell lines following BENSpm exposure, although induction of SMO(PAOh1) mRNA was only seen in MDA-MB-231 and HS578t cells; no PAO mRNA induction was detected in any cell line. Changes in enzyme activity for each of the catabolic enzymes were then examined in each cell line following the same treatment. SSAT enzyme activity was induced in each cell line with the greatest induction observed in BENSpm-treated MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t cells (Fig. 1B). The induction of SMO(PAOh1) enzyme activity closely correlated with the induction of mRNA with induction only seen in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t cells (Fig. 1C), although no induction of PAO enzyme activity was detected in any of the breast cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 1D). No significant expression or induction of SMO(PAOh1) or SSAT was seen in an immortalized nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, suggestive of a behavior similar to MCF-7 cells (data not shown). BENSpm Inhibits Cell Growth, Reduces Intracellular Polyamine Levels, and Reduces ODC Enzyme Activity in Several Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines—The effect of BENSpm on breast cancer cell growth was examined by treating MDA-MB-231, Hs578t, MCF-7, and T47D cells with 10 μm BENSpm for 96 h. Treatment of each cell line with 10 μm BENSpm for ≥48 h significantly inhibited cell growth (Fig. 2). Cell growth in each cell line was inhibited similarly by BENSpm through 96 h of exposure. FACS analysis showed no difference in cell cycle staging in BENSpm treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells; both cell lines arrested in G1 phase after 48 h of BENSpm treatment and remained in a G1 block through 96 h (data not shown). All four breast cancer cell lines treated with 10 μm BENSpm for 24 h exhibited a similar decrease of ∼50% in the levels of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine upon BENSpm treatment with a similar level of BENSpm accumulation in each cell line (TABLE ONE).

https://openalex.org/W1981589849,"Redox modification of thiol/disulfide interchange in proteins by selenium could lead to protein unfolding. When this occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a process known as unfolded protein response (UPR) is orchestrated for survival through activation of PERK-eIF2alpha (PERK: double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase; eIF2alpha: eucaryotic initiation factor 2alpha), ATFalpha (ATFalpha: activating transcription factor 6) and inositol requiring 1 (IRE1)-x-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) signalings. All three UPR transducer pathways were upregulated very rapidly when PC-3 cells were exposed to selenium. These changes were accompanied by increased expression of UPR target genes, including immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein/glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-homologous protein/growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene (CHOP/GADD153). Induction of BiP/GRP78, an ER-resident chaperone, is part of the damage control mechanism, while CHOP/GADD153 is a transcription factor associated with growth arrest and apoptosis in the event of prolonged ER stress. Knocking down BiP/GRP78 induction by small interference RNA produced a differential response of the three transducers to selenium, suggesting that the signaling intensity of each transducer could be fine-tuned depending on BiP/GRP78 availability. In the presence of selenium, CHOP/GADD153 expression was raised even higher by BiP/GRP78 knockdown. Under this condition, the selenium effect on wild-type p53-activated fragment p21 (p21(WAF)), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2 was also magnified in a manner consistent with enhanced cell growth arrest. Additional experiments with CHOP/GADD153 siRNA knockdown strongly suggested that CHOP/GADD153 may play a positive role in upregulating the expression of p21(WAF) in a p53-independent manner (PC-3 cells are p53 null). Collectively, the above findings support the idea that UPR could be an important mechanism in mediating the anticancer activity of selenium."
https://openalex.org/W2014866717,"The IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/Akt pathways regulate various cellular functions, especially cell survival. These two pathways are often activated in many tumors and are thought to be associated with tumor progression. However, the cross-talk between them remains unclear. Here we show that PDK1 can activate IKK/NF-κB signaling in addition to Akt signaling to promote cell survival. Screening kinases that could modulate NF-κB activity revealed that expression of an upstream Akt kinase PDK1 up-regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity. We found that PDK1 directly phosphorylates IKKβ at the Ser181 residue in the activation loop, leading to NF-κB nuclear translocation and NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene expression. IKKα is not required for PDK1-mediated NF-κB activation because NF-κB activation was observed in IKKα-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells as in wild type MEF cells. Akt, which was previously reported to activate IKKα, did not participate in the PDK1-dependent IKKβ or NF-κB activation. The siRNA-mediated PDK1 gene silencing attenuated NF-κB activity and increased TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of constitutively active IKKβ overcame the PDK1 siRNA-mediated susceptibility to TRAIL. These results indicate that PDK1 is a critical regulator of cell survival by modulating the IKK/NF-κB pathway in addition to the Akt pathway.

It has been well established that IKK activation requires phosphorylation of conserved two serine residues in the activation loops (Ser176 and Ser180 in IKKα and Ser177 and Ser181 in IKKβ) (8Mercurio F.

Members of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinases 1-3, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), NF-κB-activating kinase, and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase, have been shown to activate IKK (reviewed in Ref. 4Ghosh S.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3295) Google Scholar). 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) was originally identified as a protein-serine/threonine kinase to phosphorylate Akt at the Thr308 residue in its activation loop (12Alessi D.R.

Later studies have shown that PDK1 is not only an Akt kinase but also a kinase that phosphorylates several members of the protein kinase A, G, and C (AGC) family, including p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGKs), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) at the equivalent residues of Thr308 in Akt (reviewed in Ref. 14Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Therefore, PDK1 functions as a pivotal molecule for the activation of a number of signaling pathways involved in proliferation and survival. All of the AGC kinases have amino acid sequences very similar to those surrounding the Thr308 residue in Akt. These consensus motifs in activation loop of the AGC kinases are (S/T)FCGTXEY, where X represents any amino acid (14Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). PDK1, which is also one of the AGC kinases, is autophosphorylated at the Ser241 residue within its activation loop to be active (15Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). During the screening of new kinases that could activate NF-κB signaling, we observed that PDK1 promoted NF-κB activation and its nuclear localization. We found that PDK1 directly bound to, phosphorylated, and activated IKK. The siRNA-mediated PDK1 gene silencing attenuated NF-κB activation and enhanced TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that PDK1 regulates NF-κB signaling. These results indicate that PDK1 plays a critical role in cell survival promotion by activating IKK/NF-κB signaling in addition to Akt signaling.

The blots were scanned using an EPSON ES-2200 scanner supported by Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software. Immunostaining and Apoptosis Assay—For immunostaining, MCF-7 cells were transfected with pc5FLAG-WT-IKKβ together with a pCMV3 vector encoding none or WT-PDK1. Four hours after transfection, the cells were plated onto glass-bottomed dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). After incubation for a further 20 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min.

Luciferase activity was measured with LB 960 Microplate Luminometer Centro (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—MCF-7 cells were transfected with a pc5FLAG vector encoding none (Mock) or WT-IKKβ together with a pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding none or ΔN51-PDK1. 24 h later, the nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER extraction kit. Double-stranded, 5′-two nucleotides-overhanged oligonucleotides containing a consensus binding site for NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; WT-oligo) or a mutant binding site for NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGCTCACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Mutant-oligo) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the High Prime (Roche Applied Science) and purified using the NICK column (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturers' instructions (the NF-κB binding site is underlined). Five micrograms of nuclear extracts were incubated with 20000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) for 30 min at room temperature. The specificity of NF-κB DNA binding activity was confirmed by adding a 2 μm unlabeled competitor (about two thousand excess) or 4 μg of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p65 (clone A, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. Induction of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity and Nuclear Localization by PDK1—To identify new kinases associated with the NF-κB signal transduction pathway, we screened kinases using the NF-κB reporter construct. The cells were transfected with IKKβ and NF-κB reporter plasmids together with plasmids encoding kinases that mainly belong to the PI3K/PDK1/Akt or Raf/MEK pathway. We observed the increase in NF-κB activity in cells that had been transfected with PDK1 like that in NIK transfectants (Fig. 1A). In our experiments, we mainly used ΔN51-PDK1 for transfection experiments because it was reported to possess almost the same activity as full-length WT-PDK1 (24Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In some experiments (Figs. 1C, 5B, 6A, and 6B), we used full-length WT-PDK1 and obtained similar results. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that PDK1 also enhanced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the DNA binding activity was confirmed by experiments with an antibody to p65, the most studied subunit among the NF-κB family proteins and mutant oligonucleotide. To examine how PDK1 enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity, we investigated the cellular localization of NF-κB. Endogenous p65 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm when IKKβ was expressed alone (Fig. 1C). In contrast, p65 was mainly localized in the nucleus of the cells that had been transfected with IKKβ and PDK1. Quantifying more than 100 transfected cells revealed that about four-fifths exhibited p65 nuclear localization when IKKβ was co-expressed with PDK1 (Fig. 1D). The nuclear cytoplasmic fractionation experiment confirmed that p65 nuclear localization was promoted by PDK1 (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, we found increased Ser(P)181-IKKβ levels in the cells that had been transfected with IKKβ and PDK1 (Fig. 1E). Phosphorylation of this serine residue has been well known to be associated with IKKβ activation (8Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). We also observed that IκBα was phosphorylated and degraded in cells transfected with IKKβ and PDK1 (Fig. 2A). In addition, DN-IκBα that is resistant to stimulus-induced degradation (9Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) suppressed PDK1-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that PDK1 enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity by IKK-dependent IκB phosphorylation and degradation.FIGURE 5Identification of the Ser181 residue as a PDK1-mediated IKKβ phosphorylation site.

https://openalex.org/W2097766518,"This study demonstrates a significant advancement of imaging of a distance-dependent physical process, known as the bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET2) signal in living subjects, by using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A CCD camera-based spectral imaging strategy enables simultaneous visualization and quantitation of BRET signal from live cells and cells implanted in living mice. We used the BRET2 system, which utilizes Renilla luciferase (hRluc) protein and its substrate DeepBlueC (DBC) as an energy donor and a mutant green fluorescent protein (GFP2) as the acceptor. To accomplish this objective in this proof-of-principle study, the donor and acceptor proteins were fused to FKBP12 and FRB, respectively, which are known to interact only in the presence of the small molecule mediator rapamycin. Mammalian cells expressing these fusion constructs were imaged using a cooled-CCD camera either directly from culture dishes or by implanting them into mice. By comparing the emission photon yields in the presence and absence of rapamycin, the specific BRET signal was determined. The CCD imaging approach of BRET signal is particularly appealing due to its capacity to seamlessly bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies. This work validates BRET as a powerful tool for interrogating and observing protein-protein interactions directly at limited depths in living mice."
https://openalex.org/W2077650983,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of murine RAW 264.7 macrophages influences the expression of multiple genes through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We observed a 5-fold increase in CstF-64 expression following LPS treatment of RAW macrophages. The increase in CstF-64 protein was specific in that several other factors involved in 3′-end processing were not affected by LPS stimulation. Activation of RAW macrophages with LPS caused an increase in proximal poly(A) site selection within a reporter mini-gene containing two linked poly(A) sites that occurred concomitant with the increase in CstF-64 expression. Furthermore, forced overexpression of the CstF-64 protein also induced alternative poly(A) site selection on the reporter minigene. Microarray analysis performed on CstF-64 overexpressing RAW macrophages revealed that elevated levels of CstF-64 altered the expression of 51 genes, 14 of which showed similar changes in gene expression with LPS stimulation. Sequence analysis of the 3′-untranslated regions of these 51 genes revealed that over 45% possess multiple putative poly(A) sites. Two of these 51 genes demonstrated alternative polyadenylation under both LPS-stimulating and CstF-64-overexpressing conditions. We concluded that the physiologically increased levels of CstF-64 observed in LPS-stimulated RAW macrophages contribute to the changes in expression and alternative polyadenylation of a number of genes, thus identifying another level of gene regulation that occurs in macrophages activated with LPS.

The induced expression of many of these genes is attributed to the activation of transcription factors linked to Toll-like receptor 4-related signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1O'Neill L.A.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Aside from transcriptional contributions to gene expression in stimulated macrophages, post-transcriptional mechanisms have also been shown to influence gene expression. For example, the half-lives of TNF-α (3Crawford E.K. Ensor J.E. Kalvakolanu I. Hasday J.D. J. Biol.

Post-transcriptional pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, although essential in creating translationally competent mRNA, is a greatly under-appreciated contributor to the regulation of gene expression. Because it has been estimated that only 30% of primary transcripts are polyadenylated (10Jackson D.A. Pombo A. Iborra F. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 242-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), changes in 3′-end processing can have a profound effect on the amount of mature transcript produced. The frequency with which a poly(A) site is selected for the cleavage/polyadenylation reaction is greatly impacted by the strength of that poly(A) site. Relevant to the present study, the frequency of cleavage/polyadenylation at a specific poly(A) site is also sensitive to the abundance and/or activity of trans-acting mRNA processing factors (11Veraldi K.L.

Studies of pre-mRNA processing in vitro have identified soluble trans-acting factors that are required for the cleavage and polyadenylation of gene transcripts. The 160-kDa subunit of the tetrameric complex cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF-160) binds to the consensus poly(A) signal AAUAAA that is located upstream of most functional poly(A) sites (14Murthy K. Manley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14804-14811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) trimeric complex binds to the downstream element, a guanosine/uridine (GU)-rich region located downstream of the cleavage site (15Chen F. MacDonald C. Wilusz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2614-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), through its 64-kDa subunit (CstF-64) (16Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3907-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). CstF-64 is composed of a conserved RNA recognition motif near its N terminus (17Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that binds preferentially to GU-rich regions (16Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3907-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additional factors involved in pre-mRNA processing include cleavage factor Im and IIm and poly(A) polymerase. We investigated the expression of CstF-64 and other cleavage/polyadenylation factors after stimulation of murine RAW 264.7 and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with LPS. We found that LPS stimulation of RAW macrophages and murine BMDMs for 18 h significantly increased CstF-64 protein expression. Because LPS stimulation of macrophages arrests the cell cycle (18Vairo G. Royston A.K. Hamilton J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 630-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar), the increase in CstF-64 protein expression occurs in the absence of cellular proliferation. This is in contrast to the increases in CstF-64 expression observed in cells that were induced to proliferate (12Takagaki Y. Seipelt R. Peterson M. Manley J. Cell. 1996; 87: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 20Martincic K. Campbell R. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Souan L. Lotze M.T. Milcarek C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11095-11100Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because exogenous overexpression of CstF-64 in chicken B-lymphoma DT40 cells increased the use of the weak poly(A) site in the IgM heavy chain gene product (12Takagaki Y. Seipelt R. Peterson M. Manley J. Cell. 1996; 87: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the increased levels of CstF-64 observed in LPS-stimulated macrophages would have a similar effect on poly(A) site choice in many genes. To test this, we first monitored the effect increased levels of CstF-64 in RAW macrophages had on poly(A) site choice by using a stably transfected reporter construct that contained two linked poly(A) sites. We observed an increase in the use of the weaker promoter-proximal poly(A) site in the reporter construct concomitant with an increase in CstF-64 protein levels following LPS stimulation. Because of the pleiotropic effects LPS stimulation has on macrophages, we stably overexpressed CstF-64 in RAW macrophages to ascertain if CstF-64 specifically influences poly(A) site choice. Indeed, RAW macrophages that stably overexpress CstF-64 also demonstrated an increase in weak poly(A) site choice on the reporter construct. We therefore hypothesized that induction of CstF-64 by LPS has a functional consequence for gene expression in activated macrophages. To determine how many genes could be influenced, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression from RAW macrophages stably overexpressing CstF-64. We found that 10-fold constitutive overexpression of CstF-64 in RAW macrophages significantly altered the expression of 51 genes, of which over 25% share common gene expression changes with LPS-stimulated RAW macrophages that had a 5-fold maximal increase in CstF-64 expression. Closer analysis of two of the genes whose expression changed under both LPS-stimulating and CstF-64-overexpressing conditions, Id-2 and Mmp-9, revealed that an alternative polyadenylation event does occur on these gene transcripts and that this change in poly(A) site choice may contribute to the increase of mature transcripts by the removal of mRNA instability elements. From this, we conclude that increases in expression of the pre-mRNA cleavage factor CstF-64 observed in LPS-stimulated macrophages significantly contribute to changes in the expression of a multitude of genes through alternative polyadenylation events that occur in the context of infection by Gram-negative bacteria. Cell Culture and Treatment—Murine BMDM were derived from C57BL/6 bone marrow based on adherence. In brief, the bone marrow from euthanized mice was flushed out of the femur and tibia bones with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) as described previously (21Bodnar K.A. Serbina N.V. Flynn J.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The bone marrow suspension was then washed twice with 2% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) in PBS. Non-tissue culture-treated Petri dishes (Labtek) were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per dish in 25 ml of macrophage media (25% L-cell supernatant, 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% pyruvate, and 1% nonessential amino acids). After 4 days in culture the cells were fed with 10 ml of fresh macrophage media. BMDM were grown until ∼80% confluent and then treated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma, strain O111:B4) for 18 h. RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown in culture flasks until ∼80% confluent and then treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 18. Stably transfected polyclonal cell lines were also maintained under G418-neomycin (Cellgro) and/or mycophenolic acid (MPA) (Invitrogen) antibiotic pressure, depending on the incorporated plasmid(s). Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Ten micrograms of whole cell lysates were loaded per lane unless otherwise indicated. Proteins were visualized after treatment of the appropriate secondary antibody with the Renaissance™ chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. All Western blots were re-probed with GAPDH to demonstrate equal loading between lanes. Quantification of signal intensities was performed on the Kodak Imaging Station 2000R and associated one-dimensional analysis software. CstF-64 expression was normalized to the GAPDH signal on the same blot. Rabbit antiserum recognizing murine CstF-64 was generated for peptide CIAMLPPEQRQSILILKEQIQKSTGAP, corresponding to the 26 C-terminal amino acids (a cysteine residue was added to the N terminus to aid keyhole limpet hemocyanin coupling). Injections and collections of serum were performed at Charles River Pharmservices. The anti-CstF-50 and anti-CstF-77 rabbit anti-peptide antibodies were made in our laboratory as described previously (20Martincic K. Campbell R. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Souan L. Lotze M.T. Milcarek C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11095-11100Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as well as the anti-hnRNP F and anti-hnRNP H/H′ rabbit polyclonal antibodies (11Veraldi K.L. Arhin G.K. Martincic K. Chung-Ganster L.H. Wilusz J. Milcarek C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1228-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Anti-CPSF-30 (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-CPSF-100 (rabbit polyclonal) were generously provided by Walter Keller (University of Basel). We purchased the mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody from Chemicon. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for mouse IgG (Sigma A7282) and rabbit IgG (Sigma A0545) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Cell Proliferation by [3H]Thymidine Incorporation— RAW macrophages were plated in 35-mm culture dishes and allowed to grow to ∼80% confluency (3 × 10 6 cells/plate) with 5 ml of medium and were left untreated or stimulated with LPS. To measure DNA synthesis (22Navalgund L.G. Rossana C. Muench A.J. Johnson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7386-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μCi of [3H]dT (6.7 Ci/mmol) in aqueous solution was added to the cells covered with 3 ml of medium. After 6, 14.5, and 18 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then trypsinized. Cells were collected, spun down, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS; cell number was determined from an aliquot. Triplicate 200-μl samples were removed. Nucleic acids were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid and collected on glass fiber filters. Radioactivity was determined using scintillation counting, and the [3H]dT incorporated was normalized for cell counts. RNA Isolation and Poly(A)+ RNA Purification—Total RNA was extracted from RAW macrophages using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified mRNA was suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma)-treated water and 2 volumes 95% ethanol and stored at –20 °C until needed. T2 RNase Protection Assay—RAW macrophages were stably transfected with a guanine phosphotransferase (gpt)-containing plasmid with linked poly(A) sites and cultured in the presence of MPA, as described previously (23Matis S.A. Martincic K. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4684-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The gpt gene has a weak poly(A) site from the α2-globin gene upstream of the strong SV40 late poly(A) site that is contained in the pSV2gpt vector (24Mulligan R.C. Berg P. Science. 1980; 209: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The RAW macrophages that contain the gpt-encoding reporter gene are subsequently referred to as RAW-α2 macrophages. RNase protection assays were performed using an antisense radiolabeled riboprobe that hybridizes to the 3′-UTR of the gpt mRNA to detect poly(A) site usage (see Fig. 3A). The riboprobe was synthesized with a specific activity of ∼7.3 × 107 cpm/μg as described previously (23Matis S.A. Martincic K. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4684-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Radioactivity contained in the proximal and distal poly(A) site-protected fragments was measured with a PhosphorImager (MD 860, Amersham Biosciences), and quantification was performed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The proximal/distal ratio (P/D) was computed using Office XP Excel (Microsoft), and all ratios from experimental samples were normalized to the untreated control within each experiment. Statistical significance of the data was calculated using S.E. and the paired Student's t test from two to three trials performed from at least two separate RNA preparations, for a total of five trials from each condition. Overexpression of CstF-64 in RAW 264.7 Murine Macrophages—The complete open reading frame of human CstF-64 [CstF-2] was cloned into the EcoRI sites of pBluescript II SK(+) (pBSSK-64), using EcoRI linkers as described (17Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and was a gift from Jim Manley (Columbia University). To avoid difficulties with cytomegalovirus promoter activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages, we used pEF1/Myc-His B (Invitrogen), a plasmid driven by the human EF-1α promoter that has been shown to achieve high levels of exogenous gene expression in RAW macrophages (25Kepka-Lenhart D. Mistry S.K. Wu G. Morris Jr., S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R2237-R2242PubMed Google Scholar). A double digest of both pBSSK-64 and pEF1/Myc-His B with KpnI (Roche Applied Science) and XbaI (Roche Applied Science) was performed followed by gel purification of an ∼2.0-kb fragment from pBSSK-64 and an ∼6.5-kb fragment from pEF1/Myc-His B. Ligation of the purified plasmid fragments with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) was done in a 16 °C water bath overnight followed by direct transformation of the ligation reactions into One Shot MAX Efficiency DH5α-1 competent cells (Invitrogen) resulting in a sufficient number of colonies on penicillin G (Sigma) LB plates for miniprep screenings. The resulting CstF-64 expression plasmid is called pEF1-64. RAW-α2 macrophages were stably transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with pEF1-64 or pEF1-lacZ, as a control, as instructed by the manufacturer. In brief, RAW-α2 macrophages were seeded in 6-well culture dishes and grown until ∼75% confluent. Macrophages were transfected with a FuGENE 6 (μl):DNA ratio (μg) of 8:1 in the presence of serum. At day 3 post-transfection, the cells were split and placed under selective pressure of 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Cellgro) and MPA. Media were changed as needed. After 18 days of selective pressure, polyclonal populations of RAW-α2-64 or RAW-α2-LacZ cells were stored in liquid nitrogen. Raw-α2-64 cultures were assessed for constitutive CstF-64 expression by Western blot. Affymetrix Gene Chip Analysis—Three unique samples of RNA from each treatment (untreated, 100 ng/ml LPS-treated for 18 h and constitutively overexpressed CstF-64) were used to create biotinylated cRNA at the PittArray DNA microarray facility of the Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratories of the University of Pittsburgh. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented RNA were hybridized to the murine 430A Affymetrix gene chip according to manufacturer's instructions. Affymetrix gene chips were scanned using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix) to obtain raw expression values and signal calls (i.e. present, absent, or marginal) for each probe set on the array chip (GEO accession number GSE2002). Data sets of intensities for 22,690 probe sets per expression array were analyzed by BRB-ArrayTools version 3.02 (linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html). Data were filtered through the software by using the following parameters: all signals with an intensity value below 10 were given a threshold value of 10, and each array was normalized to the 64 Affymetrix control probe sets intrinsic to the murine 430A chip. Furthermore, probe sets were excluded from all arrays under the following conditions: when less than 30% (i.e. 0, 1, or 2 of 9) of expression data values have a 2-fold change in either direction from the probe set's median value or when 50% or more of the data for a probe set is missing or absent. Using these filtering parameters, 1145 probe sets passed the criteria. To identify genes that demonstrated statistically significant changes in expression between control and treatment (LPS or CstF-64 overexpressing) groups, the probe sets that had passed the initial filtering process also had to pass the following criteria. 1) The mean of the treatment group must have demonstrated a 2-fold increase or decrease in signal over the mean of the control group. 2) The signal values for each probe set must have passed a statistical univariant significance test with p value<0.05 with 1000 permutations and specifying a random variance for each calculation (class comparison feature of BRB Array Tools). 3) A probe set was excluded if it scored an absent call in at least two of three measurements for the treatment group (for up-regulated genes) or scored an absent call in at least two of three measurements for the control group (for down-regulated genes). Marginal calls were considered absent for this criterion. A statistical algorithm was designed to test if the genetic overlap between LPS-stimulated and CstF-64-overexpressing conditions was beyond the random chance of occurrence. Briefly, the test was designed with one set consisting of a draw of 515 random numbers from a pool of 22,690 and another set consisting of a draw of 51 random numbers again from a pool of 22,690 numbers. The test was run 30,000 times looking for the number of random chance over-laps from the two sets of randomly selected numbers. A graph depicting the frequency of zero numbers of overlaps, one number, two numbers, etc. up to 14 numbers from 30,000 trials was constructed using Microsoft Excel and appears in supplemental Fig. 1. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized for each condition from 10 μg of total cellular RNA using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR with oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). PCR reaction mixtures were assembled in quadruplicate for each primer pair using either 0.5 or 1.0 μl of cDNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 800 nm dNTP mix, 5 μl of 10× Taq buffer, and 2.5 units of Taq (Genechoice) in 50-μl volumes. At the conclusion of 20, 25, and 30 cycles, reaction tubes were removed from the PCR machine and placed on a heat block for final extension. The last tube of each set of four reactions was allowed to complete the PCR program to 35 cycles on the thermocycler. Ten microliter aliquots of the PCRs representing 20, 25, 30, and 35 cycles were loaded on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized using the Kodak Imaging Station 2000R. The hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, which is shown to be equally expressed between the RAW macrophage culture conditions on the microarray data (GSE2002) and has been shown previously to be a good candidate for RT-PCR loading control (26Foss D.L.

Open table in a new tab Multiple-Reverse Primer PCR (MRP-PCR)—Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized, and PCR mixtures were assembled as described above. A common forward primer (F) was designed for all five genes under study (Fig. 7A and TABLE ONE). An upstream reverse primer (R1) was designed 5′ to the most proximal putative poly(A) site and amplifies all gene products regardless of poly(A) site usage. A second downstream reverse primer (R2) was designed to the region on the gene that lies between putative poly(A) sites and amplifies only gene products that are cleaved at the distal poly(A) site(s). PCR products were loaded on agarose gels and analyzed on the Kodak Imaging Station 2000R. We treated RAW macrophages with increasing amounts of LPS for 18 h and measured CstF-64 protein expression by Western blot. We observed that CstF-64 protein levels increased with LPS stimulation of RAW macrophages and that this increase is LPS dose-dependent (Fig. 1A). The induced expression of CstF-64 plateaued at 100 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 1A). A semi-quantitative Western blot revealed that 100 ng/ml LPS stimulation of RAW macrophages for 18 h resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in CstF-64 expression (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2090320400,"We sought to evaluate the biological function of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 in bladder cancer. All of the nine bladder cancer cell lines examined express EphB4 and the receptor could be phosphorylated following stimulation with its cognate ligand, EphrinB2. Out of the 15 fresh bladder cancer specimens examined, 14 expressed EphB4 with a mean sevenfold higher level of expression compared to adjacent normal urothelium. EphB4 expression was regulated by several mechanisms: EPHB4 gene locus was amplified in 27% tumor specimens and 33% cell lines studied; inhibition of EGFR signaling downregulated EphB4 levels; and forced expression of wild-type p53 reduced EphB4 expression. EphB4 knockdown using specific siRNA and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides molecules led to a profound inhibition in cell viability associated with apoptosis via activation of caspase-8 pathway and downregulation of antiapoptotic factor, bcl-xl. Furthermore, EphB4 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. EphB4 knockdown in an in vivo murine tumor xenograft model led to a nearly 80% reduction in tumor volume associated with reduced tumor proliferation, increased apoptosis and reduced tumor microvasculature. EphB4 is thus a potential candidate as a predictor of disease outcome in bladder cancer and as target for novel therapy."

A combination of random mutagenesis and high-throughput screening was used in the analysis of P450 2A6, utilizing a fluorescent coumarin 7-hydroxylation assay. The steady-state kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) for coumarin 7-hydroxylation by wild-type P450 2A6 and 35 selected mutants were measured and indicated that mutants throughout the coding region can have effects on activity. Five mutants showing decreased catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) were further analyzed for substrate selectivity and binding affinities and showed reduced catalytic activities for 7-methoxycoumarin O-demethylation, tert-butyl methyl ether O-demethylation, and indole 3-hydroxylation. All mutants except one (K476E) showed decreased coumarin binding affinities (and also higher Km values), indicating that this is a major basis for the decreased enzymatic activities. A recent x-ray crystal structure of P450 2A6 bound to coumarin (Yano, J. K., Hsu, M. H., Griffin, K. J., Stout, C. D., and Johnson, E. F. (2005) Nat. Struct. Mol.

The decreased enzymatic activity of the K476E mutant was associated with decreases both in NADPH oxidation and the reduction rate of the ferric P450 2A6-coumarin complex. The attenuation is caused in part to lower binding affinity for NADPH-P450 reductase, but the K476E mutant did not achieve the wild-type coumarin 7-hydroxylation activity even at high reductase concentrations.

The decrease in size of the active site in P450 2A6 relative to P450 2C8 is caused by repositioning of helix B′ and helices F to H toward the active site.

In this study, a random mutagenesis approach was applied to study structure-function relationships with P450 2A6. Mutations throughout the coding region have some effects on activity. Several of the mutants have altered substrate affinity and can be rationalized by the available structure, but an unexpected finding was that the mutant with the lowest activity is related to attenuated reduction by NADPH-P450 reductase. Chemicals—Coumarin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and 7-methoxycoumarin were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI) and recrystallized from C2H5OH/H2OorCH3OH/H2O before use. The synthesis of 3-hydroxy-7-methoxy coumarin is described elsewhere (37Neubauer O. Flatow L. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1907; 52: 375-398Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 38Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, the P450 open reading frame region (1.5 kb) of a bicistronic plasmid (pCW2A6bc) expressing both human P450 2A6 and NADPH-P450 reductase was randomly mutated using low-fidelity PCR (Mutazyme®, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplified PCR library fragment was purified and cloned into the pCW2A6bc vector using the NdeI and XbaI restriction sites. Screening of P450 2A6 Libraries—P450 2A6/NADPH-P450 reductase bicistronic library DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5αF′IQ and then plated on Luria-Bertani medium (with ampicillin, 100 μg/ml) Q-tray plates (25 × 25 cm; Genetix, Hampshire, UK). Individual colonies were picked and transferred to single wells of 96-well fluorescence plates filled with 200 μl of TB expression medium, using a Genetix colony picking robot system (Genetix) (Fig. 1). Approximately 104 colonies were picked. The 96-well plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. For the measurement of activity of mutants, coumarin (2 μm) in minimal medium (including 0.04% glucose, w/v) was added into 96-well plates after the TB medium was removed. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C followed by the addition of alkaline solution (10 mm NaOH, containing 1 m NaCl), formation of the product 7-hydroxycoumarin was determined fluorometrically with a fluorescence plate reader (BD Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA). The mutants possessing low activity were selected and verified with duplicate assays for coumarin 7-hydroxylation in whole cells. Enzymes—Bacterial inner membrane fractions containing mutant P450 2A6 and NADPH-P450 reductase were isolated and prepared from 1 liter of TB (with ampicillin, 100 μg/ml) expression cultures of E. coli DH5αF′IQ, as described previously (39Gillam E.M.J.

Steady-state Kinetic Assays for Coumarin 7-Hydroxylation and 7-Methoxycoumarin O-Demethylation and 3-Hydroxylation—Steadystate coumarin and 7-methoxycoumarin metabolism reactions included 20 pmol of P450 2A6 (wild type or mutants, in bicistronic membranes), in 0.50 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), along with a specified amount of the substrate. An NADPH-generating system (43Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 4th Ed. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar) was used to start reactions. Incubations were generally done for 5 min at 37 °C and terminated with 0.05 ml of 2 m HCl. Two volumes of CHCl3 were added to extract the products, followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation. The organic layer (lower) was transferred to a clean tube and an equal volume of 0.1 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.3) was added. The upper layer, containing the phenolic product, was transferred to fluorescence microtiter plates, and the 7-hydroxycoumarin was measured using a microtiter plate fluorescence plate reader (43Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 4th Ed. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar). For the analysis of 3-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin, the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC using a Phenomenex Prodigy ODS (C18) column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the mobile phase H2O:CH3CN (70:30, v/v (solvent A); and 55:45, v/v (solvent B)) containing 10 mm HClO4 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml-1, monitoring A322 (38Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The percentage of solvent A was decreased linearly (to 0% solvent A,100% solvent B) over 10 min and held for 3 min; the percentage of solvent B was then decreased linearly (to 100% solvent A,0% solvent B) over 2 min and held for 3 min. Other Catalytic Assays—Assays of tert-butyl methyl ether O-demethylation, an established P450 2A6 reaction (44Hong J.Y. Yang C.S. Lee M. Wang Y.Y. Huang W. Tan Y. Patten C.J. Bondoc F.Y. Arch.

Pharmacol. 1999; 160: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), were done with bacterial membranes prepared from E. coli DH5α-expressing P450 2A6 (or a mutant) and NADPH-P450 reductase. Membranes were dialyzed twice versus 25 volumes of 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm EDTA at 4 °C, first for 90 min and then 14 h, to remove glycerol, which contains traces of HCHO and reduces the assay sensitivity. 3M. W. Calcutt and F. P. Guengerich, manuscript in preparation. Membranes, containing 0.3 nmol of P450, were incubated with 100 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20-800 μm tert-butyl methyl ether 4Dilutions made from tert-butyl methyl ether-saturated H2O, which are assumed to be 0.54 m according to the literature (46Budavari S. Merck Index. 13th Ed. Whitehouse Station, NJ2001: 1078Google Scholar). in a 0.75-ml volume in 4-ml glass vials fitted with Teflon-lined septa (screw caps). The vials were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.10 ml of an NADPH generating system (43Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 4th Ed. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar). After 20 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.25 ml of 17% HClO4 and chilling on ice. Following centrifugation ((3 × 103) × g, for 10 min), aliquots (0.80 ml) of the supernatant from each incubation were transferred to clean glass vials and mixed with 0.32 ml of double-strength Nash reagent (43Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 4th Ed. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar, 47Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). The tubes were heated at 60-70 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged again at (3 × 103) × g for 5 min to remove any turbid material; the A412 readings were used to estimate HCHO production by comparison with a reference curve prepared with a standard HCHO solution in the same way. The P450 2A6-catalyzed 3-hydroxylation of indole yields the blue dye indigo (19Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. DeVoss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A continuous spectral assay (20Nakamura K. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has a complication in that only the initial event, 3-hydroxylation, is catalytic. 3-Hydroxyindole (indoxyl) undergoes rapid, base-catalyzed oxidation in the presence of O2 to yield the blue dimer indigo (48Russell G.A. Kaupp G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 3851-3859Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An assay has been developed in which the oxidation of indole (or a phenyl ring-substituted indole) is carried out and stopped by the addition of base after a fixed time, with some additional time allowed for development of the indigo, which is stable. Further details are provided elsewhere (49Wu Z. Podust L.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. October 7, 2005; 10.1074/jbc.M508182200Google Scholar). These assays were done with P450 2A6 (or mutants) and NADPH-P450 reductase expressed in an E. coli trnA- strain (22Wu Z. Aryal P. Lozach O. Meijer L. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Biodiversity. 2005; 2: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), devoid of tryptophanase required to produce endogenous indole and the subsequent blue color in the membranes (expression at 28 °C for 14 h). Membranes containing 0.20 nmol of P450 2A6 (or a mutant) in 1.0 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were incubated with 0 to 400 μm concentrations of indole for 20 min at 37 °C and quenched by the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH; the formation of indigo was estimated colorimetrically by comparison with standard indigo (ϵ600 = 3.9 × 103 m-1 cm-1 under these conditions (31Li Q.S. Schwaneberg U. Fischer P. Schmid R.D. Chem. Eur. J. 2000; 6: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)). The assumptions were made that all indoxyl was coupled to indigo formation and that the formation of a single indigo molecule represents the formation of two molecules of indoxyl. NADPH oxidation rates for P450 2A6 enzymes were determined using P450/NADPH-P450 reductase/phospholipid reconstituted systems for some steady-state kinetic experiments (43Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 4th Ed. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar). Reconstituted enzymes were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of coumarin (20 μm). Reactions were initiated with the addition of 15 μl of 10 mm NADPH, and the decrease of A340 was monitored. Rates were calculated using the value Δϵ340 = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1. Spectral Binding Titrations—Purified P450 2A6 and mutants were diluted to 1 μm in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and divided between two glass cuvettes. Spectra (350-500 nm) were recorded with subsequent additions of coumarin (from an aqueous stock, Ref. 38Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or DTT (also aqueous stock) using an Aminco DW-2a/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). The difference in absorbance between the difference wavelength maximum (385 nm) and minimum (418 nm) was plotted versus the substrate concentration (50Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar) to estimate Ks. 5Ks indicates a dissociation constant estimated by measurement of the UV-visible changes in the P450 heme spectrum. Anaerobic Reduction Kinetics—The modified systems for anaerobic stopped-flow experiments have been previously described (38Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 51Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10775-10788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The instrument drive syringes were flushed with anaerobic buffer, filled with a solution of safranine T in 0.25 m Tris-HCl/25 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.5) (38Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and illuminated (with a lamp) to scrub the system. Enzyme mixtures (of purified wild-type 2A6 and the K476E mutant) and NADPH (150 μm) were prepared separately and made anaerobic by alternative cycles of vacuum and argon, using a gas manifold. The dye solution was flushed from the stopped-flow instrument with anaerobic buffer, and then anaerobic samples were introduced from the tonometers. Reduction kinetics was monitored at 448 nm using an RSM-1000 stopped-flow apparatus (On-Line Instrument Systems). Selection of Low Activity Mutants—More than 104 mutant clones were screened for coumarin 7-hydroxylation activity, and the mutants with apparently reduced activity were verified in duplicate cultures (Fig. 1). Some of the mutants were found to have low activity because of very low P450 expression upon subsequent analysis and were discarded. Thirty-five mutants showing expression of P450 holoenzyme were isolated, and the nucleotide sequences of the DNAs were analyzed. Fifty-one amino acid residues were changed in the 35 mutants, and 12 of the changed residues were located in SRS regions (Fig. 2). Catalytic Activities of Selected Mutants—Characterization of mutants was initially done with membrane preparations. Fe2+-CO versus Fe2+ difference spectroscopy indicated that the whole cell expression levels of P450 2A6 varied among the mutants, ranging from 50 to 350 nmol per liter culture (see supplemental data Table S1). The rates of coumarin 7-hydroxylation by P450 2A6 and the mutants were measured and normalized for P450 content (TABLE ONE, Figs. 3 and 4). Steady-state kinetic analysis of coumarin 7-hydroxylation indicated lower catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) than wild-type P450 2A6 for most mutants (12-fold decreases in catalytic efficiency for mutants C004 and C332).TABLE ONEKinetic parameters for 7-hydroxylation of coumarin by P450 2A6 mutants measured in bacterial membrane fractionsMutantMutationskcatKmkcat/KmMutantMutationskcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μMmin−1μM−1min−1μMmin−1μM−1Wild type10.2 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.34.9 ± 0.7C198E103K, V140M, I434V, T482R6.7 ± 0.44.6 ± 0.61.5 ± 0.2C004A481T3.4 ± 0.38.1 ± 1.20.42 ± 0.07C201T177I7.7 ± 0.43.4 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.3C028S183C, K337N, F384N7.3 ± 0.32.3 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.4C215D93H, D169N4.4 ± 0.64.7 ± 1.40.9 ± 0.3C030G141C, H320Y1.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.3C216T16S, K250R, E329A7.2 ± 0.52.2 ± 0.43.3 ± 0.6C033N255H6.2 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.6C332K476E0.51 ± 0.031.4 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.1C056T511, V186L, L240C, N297Q18.3 ± 2.18.3 ± 1.72.2 ± 0.5C347M222I, R257H6.6 ± 0.33.4 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.2C065N297S10.0 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.1C348E103D, M227L8.0 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.3C066L202M, M489L9.8 ± 0.52.4 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.6C353R372H2.6 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.2C072F209V4.3 ± 0.32.3 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.3C378K469N5.0 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.4C074M205I3.3 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.4C386W24L, K420M5.4 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.3C077L20M, I168F10.7 ± 1.03.1 ± 0.73.5 ± 0.8C401T134I7.4 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.3C079S183C, H254Y13.2 ± 0.95.0 ± 0.72.6 ± 0.4C426Q422H7.3 ± 0.32.3 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.3C080F209I50 ± 1125 ± 72.0 ± 0.7C441I61F13.1 ± 1.34.1 ± 1.03.2 ± 0.8C082Y287N8.4 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.33.4 ± 0.4C443D364Y2.9 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.1C113A95V, A249S, F271Y8.9 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.32.8 ± 0.3C502P39S4.5 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.2C127P367T7.0 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.2C600K60M5.3 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.2C166V116M, F453Y3.5 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1C630M318T7.3 ± 0.53.3 ± 0.62.3 ± 0.4C188F286L6.3 ± 0.44.6 ± 0.61.4 ± 0.2C696A95S, E197G11.6 ± 0.94.3 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Steady-state kinetics of coumarin 7-hydroxylation by P450 2A6 mutants. kcat is expressed in nmol of 7-hydroxycoumarin formed/min/nmol of P450 and Km in μm.

https://openalex.org/W2047071710,"The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is implicated in the regulation of many different molecular and physiological processes. Mice with a germline deletion of C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ−/−) display phenotypes in a multitude of cell types and organ systems, including skin where C/EBPβ−/− mice exhibit increased apoptosis in epidermal keratinocytes in response to carcinogen treatment and are completely resistant to carcinogen-induced skin tumorigenesis. To determine the contribution of systemic versus cell autonomous functions of C/EBPβ to specific phenotypes, mice with a conditional ‘floxed’ C/EBPβ null allele were generated. Epidermal-specific deletion of C/EBPβ was achieved by Cre recombinase expression from a keratin 5 (K5) promoter. Similar to C/EBPβ−/− mice, K5-Cre;C/EBPβfl/fl mice were completely refractory to 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced skin tumorigenesis and these mice displayed increased DMBA-induced apoptosis in epidermal keratinocytes compared to wild-type mice. In contrast, mice lacking the related gene, C/EBPδ, were not resistant to DMBA-induced skin tumorigenesis, indicating a unique role of C/EBPβ in skin tumor development. Our findings demonstrate that C/EBPβ exerts an essential, keratinocyte-intrinsic role in cell survival in response to carcinogen treatment and the elimination of C/EBPβ in keratinocytes is sufficient to confer complete resistance of the skin to chemical carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2021392815,"Deletions of chromosome 6 are a common abnormality in diverse human malignancies including astrocytic tumours, suggesting the presence of tumour suppressor genes (TSG). In order to help identify candidate TSGs, we have constructed a chromosome 6 tile path microarray. The array contains 1780 clones (778 P1-derived artificial chromosome and 1002 bacterial artificial chromosome) that cover 98.3% of the published chromosome 6 sequences. A total of 104 adult astrocytic tumours (10 diffuse astrocytomas, 30 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 64 glioblastomas (GB)) were analysed using this array. Single copy number change was successfully detected and the result was in general concordant with a microsatellite analysis. The pattern of copy number change was complex with multiple interstitial deletions/gains. However, a predominance of telomeric 6q deletions was seen. Two small common and overlapping regions of deletion at 6q26 were identified. One was 1002?kb in size and contained PACRG and QKI, while the second was 199?kb and harbours a single gene, ARID1B. The data show that the chromosome 6 tile path array is useful in mapping copy number changes with high resolution and accuracy. We confirmed the high frequency of chromosome 6 deletions in AA and GB, and identified two novel commonly deleted regions that may harbour TSGs."

https://openalex.org/W2028861264,"Oxidative stress plays an important role in atherosclerotic vascular disease, and several recent studies were focused on thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) and its potential protective role against oxidative stress. Since human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) are important cells in several inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, we conducted this study to evaluate the impact of extracellular recombinant human Trx-1 (rhTrx-1) on gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-activated HMDM. Our results showed that rhTrx-1 was capable of reducing interleukin (IL)-1β mRNA and protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was partly mediated through a reduction of NF-κB activation as analyzed by transient transfection and gel shift assays. In addition, we showed that the attenuation of NF-κB activity was the result of the reduction of both p50 and p65 subunit mRNA and protein synthesis on one hand and of the induction of I-κBα mRNA and protein expression on the other hand. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous Trx-1 mRNA was also observed, suggesting a contribution to the diminution of NF-κB activity since endogenous Trx-1, in contrast to the exogenous Trx-1, activates the NF-κB system. Finally, H2O2-oxidized rhTrx-1 reduced IL-1β mRNA synthesis in lipopolysaccharide-activated HMDM. This result highly suggested that the rhTrx-1 used in this study could be oxidized in the culture medium and, in turn, reduced IL-1β mRNA and protein synthesis. Taken together, these data indicated a potential new mechanism through which extracellular rhTrx-1 exerts an anti-inflammatory function in HMDM.

Nevertheless, recent attention was focused on thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) 2The abbreviations used are: Trx-1thioredoxin-1rhTrx-1recombinant human Trx-1ILinterleukinHMDMhuman monocyte-derived macrophagesLPSlipopolysaccharideQ-PCRquantitative PCRTNFtumor necrosis factorDTTdithiothreitolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayhApoAhuman apolipoprotein A. 2The abbreviations used are: Trx-1thioredoxin-1rhTrx-1recombinant human Trx-1ILinterleukinHMDMhuman monocyte-derived macrophagesLPSlipopolysaccharideQ-PCRquantitative PCRTNFtumor necrosis factorDTTdithiothreitolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayhApoAhuman apolipoprotein A. and its potential protective role against oxidative stress (see review (2Yamawaki H. Haendeler J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)). Indeed, Trx-1, a 12-kDa highly conserved protein in almost all species, is the major carrier of redox potential in cells (3Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trx-1 functions by the reversible oxidization of two Trx-specific redox-active cysteine residues (Cys-32 and Cys-35) to form a disulfide bond that, in turn, can be reduced by the action of Trx-1 reductase and NADPH. thioredoxin-1 recombinant human Trx-1 interleukin human monocyte-derived macrophages lipopolysaccharide quantitative PCR tumor necrosis factor dithiothreitol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay human apolipoprotein A. thioredoxin-1 recombinant human Trx-1 interleukin human monocyte-derived macrophages lipopolysaccharide quantitative PCR tumor necrosis factor dithiothreitol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay human apolipoprotein A. Intracellular Trx-1 exerts most of its antioxidant properties through scavenging of reactive oxygen species (4Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it acts as a cofactor for several enzymes such as nucleoside diphosphate reductase (5Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Moreover, mammalian Trx-1 plays an important role in the regulation of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (8Hirota K. Matsui M.

Indeed, Trx-1 secretion has been reported to occur in conditions associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection (17Nakamura H. De Rosa S.

In addition, data reported in a recent review indicated that serum Trx-1 levels were found to be significantly increased in patients with acute coronary syndromes and dilated cardiomyopathy (2Yamawaki H. Haendeler J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Similarly, serum Trx-1 concentrations were higher in patients with several cardiovascular risk factors than in normal subjects (20Miwa K. Kishimoto C. Nakamura H. Makita T. Ishii K. Okuda N. Yodoi J. Sasayama S. Circ. J. 2005; 69: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, results suggesting a possible association between Trx-1 secretion and the severity of heart failure were reported (2Yamawaki H. Haendeler J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, beneficial effects of elevated plasma Trx-1 levels induced by injection of recombinant human Trx-1 have been described in ischemic reperfusion injury (21Yokomise H. Fukuse T. Hirata T.

In addition, overexpression of human Trx-1 in transgenic mice attenuated focal ischemic brain damage (25Takagi Y. Mitsui A. Nishiyama A. Nozaki K. Sono H. Gon Y. Hashimoto N. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl.

These data suggest that Trx-1 plays a number of biological roles in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Since human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) are important cells involved in several inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, we conducted this study to evaluate the impact of extracellular human Trx-1 on gene expression using a DNA array approach. We found an inhibitory effect of Trx-1 on the expression of several important inflammatory genes such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in LPS-activated HMDM. Given the fact that monocytes, macrophages, and macrophage-derived foam cells are the main sources of IL-1β (26Kelk P. Claesson R. Hanstrom L. Lerner U.H. Kalfas S. Johansson A. Infect.

Cytokine. 1997; 9: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) on the other hand, we decided to focus our study on this cytokine to elucidate the mechanism by which recombinant human Trx-1 (rhTrx-1) inhibits its synthesis. Isolation and Culture of Human Monocytes—Mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy normolipidemic donors using Ficoll gradient centrifugation and were subsequently cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing gentamicin (40 μg/ml), glutamine (0.05%) (Sigma), and 10% pooled human serum (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) at a density of 6 × 106 cells/well in 60-mm well Primaria plastic culture dishes (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France). Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages was allowed to occur spontaneously by adhesion of cells to the culture dish and continued maturation by subsequent 12 days of culture. For analysis, these cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated 2 h with or without LPS (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml. The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of rhTrx-1 (American Diagnostica) for 6 or 24 h in the presence of RPMI medium supplemented with gentamicin (40 μg/ml), glutamine (0.05%), and 1% Nutridoma-HU (Roche Diagnostics). The viability of the cells was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release (lactate dehydrogenase kit, Roche Diagnostics). No statistical difference was detected between the level of cytotoxicity in control and treated cells (viability >95%). RNA and Protein Extraction—To obtain both total cellular protein and RNA using the PARIS kit (Ambion), whole cells were first homogenized in ice-cold cell disruption buffer. A part of the cell lysate was used for protein analysis, and the other part was immediately mixed with an equal volume of lysis/binding solution containing a high concentration of guanidinium thiocyanate for RNA purification using an RNA binding glass fibber filter. After three rapid washing steps, RNA was eluted and quantitated. Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Arrays—First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 3 μg of total RNA with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and T7-oligo(dT). Second strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly, MA), DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), RNase H (Invitrogen), and T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as described by Park et al. (37Park P.J. Cao Y.A. Lee S.Y. Kim J.W. Chang M.S. Hart R. Choi S. J. Biotechnol. 2004; 112: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA was purified using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol on a Phase Lock Gel tube (Eppendorf) followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water. cRNA was synthesized from double-stranded cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). cRNA was fragmented for 35 min at 94 °C in a solution of 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mm magnesium acetate. Fragmented cRNA samples were mixed with eukaryotic hybridization controls (Affymetrix), salmon sperm DNA, and acetylated bovine serum albumin and hybridized to microarrays for 16 h, rotating at 60 rpm, at 45 °C. After hybridization and washing, scanning of microarrays was performed according to the standard protocols (Affymetrix). The Affymetrix GeneChip information was extracted, and data were compared according to Park et al. (37Park P.J. Cao Y.A. Lee S.Y. Kim J.W. Chang M.S. Hart R. Choi S. J. Biotechnol. 2004; 112: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR Conditions—For real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis, 5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using a random hexamer primer (Clontech). To avoid DNA contamination, a DNase I (Invitrogen) treatment was performed before each reverse transcription. All Q-PCR analyses were carried out using the Mx4000 multiplex quantitative PCR system (Stratagene). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5-10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 1 min of annealing (annealing temperature adapted for the specific primer set used), and 1 min of extension at 72 °C. Fluorescence data were collected during the annealing stage of amplification. The presence of specific amplicon was established when fluorescence signal intensity for each molecular probe exceeded the instrument-defined calculated background noise threshold level, based on the fluorescence parameters for no-sample controls. cDNA of cyclophilin was used as an endogenous control to standardize the amount of cDNA in each sample. However, β-actin and 28 S gene expressions, in contrast to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were not affected by rhTrx-1 treatment and therefore can be used, like cyclophilin, for normalization. The following primer pairs were used: for IL-1β, forward, 5′-ACAGACCTTCCAGGAGAATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCAGTTCAGTGATCGTACAG-3′); for I-κB, forward, 5′-TTGGGTGCTGATGTCAATGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTGACAGTCATCCACATCTAC-3′; for p50, forward, 5′-GCAATCATCCACCTTCATTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGTCTGGTACAGATCATTTC-3′; for p65, forward, 5′-GTTTCCAGAACCTGGGAATC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGCTGCTCTTCTATAGGAAC-3′; for endogenous Trx-1, forward, 5′-GACGCTGCAGGTGATAAAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTGACAGTCATCCACATCTAC-3′; for β-actin, forward, 5′-AACTCCATCATGAAGTGTGACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGG-3′; for 28 S gene, forward, 5′-AAACTCTGGTGGAGGTCCGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTACCAAAAGTGGCCCACTA-3′; and for cyclophilin, forward, 5′-GCATACGGGTCCTGGCATCTTGTCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATGGTGATCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGC-3′. cDNA standard sample was replaced with water in all no-sample controls. Quantification of Secreted IL-1β by the ELISA Procedure—Extracellular IL-1β in HMDM culture media was quantitated by a sandwich ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Lille, France) containing two monoclonal antibodies specific to human IL-1β antigen. Western Blot Analysis—For Western analyses, the cells were stimulated with LPS for 2 h and then with rhTrx-1 as indicated above, washed, and lysed, and the protein concentrations were measured by Peterson's method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Samples (25 μg) were denatured with SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel). The samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with buffer containing 10 mm Tris/NaCl (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dried milk. The blot was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-I-κBα antibody, anti-p50 antibody, or anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:200 dilution), washed three times for 15 min with 10 mm Tris/NaCl (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) (1:500 dilution) for 1 h. β-actin expression was used as an endogenous control to standardize the amount of protein in each sample. Blots were visualized with a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were scanned to compare their intensities. Carboxymethylation of rhTrx-1—rhTrx-1 was reduced with 4 mm DTT for 10 min at room temperature or oxidized with 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Separation of the redox forms of Trx-1 was based upon the procedures of Watson et al. (38Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O. Reed M.S. Powis G. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33408-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). rhTrx-1 was carboxymethylated in guanidine-Tris solution (6 m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm, Tris, pH 8.3, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 50 mm iodoacetic acid. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, excess iodoacetic acid was removed by Sephadex chromatography (MicroSpin G-25 columns, Amersham Biosciences). Eluates were diluted in 5× sample buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and separated on a discontinuous native polyacrylamide gel (5% stacking gel, 15% resolving gel). Gels were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane and probed for rhTrx-1 using anti-Trx-1 primary antibody (Abcam) (1:1000 dilution) and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) (1:500 dilution). Oxidized and reduced human apolipoprotein A-I (hApoA-I) were used as a negative control. Human IL-1β Promoter Analyses—The pGL3(NF-κB)-luciferase expression vector was made according to Gray et al. (39Gray J.G. Chandra G. Clay W.C. Stinnett S.W. Haneline S.A. Lorenz J.J. Patel I.R. Wisely G.B. Furdon P.J. Taylor J.D. Kost T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6678-6689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment of IL-1β promoter (position -3690 to -3267) was linked upstream of a luciferase gene (KpnI-XhoI). This construct was obtained with the forward primer 5′-AGAAACTGGCAGGTACCAAACCTCTTCGAGGCACAA-3′ and the backward primer 5′-TGTAATAAGCCATCATTTCACTCGAGAGCTCAGGTA-3′. The pGL3(NF-κB)-luciferase plasmid was transiently transfected into the primary HMDM cells using jetPEI-Man transfection reagent (Qbiogene, Illkirch, France). A β-galactosidase expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) was co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. Twenty hours following transfection, a fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% Nutridoma-HU was added. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 2 h and then with 5 μg/ml rhTrx-1. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 30 min, and subjected to luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase assays (Roche Diagnostics). Nuclear Protein Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear proteins were extracted from 1.2 × 106 human macrophages grown in 100-mm2 culture dishes that were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 10 min at 1800 × g as described previously (40Furman C. Rundlof A.K. Larigauderie G. Jaye M. Bricca G. Copin C. Kandoussi A.M. Fruchart J.C. Arner E.S. Rouis M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the probe used was as follows. For κB, 5′-CAGAGGGACTTTCCGAGA-3′, briefly, double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing equimolar complementary oligonucleotides, either labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP (κB) or end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by Chroma-spin 30 (Clontech) as described in Furman et al. (40Furman C. Rundlof A.K. Larigauderie G. Jaye M. Bricca G. Copin C. Kandoussi A.M. Fruchart J.C. Arner E.S. Rouis M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of rhTrx-1 on the expression of inflammatory genes in HMDM, we stimulated the cells with LPS at 1 μg/ml for 2 h followed by the addition of rhTrx-1 at different concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μg/ml for 6 and 24 h. The effect of rhTrx-1 on gene expression was determined using DNA array approach. The results showed a strong down-regulation of the expression of several known potent inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in the presence of rhTrx-1 (data not shown). These results were confirmed by using the real-time PCR approach (not shown for IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α). Because IL-1β has a wide spectrum of inflammatory disorders including atherosclerosis, we selected this cytokine to determine the mechanism used by rhTrx-1 to inhibit its expression on HMDM. Effect of rhTrx-1 on LPS-induced Human IL-1β Expression in HMDM—Since LPS is a well known potent inducer of IL-1β expression on macrophages (41Schilling D. Beissert T. Fenton M.J. Nixdorff K. Cytokine. 2001; 16: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 42Chang C.K. LoCicero III, J. Ann. Thorac.

Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we first stimulated HMDM with LPS at 1 μg/ml for 2 h and thereafter evaluated the effect of rhTrx-1 treatment on IL-1β gene expression. IL-1β mRNA abundance (Fig. 1, A and B) as well as protein levels (Fig. 1C) were induced by LPS. The addition of rhTrx-1 for 6 or 24 h significantly reduced the mRNA levels of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). The maximum inhibitory effect was observed at 5 μg/ml rhTrx-1 treatment. Higher concentrations up to 15 μg/ml did not enhance the inhibitory effect (not shown). At 5 μg/ml rhTrx-1, 97% of mRNA inhibition was observed after 6 h of treatment (p < 0.01) and 60% inhibition after treatment for 24 h (p < 0.05). Moreover, although IL-1β protein secretion was undetectable in cultured media after 6 h of treatment of LPS-activated HMDM with rhTrx-1, its secretion was reduced by 30% after 24 h of treatment with 5 μg/ml rhTrx-1 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). In addition, treatment of HMDM with rhTrx-1 at 5 μg/ml for 6 h after their activation for 2 h with TNFα at 10 ng/ml showed, like LPS, a decrease in p50 and p65 mRNA and an increase in I-κBα mRNA synthesis (data not shown). Effect of rhTrx-1 Treatment on LPS-induced Human IL-1β Promoter Activity in HMDM—A body of evidence indicates that LPS exerts its induction effect through a functional NF-κB site located between -3296 and -3287 bp in the human IL-1β promoter (39Gray J.G.

Chandra G. Clay W.C. Stinnett S.W. Haneline S.A. Lorenz J.J. Patel I.R. Wisely G.B. Furdon P.J. Taylor J.D. Kost T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6678-6689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HMDM were transiently transfected and treated or untreated with rhTrx-1 (5 μg/ml). The result indicated a significant reduction (∼26%, p < 0.01) in the luciferase activity in treated macrophages (Fig. 2).

The mechanisms of light-induced transducin translocation to the IS/ST and its return to the OS during dark adaptation are not well understood. We have probed these mechanisms by examining light-dependent localizations of the transducin-α subunit (Gtα)in mice lacking the photoreceptor GAP-protein RGS9, or expressing the GTPase-deficient mutant GtαQ200L. An illumination threshold for the Gtα movement out of the OS is lower in the RGS9 knockout mice, indicating that the fast inactivation of transducin in the wild-type mice limits its translocation to the IS/ST. Transgenic GtαQ200L mice have significantly diminished levels of proteins involved in cGMP metabolism in rods, most notably the PDE6 catalytic subunits, and severely reduced sensitivity to light. Similarly to the native Gtα, the GtαQ200L mutant is localized to the IS/ST compartment in light-adapted transgenic mice. However, the return of GtαQ200L to the OS during dark adaptation is markedly slower than normal. Thus, the light-dependent translocations of transducin are controlled by the GTP-hydrolysis on Gtα, and apparently, do not require Gtα interaction with RGS9 and PDE6.

Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) propagate a variety of hormonal and sensory signals from specific cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

In rod photoreceptor cells, illuminated rhodopsin stimulates GTP-GDP exchange on the retinal G protein, transducin (Gt) 2The abbreviations used are: GttransducinGtαrod G protein (transducin) α-subunitGtα*effector-competent chimeric GtαPDE6rod outer segment cGMP phosphodiesteraseOSouter segmentISinner segmentsSTsynaptic terminalsR*light-activated rhodopsinuROSurea-stripped ROS membranesGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)ERGelectroretinogram., resulting in dissociation of GtαGTP from Gtβγ and rhodopsin. Gtα in the active GTP-bound conformation stimulates the effector enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6), by displacing the inhibitory γ-subunits (Pγ) from the PDE6 catalytic core (PDE6αβ). cGMP hydrolysis by active PDE6 results in closure of cGMP gated channels in the plasma membrane (4Chabre M.

Physiol. 2002; 264: 153-187Crossref Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The turn-off phase of the visual signal is determined by reactions controlling the lifetimes of photoexcited rhodopsin (R*) and activated transducin. The catalytic function of R* is blocked by the rhodopsin-kinase mediated phosphorylation and the binding of arrestin to phosphorylated R* (6Wilden U. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hydrolysis of GTP switches the Gtα molecule to the inactive GDP-bound conformation and allows reinhibition of PDEαβ by Pγ. RGS9-1, a photoreceptor-specific member of the RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) family, in the complex with Gβ5L acts as a GTPase-activating protein for transducin and thus is a major regulator of the turn-off kinetics of the visual signal (9He W.

The RGS9-1/Gβ5L complex is anchored to disc membranes through the interaction with R9AP (RGS-9-1-anchor protein) that enhances the complex GAP activity (12Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The recovery in the visual transduction cascade and light adaptation of photoreceptors are coupled to the changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A decrease in intracellular Ca2+ concentration resulting from the closure of cGMP-gated channels leads to activation of guanylate cyclase by specific Ca2+-binding guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) and restoration of cGMP levels (15Dizhoor A.M.

The light-induced movement of transducin from the rod outer segments (OS) into the inner segments (IS) and synaptic terminals (ST) of photoreceptor cells, and the movement of arrestin in the opposite direction were known for a long time (17Brann M.R. Cohen L.V. Science. 1987; 235: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Philp N.J. Chang W. Long K.

This phenomenon has attracted renewed attention with the application of quantitative approaches involving tangential microsectioning of flat mounted retinas (20Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A reduction in the transducin content in the rod outer segment because of its translocation was correlated with a decrease in the amplification of the photoresponse, suggesting that the protein redistribution is a novel mechanism contributing to light adaptation (20Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A recent study concluded that the distribution of arrestin is controlled by its interactions with rhodopsin in the OS and microtubules in the IS, and the movement of arrestin occurs by simple diffusion (21Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Gurevich V.V. Slepak V.Z. Neuron. 2005; 46: 555-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of transducin translocation to the IS/ST in the light and back to the OS during dark adaptation remain largely unknown. Diffusion and active transport represent two potential general modes for the transducin translocation (20Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In a diffusion model, the light-induced dissociation of GtαGTP and Gtβγ from the disc membranes simply allows them to diffuse into the IS/ST. In the IS/ST, Gtα is converted into the GDP-bound state, forms a heterotrimer with Gtβγ, and returns by diffusion to the OS during dark adaptation. Gt accumulates in the OS in the dark due to its affinity for the disc membranes and, perhaps, binding to the ground-state rhodopsin (22Alves I.D. Salgado G.F. Salamon Z. Brown M.F. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 198-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on the model, the kinetics and/or the illumination threshold for Gtα movement to the IS should depend on the rate of transducin inactivation. GTPase-deficient mutants of Gtα can be predicted to undergo a rapid translocation to the IS and have slower return kinetics during dark adaptation. We have examined the mechanism of transducin movement using the RGS9 knock-out (11Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and GTPase-deficient GtαQ200L mouse models. In agreement with the diffusion hypothesis, the illumination threshold for the Gtα movement to the IS/ST is lower in the RGS9-/- mice, and the return of GtαQ200L to the OS during dark adaptation of the transgenic mice is markedly slower than normal. The GtαQ200L mice show dramatic down-regulation of the rod PDE6 catalytic subunits. Therefore, the observation of light-dependent movement of transducin in these mice suggests that the translocation mechanism is independent of the transducin/PDE6 interaction. Generation of EE-tagged Gtα and GtαQ200L Transgenic Mice—All experimental procedures involving the use of mice were carried out in accordance with the NIH guidelines and the protocols approved by the University of Iowa, University of Utah, and Virginia Commonwealth University Animal Care and Use Committees. A pBRH Gtα transgenic construct containing the mouse Gtα genomic sequence of ∼5.5 kb (23Raport C.J. Dere B. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7122-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) flanked by the 4.4-kb mouse opsin promoter fragment (24Lem J. Applebury M.L. Falk J.D. Flannery J.G. Simon M.I. Neuron. 1991; 6: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and polyadenylation signal was kindly provided by Dr. J. Lem (New England Medical Center). The Glu-Glu (EE) monoclonal antibody epitope was introduced into Gtα to quantitatively assess the level of expression of the transgene (see Fig. 1). Two substitutions required to convert Gtα sequence 162GYVPTE167 into the epitope sequence EYMPTE were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, a similar procedure was used to generate the transgene for expression of the EE-tagged GtαQ200L (see Fig. 1). DNA fragments of 9-kb were released from the pBRH-GtαEE and pBRH-GtαEEQ200L plasmids by restriction with NotI and gel purification. The GtαEE and GtαEEQ200L DNA fragments were microinjected into mouse embryos and implanted into pseudopregnant females in the transgenic core facilities at University of Utah. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR of mouse tail DNA with a pair of primers chosen to amplify a 300-bp fragment surrounding the junction between the Gtα and polyadenylation signal sequences. Fifteen potential GtαEE transgenic founders were generated; nine of them transmitted the transgenes after mating with C57BL/6 mice, and five transgenic lines expressed the GtαEE protein as assessed by Western blotting with anti-EE antibodies. Two GtαEEQ200L founders were obtained, and both transmitted the transgenes. One GtαEE line and one GtαEEQ200L line with high levels of transgene expression across the retina were selected for characterization and breeding with the rod Gtα knock-out mice (25Calvert P.D. Krasnoperova N.V. Lyubarsky A.L. Isayama T. Nicolo M. Kosaras B. Wong G. Gannon K.S. Margolskee R.F. Sidman R.L. Pugh Jr., E.N. Makino C.L. Lem J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunoblot Analysis and Quantification of Transgene Expression—Total mouse retinal homogenates were obtained by solubilization of 1-2 retinas in 200 μl of 10% SDS-Na using brief sonication and heating. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay and bovine serum albumin dissolved in 10% SDS-Na as a standard. Typically, a total protein content of a homogenate obtained from a single mouse retina was ∼400 μg. Samples of retinal homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% gels, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against rod Tα (K-20), anti-Gβ1 (M-14), anti-Gγ1 (P-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), EE-epitope (CRP, Berkley, CA), rod opsin (1D4) (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN), PDE6α (PA1-720), PDE6β (PA1-722), GRK1 (MA1-720) (ABR, Golden, CO), RGS9-469-484 (Elmira Biologicals, Iowa City), AIPL1 (gift of Dr. J. Hurley, University of Washington), Pγ-63-87 (gift of Dr. R. Cote, University of New Hampshire), GC-E, anti-GC-F (gift of Dr. D. Garbers, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), GCAP1, or GCAP2 (gift of Dr. A Dizhoor, Pennsylvania College of Optometry) antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-sheep antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The EE-tagged transducinlike chimeric Gtα* (Gtα*EE) and the Q200L mutant (Gtα*Q200L) were constructed by PCR-directed mutagenesis similarly as described previously (26Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6969-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli-expressed and purified Gtα*EE was used as a standard. In control experiments, the immunoblot signals of Gtα*EE were not notably affected by the presence of up to 40 μg of retinal extracts from Gtα-/- mice (not shown). Nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to film, and integrated densities of scanned individual bands were measured with Scion Image software (version 4.0.3.2). Immunofluorescence—For dark adaptation, mice were kept in the dark for an indicated period of time (up to 30 days). All dark procedures were performed under infrared illumination using night vision goggles. For light adaptation, the pupils were dilated by applying a drop of 1% tropicamide, followed by a drop of 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride 30 min prior to light exposure. During light exposure, mice that were free to move were kept in a Styrofoam box (20 × 15 × 15 cm) covered with semi-transparent polyethylene film to diffuse light. Light from white fluorescent bulbs in the ceiling was used for strong light exposure (∼500 lux, 45 min). Low level light exposures (2-8 lux, 25 min) were achieved with light from a light table reflected by a white ceiling. These conditions provided a uniform illumination from all directions as measured with a LX-1010B digital lux meter. The mice were euthanized with CO2. Mouse eyeballs were enucleated, poked through the cornea with a 21-gauge needle, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 22 °C. After fixation, the eyeballs were cut in half, the cornea and lens were removed, and the eyecups were submersed in a 30% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 h at 4°C. The eyecups were then embedded in tissue freezing medium (TBS) and frozen on dry ice. Radial sectioning (10 μm) of the retina was performed using a cryomicrotome Microm HM 505E. Retinal cryosections were air-dried and kept at -80 °C until use. Before staining, sections were warmed up to 25 °C and incubated in 0.1% Triton/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min followed by incubation with 2% normal goat serum/5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Then sections were incubated with rabbit anti-rod Gtα antibody K-20 (1:2000), anti-Gβ1 M-14 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), a monoclonal anti-EE antibody (1:2000) (CRP, Berkley, CA), or rabbit anti-Pγ-63-87 antibodies (1:10,000) for 3 h. Following a 1-h incubation with goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 546 or goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) (1:1000), the sections were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Fluorescence signal quantification was performed using Scion Image for Windows software (version 4.0.3.2). Electroretinography—The mice were dark-adapted overnight and prepared for recording the next morning under infrared illumination after anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine (150 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and xylazine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal). The body temperature was maintained at 35-37 °C using a homeothermic blanket. Pupils were dilated using equal parts of topical phenylephrine (2.5%) and tropicamide (1%). Drops of 0.9% saline were applied onto the cornea to prevent its dehydration and allow electrical contact with the recording electrode (a gold wire loop). A platinum subdermal needle was inserted under the scalp and between the two eyes to serve as the reference electrode. Amplification (at 1-1000-Hz bandpass, without notch filtering), stimuli presentation, and data acquisition were performed on the UTAS-E 3000 visual diagnostic system from LKC Technologies Inc. Scotopic ERG responses to single flash presentations (10-μsec duration) at increasing intensities covering a range from -3.6 to 1.4 log cds/m2 were recorded. To ensure the dark-adapted state of the animals, interstimulus intervals have been programmed to increase from 10 s at lowest stimulus intensity to 2 min at highest stimulus intensity. Two GtαEEQ200L mice were analyzed by ERG with similar results. Trypsin Protection Test—One GtαEE retina and one GtαEEQ200L retina from the dark-adapted mice (30-day dark adaptation) were homogenized in the dark by sonication in 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH = 8.0), containing 100 mm NaCl and 4 mm MgSO4. Aliquots of retinal homogenates (15 μl) were incubated with trypsin (10 μg/aliquot) for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by the addition of 50 μg of soy bean trypsin inhibitor. Additional aliquots of retinal homogenates were photobleached, followed by the addition of 100 μm GTPγS or GTP. After 5-min incubation at 22 °C, the aliquots were treated with trypsin as above and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-EE antibodies Single Turnover GTPase Assay—Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out in suspensions of uROS membranes (5 μm rhodopsin) reconstituted with Gtα* or Gtα*Q200L (0.5 μm) and Gtβγ (0.5 μm) as previously described (27Arshavsky V.Y. Gray-Keller M.P. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18530-18537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The GTPase reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼4 × 105 dpm/pmol). The GTPase rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to an exponential function: %GTP hydrolyzed = 100(1 - e-kt), where k is a rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. Transducin Translocation in RGS9 Knock-out Mice—A general translocation of Gtα in the rods of the RGS9 knock-out mice was examined following exposure of the dark-adapted mice to moderate illumination conditions (500 lux, 45 min). This light exposure caused redistribution of Gtα from the OS to the IS/ST, similarly to that observed in control C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2). To assess the return of Gt to the OS, the RGS9-/- and control mice were exposed to light (500 lux, 45 min) and then dark-adapted for 4, 10, or 24 h. The immunostaining of retinal cross-sections from the dark-adapted mice demonstrated that redistribution of Gtα during dark adaptation is similar in RGS9-/- and control mice, and is largely complete within 10-h in the dark (Fig. 2). Quantification of protein distribution by immunofluorescence intensity has its limitations because of the potential antibody epitope masking and other related artifacts (20Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the estimates of Gtα content in the OS of the light- and dark-adapted wild type and RGS9-/- mice by immunofluorescence are similar to those obtained previously by a more quantitative procedure of tangential retina microsectioning combined with immunoblotting (Fig. 2B) (29Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The conditions of minimal illumination that cause movement of Gtα in control dark-adapted mice with dilated pupils were determined by varying the level of illuminance and the time of light exposure. The distribution of Gtα in mouse retinas from C57BL/6 mice after the light exposure equivalent to 2 photopic lux over 25 min was found to be identical to the Gtα distribution in the dark-adapted animals (Fig. 3). Small, but detectable movement of Gtα to the IS was observed in the control retinas using illumination of 4 and 8 lux for 25 min (Fig. 3). In contrast to control mice, the lowest level of light exposure (2 lux, 25 min) induced a considerable translocation of Gtα to the rod IS/ST in the RGS9-/- mice (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Translocation of Gtα in RGS9-/- rods in response to dim light. Retinal distribution of Gtα in RGS9-/- and control C57BL/6 (WT) mice dark-adapted for 24 h or after exposing the dark-adapted animals to dim light (2 lux, 25 min). The sections were stained with rabbit anti-rod Gtα antibody and visualized with goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 546 secondary antibodies. Bar, 10 μm.

The EE-tag at the selected position had no effect on the signaling activity of different G protein α subunits including Gαq, Gαs, and Gαi (30Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that the EE-epitope does not affect the key biochemical properties of Gtα, whereas the Q200L mutation impairs its GTPase activity in vitro. The EE-tagged transducin-like chimeric Gtα* (26Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

The impact of the Q200L mutation on Gtα was assessed by measuring single turnover GTP hydrolysis in the reconstituted system with Gtα*Q200L, Gtβγ, and urea-treated ROS as a source of R*. The kcat for GTP hydrolysis by Gtα* was 0.019 s-1 (Fig. 5). The Q200L mutation reduced the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gtα* under these conditions by at least 10-fold (Fig. 5). Even larger decreases in the rate constants of GTP-hydrolysis had been reported for the Gαs and Gαi Q/L mutants (32Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Examination of the levels of major phototransduction proteins revealed no significant differences between the GtαEE mice and control non-transgenic animals (not shown). In contrast, the rod PDE6 catalytic subunits were dramatically down-regulated in the GtαEEQ200L mice (Fig. 6A). The levels of GC-1, GC-2, GCAP-1, and GCAP2 were also significantly decreased (Fig. 6A). The reduction in the PDE6 content caused by the GTPase-deficient mutant is in agreement with a similar observation made in transgenic mice expressing the cone GtαQ204L mutant in mouse rods (34Raport C.J.

The morphology of GtαEEQ200L animals at 1 month of age was found to be largely normal (Fig. 6B). The analysis of scotopic ERG responses of dark-adapted GtαEEQ200L mice revealed that the response threshold is elevated by three orders of magnitude in comparison to wild type controls, indicating a severe reduction of light sensitivity in transgenic rods (Fig. 6C). After breeding the transgenic mice with the Gtα knock-out mice (25Calvert P.D. Krasnoperova N.V. Lyubarsky A.L. Isayama T. Nicolo M. Kosaras B. Wong G. Gannon K.S. Margolskee R.F. Sidman R.L.

The total levels of transducin were similar in the GtαEE and control mice and slightly lower in the GtαEEQ200L mice (∼85%). Relative to the native Gtα in the wild type mice, the hemizygous GtαEE mice were estimated to express ∼50% of GtαEE, whereas the hemizygous GtαEEQ200L mice expressed ∼40% GtαEEQ200L (Fig. 7). Localization and Translocation of Transducin in the GtαEEQ200L Mice—The immunofluorescence staining of retinal sections from the light- (500 lux, 45 min) and dark-adapted hemizygous GtαEE transgenic mice using anti-rod Gtα and anti-EE antibodies demonstrated a wild type-like light-induced translocation of GtαEE to the IS/ST and its return to the OS during dark adaptation (Fig. 8). Similarly, GtαEEQ200L was primarily localized to the IS/ST compartments in the light-exposed GtαEEQ200L mice (Fig. 8). However, the return of GtαEEQ200L to the OS during dark adaptation of the transgenic mice was markedly slower. Only a partial relocalization of GtαEEQ200L to the OS was observed after a 5-day period of dark adaptation. The mutant Gtα apparently continued to accumulate in the OS during extended dark adaptation for 30 days, but its return was still incomplete with a fraction of GtαEEQ200L present in the IS/ST (Fig. 8). The distribution of Gtβγ in the light-(500 lux, 45 min) and dark-adapted GtαEE and GtαEEQ200L mice was probed using anti-Gtβ antibodies (Fig. 9). This analysis confirmed light-dependent translocation of transducin in rods expressing the GTPase-deficient mutant. A fraction of Gtβγ also remained in the IS/ST after a 30-day dark adaptation of the transgenic animals (Fig. 9).FIGURE 9Light-dependent distribution of Gtβγ in retinas of GtαEE and GtαEEQ200L mice.

To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the nuclear translocation of VDR, we utilized an in vitro nuclear transport assay using digitonin-permeabilized semi-intact cells. In this assay, recombinant whole VDR-(4-427) and a truncated mutant VDR-(4-232) lacking the carboxyl terminus of VDR were imported to nuclei even in the absence of ligand. In contrast, VDR-(91-427) lacking the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain was not imported to nuclei in the absence of ligand, and was efficiently imported in its liganded form. These results suggested that there are two distinct mechanisms underlying the nuclear transport of VDR; ligand-dependent and -independent pathways, and that the different regions of VDR are responsible for these processes. Therefore, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using VDR-(4-232) as the bait to explore the molecules responsible for ligand-independent nuclear translocation of VDR, and have identified importin 4 as an interacting protein. In the reconstruction experiments where transport factors were applied as recombinant proteins, recombinant importin 4 facilitated nuclear translocation of VDR regardless of its ligand, whereas importin β failed in transporting VDR even in the presence of ligand.

Nuclear receptors including VDR act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, and consist of several functional domains to regulate the expression of the target genes (1Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K.

Utilizing its DNA-binding domain, VDR recognizes a vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) in the target genes, and regulates the expressions via forming complexes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and transcriptional co-factors on its ligand-binding domain. To fulfill these events on the genome, nuclear receptors must be localized in nuclei. However, it seems that the subcellular distributions of the nuclear receptors do not resemble each other, unlike their transcriptional regulatory systems. Several reports have demonstrated that VDR is located in nuclei even in the absence of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and is accumulated in nuclei to a greater extent by addition of the ligand (4Milde P. Merke J.

These observations are in contrast with the cases of other nuclear receptors, glucocorticoid receptor or estrogen receptor; the former translocates from the cytoplasm into nuclei only in the presence of the ligand, and the latter is located in nuclei regardless of the ligand (7Ogawa H.

In cells of eukaryotes, nucleoplasm is separated from cytoplasm with nuclear envelope, which is perforated by numbers of large apparatus consisting of specific proteins. The assembled structures, termed nuclear pore complexes, are composed of subunits of nucleoporins, and act as the sole gatekeepers controlling the exchange of materials between the two compartments (9Davis L.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 865-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 10Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although nuclear pore complexes are freely permeable to small molecules (such as water and ions) with passive diffusion, they restrict the movement of larger molecules (such as proteins and RNAs) across the nuclear envelope. To overcome the barrier, larger molecules harbor signal sequences that allow them to access the nuclear transport machinery (11Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 12Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 13Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The import of cargo molecules such as transcription factors and signal transducers through nuclear pore complexes is mediated by the nuclear transport factors such as importin β, which binds cargoes and nucleoporins simultaneously through separate domains (14Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the case of classical nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins, importin α bridges the interaction between the NLS motif and importin β (14Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Another common element in the process is the small GTPase Ran in its GTP-bound form (Ran-GTP), whose binding to importin β triggers the dissociation of the complex consisting of importin α, importin β, and the cargoes. Ran exists mostly in its GTP-bound form in nuclei and in a GDP-bound form in cytoplasm. Such a Ran-GTP gradient across the nuclear envelope prompts the release of cargoes only in nucleoplasm, ensuring the accumulation of the cargoes in nuclei. Recent advances have demonstrated that the members of the importin β-like family can recognize cargoes harboring atypical NLSs, and transport them into nuclei independently of importin α (14Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The importin α-independent pathways also function in a Ran-dependent manner. Although the general mechanisms of nuclear transport are rather well understood as described above, the specific role of the importin β family other than importin β remains to be determined. In addition, the nuclear transport system for VDR has not yet been clarified. In the current study, we have investigated the nuclear import process of VDR utilizing an in vitro nuclear transport assay. Our results have demonstrated that VDR possesses two distinct nuclear transport pathways, i.e. the ligand-dependent and -independent pathways, and that the different regions of VDR are responsible for these processes. The exploration of the molecules involved in the nuclear import of VDR utilizing the yeast two-hybrid screening have revealed the interaction of VDR and importin 4, and the recombinant importin 4 was capable of transporting VDR into nuclei regardless of the presence or absence of the ligand. Cell Culture and Transfections—Monkey kidney epithelial cell line COS7 was maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) stripped with dextran-coated charcoal to remove endogenous steroids. Human fibroblastic cell line HeLa was cultured under the same conditions as described above except that non-stripped fetal bovine serum was used. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6® (Roche Diagnostics). Antibodies—Antibodies against VDR, 9A7, and D-6 were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Neshanic Station, NJ) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Anti-RXR antibody (D-20) and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody (B-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz, and anti-FLAG® antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The expression vector of the human VDR, pSG5-hVDR, was kindly provided by Dr. M. R. Haussler, University of Arizona (15Baker A.R. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Crisp T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Haussler M.R. Pike J.W. Shine J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3294-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid number is indicated according to the original paper concerning the human VDR cDNA (GenBank® accession number J03258), pSG5-VDR itself contains the VDR cDNA that starts from the second translation start point because of the existence of polymorphism, resulting in 424 amino acids (aa 4-427). To construct the bacterial expression vector, pGEX2T-hVDR, the fragment excised with EcoRI from pSG5-hVDR was subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The truncated mutants of VDR-(4-232) and VDR-(91-427) were obtained by digestion of pSG5-hVDR with appropriate restriction endonucleases and inserted into pGEX-2T vector. The GST fusion proteins were then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were then collected and disrupted in sonication buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. GST fusions bound on glutathione-Sepharose were washed extensively with the sonication buffer. For GST pull-down experiments, the fusions on glutathione-Sepharose were utilized directly after equilibration. If necessary, the fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose and cleaved to remove GST with thrombin. The soluble proteins passed through the desalting columns were equilibrated with required buffers, followed by concentration using a Vivaspin® Concentrator (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). The purity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Human importin 4 cDNA containing full-length open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number AK057277; equal to NM_024658) was purchased from the Helix Institute (Kisarazu, Japan). To prepare recombinant importin 4, bacterial expression vector was constructed by insertion of importin 4 cDNA into pGEX-6P-3 followed by expression, extraction, and purification of the recombinant protein as described above. The vectors pGEX-HA-PTAC97 encoding mouse importin β with hemagglutinin tag at the amino terminus and pGEX-2T-SV40NLS-GFP containing NLS and green fluorescent protein (Ref. 16Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar; designated as GST-NLSSV40-GFP in this paper) were also utilized to prepare the corresponding recombinant proteins. Ran-GDP and NTF2 were prepared as described previously (17Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Tachibana T. Hieda M. Sekimoto T. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for FLAG®-tagged importins were also constructed using pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the BD Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System (Clontech) following the manufacturer's protocols. The bait vector pAS2-1-VDR-(4-232) was constructed by inserting the same fragment of VDR with that of pGEX-VDR-(4-232) into pAS2-1 (Clontech). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 was transformed with the bait vector, and then subsequently mated with another strain Y187 pretransformed with the human kidney cDNA library. Tranformants were plated onto the synthetic media lacking adenine (Ade), leucine (Leu), histidine (His), and tryptophan (Trp). Ade+ His+ growers were isolated, and subjected to β-galactosidase filter assay. Blue clones were regarded as candidates, and the inserts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for the library plasmid, followed by sequencing. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—To construct mammalian two-hybrid vectors, the carboxyl-terminal fragment of importin 4 (aa 846-1081) was released by SacII/XbaI digestion and fused in-frame into pM vector (Clontech), resulting in pM-IMP4. Whole cDNA of human VDR was released by EcoRI digestion from pSG5-hVDR and inserted inframe into pVP16 vector (pVP16-hVDR), and further cDNA fragments of human VDR were excised by digestion with appropriate restriction endonucleases and cloned to pVP16 vector. The fragment obtained by NaeI/EcoRI digestion of pSG5-hVDR was also cloned into pVP16 vector, resulting in pVP16-hVDR-(81-427). A luciferase reporter plasmid was generated by the insertion of 5 copies of consensus GAL4 binding sites into pGVP2 vector (Toyo Ink Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and designated as pGVP2-GAL4BS. Various combinations of the mammalian two-hybrid vectors constructed as above were transfected with pGVP2-GAL4BS and β-galactosidase expression vector into COS7 cells. If necessary, cells were treated with 10-8 m 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activities of the lysates were then evaluated using a luciferase assay kit (Toyo Ink Co. Ltd.). The reporter activities were standardized by the β-galactosidase activities of the same lysates. In Vitro Binding Assay—To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Co.)) and gently rocked at 4 °C for 10 min. The mixture was sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then diluted to 5-fold with dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and Complete® EDTA-free). The diluted extracts were preincubated twice with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min to remove nonspecific binding proteins, and were then incubated with various GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Sepharose beads were washed extensively with dilution buffer, and interacted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. In Vitro Nuclear Transport Assay—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml on 8-well multitest slides (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) 24 h before use. The cells grown on the slides were rinsed twice in ice-cold transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm CH3COOK, 2 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 5 mm CH3COONa, and 0.5 mm EGTA) and permeabilized for 5 min in ice-cold transport buffer containing 40 μg/ml digitonin, 2 mm DTT, and Complete® EDTA-free (Roche). After washed and immersed in ice-cold transport buffer containing 2 mm DTT and Complete® EDTA-free for 10 min, the slides were blotted to remove excess buffer, and the reaction mixtures were applied to each well. Import reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C. Then the slides were rinsed twice in the transport buffer, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After being rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, the fixed slides were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 7 min at room temperature and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using specific antibody against VDR or GST. The second antibodies were labeled with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). The import of GST-NLSSV40-GFP was detected by direct fluorescence. Each transport reaction mixture contained an import substrate combined with HeLa cytosolic fraction as a source of nuclear transport factors or a combination of recombinant transport factors with an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). HeLa cytosolic fraction was prepared as previously described (19Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8559-8565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-VDR Fusion Proteins—The construction of the expression plasmid coding GFP-tagged whole hVDR-(4-427) was previously described (6Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33531-33538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the termination codon in a GFP fusion vector pGreen Lantern-1 (Invitrogen) was mutated to a new HindIII site, where the full-length hVDR cDNA obtained from pSG5-hVDR was inserted to yield a fusion protein in-frame. We also modified pGreen Lantern vector to possess a multiple cloning site at the position of original termination codon of GFP (designated as pGreen Lantern-MCS) (6Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33531-33538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and constructed pGreen Lantern-hVDR-(81-427) by cloning the NaeI/EcoRI fragment of pSG5-hVDR into pGreenLantern-MCS in-frame. Characterization of Nuclear Transport of VDR by an in Vitro Nuclear Transport Assay—The nuclear translocation of VDR was characterized in an in vitro nuclear transport assay that uses digitonin-permeabilized cells (20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). When the recombinant protein for whole VDR (aa 4-427: see “Materials and Methods”) was applied to this system, it was imported to nuclei in the presence of cytosolic extracts prepared from HeLa cells as a source of nuclear transport factors, whereas VDR failed to enter nuclei without cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1A). Utilizing two specific antibodies that recognize the different epitopes of VDR, we obtained completely identical results. Treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 did not further enhance the transport activity of the cytosolic extracts. A recombinant protein that contains the classical NLS of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (21Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), designated as GST-NLSSV40-GFP, was also used as the cargo protein to confirm the quality and fidelity of the assay system. As previously proved, GST-NLSSV40-GFP was imported to nuclei in the presence of cytosolic extracts and ATP (Fig. 1B). The nuclear accumulation of VDR was entirely blocked by pretreatment with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), suggesting that the nuclear import of VDR was a facilitated procedure involving contacts with nucleoporins that construct the nuclear pore complex (Fig. 1C). The Ligand-dependent and -independent Nuclear Import of VDR—To further characterize the mechanisms underlying the nuclear transport of VDR, we performed a nuclear transport assay using truncated forms of VDR (Fig. 2). In the series of these experiments, GST-VDR fusion protein was utilized as the control, and the obtained results were identical to those of the whole VDR-(4-427) without GST tag, demonstrating that GST does not affect the import process of VDR. Two truncated forms of VDR fused to GST were then constructed, and were subjected to the assay. One mutant contained the amino terminus of VDR-(4-232), and the other contained the carboxyl terminus of VDR and lacked the DNA-binding domain (aa 91-427). GST-VDR-(4-232) displayed cytosol-dependent, ligand-independent nuclear translocation in this system, which was similar to the case of GST-VDR-(4-427) (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, GST-VDR-(91-427) was not transported in the absence of ligand, and the addition of 1α,25(OH)2D3 resulted in the efficient nuclear import of GST-VDR-(91-427) (Fig. 2A). All nuclear import observed in this assay was inhibited completely by WGA treatment, suggesting that the cargoes were transported into nuclei through nuclear pore complexes (Fig. 2B). To confirm the effect of the ligand on the process, we carried out the assay utilizing GST-VDR-(4-427) and GST-VDR-(91-427) carrying the R274A mutation, which results in ligand binding deficiency. GST-VDR-(4-427) carrying R274A (GST-VDR-(4-427)R274A) entered nuclei via the nuclear pore as well as wild-type GST-VDR-(4-427) (GST-VDR-(4-427)WT). On the other hand, GST-VDR-(91-427) carrying R274A (GST-VDR-(91-427)R274A) failed to enter nuclei even in the presence of the ligand, which is different from the case of GST-VDR-(91-427)WT (Fig. 3). These results supported the notion that VDR has two distinct types of nuclear import signals, i.e. ligand-dependent and -independent pathways, and that the different regions of VDR may be responsible for these processes.FIGURE 3Ligand-dependent and -independent pathways in the nuclear translocation of VDR. Recombinant GST-VDR-(4-427) and GST-VDR-(91-427) with (R274A) or without (WT) the R274A mutation, which results in the defect in ligand binding, were utilized as the cargoes in the import reactions. These recombinants were incubated with or without HeLa cytoplasmic extract (cytosol) and 10-8m 1α,25(OH)2D3 for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of an ATP-regeneration system. Then the reaction mixtures were added to digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. In some reactions, the digitonin-permeabilized cells were pretreated with 0.4 mg/ml WGA for 10 min at 30 °C (WGA(+)). The subcellular distribution of cargoes was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against GST. As to the GST-VDR-(4-427), both WT and R274A were imported independently of ligand. On the other hand, GST-VDR-(91-427) without the mutation was imported in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas that with R274A failed to enter nuclei even in the presence of ligand. Pretreatment of the digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells with WGA abolished all the nuclear import.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Novel Interacting Proteins of VDR—We next attempted to identify the molecules responsible for ligand-independent nuclear transport of VDR based on protein-protein interaction. Because GST-VDR-(4-232) exhibited ligand-independent nuclear import as well as whole VDR, we screened a human kidney cDNA library with a yeast two-hybrid method using the fragment corresponding to VDR-(4-232) as bait. The obtained transformants were selected for growth on the synthetic media that lacked specific nutrients, followed by β-galactosidase filter assay. The selected clones were then analyzed by PCR using vector-specific primers followed by sequencing to identify the inserted genes. Among them, there was a clone carrying the gene fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal region (aa 824-1081) of human importin 4 (GenBank™ accession number NM_024658), a relatively new member of the importin β-family, and we selected the molecule for further analysis. Interaction between VDR and the carboxyl-terminal region of importin 4 was further confirmed by a mammalian two-hybrid assay, which detected protein-protein interaction and ligand dependence in vivo. The interaction between the carboxyl terminus of importin 4 (aa 845-1081; pM-IMP4) and VDR occurred independently of ligand (Fig. 4B). It is well known that the binding of 1α,25(OH)2D3 enhances the heterodimerization of VDR with RXR, which was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using the GST-VDR-(4-427) recombinant protein (Fig. 4C). We then examined whether ligand might affect the association of importin 4 and VDR utilizing the in vitro binding assay. It was revealed that GST-VDR-(4-427)WT pulled down FLAG-tagged full-length importin 4 regardless of treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3, whereas importin β, a typical nuclear transport factor, did not bind to VDR in either its liganded and unliganded form (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that the interaction between VDR and importin 4 did not require the ligand. In parallel with this observation, recombinant GST-VDR-(4-427)R274A lacking the capability to bind ligand also pulled down importin 4 as well as GST-VDR-(4-427)WT (Fig. 4C). Next, the pull-down analyses utilizing a series of truncated VDR proteins were performed to investigate which region of VDR is responsible for the interaction with importin 4. In addition to GST-VDR-(4-232), we prepared two more GST fusion proteins containing VDR-(4-90) and VDR-(91-232), respectively, which made up the yeast two-hybrid bait, and then applied them to the in vitro binding assay to map the interacting region of VDR. Although GST-VDR-(4-232) and GST-VDR-(4-90) were able to bind importin 4, only the background level of binding was detected between importin 4 and GST-VDR-(91-232) (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that aa 4-90 corresponding to the DNA-binding domain was essential for the interaction with importin 4. In addition, the in vitro binding assay also demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of importin 4 was important for the interaction (Fig. 5). GST-VDR-(4-427) pulled down the various forms of importin 4 from each cell lysate except for the importin 4ΔC, a carboxyl-terminal truncated form (Fig. 5). Importin 4 Mediates the Ligand-independent Nuclear Import of VDR—Finally, to investigate whether importin 4 is the molecule that confers the nuclear translocation of VDR, we performed the in vitro nuclear transport assay where all the required components were supplied as recombinant proteins. It has already been established that nuclear transport can be reconstructed using the in vitro nuclear transport assay with the recombinant proteins of Ran-GDP, NTF2, and nuclear transport factors instead of cytosolic extracts (22Sekimoto T. Fukumoto M. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). If importin 4 is the molecule responsible for nuclear transport of VDR, VDR can be imported to nuclei in the presence of recombinant importin 4, such as in the system driven with the HeLa cytosol. Indeed, whole VDR (aa 4-427) was steadily imported to nuclei in the prese"

PS2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including hearts. In this study, we examined cardiac phenotypes of PS2 knockout (PS2KO) mice to elucidate a role of PS2 in hearts. PS2KO mice developed normally with no evidence of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Invasive hemodynamic analysis revealed that cardiac contractility in PS2KO mice increased compared with that in their littermate controls. A study of isolated papillary muscle showed that peak amplitudes of Ca2+ transients and peak tension were significantly higher in PS2KO mice than those in their littermate controls. PS2KO mouse hearts exhibited no change in expression of calcium regulatory proteins. Since it has been demonstrated that PS2 in brain interacts with sorcin, which serves as a modulator of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), we tested whether PS2 also interacts with RyR2. Immmunoprecipitation analysis showed that PS2, sorcin, and RyR2 interact with each other in HEK-293 cells overexpressing these proteins or in mouse hearts. Immunohistochemistry of heart muscle indicated that PS2 colocalizes with RyR2 and sorcin at the Z-lines. Elevated Ca2+ attenuated the association of RyR2 with PS2, whereas the association of sorcin with PS2 was enhanced. The enhanced Ca2+ transients and contractility in PS2KO mice were observed at low extracellular [Ca2+] but not at high levels of [Ca2+]. Taken together, our results suggest that PS2 plays an important role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by interacting with RyR2."
https://openalex.org/W2045082628,"The terminal ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, termed telomeres, progressively shorten during each round of cell division eventually leading cells into senescence. Tumor cells typically overcome this barrier to unlimited proliferation by activation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. In contrast, in most human somatic cells hTERT expression is tightly repressed by multiple tumor suppressors. Here, we studied the regulation of hTERT by the p53 family member p73. We show that forced expression of p73 or activation of endogenous p73 by E2F1 results in the downregulation of telomerase activity. Vice versa, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p73 induces hTERT expression. Responsiveness to p73 is conferred by Sp1 binding sites within the hTERT core promoter. In tumor cells, p73 isoforms lacking the transactivation domain (DeltaNp73) are frequently overexpressed and believed to function as oncogenes. We show that DeltaNp73 antagonizes the repressive effect of the proapoptotic p53 family members on hTERT expression and, in addition, induces hTERT expression in telomerase-negative cells by interfering with E2F-RB-mediated repression of the hTERT core promoter. These data provide evidence that the p73 gene functions as an important regulator of telomerase activity with implications for embryonic development, cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2092816832,"Telomerase is induced in certain pathological conditions such as cancer and tissue injury and repair. This induction in fibroblasts from injured lung is repressed by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) via yet unknown mechanisms. In this study, the role of Smad3 in the inhibition of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene transcription by TGFβ was investigated. The rat TERT (rTERT) gene promoter was cloned by PCR amplification and fused with a luciferase reporter gene. This construct was used to analyse regulation of promoter activity in fibroblasts isolated from bleomycin-injured lung with induced telomerase activity. The results showed that TGFβ inhibited rTERT transcription while stimulating Smad3 expression. Interestingly, TGFβ also inhibited the expression of c-myc. Cotransfection with a Smad3 expressing plasmid further repressed rTERT transcription and c-myc expression, while cotransfection with the corresponding antisense Smad3 construct had the opposite effect. Mutation of an E-box in the rTERT promoter suppressed its activity, which could be further reduced by TGFβ treatment. In contrast, mutation at a Smad binding element enhanced promoter activity whose inhibition was impaired by TGFβ treatment. Thus TGFβ inhibition of rTERT gene expression was directly mediated by Smad3 via the Smad binding element, while c-myc appears to primarily regulate its constitutive or induced expression."

Factors that control the redox chemistry of the heme attachment reaction to apocytochrome c are known in bacteria and plastids but not in mitochondria. We have explored the function of Cyc2p, a candidate redox cytochrome c assembly component in yeast mitochondria. We show that Cyc2p is required for the activity of CCHL toward apocytochrome c and c1 and becomes essential for the heme attachment to apocytochrome c1 carrying a CAPCH instead of CAACH heme binding site. A redox function for Cyc2p in the heme lyase reaction is suggested from 1) the presence of a noncovalently bound FAD molecule in the C-terminal domain of Cyc2p, 2) the localization of Cyc2p in the inner membrane with the FAD binding domain exposed to the intermembrane space, and 3) the ability of recombinant Cyc2p to carry the NADPH-dependent reduction of ferricyanide.

Cytochromes define a large and structurally diverse class of heme containing proteins that are active in electron transfer (1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Since they were first recognized in the 1920s, cytochromes have been the focus of intense investigation from mechanism to structure and now to the details of their maturation. Type c cytochromes are a distinct subgroup of cytochromes characterized by a covalently attached protoheme IX prosthetic group that is linked via thioether bonds to cysteine residues in a CXXCH motif (where X can represent any amino acid except cysteine), also referred to as a heme binding site (1Thöny-Meyer L.

Besides their well recognized role in bioenergetic redox chemistry, c-type cytochromes can also be recruited to function in antioxidative pathways, signaling, and regulation (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This diversity in terms of function is paralleled by a diversity in terms of assembly pathways and a surprising finding was the discovery that three pathways (Systems I–III) for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes have evolved in bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria (for reviews, see Refs. 1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Allen J.W. Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser.

The definition of the three systems is based on the occurrence of specific assembly components that are unique to each maturation pathway (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The basis for such a diversity is not obvious, because it appears that the biochemistry to complete holocytochrome c formation is the same regardless of the assembly system under study (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The biochemical requirements for holocytochrome c formation can be divided into functions needed for the transport and delivery of heme, the reduction of apoprotein cysteinyl thiol and heme co-factor prior to the heme ligation reaction, and the catalysis of thioether bond formation (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).

However, the observation that some cyc2 mutations do not solely affect cytochrome c but also impact other unrelated mitochondrial processes led to the perception that Cyc2p acts as a “general” factor for mitochondrial biogenesis (35Sanchez N.S.

Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) modules were chosen to inactivate the wild type copy of the CYC2 and CC1HL genes, respectively. A triple histidine tag was engineered at the 3′-end of the CYC2 gene using plasmid pFA6a-3HA-HIS3MX6 as a template (39Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A.

The arrows indicate the absorption maxima of the a bands of cytochromes c (546 nm), c1 (552 nm), b (558 nm), and a + a3 (602 nm). Note that cytochromes aa3 of cytochrome c oxidase are spectrally detectable in the Δcyc2 cyt1–34 mutant that still assembles a residual level of holocytochrome c (see B). Only low levels of holocytochrome c are required to maintain assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (66Sherman F. Taber H. Campbell W. J. Mol.

B, heme stain of mitochondrial c-type cytochromes. 6 μg of mitochondrial protein from cells grown at 28 °C in galactose medium were analyzed for the abundance of the holoforms of cytochrome c and cytochrome c1. Dithiothreitol-treated samples were separated in a 12% lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The level of holocytochrome c and c1 was assessed by heme staining. CCHL, Cyc2p, and cytochrome b2 (loading control) were detected by immunodetection. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasmid Construction—DNA manipulations were carried out following published procedures (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding amino acids Glu53–Ser366 of Cyc2p was amplified using W303-1A genomic DNA as a template and the following NheI and XhoI engineered oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-GCTAGCTAGCGAGGAGGGAAAACAAACATGAGTTATCTCC-3′;5′-CCGCTCGAGTGAAATTTATACACATTATCGGAGTTC-3′.The NheI/XhoI-digested PCR product was cloned into the NheI-XhoI sites of the hexahistidinyl tag vector pET-24a (Novagen). In the same way, the CCHL open reading frame was amplified using W303-1A genomic DNA as template and the following NdeI and XhoI engineered oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGTTGGTTTTGGGCAGATCAAAAAAC-3′;5′-CCGCTCGAGAGGGGCGGAGGACGAAGAGGACGGACC-3′.The NdeI/XhoI-digested PCR product was cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of pET-24a. Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Novagen) was used for the expression of recombinant His6-tagged Cyc2p and CCHL proteins.Purification of Native Cyc2p-His6—E. coli BL21 transformants carrying the pET-24a plasmid expressing the Cyc2p-His6 protein were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5 and induced at 20 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected 6 h after induction and disrupted by sonication. In these conditions, Cyc2p was found to be mainly soluble in the supernatant after a 15,000 × g, 30-min centrifugation. The presence of the hexahistidinyl tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein allowed rapid purification on nickel-agarose under native conditions in a buffer consisting of 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The protein was bound to nickel-agarose (Qiagen), eluted with 400 mm imidazole, and further purified on a Superdex75 column. The concentration of the purified enzyme was measured by absorbance at 280 nm, and the purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE.Enzymatic Activities—NAD(P)H-ferricyanide reductase activities were assayed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 400 mm ferricyanide and 2.5 mm recombinant soluble Cyc2p-His6. The reduction of ferricyanide was monitored by measuring the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm in a Cary 400 spectrophotometer. Kinetic parameters were determined by measuring initial velocities at different substrate concentrations. Rates were calculated using a Δϵ of 1.04 mm–1 cm–1 for the conversion of ferricyanide. NADH and NADPH were obtained from Sigma.Identification of the Flavin Cofactor—Recombinant Cyc2p-His6 protein was denatured in 4.5 m guanidine chloride and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using negative electrospray and coupled to mass spectrometry. Pure FAD and FMN, obtained from Sigma, were treated in the same fashion and used as mass standards.Production of Antibodies—For generation of anti-Cyc2p and anti-CCHL antisera, rabbits were injected with native Cyc2p (prepared as described above) or denatured CCHL prepared according to QIAexpress purification protocol (Qiagen), respectively. As expected, both anti-Cyc2p and anti-CCHL antibodies immunoreact against mitochondrial proteins of ∼40 and 33 kDa, respectively (see Fig. 3; data not shown).Protein Preparation and Analysis—Mitochondria were purified from yeast grown in galactose medium as described earlier (45Kermorgant M. Bonnefoy N. Dujardin G. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma) or the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Protein samples were analyzed through lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (4 °C) or SDS-PAGE (room temperature) and subsequently immobilized by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 mm). For heme staining of mitochondrial c type cytochromes, samples were reduced with dithiothreitol on ice for 30 min and separated by lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE at 4 °C (46Dutta C. Henry H.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The heme-associated peroxidase activity was revealed directly on membrane-transferred c-type cytochromes by the enhanced chemiluminescence method from Pierce. Polyclonal antibodies raised against CCHL, Cyc2p (this work), cytochrome b2, AAC, Hsp60 (Dr. C. Meisinger, Freiburg, Germany), and cytochrome c1 (Dr. C. Lemaire, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), and monoclonal antibody against HA epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and porin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used for immunodetection of immobilized proteins. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.Biochemical Methods—Hypotonic swelling of mitochondria, subsequent treatment with proteinase K, and carbonate extraction were performed as described (47Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that trichloroacetic precipitation was omitted. When indicated, mitochondria were treated with 30 or 60 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min on ice. After the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10-min incubation on ice, mitochondria were reisolated after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. Mitochondria were sonicated on ice (Bioblock Scientific, 3 × 30 s, duty cycle 40%, output 5), and the soluble fraction was separated from the membrane fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4° C. For carbonate extraction, mitochondria were treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5 or 10.8 (adjusted with HCl), incubated for 20 min on ice, and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Total (T), pellet (P), and supernatant (S) fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For submitochondrial fractionation, 8 mg of mitochondria were resuspended in 4 ml of swelling buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 30 min incubation on ice, sucrose was added to 0.45 m final concentration, and mitochondria were further incubated for 10 min on ice. After sonication (Bioblock Scientific, 3 × 30 s, duty cycle 80%), the remaining intact mitochondria and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of buffer containing 5 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a clarifying spin (15,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (made with 1.4 ml of 55%, 5.1 ml of 46%, 2.3 ml of 38%"
https://openalex.org/W2056658556,"The hexameric cylindrical Hsp100 chaperone ClpA mediates ATP-dependent unfolding and translocation of recognized substrate proteins into the coaxially associated serine protease ClpP. Each subunit of ClpA is composed of an N-terminal domain of ∼150 amino acids at the top of the cylinder followed by two AAA+ domains. In earlier studies, deletion of the N-domain was shown to have no effect on the rate of unfolding of substrate proteins bearing a C-terminal ssrA tag, but it did reduce the rate of degradation of these proteins (Lo, J. H., Baker, T. A., and Sauer, R. T. (2001) Protein Sci. 10, 551-559; Singh, S. K., Rozycki, J., Ortega, J., Ishikawa, T., Lo, J., Steven, A. C., and Maurizi, M. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 29420-29429). Here we demonstrate, using both fluorescence resonance energy transfer to measure the arrival of substrate at ClpP and competition between wild-type and an inactive mutant form of ClpP, that this effect on degradation is caused by diminished stability of the ClpA-ClpP complex during translocation and proteolysis, effectively disrupting the targeting of unfolded substrates to the protease. We have also examined two larger ssrA-tagged substrates, CFP-GFP-ssrA and luciferase-ssrA, and observed different behaviors. CFP-GFP-ssrA is not efficiently unfolded by the truncated chaperone whereas luciferase-ssrA is, suggesting that the former requires interaction with the N-domains, likely via the body of the protein, to stabilize its binding. Thus, the N-domains play a key allosteric role in complex formation with ClpP and may also have a critical role in recognizing certain tag elements and binding some substrate proteins.

In eukaryotes, conjugation of proteins with polyubiquitin is the major step directing proteins toward proteolytic turnover (10Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In bacteria, tagged substrate proteins are recognized by hexameric Hsp100 ring chaperones such as ClpA, ClpX, or HslU, which are known to mediate ATP-dependent unfolding and translocation of substrate proteins into the coaxially aligned partner proteases ClpP and HslV, respectively (15Hoskins J.R.

Analogously in eukaryotes, polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the 19 S proteasome cap complex containing a hexameric ring of ATPases at its base, which unfolds and translocates the substrates into the 20 S proteasome core (12Hershko A.

ClpX and ClpA also contain NH2-terminal domains (N-domains) that appear to control substrate access to the machinery by several means. In the case of ClpX, the N-domain is a 60-residue zinc finger element that may dimerize in the context of the intact ClpX ring, considered to be a trimer of dimers (26Wojtyra U.A. Thibault G.

Another delivery agent, RssB, also binds to the ClpX N-domains to deliver the stress-dependent σ factor σS (33Zhou Y. Gottesman S. Hoskins J.R. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the case of ClpA, the N-domain is composed of ∼150 amino acids folded into an α-helical, 2-fold pseudosymmetric structure as revealed from both a stand alone x-ray structure and a structure of the intact subunits (22Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A recent cryo-electron microscopy study comparing intact ClpA with an N-domain-deleted version suggests that the N-domains rise in the axial direction out of the body of the cylinder, emerging from the D1 AAA+ domain (34Ishikawa T. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Simulations of this electron microscopy data suggest that the N-domains are very mobile in their position atop the cylinder, consistent with what appears from structural studies to be attachment to the D1 domain via a flexible linker segment (amino acids 143-167). As with ClpX, the ClpA N-domains can bind a partner protein, in this case a small protein called ClpS that shares an operon with ClpA (35Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 36Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 9: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ClpS appears to modulate substrate specificity by binding 1:1 to each N-domain. This acts to inhibit the accesswes of ssrA-tagged substrates to ClpA, potentially by steric blockage. It also inhibits the “autodegradation” of ClpA itself, which occurs in the presence of ATP and ClpP. At the same time, binding of ClpS appears to activate an activity in protein disaggregation, observed in vitro. Despite the effect of ClpS on access of ssrA-tagged proteins in vitro, the fact remains that in the intact cell ClpA shares action with ClpX on ssrA-tagged protein substrates, as evidenced by an elegant experiment using a proteolytically inactive mutant ClpP as a substrate “trap” in the setting of deletion of ClpX (8Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.-I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The functional role of the N-domains has been directly evaluated by deletion analysis and cross-linking studies. N-domain-deleted ClpA has been observed to be able to support ClpP-mediated degradation of casein and two ssrA-tagged proteins, GFP-ssrA and λN-cI-ssrA, although the rates of degradation of these substrates was substantially slowed (28Singh S.K.

Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This observations suggests that the N-domains are not required for recognition of these substrates. Furthermore, cross-linking studies have shown that the ssrA tag interacts with loop structures in the ATPase domains (39Hinnerwisch J. Fenton W.A. Furtak K.J. Farr G.W. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here we have dissected the basis for the slowed turnover of ssrA-tagged proteins by N-domain-deleted ClpA-ClpP complexes, observing that whereas the rate of unfolding of GFP-ssrA is indeed unaffected by deletion of the N-domains, the rate of substrate translocation into ClpP is greatly reduced. We have also evaluated the action of the N-domain-deleted ClpA on additional substrates, both a GFP 4The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)CFPcyan fluorescent proteinFRETfluorescence resonance energy transfer.4The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)CFPcyan fluorescent proteinFRETfluorescence resonance energy transfer. derivative fused at its C terminus with the 15 N-terminal amino acids of RepA, GFP-RepA (1-15), and two larger ssrA-tagged substrates, CFP-GFP-ssrA and luciferase-ssrA, all of which are efficiently acted on by wild-type ClpA-ClpP. green fluorescent protein adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) cyan fluorescent protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer. green fluorescent protein adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) cyan fluorescent protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer. DNA Constructs—ClpAΔ143 was generated by PCR mutagenesis, removing codons for residues 2-142. A COOH-terminal ssrA-tagged version of firefly luciferase (Photinus pyralis) was amplified by PCR from the pGEM-luc vector (Promega) and cloned into the pET-16b expression vector (Novagen), which adds a 10-histidine affinity purification tag to the NH2 terminus. CFP-GFP-ssrA was produced by adapting pECFP (Clontech) and GFP-ssrA by PCR mutagenesis to allow in-frame fusion of both coding sequences through appropriate restriction sites. GFP-RepA (1-15) was generated as reported (7Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All clones were subjected to DNA sequencing to verify their identity. Proteins—ClpA, ClpP, mClpP(S111A/L139C), GroEL(D87K), GFP-ssrA, and GFP-RepA-(1-15) were expressed and purified to homogeneity as described previously (7Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K.

Purification of ClpAΔ143 followed the protocol of wild type ClpA. After overexpression in BL21(DE3) cells, CFP-GFP-ssrA was purified by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. His-tagged luciferase-ssrA was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells cultivated at room temperature. Overexpressed protein was purified by column chromatography on a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). Concentrations of ClpAs and ClpPs are given in terms of assembled complexes, i.e. hexamers and tetradecamers, respectively. Unfolding, Degradation, and Translocation Assays—Unfolding and degradation assays of GFP-ssrA, GFP-RepA (1-15), and CFP-GFP-ssrA with ClpA, ClpAΔ143, and ClpP were performed as described (5Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was determined with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 510 nm for GFP or with excitation at 433 nm and emission at 475 nm for CFP. Luciferase unfolding was monitored by observing the luminescence of luciferin. His-luciferase-ssrA (1 μm) and 150 μm luciferin were mixed with 10 mm ATP and incubated at 25 °C until the luminescence (565 nm) reached its steadily declining phase (15 min). Then, unfolding was initiated by adding 1.25 μm ClpA or ClpAΔ143 and additional ATP (10 mm). Unfolding assays of luciferase-ssrA were performed in the absence of the GroEL(D87K) trap, because spontaneous refolding was not observed under these conditions (data not shown). Translocation was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a stopped-flow fluorometer as reported previously (40Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3768-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using pyrene maleimide-modified mClpP(S111A/L139C) as the donor and the GFP chromophore as acceptor. Note that the GFP chromophore appears to act as a FRET quencher even when it is not itself fluorescent. 5B. G. Reid, unpublished observations. Excitation was at 338 nm and emission was recorded through a combination of long wave pass (nominal 370-nm cut-off) and short wave pass (nominal 490-nm cut-off) filters. ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured by determining free phosphate with the malachite green method (42Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.25 μm ClpA or ClpAΔ143 and 0.125 μm ClpP in assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 min, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 5 mm ATP. Aliquots were taken at various time points up to 5 min, and the phosphate released was determined. Rates were calculated from the linear plots of phosphate released versus time. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration in 0.5 mm ATPγS was carried out at room temperature on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% Triton X-100. Samples (150 μl) contained 2 μm ClpA or ClpAΔ143 and 8 μm GFP-RepA-(1-15). N-deleted ClpA Exhibits Normal Kinetics of Unfolding of GFP-ssrA but Supports a Decreased Rate of Degradation in the Presence of ClpP—A ClpA construct commencing at residue 144 (ClpAΔ143) was expressed and purified. Similarly to an earlier-reported construct commencing at residue 162 (38Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this molecule efficiently assembled into hexamers in either ATPγS or ATP as observed in gel filtration (not shown), but in the presence of ATP it only supported relatively slow degradation of GFP-ssrA by the addition of ClpP (Fig. 1a, red trace). To further examine this reaction, we first measured the rate of GFP-ssrA unfolding by either wild-type ClpA or ClpAΔ143 in the presence of ATP and a trap version of GroEL, the mutant D87K (Fig. 1b). This trap mutant has been observed to bind and retain non-native forms of GFP-ssrA as they are released from ClpA, preventing their refolding and thus allowing a determination of the ability of ClpA to mediate unfolding. When GFP-ssrA was incubated with wild-type ClpA (8:1; GFP-ssrA/ClpA) and the trap, there was loss of fluorescence intensity occurring as a single exponential decay with a rate constant of 0.0021 s-1 (Fig. 1b, blue trace), similar to that reported previously (41Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Remarkably, and in agreement with studies on ClpAΔ162 (38Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), there was a virtually identical loss of fluorescence when GFP-ssrA was incubated with ClpAΔ143 at a similar rate constant of 0.0017 s-1 (Fig. 1b, red trace). Thus, it appears that the absence of the N-domains has no effect on the ability of ClpA to recognize and unfold a substrate protein such as GFP-ssrA. This implies that recognition and unfolding of these substrate proteins is mediated by the AAA domains of ClpA, which form the barrel of the ClpA cylinder, rather than the N-domains. This hypothesis has been directly established by recent chemical cross-linking and mutational studies (39Hinnerwisch J. Fenton W.A. Furtak K.J. Farr G.W. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) showing that the ssrA tag is recognized by loops in the ATPase domains that extend into the central channel of the ClpA hexamer. Defective Translocation into ClpP—Considering that the rate of recognition and unfolding by ClpAΔ143 resembles that by wild-type, we hypothesized that the slow rate of ClpAΔ143-mediated substrate degradation by ClpP must result from a defect of translocation into the ClpP protease. Translocation was assessed in real time by following the appearance of FRET between a donor fluorophore, pyrene, placed on the inside cavity wall of a proteolytically defective (and leader peptide-deleted, i.e. mature-sized) mutant version of ClpP, mClpP(S111A) (40Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3768-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the chromophore of GFP-ssrA, which appears to act to quench fluorescence even when GFP is unfolded and is not itself fluorescent. 5B. G. Reid, unpublished observations. In particular, this experiment was carried out by first assembling ClpA in ATPγS and incubating it with GFP-ssrA and the pyrene-labeled ClpP and then adding ATP with stopped-flow mixing and measuring the acquisition of FRET by monitoring the loss of fluorescence in the donor channel (>370 nm) (Fig. 2). In the case of wild-type ClpA, there was a rapid acquisition of FRET (Fig. 2, blue trace). By contrast, the rate of acquisition of FRET was much reduced with ClpAΔ143 (Fig. 2, red trace), indicating that the transfer of GFP-ssrA into the ClpP cavity was slowed with the mutant ClpA. Reduced Stability of Association of ClpAΔ143 with ClpP during Proteolysis—The impairment of transfer of unfolded GFP-ssrA from ClpAΔ143 to ClpP could result either from a defect of ATP-mediated translocation from the mutant into the physically associated ClpP or from decreased stability of the ClpAΔ143-ClpP complex, essentially removing access of the substrate to the translocation target. (Notably, ClpP in isolation is unable to bind and degrade unfolded polypeptides, although it can act upon small peptides; see Ref. 43Woo K.M. Chung W.J. Ha D.B. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2088-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the relative stabilities of association of ClpP with wild-type and truncated ClpA during ClpAP-mediated degradation of GFP-ssrA, we took advantage of an experimental design used by Singh et al. (44Singh S.K. Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to measure the dissociation rate of the ClpA-ClpP complex by competition with chemically inactivated ClpP. Here, the protease-defective mClpP(S111A) (40Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3768-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used to perform a similar experiment. We first showed that the complex of this mutant with ClpA supported only a minor degree of unfolding of GFP-ssrA (Fig. 3a). Then the stability of the GFP-ssrA-ClpA-ClpP complex was tested by initiating a proteolysis reaction by the addition of ATP and, after 120 s, the addition of a large molar excess of the mutant, mClpP(S111A). Because this mutant has a normal ability to associate with ClpA, it should successfully compete with the wild-type ClpP for binding to ClpA if the ClpA-ClpP complex dissociates during the degradation reaction. This should block further degradation, with GFP fluorescence then remaining constant, because any GFP-ssrA that is unfolded by ClpA but released into solution will refold to native form (as in Fig. 3a). When this competition experiment was carried out with wild-type ClpA, the addition of mClpP(S111A) had little effect on the rate of loss of fluorescence until the reaction had proceeded for 7-8 min (Fig. 3b, compare light blue and dark blue traces), reflecting the relative stability of the wild-type ClpA-ClpP complex (44Singh S.K. Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as well as the commitment of unfolded proteins to degradation by ClpP. In striking contrast, when the mClpP(S111A) was added to a similar reaction with ClpAΔ143 after 120 s, the loss of fluorescence of GFP-ssrA was almost immediately halted (Fig. 3b, compare red and purple traces), indicating that the mClpP(S111A) had immediately begun to compete with wild-type ClpP for binding to the ClpAΔ143 mutant. This finding suggests that the association between ClpAΔ143 and ClpP is considerably less stable than that of the wild-type complex. Further evidence of an impaired interaction between the hexameric ClpAΔ143 complex and ClpP was obtained by comparison of its ATPase activity with that of wild-type ClpA. Although a previous study with wild-type ClpA had indicated that the rate of ATP hydrolysis is slightly reduced upon association with its proteolytic partner (45Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in our hands the ATPase activity of ClpA was reproducibly enhanced by a factor of 2 in a ClpA-ClpP (2:1) complex as compared with ClpA alone (Fig. 4). Deletion of the N-terminal domain did not significantly affect the ATPase activity of ClpAΔ143 alone, suggesting that neither the structure of the ATP binding pockets of the D1 and D2 domains nor the contact between neighboring subunits, which is necessary for hydrolysis (22Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), is altered by the deletion. In contrast, the addition of ClpP to ClpAΔ143 failed to stimulate the ATPase activity (Fig. 4) even in a 20-fold molar excess (not shown). The observed effect could be explained either by a structural alteration in the route of allosteric communication between ClpP and the ClpA ATPase domains or more simply by an increased dissociation constant for the complex. We tested whether the dissociation constant for the ClpAΔ143-ClpP complex was greater than that for ClpA-ClpP by measuring individually the association and dissociation rates for the complexes using a FRET-based assay. Although the dissociation rate for the ClpAΔ143-ClpP complex was slightly greater than that measured for ClpA-ClpP (0.025 ± 0.004 s-1 versus 0.019 ± 0.0025 s-1 its association rate was also greater (0.99 ± 0.16 × 106 m s-1 versus 0.63 ± 0.05 × 106 m-1 s-1). Thus, the dissociation constants for the two complexes as measured in the absence of substrate protein are the same (25-30 nm) within experimental error. Based on the relative instability of the association of ClpAΔ143 and ClpP observed in the ClpP exchange experiment in Fig. 3, we infer that the substrate protein itself must be contributing to the stability of the ClpA-ClpP complex via the N-domains. As observed in recent cross-linking and FRET studies (39Hinnerwisch J. Fenton W.A. Furtak K.J. Farr G.W. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), substrate proteins come in contact with the N-domains during binding and translocation steps, and such contact may produce allosterically directed stabilization of the association of ClpA with ClpP. The absence of the N-domains here would prevent such signaling from occurring and result in a destabilized complex. More generally, such an action is consistent with a model in which AAA+ unfoldases allosterically regulate the proteases with which they associate (and vice versa). This has been directly demonstrated by crystallographic studies of the HslU-HslV chaperone-protease pair, where binding of HslU to HslV produces structural shifts that are transmitted to the active sites of HslV, correlating with HslU-directed activation of HslV protease activity (46Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Evidence for a complementary allosteric influence of ClpP on ClpA is apparent in the experiment in Fig. 4, where the ATPase activity of wild-type ClpA was increased by 2-fold when ClpP was added. The absence of any increase in the ATPase activity of ClpAΔ143 with added ClpP suggests that allosteric communication between ClpP and the ClpA ATPase domains was also disrupted by deletion of the N-domains, an effect that does not appear to depend on a substrate protein. Even so, it seems likely that the same pathway of signaling, from N-domains to ATPase domains to ClpP interaction sites and back, is involved in both phenomena. N-domain-deleted ClpA Does Not Act on GFP-RepA-(1-15) and Has Different Effects on Two Larger (∼60 kDa) ssrA-tagged Substrates—The plasmid P1 replication origin-binding protein RepA has previously been shown to be recruited as a dimer to ClpA for dissociation into DNA binding-competent monomers via its NH2-terminal region (6Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 47Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A segment comprising the first 15 amino acids of RepA has been observed to be sufficient to promote either ClpA-mediated unfolding or ClpA-ClpP-mediated degradation of GFP fusion proteins bearing this RepA sequence at either the NH2 or COOH terminus (5Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, the COOH-terminal fusion protein GFP-RepA-(1-15) was incubated with wild-type ClpA or ClpAΔ143 in the presence of ATP and the D87K GroEL trap as in the earlier study of GFP-ssrA (Fig. 1) (41Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and fluorescence was monitored in a time-dependent manner. In contrast with the rapid loss of fluorescence brought about by wild-type ClpA (Fig. 5a, blue trace), reflecting unfolding, there was little loss of fluorescence in the presence of ClpAΔ143 (Fig. 5a, red trace), reflecting that the substrate either failed to be recognized by the ClpA mutant or was recognized but then failed to be unfolded. Consistent with this observation, GFP-RepA-(1-15) was degraded very slowly by ClpAΔ143-ClpP (not shown). The step of binding could be directly evaluated because RepA and a number of GFP-RepA fusions bind stably to ClpA in ATPγS (6Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), such that a fluorescent binary complex can be detected in gel filtration at the position of ClpA (e.g. Fig. 5b, upper left). When such an incubation was carried out with ClpAΔ143, little fluorescence was observed at the migration position of ClpAΔ143 (Fig. 5b, upper right), indicating that the substrate did not associate with ClpA in the absence of its N-domains. Thus it appears that in contrast with the ssrA tag (Fig. 1b), the RepA recognition element has a strong requirement for the N-domains as sites of initial recognition. This finding has been confirmed by recent chemical cross-linking studies showing that the site of interaction of the RepA tag is within the N-domains (39Hinnerwisch J. Fenton W.A. Furtak K.J. Farr G.W. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Unfolding of Larger ssrA-tagged Substrates—Two larger ssrA tagged substrates were also examined. One was firefly luciferase, a 62-kDa protein composed of a large N-terminal α-β domain and a much smaller C-terminal one (48Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). When fused with a C-terminal ssrA tag, it was unfolded by the N-deleted version of ClpA as efficiently as by wild-type ClpA, as judged by the change in luciferin luminescence (Fig. 6a), and it was degraded when ClpP was added (not shown). The second larger substrate was a fusion of CFP with GFP-ssrA to produce a 58-kDa substrate with two β-barrel domains. In contrast to GFP-ssrA alone, which was unfolded by ClpAΔ143 at a rate similar to that of wild-type ClpA (Fig. 1b), the CFP-GFP-ssrA fusion protein was unfolded considerably more slowly by the mutant than by wild-type ClpA in the presence of ATP and D87K GroEL trap (Fig. 6b). Consistently, CFP-GFP-ssrA was also degraded much more slowly by ClpAΔ143-ClpP than by wild-type ClpA-ClpP (Fig. 6c, compare red with cyan or green traces). Interestingly, the two domains of CFP-GFP-ssrA are degraded by wild-type ClpA-ClpP at essentially the same rate (Fig. 6c, cyan and green traces) and almost as fast as is GFP-ssrA itself (blue trace). Furthermore, the data in Fig. 6c (inset) suggest that the degradation by wild-type ClpA-ClpP is sequential, with GFP fluorescence (510 nm; green) beginning to decrease immediately, whereas CFP fluorescence actually increases slightly before beginning to decay about 20 s later (475 nm; cyan). We could not evaluate whether binding of the fusion protein to ClpAΔ143 was affected, because gel filtration experiments with this and other GFP-ssrA fusions (in ATPγS) failed to reveal the presence of binary complexes, even with wild-type ClpA (not shown). We surmise, however, that, in the absence of the N-domains, the fusion protein is unable to form a sufficiently stable initial association with ClpA to unfold efficiently, unlike a single GFP attached to an ssrA tag. These data suggest that the N-domains likely interact with one of the CFP-GFP moieties to stabilize the overall interaction. Indeed, cross-linking studies have shown that the GFP moiety of GFP-ssrA is positioned to interact with the N-domains (39Hinnerwisch J. Fenton W.A. Furtak K.J. Farr G.W. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), even though this interaction is not required for unfolding. The source of the requirement for the N-domains in the case of CFP-GFP-ssrA is not clear, however. For example, the contrasting behavior of CFP-GFP-ssrA and the other similarly large protein, luciferase-ssrA, shows that larger size alone does not determine whether the ClpA N-domains are necessary. Some larger ssrA-tagged proteins, such as CFP-GFP-ssrA, may need the N-domains to stabilize binding through the “body” of the substrate protein to achieve efficient degradation. Other factors, for example the stability of individual domains in the substrate (25Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 49Matouschek A. Bustamante C. Nat. Struct.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), have been considered to be important in determining whether the N-domains are required for individual substrate proteins, but that seems less likely to be the case here because the individual domains are of comparable stability. Overall, it seems clear that the N-domains play several critical roles in the function of ClpA as follows. (i) They act as the binding site for the adaptor protein ClpS. (ii) They bind certain recognition tags such as the RepA N-domain; and (iii) they also are required for efficient degradation of some substrate proteins, even in the presence of a recognized terminal tag. Furthermore, the N-domains appear to allosterically modulate the interaction of ClpA with its partner protease ClpP. It remains to be seen whether other sequence elements recognized by ClpA also require the presence of the N-domains for binding and whether the N-domains themselves contribute directly to unfolding or translocation or whether they are strictly a recognition/binding element.

Thus the study of their regulatory mechanisms may lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we provide supporting evidence that sumoylation and acetylation regulate functions of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. A conserved transcriptional repression domain exists in both PLAG1 and PLAGL2, whose activity depends on the presence of three sumoylation motifs and an intact sumoylation pathway. In vivo sumoylation assays confirmed that lysines 244, 263, and 353 of PLAG1 and lysines 250, 269, and 356 of PLAGL2 are indeed sumoylation sites. Further study showed that sumoylation inhibits PLAG1-induced IGF-II expression in reporter assays. The repression mediated by sumoylation may be partially explained by its effect on the cellular localization of PLAG1 and PLAGL2, because sumoylation-deficient but not wild-type PLAG1 and PLAGL2 concentrate in the nucleolus. PLAG1 and PLAGL2 are also regulated by acetylation. They are acetylated and activated by p300 and deacetylated and repressed by HDAC7. Interestingly, the sumoylation-deficient mutant of PLAGL2 is acetylated at a lower level than its wild-type counterpart, suggesting that some of the lysine residues may be targets for both modifications. Finally, mutation of three lysine residues in sumoylation motifs significantly impairs the transformation ability of PLAG1 and PLAGL2, suggesting the essential roles of these sites in the oncogenic potential of PLAG proteins. Taken together, the activities of PLAG1 and PLAGL2 are tightly modulated by both sumoylation and acetylation, which have opposite effects on their transactivation.

One of the mechanisms of regulation of the activity of transcription factors is post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation (10O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D.

The exact mechanism of how sumoylation represses transactivation remains unclear, although SUMO-dependent recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been implicated in the transcriptional repression of p300 (19Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Mol.

In addition to ubiquitination and sumoylation, lysine residues of transcription factors can be covalently modified by acetylation, a process known to enhance DNA binding (21Soutoglou E. Katrakili N.

Among them, p300 and the closely related CREB-binding protein (CBP) are the most potent and versatile of all the acetyltransferases. Consistent with its role as a global co-activator, p300 acetylates and regulates various non-histone transcription factors, such as GATA-1 (25Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V.

On the other hand, HDACs reverse the acetylation process to maintain the balance between the acetylated and deacetylated states of chromatin and other non-histone proteins. HDACs are divided into four classes: class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) localize to the nucleus; class II HDACs (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm; class III HDACs are NAD+-dependent enzymes that are similar to the yeast SIR2 proteins; and class IV (HDAC11) is the smallest of the HDAC members (28Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified regulatory mechanisms for PLAG1 and PLAGL2. Sumoylation occurs in a conserved repression domain and inhibits transactivation of both PLAG1 and PLAGL2, which may be explained by changes of subnuclear localization. Moreover, PLAG1 and PLAGL2 are also regulated by acetylation. They are acetylated and activated by p300, while deacetylated and repressed by HDAC7, suggesting opposite roles of acetylation and sumoylation in the transactivation of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. Interestingly, sumoylation-deficient PLAGL2 shows decreased acetylation, suggesting that some lysine residues could be targets for both modifications. Importantly, mutation of the sumoylation sites greatly reduced transformation abilities of both PLAG1 and PLAGL2, suggesting the importance of these modifications for PLAG1 and PLAGL2 as oncoproteins.

Human IGF-II-luciferase reporter construct Hup3-luc was provided by Dr. P. Elly Holthuizen. Transient Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—HEK-293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with various plasmid combinations as indicated. Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with occasional vortexing. The lysates were collected into 1.5-ml tubes and cleared of nuclei by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants (whole cell extracts) were incubated with different antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C and protein A-agarose beads were added for the last hour. The beads were washed five times in TNEN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF). Bound proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with the ECL detection system. For sumoylation assays, 0.5 μg/well of expression plasmid for a potential substrate was cotransfected with 0.5 μg/well of FLAG-SUMO-1 plasmid in 6-well plates. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in a denaturing buffer (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in 12-well plates and grown overnight before transfection. The total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted with pcDNA3. Luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid was cotransfected with the plasmids as indicated. The relative luciferase units were corrected based on Renilla luciferase activity. For GAL4 fusion-driven luciferase reporter gene assays, 0.1 μg/well of reporter (pG5-luc) was cotransfected with 0.1 μg of GAL4 fusion expression plasmid in 12-well plates. 0.2 μg/well of pcDNA3-DNUbc9 or pCMV6-SSP3 construct was used if indicated. For IGF-II-luciferase reporter assays, 0.05 μg/well of reporter plasmid was cotransfected with effector plasmids of indicated amounts in 12-well plates. Plasmid Construction—The PLAG constructs used in mammalian cells were generated by polymerase chain reactions with primers containing restriction sites for cloning. Every construct was sequenced fully to verify the fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction. PLAG cDNAs were fused in-frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 using the pM vector. PcDNA3-PLAG1-Myc and subfragments of PLAG1 were constructed using XhoI and EcoRI sites. PcDNA3-PLAGL2-Myc and subfragments of PLAGL2 were constructed using EcoRI and BamHI sites. PCMV2-FLAG-PLAG1 was constructed using EcoRI and XbaI sites. PCMV2-FLAG-PLAGL2 was constructed using EcoRI and BamHI sites. GFP-PLAG1 or its mutants were constructed by inserting full-length or mutant PLAG1 into XhoI and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). GFP-PLAGL2 or its mutants were constructed by inserting wild-type or mutant PLAGL2 into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1. Immunostaining—HEK293 cells were seeded in chamber slides (0.5 × 105 cells/ml) and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of respective plasmids by the calcium phosphate method. 24-48 h later, cells were washed in cold PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100), incubated with primary antibody for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. After incubation with secondary antibody and washing three times with PBS, cells were examined under confocal immunofluorescence microscope. Focus Formation Assay—NIH-3T3 cells (in 6-well plates) were transfected with 2 μg of empty vector, expression plasmid for PLAG1, PLAG1 mutant, PLAGL2, PLAGL2 mutants, or Ha-RAS. The day after transfection, cells were split at 3 × 104/plate in 10-cm plates and selected in 300 μg/ml G418 and 10% serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 days. Then cells were fed once every 4 days with DMEM plus 1% serum and 300 μg/ml G418. After 3 weeks, cells were fixed and stained with methylene blue, and the number of foci was determined. Identification of Repression Domains in PLAG1 and PLAGL2—In this study, PLAG1 and PLAGL2 were found to share similar regulatory mechanisms. To avoid redundancy, the data for PLAGL2 is under “Results” wherever indicated; the rest of the data is under supplemental materials. The structures of PLAG1, PLAGL2, and their GAL4 fusion derivatives are shown in Fig. 1A. Both PLAG proteins have a zinc finger domain in the N terminus, and a transactivation domain in the C terminus. A previous study by Kas et al. (30Kas K. Voz M.L. Hensen K. Meyen E. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23026-23032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) identified a region in the middle of PLAG1 and PLAGL2 with a transcriptional repression function. As shown in Fig. 1B, when PLAGL2-(387-496), which includes only the transactivation domain, and PLAGL2-(238-496), which includes both the transactivation domain and the middle region, were fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain, there was a 10-fold difference in the transactivation capacity between these two constructs. Similarly, PLAG1-(361-500) exhibited about 10 times more transactivation potential compared with PLAG1-(232-500) (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that PLAG1-(232-361) and PLAGL2-(238-387) have repressive activity. The repression domains of some transcription factors such as Elk-1 have been shown to act in trans (18Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); that is, when bound to a promoter, the repression domain itself is able to repress the activity of another adjacent transcription factor. To test whether the repression domains of PLAG proteins also repress transcription in trans, we performed transrepression assays in which GAL4 fusion proteins were used to repress the activity of a Lex-VP16 activated reporter (18Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We found that both PLAG1-(232-361) (data not shown) and PLAGL2-(238-387) (supplemental Fig. S2) have no significant repression activity in the assay, suggesting that the repression domains of PLAG1 and PLAGL2 function differently from that of Elk-1. Potential SUMO Modification Sites Play a Repressive Role in PLAG1 and PLAGL2—Because repression activities are conserved in the middle regions of PLAG1 and PLAGL2, we aligned their sequences to find the possible conserved sites that may be crucial for the repressive activity. We found 3 sumoylation motifs, whose consensus sequence is ψKXE (ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid, X is a random amino acid), well conserved in both PLAG1 and PLAGL2 (supplemental Fig. S3). We tested whether they are crucial for the repression domain by introducing triple mutations K244R/K263R/K353R into PLAG1 and K250R/K269R/K356R into PLAGL2. In the context of a GAL4 fusion protein tethered to an artificial promoter, both GAL4-PLAG1-(232-500) (K244R/K263R/K353R) (supplemental Fig. S4A) and GAL4-PLAGL2-(238-496) (K250R/K269R/K356R) (Fig. 2A) exhibited a 9-10-fold higher transcriptional activity than their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, these mutants became equally active to the transactivation domains alone, suggesting that the activities of the repression domains were abolished by the mutations of the sumoylation motifs. Western blot analysis showed that the effect of the mutations is not caused by higher expression of the mutants (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S4B). These results suggest that these sumoylation motifs are required for the repression domains of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. Next we investigated whether the sumoylation pathway is involved in the activity of the repression domains of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. We used two approaches to block the sumoylation pathway: a catalytically inactive form of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9C93S (DNUbc9), which acts as a dominant-negative mutant; and SSP3, which is a SUMO-specific protease. As shown in Fig. 2C, transfection of pcDNA3-DNUbc9 completely rescued the difference between GAL4-PLAGL2-(238-496) and GAL4-PLAGL2-(387-496), suggesting that the repressive activity of PLAGL2-(238-387) was abolished. A similar observation was made using SSP3 (Fig. 2D). When we converted the luciferase activity to fold induction (the ratio between transfected and untransfected with pcDNA3-DNUbc9 or pCMV6-SSP3), as shown in supplemental Fig. S4C and S4D, both sumoylation pathway inhibitors significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of PLAG1-(232-500), but had much less effect on PLAG1-(361-500) and PLAG1-(232-500) (K244R/K263R/K353R). Moreover, the repression domain of either PLAG1 or PLAGL2 alone, but not vector control or a control protein ZNF76K411R, was activated by DNUbc9 (supplemental Fig. S5). These results suggest that both the sumoylation motifs and the intact sumoylation pathway are essential for the repression domains of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. PLAG1 and PLAGL2, but Not PLAGL1, Are Modified by Sumoylation—To verify that sumoylation of PLAGL2 occurs in cells, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with expression plasmids for PLAGL2-Myc and FLAG-SUMO-1 and analyzed sumoylation of PLAGL2 by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. A slower migrating band reacting with anti-Myc antibody was clearly detected in cells ectopically expressing FLAG-SUMO-1 (Fig. 3A). Because PIAS1 is a well established E3 ligase in sumoylation, we tested whether PIAS1 promotes sumoylation of PLAGL2. HEK293 cells were transfected with PLAGL2-Myc, FLAG-SUMO-1, and FLAG-PIAS1 or FLAG-PIAS1C335A, a construct encoding an inactive form of PIAS1. As shown in Fig. 3B, cotransfection of FLAG-PIAS1, but not FLAG-PIAS1C335A, strongly enhanced the sumoylation of PLAGL2. Moreover, DNUbc9 abolished the appearance of the slower migrating bands (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the higher molecular weight bands correspond to sumoylated PLAGL2. To test whether lysine residues in the consensus sumoylation motifs are indeed sumoylation targets, wild-type and mutant PLAGL2 were cotransfected with FLAG-SUMO-1 and FLAG-PIAS1. PLAGL2K250R, partially, and the triple mutant PLAGL2K250,269,356R, completely, lost their abilities to be sumoylated (Fig. 3D), which correlates with the loss of repression activity (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained for PLAG1 (supplemental Fig. S6). We also tested single mutants of PLAGL2. As shown in Fig. 3E, each PLAGL2 single mutant still retained the ability to be sumoylated, suggesting that all three lysine residues are sumoylation targets. PLAGL1 is another member in the PLAG family. Unlike PLAG1 and PLAGL2, PLAGL1 is a tumor suppressor gene rather than an oncogene. As shown in Fig. 3F, no sumoylation was detected for PLAGL1 even when FLAG-SUMO-1 was overexpressed. These results suggest that both PLAG1 and PLAGL2, but not PLAGL1, can be sumoylated, and lysine residues inside the sumoylation motifs are indeed sumoylation targets. Sumoylation Pathway Represses PLAG1/PLAGL2-mediated Transcription—Because both the intact sumoylation motifs and the sumoylation pathway are required for the function of the repression domain (Fig. 2), and PLAGL2 can be physically sumoylated at those sites (Fig. 3), we next tested in the full-length context, whether sumoylation represses PLAG1/PLAGL2-mediated transcription. We fused full-length PLAGL2 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and tested their activity in the presence or absence of DNUbc9. Though DNUbc9 did not change the basal reporter activity, it activated PLAGL2 about 15-fold (Fig. 4A). A similar observation was made for PLAG1 (supplemental Fig. S7). We also tested whether sumoylation regulates PLAG1-induced expression of IGF-II, a well established target gene of PLAG1 (8Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). DNUbc9 did not have any effects on the basal reporter activity, but transfection of as low as 0.02 μg of pcDNA3-DNUbc9 enhanced PLAG1-induced IGF-II promoter activity, and the increase was dose-dependent (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that sumoylation negatively regulates PLAG1/PLAGL2-mediated transcription. Sumoylation-deficient PLAG1 and PLAGL2 Localize to Nucleoli—To further understand sumoylation-mediated functions, we compared the cellular localization of wild-type PLAG1 and PLAGL2 with that of the sumoylation-deficient mutants. Both GFP-PLAG1 (supplemental Fig. S8) and GFP-PLAGL2 (Fig. 5A) showed a diffused nuclear pattern except for the nucleolus. However, after lysine residues responsible for sumoylation were mutated, 80% of GFP-PLAG1K244,263,353R (supplemental Fig. S8) and 60% of GFP-PLAGL2K250,269,356R (Fig. 5A) exhibited strong and distinct nucleolar localization. PIAS1, which promotes sumoylation of PLAG1 and PLAGL2, colocalized with wild-type but not the mutant PLAGL2 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that sumoylation regulates the subnuclear localization of PLAG1 and PLAGL2, which may contribute to its transcriptional repression effect. PLAG1 and PLAGL2 Are Regulated by Acetylation—Surprisingly, when we compared wild-type and sumoylation-deficient PLAG1 for their ability to activate IGF-II expression in reporter assays, we found that PLAG1K244,263,353R has lower transactivation activity than wild-type PLAG1 (Fig. 6A). We speculated that besides being the sumoylation sites, these lysine residues may play other critical roles in transactivation. Because lysine residues can also be acetylated, and acetylation has been shown to regulate transactivation of transcription factors, we considered the possibility that one or more of the three lysine residues of PLAG1 and PLAGL2 are also targets for acetylation. To determine whether PLAG1 and PLAGL2 can be acetylated in cells, GFP-PLAG1 or FLAG-PLAGL2 were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells with or without HA-p300, a well studied lysine acetyltransferase. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibody, and acetylated forms of PLAGL2 and PLAG1 were detected by Western blotting with anti-acetyl lysine antibody (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S9). P300 significantly enhanced acetylation of both PLAG1 and PLAGL2. TSA, which is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, further increased the acetylation level of PLAGL2 (Fig. 6C), suggesting that HDACs may regulate the acetylation of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. Indeed, HDAC7, a histone deacetylase, significantly decreased acetylation of PLAGL2 (lane 4 compared with lane 3, Fig. 6D). Interestingly, the triple mutant PLAGL2K250,269,356R, was less acetylated than the wild-type (lane 3 compared with lane 6, Fig. 6D), suggesting that these lysine residues may also be the targets for acetylation, which could explain why the sumoylation-deficient mutant PLAG1 has weaker activity than the wild-type PLAG1 (Fig. 6A). To investigate the functional consequences of acetylation, we tested whether p300 affects the transactivation of PLAG1 and PLAGL2. When GAL4-fused full-length PLAG1 and PLAGL2 were transfected alone or with p300, p300 significantly enhanced the transactivation potential of both PLAG proteins (Fig. 6E and data not shown), Moreover, transfection of p300 also enhanced PLAG1-induced IGF-II expression in luciferase reporter assays (supplemental Fig. S10). Because acetylation is a reversible process and HDAC7 decreased p300-induced PLAGL2 acetylation (Fig. 6D), we also tested the effect of HDAC7 on PLAG1-mediated IGF-II expression in reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 6F, ectopic expression of HDAC7 repressed the PLAG1-induced IGF-II expression in a do"

Loss of heterozygosity analyses suggest the presence of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) on chromosome 6p21.3-p25. Here we report the cloning NOL7, its mapping to chromosome band 6p23, and localization of the protein to the nucleolus. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated an allelic loss of an NOL7 in cultured tumor cells and human tumor samples. Transfection of NOL7 into cervical carcinoma cells inhibited their growth in mouse xenografts, confirming its in vivo tumor suppressor activity. The induction of tumor dormancy correlated with an angiogenic switch caused by a decreased production of vascular endothelial growth factor and an increase in the production of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1. These data suggest that NOL7 may function as a TSG in part by modulating the expression of the angiogenic phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2096642917,"Several peptides, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), activate the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells (ECs). Both messengers are involved in EC proliferation and vascular permeability and control calcium homeostasis in different ways. Interestingly, it has been recently suggested that NO acts as a downstream mediator of AA-induced calcium entry in smooth muscle cells and isolated mouse parotid cells. In this paper, we have investigated the complex relationships that link intracellular calcium, AA, and NO in cultured endothelial cells. Using different experimental approaches, mainly simultaneous Ca2+ and NO fluorimetric confocal imaging, we provide evidence for a complex pathway leading to noncapacitative calcium entry (NCCE) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). In particular, AA is able to induce NCCE through two different pathways: one dependent on eNOS recruitment and NO release, the other NO-independent. Finally, we show that NO increase is involved in the control of BAEC proliferation."

In this bacterium the last step of the corrinoid adenosylation pathway, i.e. the transfer of the adenosyl group from ATP to the corrin ring, is catalyzed by the ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase (CobA, EC 2.5.1.17) enzyme (16Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to CobA, the S. enterica genome encodes two other ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyl-transferases encoded by the eutT and pduO genes (17Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A.

However, unlike the EutT and PudO enzymes, CobA has broad specificity for its corrinoid substrate, allowing it to adenosylate de novo corrin ring intermediates as well as complete (e.g. cobalamin (Cbl)) and incomplete corrinoids lacking the nucleotide loop (e.g. cobinamide (Cbi)) (4Escalante-Semerena J.C.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9493) Google Scholar) and aligned to bring CobA residues Arg-9, Arg-98, and Arg-165 within close proximity to FldA residues Asp-11, Glu-61, Asp-68, and Asp-93. No structural optimization was performed. The figures were generated using PyMOL (www.pymol.org). PCR Methods—An Eppendorf Mastercycler® thermocycler was used to amplify templates listed in TABLE TWO using primers listed in TABLE TWO. Amplification products were cloned in vector pET15b (Novagen) to fuse an N-terminal hexahistidine tag to the gene product. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Stratagene QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to create point mutants in plasmids pCOBA17 and pFLDA4 (TABLE TWO). Nonradioactive BigDye® (Amersham Biosciences) protocols for DNA sequencing were used to verify the presence of mutations. Plasmids were reconstructed and then sequenced at the DNA sequencing facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. Purification of His-tagged CobA Proteins—Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(λDE3) for overexpression (JE3892). Fresh transformants were used to inoculate 2 ml of fresh Luria-Burtani broth (LB)/ampicillin medium. A starter culture (1 ml) was used to inoculate 100-ml cultures of LB/ampicillin medium. After overnight growth at 37 °C with shaking, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman/Coulter Avanti J-25I centrifuge equipped with a JLA-16.250 rotor. Cell paste was frozen at -80 °C until use. To purify proteins 5 ml of lysis buffer (1× Bug Buster reagent (Novagen) in 1× binding buffer, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was used to resuspend the cell pellet. Cells were lysed at room temperature for 20 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 43,667 × g. Cell-free extract was passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter before loading onto HisBind 900 cartridges (Novagen). Protein was purified as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was eluted into 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing highly purified protein were pooled and dialyzed once against 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8, (at 4 °C) containing 10 mm EDTA. Subsequent dialyses were performed against buffer without EDTA. In some cases protein was concentrated using a YM10 Centricon unit (molecular weight cutoff = 10,000; Amicon). Glycerol was added to 10% (v/v) and dithiothreitol to 1 mm; 100-μl drops of protein solution were flash-frozen using liquid N2, and pellets were stored at -80 °C until used. Native Wild Type (WT) and CobAΔN2-26 Protein Purification—Native WT CobA protein was overexpressed on strain JE2886 and purified as described (15Fonseca M.V. Buan N.R. Horswill A.R. Rayment I.

Allele cobA1328 encoding the mutant CobA protein with the N-terminal 2-26 amino acids deleted (CobAΔN2-26) was cloned into plasmid pT7-7 (27Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar) and overproduced in E. coli strain BL21(λDE3); all chromatographic steps were identical to those used to isolate native WT CobA protein. FldA Overexpression and Purification—Plasmids encoding WT or mutant His-tagged FldA proteins were freshly transformed into strain JE4182. Four 2-liter flasks containing 750 ml of LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μl/ml) and ampicillin (100 μl/ml) were each inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight starter culture grown in the same medium. After the culture reached mid-log phase at 30 °C and 160 rpm shaking, riboflavin was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and cultures were shifted to 42 °C for 1 h and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cells were harvested at 4 °C and 15,000 × g for 10 min; cell paste was frozen at -80 °C until used. Frozen cell paste was resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, (at 4 °C) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was passed through a French press twice, 10 mg of DNase was added, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 43,667 × g for 30 min, and soluble protein was passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Proteins were isolated from crude cell extracts using a ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatograph equipped with a 5-ml HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). After column equilibration, cell-free extract was loaded onto the column, which was washed with 5 column volumes (CV) of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, (at 4 °C) containing 0.5 m NaCl. Mutant FldA proteins were eluted with a 0-50% linear gradient of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, (at 4 °C), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m imidazole over 15 column volumes. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, concentrated in an YM10 Centricon unit, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, (at 4 °C) containing 1 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was determined by A466 to measure flavin mononucleotide (FMN) bound to FldA (ϵ466 = 8250 m-1) (28Hall D.A. Jordan-Starck T.C. Loo R.O. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glycerol was added to 10% (v/v), and dithiothreitol was added to 1 mm before protein was flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C until used. Fpr protein (ferredoxin (flavodoxin):NADP+ reductase) was purified as described (14Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32101-32108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fre Protein Overexpression and Purification—H6Fre (flavin reductase; EC 1.5.1.29) protein was overexpressed using E. coli BL21(λDE3)/pFRE3 (13Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter was re-constructed before overexpression by transforming strain JE3892 with plasmid pFRE3. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB/ampicillin medium and incubated to stationary phase at 37 °C. 2.5 ml of the starter culture was used to inoculate four 1-liter flasks containing 250 ml of LB/ampicillin medium. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C to late log phase and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside with shaking for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested at 15,000 × g for 10 min; the cell pellet was frozen at -80 °C until used. To purify H6Fre (flavin reductase) protein, 20 ml of lysis buffer (1× Bug Buster reagent (Novagen) in 1× binding buffer, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was used to resuspend the cell pellet. Cells were lysed at room temperature for 20 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 43,667 × g. Cell-free extract was filtered through a 0.45-μm and then a 0.2-μm syringe filter before loading onto HisBind 900® cartridges (Novagen). H6-Fre Protein was purified as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was eluted directly into 5 mm EDTA. Fractions containing homogeneous protein were pooled, concentrated in an YM10 Centricon unit, and dialyzed once against 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, (at 4 °C) containing 10 mm EDTA. Subsequent dialyses were against buffer without EDTA. Glycerol was added to 10% (v/v) and dithiothreitol to 1 mm before aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Growth Behavior Analysis—Ten μl of overnight cultures of all strains was used to inoculate 190 μl of fresh medium in each well of a 96-well microtiter dish; all strains were cultured in triplicate. Growth media contained 1× no-carbon E medium (29Berkowitz D. Hushon J.M. Whitfield H.J. Roth J. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 mm Mg+2, 0.5 mm methionine, 1× trace minerals (30Balch W.E. Wolfe R.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1976; 32: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 50 mm NH4Cl, 50 mm ethanolamine, pH 7.0. When added, ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml, kanamycin was used at 50 μg/ml, and AdoCbl, hydroxycobalamin, or dicyano-cobinamide was used at 200 nm. For growth on glycerol as the sole carbon and energy source, ethanolamine and methionine were omitted, and glycerol was added to 30 mm. Cultures were incubated with shaking for up to 96 h at 37 °C in a SpectraMAX Plus automatic plate reader (Molecular Devices). Western blots were performed to determine whether complementation defects were due to protein expression or stability issues. However, because of the sensitivity of the growth assay, even undetectable levels of CobAWT allowed full complementation. Cobalamin Adenosyltransferase Assays—Fig. 1 shows three different ways to generate the co(I)rrinoid substrate for CobA. Reactions contained 4 mg of potassium borohydride (KBH4), 50 μm hydroxycobalamin, 0.8 mm Mn2+, 0.4 mm ATP, 3 μm, 0.5 μm CobA. AdoCbl formation was determined by measuring the decrease in A525 after 15 min at 37 °C and after 5 min of photolysis. When FldA was used as the reductant instead of KBH4, assays contained 50 μm hydroxycobalamin, 0.8 mm Mn2+, 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.4 mm ATP, 3 μm Fpr, 2 μm FldA, 2 μm CobA and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Peptide inhibition assays contained concentrations of FldA ranging from 0.25 to 2 μm. For mutant FldA proteins, Fpr protein was omitted and replaced by 0.5 μm Fre protein and 50 μm FMN. FldA peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Sequencing Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. Modeling CobA·FldA Interactions—We artificially docked CobA with FldA using ExPasy Deep View (www.expasy.org/spdbv) software (Fig. 2). Without making any structural modifications, three positively charged surface residues on CobA (Arg-9, Arg-98, Arg-165) were aligned with three negatively charged residues on FldA (Glu-61, Asp-68, Asp-93). These FldA residues were previously shown (28Hall D.A. Jordan-Starck T.C. Loo R.O. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to be involved in its interactions with the Cbl-dependent methionine synthase (MetH) enzyme. In this hypothetical CobA·FldA complex, the FMN cofactor of FldA was within 10 Å of the Cbl substrate in the CobA active site, and hydrophobic patches on both proteins were brought together (Fig. 2D). Competitive Inhibition of FldA-dependent AdoCbl Synthesis by a FldA Peptide—Based on our computer model, residues TWYYGEAQCDWDD68 of FldA were predicted to be part of the surface interacting with CobA. We hypothesized that a peptide mimic of this region should block CobA·FldA interactions. Because the same region of FldA is known to also interact with Fpr, the latter was present in the reaction mixture in large excess and was preincubated with FldA before peptide, ATP, and CobA were added to start the cobalamin adenosyltransferase assay reaction. The control peptide TWYYGAAQCDWDA68 contained E61A and D68A mutations to determine whether, as predicted, these two charged residues contributed to any interactions of FldA with CobA. A third FldA peptide of similar size and hydrophobicity (WPTAGYHFEASKG132) was used as negative control. The control peptide did not contain any residues known to interact with MetH (Fig. 3) and, hence, were predicted to have no effect of the interactions of FldA with CobA. The effect of all three peptides on FldA-dependent AdoCbl synthesis was assayed in vitro. In these assays, AdoCbl formation relied on productive CobA·FldA interactions for the generation of the cob(I)alamin nucleophile. To optimize the assay conditions, various concentrations of FldA were used in assays where substrates and CobA were held constant. The Km for FldA was 5.65 μm and Vmax = 31.8 nmol min-1 mg-1 (Fig. 4). For Lineweaver-Burk analysis, subsaturating levels of FldA were used such that the reaction proceeded at a rate between 4 and 50% Vmax when no peptides were added. Each of the three peptides was then varied from 2-6 μm for each concentration of FldA. Peptide TWYYGEAQCDWDD68 inhibited AdoCbl formation by ∼30% when present at a 1.5:1 peptide:FldA ratio. At 59% Vmax, the specific activities were 19 and 13, respectively. This level of inhibition was significant considering the small size of the peptide. According to Lineweaver-Burk analysis, this inhibition was competitive (Km peptide = 29 μm and Ki = 1.3 mm). A 13-amino acid peptide mimic of FldA had only a 5-fold decrease in CobA binding efficiency. This decreased affinity might be due to several reasons. The peptide could have greater conformational flexibility than the FldA protein or lack a secondary structure needed for interactions with CobA. In addition, the peptide may not span all the residues involved in the CobA·FldA interaction. In contrast, the mutagenized and control (TWYYGAAQCDWDA68 and WPTAGYHFEASKG132 peptides, respectively) failed to inhibit AdoCbl production even when present at 10-fold increase over FldA. These results suggested that the TWYYGEAQCDWDD68 peptide did bind to CobA and interfered with the FldA docking. Results with the mutagenized peptide indicated that this inhibition depended on residues Glu-61 and Asp-68. In Vivo Assessment of CobA Activity—To test the effect of mutations in residues Arg-9, Arg-98, and Arg-165, we site-directed mutagenized each one of these residues to Ala or Glu. Permutations of mutated residues were also constructed, and their effects were tested in vitro and in vivo. Plasmids containing mutant cobA alleles were transformed into a metE cobA strain of S. enterica (JE7180) to assess their level of function in vivo. Strains were grown under conditions that demanded low or high levels of cobalamin synthesis. When grown on glycerol as sole carbon source, a metE cobA strain cannot convert dicyano-cobinamide into Cbl because enzymes that assemble the nucleotide loop of Cbl require AdoCbi (4Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.-J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6328-6336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of Cbl, the Cbl-dependent methionine synthase (MetH) cannot methylate homocysteine to produce methionine. Hence, the metE cobA strain is an AdoCbi, Cbl, or methionine auxotroph. When grown on ethanolamine as the carbon and energy source, AdoCbl synthesized by CobA is needed to activate transcription of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) operon and to provide AdoCbl for ethanolamine ammonia-lyase function (18Buan N.R. Suh S.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5708-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Sheppard D.E. Penrod J.T. Bobik T. Kofoid E. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7635-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Of the CobA mutant proteins tested, only CobAR98A, CobAR98E, and CobAR165A supported growth on ethanolamine as carbon and energy source, albeit to a reduced level relative to the wild-type strain (Fig. 5A). It was surprising to learn, however, that protein CobAR98A with"
https://openalex.org/W2015362487,"Classical hemophilia results from a defect of the intrinsic tenase complex, the main factor X (FX) activator. Binding of factor VIIa to tissue factor triggers coagulation, but little amplification of thrombin production occurs. Handling of hemophilia by injection of the deficient or missing (thus foreign) factor often causes immunological complications. Several strategies have been designed to bypass intrinsic tenase complex, but none induce true auto-amplification of thrombin production. In an attempt to re-establish a cyclic amplification of prothrombin activation in the absence of tenase, we prepared a chimera of FX having fibrinopeptide A for the activation domain (FXFpA). We reasoned that cascade initiation would produce traces of thrombin that would activate FXFpA (contrary to its normal homologue). Given that the activation domain of FX is released upon activation, thrombin cleavage would produce authentic FXa that would produce more thrombin, which in turn would activate more chimeras. FXFpA was indeed activable by thrombin, albeit at a relatively low rate (5 × 103 m-1 s-1). Nevertheless, FXFpA allowed in vitro amplification of thrombin production, and 100 nm efficiently corrected thrombin generation in tenase-deficient plasmas. A decisive advantage of FXFpA could be that the artificial cascade is self-regulating: FXFpA had little influence on the clotting time of normal plasma, yet corrected that of tenase deficiency. Another advantage could be the half-life of FXFpA in blood; FX has a half-life of about 30 h (less than 3 h for FVIIa). It is also reasonable to expect little or no immunogenicity, because FX and fibrinopeptide A both circulate normally in the blood of hemophiliacs."
https://openalex.org/W2034563381,"Although telomere instability is observed in human tumors and is associated with the development of cancers in mice, it has yet to be established that it can contribute to the malignant transformation of human cells. We show here that in checkpoint-compromised telomerase-positive human fibroblasts an episode of TRF2 inhibition promotes heritable changes that increase the ability to grow in soft agar, but not tumor growth in nude mice. This transforming activity is associated to a burst of telomere instability but is independent of an altered control of telomere length. Moreover, it cannot be recapitulated by an increase in chromosome breaks induced by an exposure to gamma-radiations. Since it can be revealed in the context of telomerase-proficient human cells, telomere dysfunction might contribute to cancer progression even at late stages of the oncogenesis process, after the telomerase reactivation step."

https://openalex.org/W2011000970,"The retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein (RB) is an important regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis. RB is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent protein kinase during cell cycle progression. A phosphorylation site mutated (PSM)-RB has previously been shown to cause G1 arrest and to interfere with S phase progression. In this study, we examined the effect of inducible PSM-RB expression on the apoptotic response to three different death stimuli: doxorubicin (DOXO), staurosporine (STS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in Rat-16 cells. Induced expression of PSM-RB attenuated caspase activation by DOXO as a result of cell cycle arrest. STS has been shown to cause RB-dependent G1 arrest or apoptosis; however, expression of PSM-RB did not prevent caspase activation by STS. Surprisingly, induced expression of PSM-RB stimulated the apoptotic response to TNF in Rat-16 cells, which mostly undergo necrosis in the absence of PSM-RB. These results show that PSM-RB exerts disparate effects on apoptotic response to different stimuli, and that cell cycle arrest does not always associate with resistance to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2133539935,"The E2F1 transcription factor, which is deregulated in most human cancers by mutations in the p16-cyclin D-Rb pathway, has both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive properties. This is dramatically illustrated by the phenotype of an E2F1 transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops tumors in the skin and other epithelial tissues but is resistant to papilloma formation when subjected to a two-stage carcinogenesis protocol. Here, this E2F1 transgenic model was used to further explore the tumor-suppressive property of E2F1. Transgenic expression of E2F1 was found to inhibit ras-driven skin carcinogenesis at the promotion stage independent of the type of promoting agent used. E2F1 transgenic epidermis displayed increased expression of p19(ARF), p53, and p21(Cip1). Inactivation of either p53 or Arf in E2F1 transgenic mice restored sensitivity to two-stage skin carcinogenesis. While Arf inactivation impaired tumor suppression and p21 induction by E2F1, it did not reduce the level of apoptosis observed in E2F1 transgenic mice. Based on these findings, we propose that E2F1 suppresses ras-driven skin carcinogenesis through a nonapoptotic mechanism involving ARF and p53."
