https://openalex.org/W2020007020,"We present data suggesting a function of α2-HS glycoproteins/fetuins in serum and in mineralization, namely interference with calcium salt precipitation. Fetuins occur in high serum concentration during fetal life. They accumulate in bones and teeth as a major fraction of noncollagenous bone proteins. The expression pattern in fetal mice confirms that fetuin is predominantly made in the liver and is accumulated in the mineralized matrix of bones. We arrived at a hypothesis on the molecular basis of fetuin function in bones using primary rat calvaria osteoblast cultures and salt precipitation assays. Our results indicate that fetuins inhibit apatite formation both in cell culture and in the test tube. This inhibitory effect is mediated by acidic amino acids clustering in cystatin-like domain D1. Fetuins account for roughly half of the capacity of serum to inhibit salt precipitation. We propose that fetuins inhibit phase separation in serum and modulate apatite formation during mineralization.

Considerable progress has been made toward a molecular understanding of skeletal development through the identification of local factors that control skeletal patterning and bone shape (1Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Stages beyond the condensation of mesothelial cells and the developing chondrogenic phenotype are envisaged as a chain of timed events that lead to a progressive development of the osteoblast phenotype (2Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Following that is the assembly of collagen, noncollagenous proteins, and mineral into functional bone tissue with acidic proteins controlling crystal growth at the interphase of the mineral and organic components (3Weiner S. Addadi L. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 252-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Most protein components of this assembly are expressed bone tissue-specific. However, serum proteins made in the liver are also known to contribute to the organic phase of bone and dentine (4Mbuyi J.M. Dequeker J. Bloemmen F. Stevens E. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1982; 34: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The function of serum proteins in biomineralization is poorly understood despite the fact that cell culture systems mimicking bone formation generally include serum. One particular family of serum proteins, synonymously called α2-HS1 glycoproteins or fetuins, are concentrated in the mineral phase of bone (5Triffitt J.T. Gebauer U. Ashton B.A. Owen M.E. Reynolds J.J. Nature. 1976; 262: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and teeth (6Takagi Y. Shimokawa H. Suzuki M. Nagai H. Sasaki S. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1990; 47: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They are structurally well studied. To date complete primary structures are published for human (7Lee C.C. Bowman B.H. Yang F.M. Proc.

Acta. 1992; 1130: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) fetuins and the intron-exon structure has been published for the rat gene (12Falquerho L. Patey G. Paquereau L. Rossi V. Lahuna O. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Levan G. Le Cam A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From N terminus to C terminus two conserved cystatin domains functionally silent in human fetuin (13Kellermann J. Haupt H. Auerswald E.A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14121-14128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are followed by a third, unrelated and more divergent domain rich in proline. Due to the cystatin domains fetuins are grouped within the cystatin superfamily of proteins (14Elzanowski A. Barker W.C. Hunt L.T. Seibel-Ross E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fetuins are both N- and O-glycosylated (15Watzlawick H. Walsh M.T. Yoshioka Y. Schmid K. Brossmer R.

Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human plasma α2-HS is proteolytically processed (17Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Throughout all species studied high amounts of fetuins consistently occur in mineralized bone (5Triffitt J.T. Gebauer U. Ashton B.A. Owen M.E. Reynolds J.J. Nature. 1976; 262: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Triffitt J.T. Owen M.E. Ashton B.A. Wilson J.M. Calcif. Tissue.

Ozawa M. Arakaki N. Muramatsu T. Daikuhara Y. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on this observation a role for fetuins in bone formation and resorption has been suggested (22Colclasure G.C. Lloyd W.S. Lamkin M. Gonnerman W. Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Nimberg R.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 66: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fetuins are abundant in fetal blood and tissues indicating that they may play a more general role during organ development. More specific functions of fetuin like lipid transport or inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase have been suggested; they are critically reviewed in a recent monograph (23Dziegielewska K.M. Brown W.M. Fetuin. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1995Crossref Google Scholar). Fetuins bind strongly to apatite and can thus be selectively enriched from serum (18Triffitt J.T. Owen M.E. Ashton B.A. Wilson J.M. Calcif. Tissue. Res. 1978; 26: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bovine fetuin has several low affinity calcium binding sites (24Suzuki M. Shimokawa H. Takagi Y. Sasaki S. J. Exp. Zool. 1994; 270: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that might mediate apatite binding. However, the molecular basis of apatite binding and the significance of fetuin accumulation in bone have not been elucidated. In this paper we demonstrate that fetuins inhibit apatite precipitation. We propose a biological function for fetuins in the maintenance of high blood calcium levels and in the inhibition of unwanted mineralization. α2-HS glycoprotein (human fetuin) from serum, the corresponding rabbit antiserum, and α2-HS glycoprotein isolated from HepG2 hepatoma medium have been described (17Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human serum was depleted of α2HS-glycoprotein by antibody affinity chromatography (17Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mouse fetuin cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Yang, San Antonio, TX (11Yang F. Chen Z.L. Bergeron J.M. Cupples R.L. Friedrichs W.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Copy DNAs encoding human and rat fetuins have been described (10Rauth G. Pöschke O. Fink E. Eulitz M. Tippmer S. Kellerer M. Häring H.U. Nawratil P. Haasemann M. Jahnen-Dechent W. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin were obtained from Roth, Karlsruhe, calmodulin, lysozyme and type II-collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum from Sigma, [45Ca]Cl2 and Na[125I] from ICN-Flow, Iodogen (1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α-6α-diphenylglycouracil) from Pierce, antibody conjugates from Dako (FITC-conjugated) and Bio-Rad (peroxidase-conjugated). The complete cDNAs encoding human and mouse fetuins, respectively, were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen) as EcoRI fragments. Rat fetuin was subcloned from pBluescript vector as an EcoRV/NotI fragment into pVL1393 digested with SmaI and NotI. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with pVL1393 vector and Baculogold™ DNA (Pharmingen). Virus expressing fetuins were cloned by limited dilution of virus mixtures. Recombinant fetuin proteins were purified from protein-free medium (Sf900II, Life Technologies, Inc.) of virus-infected Sf9 cells by a four-step procedure. Protein was concentrated by precipitation with 2 M (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was dissolved in buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7, 0.75 M (NH4)2SO4), and applied to a butyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column. Bound protein was eluted at a flow of 2 ml/min with a 30-min linear gradient of 0.75 M ammonium sulfate, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7, to 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7. Fractions containing recombinant protein (as determined by ELISA) were pooled and concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The pellets were redissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and fractionated on a Superose 200 (Pharmacia) column. The purified fetuins migrated as single bands upon SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Purification of recombinant rat and mouse fetuin was monitored by ELISA and Western blot analysis using antibody against rat serum fetuin (Dr. Nawratil, Munich). C-terminally truncated variants of mouse fetuin were expressed in Escherichia coli (XL1, Stratagene) as fusion proteins of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) using the expression vector pMal™-c2 (New England Biolabs). The mouse fetuin cDNA was shortened from the 3′-end by digestion with exonuclease III. The expression vector pMal™-c2 was modified by inserting into XbaI/PstI-digested vector an oligonucleotide hybrid carrying a KpnI restriction site and three TAA stop codons. The hybrid forming oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTAGAGGTACCTAACTAACTAACTGCA-3′ and 5′-GTTAGTTAGTTAGGTACCT-3′. The modified pMal™-c2 vector was digested with BamHI and KpnI, and a mouse fetuin cDNA fragment was inserted. This fragment was generated by PCR from the complete cDNA (11Yang F. Chen Z.L. Bergeron J.M. Cupples R.L. Friedrichs W.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) subcloned into the vector pBluescript. The primers used were the M13-20 primer as the 3′-primer and the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCTGCGGATCCGCTCCACAAGGT-3′ as the 5′-primer containing a BamHI restriction site followed by the sequence encoding the first amino acids of the processed mouse fetuin protein (without signal sequence). The PCR amplicon was digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into the modified pMal™-c2 vector. For deletion mutagenesis the plasmid was digested with KpnI (3′-overhang) and XhoI (5′-overhang), and the mouse fetuin cDNA was truncated from the 3′-end with exonuclease III following established protocols (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1987Google Scholar). Deletion mutants were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Bacteria were lysed in buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 µg/ml benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM DTT). DNase and RNase (final concentration 10 µg/ml) were included in the lysis buffer, as contaminating E. coli DNA inhibited apatite formation. MBP fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). MBP expressed from the modified vector pMal™-c2 (lacking the LacZα sequences fused to MBP) and MBP fusion proteins with deleted mouse fetuin proteins smaller than 100 amino acids for reasons unknown bound to amylose affinity matrix very inefficiently. We therefore purified the deleted MBP-mouse fetuin fusion proteins by a three-step procedure. After cell lysis and centrifugation protein was precipitated with 3.2 M ammonium sulfate, dissolved in buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM DTT, RNase and DNase, 10 µg/ml), and fractionated on a Superose 200-gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 6 M urea). DTT (final concentration 100 mM) was added to the eluant and reduction proceeded for 2 h at room temperature. Reoxidation proceeded overnight at room temperature and was achieved by diluting the proteins to a final concentration of less than 50 µg/ml (about 150-fold dilution) into renaturation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, including 2 mM reduced, 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione, and 0.01% NaN3). The solution was applied onto a Resource Q column (Pharmacia), and bound protein was eluted with a 10-min linear gradient from buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8) to buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.5 M NaCl). Fractions containing fusion proteins were desalted by gel filtration. Protein concentration was determined using a dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and purified MBP (New England Biolabs) as a standard, by Western blotting and by ELISA using antibodies against MBP. Inhibition of apatite formation was assayed as described below, and the protein specificity of inhibition was routinely verified by digestion of test proteins with proteinase K. Antisera were generated by injecting rabbits with three 50-µg doses of recombinant Sf9 mouse fetuin. The specificity of the antiserum was determined by immunoblotting of serum and tissue extracts from brain, liver, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen, and kidney. In serum and in liver tissue a single protein band of 50-kDa molecular mass (reducing SDS-PAGE) was detected (not shown). SDS-PAGE and chemiluminescence immunoblots were done as described (17Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lectin blots were performed using the DIG-glycan differentiation kit according the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Mice were snap-frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections were cut nominally 8-µm thick and mounted on silanized glass slides. Sections were fixed 10 min at room temperature in Histochoice fixative (AMRESCO) for immunocytochemistry and in p-formaldehyde fixative (4% in PBS) for in situ hybridizations and washed in PBS for 5 min. Immunocytochemistry was performed using peroxidase antiperoxidase reagents (DAKO) and following the manufacturer's handbook of peroxidase staining. Primary antibody was diluted 2000-fold in blocking solution and incubated overnight. Bound antibody was visualized by incubating for 10 min in chromogenic substrate solution (10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 0.03% NiCl2, and 0.03% H2O2). In situ hybridization was performed following published methods (26Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Cryostat sections were dried, fixed, rinsed in water, quenched in acetic anhydride, and dehydrated. 35S-Labeled riboprobes were transcribed from linearized plasmids using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase (Fermentas or Ambion) and 35S-UTP (ICN, 600 Ci/mmol). Probe was applied at 0.3 × 109 cpm/ml and hybridized overnight at 55°C. Sections were treated with RNase, washed at high stringency (65°C, 0.1 × SSC, 30 min), dehydrated, and exposed to BioMAX x-ray film (Kodak) for 3 h. 40 µg of human serum α2-HS dissolved in 90 µl of phosphate-buffered saline were incubated with 1 mCi (10 µl) of carrier-free Na[125I] and Iodogen (100 µg/tube) for 10 min. Unreacted iodine was separated by spin column chromatography on 1 ml of Sephadex LH20 gel (Pharmacia) equilibrated in PBS. Coprecipitation of α2HS with salts was determined by incubating for 90 min at 37°C 125I-labeled α2-HS (5 nM, 200,000 cpm) in buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) with the salt mixtures indicated in Fig. 3. Precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min), and α2-HS coprecipitated was quantified using a gamma counter. To determine the effect of fetuins on the formation of apatite, we adapted the assays described (27Hunter G.K. Kyle C.L. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 28Price P.A. Otsuka A.A. Poser J.W. Kristaponis J. Raman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1447-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Inhibition of calcium salt precipitation was determined by incubating at 37°C for 90 min a buffered salt solution (50 mM Tris-HCl or 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 4.8 mM CaCl2, 2 × 106 cpm [45Ca]Cl2, 1.6 mM Na2HPO4) containing test proteins as indicated in the figure legends. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation (15000 × g, 5 min at room temperature), dissolved in 0.5% acetic acid, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. All incubations were done in triplicate and independently repeated at least two times. To estimate the inhibition of salt precipitation by serum and α2-HS-depleted serum, assays were done in buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing salts at their serum concentrations (25 mM NaHCO3, 4 mM KCl, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2) and a spike of [45Ca]Cl2. Calcium salt precipitation was performed and quantified as above. Human α2-HS glycoprotein was digested either with chymotrypsin, elastase, proteinase K, trypsin, or endoproteinase Glu-C at a molar ratio of 100:1. All digests proceeded 2 h at 37°C in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT). The endoproteinase Glu-C digest was fractionated by HPLC gel filtration. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for inhibitory potency toward apatite formation. Blot sequencing of peptides separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE was performed by Dr. R. Kellner at the Central Protein Chemistry Facility, University of Mainz. 5 mg of bovine fetuin was chemically reduced by incubation for 3 h at 45°C in 1 ml of buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM DTT, 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride). The reduced cysteine residues were carboxymethylated by iodoacetamide (final concentration 6 mM) for 30 min at 25°C in the dark. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to quench residual iodoacetamide, and the reduced/carboxymethylated fetuin was desalted by gel filtration. Reduction was assayed by SDS-PAGE, as reduced single chain fetuins display higher apparent molecular weights than nonreduced forms (17Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Modification of carboxylate groups was performed as published (29Staros J.V. Wright R.W. Swingle D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). 5 mg of bovine fetuin was reacted for 4 h at 37°C in 1 ml of buffer (12.5 mM glycine ethyl ester (GEE), 50 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), and 5 mM N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, pH 4.75). The modified fetuin was dialyzed against water. Modification of carboxylate groups was determined by pI shift in isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (Phastsystem, Pharmacia). Calvaria from newborn rats were dissected and digested with collagenase (type II from C. histolyticum, 2 mg/ml, 20 min, 37°C). The digestion procedure was repeated five more times. Cells of the sixth digest were harvested by straining through a nylon mesh and seeded into 24-well plates at 20,000 cells/cm2. Initial cell culture was in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; calcium, 1.8 mM; PO4, 1 mM; 5% CO2) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) until the cultures became confluent, typically at day 4 in culture. Mineralization was induced by changing the culture medium to DMEM/FCS including 10 mM β-glycerophosphate and 50 µg/ml ascorbate. In serum-free conditions, FCS was substituted by 0.5% bovine serum albumin (dialyzed against distilled water). The influence of fetuins on mineralization was determined by adding purified proteins from stock solutions (in DMEM) to the serum-free medium. Fresh culture medium was replaced every 3 days, and the extent of mineral deposition was scored at day 12 by von Kossa staining (30Clark G. Staining Procedures. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1981: 187Google Scholar). For immunostaining, mineralized primary osteoblasts were fixed with cold methanol. Human α2-HS was detected using polyclonal antiserum against serum α2-HS (diluted 100-fold in PBS) and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 100-fold in PBS). Rabbit preimmune serum served as a negative control. We expressed mouse fetuin cDNA in Sf9 insect cells and purified recombinant mouse fetuin protein to homogeneity to raise specific antibodies in rabbits. We studied the tissue distribution of fetuin in fetal and newborn mice by immunostaining, and on consecutive serial sections we determined the expression of fetuin mRNA by in situ hybridization. Fig. 1 shows an autoradiograph of longitudinal sections of a mouse at day 2 after birth (P2) probed with 35S-labeled riboprobes transcribed in antisense (Fig. 1A) and sense (Fig. 1C) orientation. In this section like in all developmental stages analyzed (E12 through P7, not shown), strong hybridization signals for fetuin mRNA were detected in liver. No other organ expressed fetuin mRNA at levels comparable with liver. Similar hybridization patterns were obtained with 35S-UTP-labeled riboprobes transcribed from the full-length cDNA (1250 base pairs) and from PCR fragments comprising the 3′-terminal half (650 base pairs) of the cDNA (not shown). The 5′-terminal part of fetuins contains two cystatin domains, and riboprobes representing this part of the molecule could possibly cross-hybridize with mRNA for other cystatin-like molecules. The 3′-terminal part of fetuins is, however, specific for this molecule and should only detect fetuin mRNA. The fact that both riboprobe types yielded similar hybridization patterns therefore indicates that our staining was strictly fetuin-specific. To study the tissue distribution of fetuin protein, we stained sections consecutive to the ones used for in situ hybridization with antibody against mouse fetuin protein. Antibody staining of sections at low concentration of antibody (antiserum diluted 1 in 2000) outlined the skeleton, most notably the skull, the calcified part of the ribs, long bones, and teeth (Fig. 1B), indicating that these tissues contained the highest amounts of fetuin protein. Earlier stages of development showed no detectable signal at this low concentration of antiserum. At higher concentration of antibodies (antiserum diluted 1 in 500), many more tissues stained positive for fetuin, among them liver, kidney, hind gut, and skeletal muscle (not shown). Sections stained with preimmune serum diluted 1 in 200 remained unstained (Fig. 1D). The combined results of in situ hybridization and antibody staining indicate that fetuins are primarily made in the liver and are concentrated in bone and teeth. We sought to determine what function in bone fetuins might serve. To test the influence of fetuins on actively mineralizing bone cells, we established primary rat calvaria osteoblast cultures. These cultures grow confluent until day 4 in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After this initial culture period the cells were further grown in DMEM supplemented with ascorbate and β-glycerophosphate to induce mineralization. During this second culture period, the cells deposited calcium mineral as revealed by von Kossa staining at day 12. Fig. 2A represents a typical view of von Kossa stained primary osteoblasts at day 12 in culture. When the DMEM culture medium contained 10% FCS and hence large amounts of bovine fetuin, calcium salt deposits were inconspicuous and only microscopically visible (Fig. 2A, top left well). Bone nodule formation commenced and the cells stayed alive in long term culture for up to 3 weeks (longer periods were not tested). When FCS was omitted from the culture medium and instead 0.5% BSA was included (serum-free medium), upon addition of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbate abundant precipitation of calcium salts occurred starting at day 10, and the cells died until day 12 (Fig. 2A, bottom row). When, however, bovine fetuin (Fig. 2A, left panel) or human α2-HS (Fig. 2A, center panel) were included in the serum-free medium, the initial pattern of FCS-containing cell culture was restored in that precipitation of calcium salts was reduced, mineralized bone nodules were formed, and cells were visually indistinguishable from FCS-containing cultures. This inhibition of salt precipitation was also observed with asialofetuin and recombinant human, rat, and mouse fetuin expressed by baculovirus-infected insect cells (not shown). The inhibition was dose-dependent in that higher concentrations of fetuin more consistently inhibited precipitation than lower concentrations. For example, human α2-HS at 2 µM (100 µg/ml) completely inhibited salt precipitation in 6 out of 6 replicates within 3 independent experiments. At 0.02 µM (1 µg/ml), complete inhibition was observed in 4 out of 6 replicates. Bovine fetuin, asialofetuin, and recombinant human, rat, and mouse fetuin expressed by baculovirus-infected insect cells effected similar inhibition at 0.2 µM like human serum α2-HS. Ovalbumin in combination with BSA (Fig. 2A, right panel) or BSA alone (Fig. 2A, bottom) could not restore the initial pattern obtained with serum-containing medium. Immunofluorescence analysis of the calcium salt deposits formed in the presence of human α2-HS showed that they contained this protein (Fig. 2C), whereas no such α2-HS-containing deposits could be observed in cultures grown without β-glycerophosphate and ascorbate (Fig. 2D). We concluded that fetuins modulate the formation of calcium mineral and sought to determine the molecular basis for this activity. We deliberately switched between forms of fetuins from different species to establish a broad base for the interpretation of fetuin biological activity. We used commercial preparations of bovine fetuin and human α2-HS for chemical modification studies where mg quantities of proteins were required, and we included recombinant forms of fetuins derived from several species to confirm activity detected in bulk purified protein. Results were essentially congruent whenever fetuins from different species were tested in parallel. The accumulation of fetuins in bone matrix has previously been ascribed to its high affinity for hydroxyapatite. An elegant purification procedure for α2-HS has been devised exploiting differential precipitation with solutions containing precipitates of calcium and phosphate (19Ashton B.A. Hohling H.-J. Triffitt J.T. Calcif. Tissue. Res. 1976; 22: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Elaborating on this observation, we devised a precipitation assay to determine the ion specificity of this precipitation reaction. In a precipitation assay with combinations of calcium, magnesium, carbonate, and phosphate ions, 125I-labeled fetuins co-precipitated in mixtures of calcium and phosphate and in mixtures of calcium and carbonate but not in mixtures of magnesium and phosphate (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the binding of fetuins to apatite is due to interactions with calcium ions rather than with phosphate ions. The mineral formed in mixtures of calcium and phosphate under the assay conditions was poorly crystalline apatite as judged by x-ray diffraction of spun and dried precipitate powder (data not shown). Henceforth, we refer to the mineral formed as apatite. We noticed that considerably less apatite but not calcium carbonate was formed in the presence of fetuins than in the protein-free control incubations. Quantification of the salt precipitates under modified assay conditions (Tris-buffered precipitation mixture with added [45Ca]Cl2) revealed that, for example, human α2-HS inhibit"

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), tissue factor, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes. Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP, which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms, inhibited TNFα and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription. Induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers, decrease nuclear translocation of p65, or significantly modify TNFα-induced phosphorylation of p65. Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized κB sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA. This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2072310191,"Posttranslational modifications of synapsin I, a major phosphoprotein in synaptic terminals, were studied by mass spectrometry. In addition to a well known phosphorylation site by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), a hitherto unrecognized site (Ser553) was found phosphorylated in vivo. The phosphorylation site is immediately followed by a proline, suggesting that the protein is an in vivo substrate of so-called proline-directed protein kinase(s).

Recently we have applied electrospray mass spectrometry to studies on in vivo posttranslational modifications of various phosphoproteins. The high precision (within a few Da) and the high resolution (on the order of 10 Da) achieved by the method has made it possible to analyze protein phosphorylation and myristoylation of isolated proteins directly (7Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22310-22315Google Scholar, 8Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol.

Liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in which a capillary high performance liquid chromatography is connected online to an electrospray mass spectrometer, was found very useful in analyzing the in vivo posttranslational modifications including protein phosphorylation. Application of the methodology to brain-specific phosphoproteins revealed that prominent in vivo substrate proteins such as myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) or GAP-43 are phosphorylated by proline-directed protein kinases such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Cdk5 (10Taniguchi H.

This was surprising, since these two proteins have been believed to be major and specific substrates of protein kinase C. This prompted us to reexamine in vivo phosphorylation sites of various major phosphoproteins systematically. In the present study, the posttranslational modifications of synapsin I isolated from bovine brain were studied, and the LC/MS analysis revealed a novel phosphorylation site. To identify the protein kinase(s) involved in the phosphorylation at the novel site, we have examined in vitro phosphorylation of synapsin I by three proline-directed protein kinases expressed highly in the brain, namely MAP kinase, Cdk5-p23 (tau protein kinase II), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (tau protein kinase I) (12Drewes G.

Effects of the phosphorylation on physiological functions of synapsin I were further assessed by examining the interaction of the protein with cytoskeletal proteins. Synapsin I, purified from bovine brain using acid extraction or detergent extraction under nondenaturing conditions as described (18Ueda T. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5155-5163Google Scholar, 19Schiebler W. Jahn R. Doucet J.-P. Rothlein J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8383-8390Google Scholar), was stored in 25 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 175 m NaCl and 0.1 m EGTA, at −80°C. Both preparations gave essentially the same results in terms of in vitro phosphorylation. Actin prepared from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle as described (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Google Scholar) was further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Tubulin was prepared from bovine brain homogenates by three cycles of temperature-dependent assembly and disassembly in 0.1 Mes-NaOH buffer (pH 6.8), containing 1 m EGTA, 0.5 m MgCl2, and 1 m GTP, followed by phosphocellulose column chromatography (21Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.-Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1162-1858Google Scholar). MAP kinase was purified from bovine brain as described previously (12Drewes G. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Döring F. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Goris J. Dorée M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2131-2138Google Scholar), while Cdk5-p23 and GSK3β were purified from the same source as tau protein kinase II and I, respectively (22Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Google Scholar). Purified synapsin I was digested either with −1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) or with lysyl endoprotease from Achromobacter (kindly supplied by Dr. T. Masaki, Ibaraki University, Japan) in 50 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.9) containing 2 urea at 35°C for 10 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1% final concentration of trifluoroacetic acid, and the resulting peptide mixtures were directly injected into the LC/MS apparatus as described previously (10Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of synapsin I by MAP kinase was carried out in 25 m Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 m MgCl2, 0.5 m EGTA, 2 m dithiothreitol, 0.5 m Na3VO4, 12.5 m β-glycerophosphate, 0.05 m NaF, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin at 37°C for the indicated times. The same reaction by Cdk5-p23 or by GSK3β was conducted in 50 m Mes-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.5 m magnesium acetate, 0.5 m EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.5 m dithiothreitol, 0.05 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 µg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 µg/ml antipain at 30°C for the indicated times. Aliquots of F-actin (0.057 mg/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of purified synapsin I or with synapsin I phosphorylated by MAP kinase in 10 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 m KCl, 2 m MgCl2, 1 m ATP, and 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol. Light-scattering intensity of each solution at an angle of 90° was measured in a JASCO FP-777 spectrofluorometer with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 400 nm as described (23Bähler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1986; 326: 704-707Google Scholar). G-actin (3.2 µ) and synapsin I (0.55 µ, unphosphorylated or phosphorylated form) were incubated under polymerizing conditions of actin for 1 h at room temperature in 70 m KCl, 25 m NaCl, 2 m MgCl2, 0.2 m ATP, 14 µ EGTA, 7 µ CaCl2, 3.5 m Tris-HCl, and 15 m Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a table top centrifuge, and the resulting pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tubulin stored as a microtubule pellet at −80°C was cycled once prior to use. Synapsin I, unphosphorylated or phosphorylated, was mixed with tubulin at 4°C in 0.1 Mes buffer (pH 6.8), containing 1 m MgCl2, 1 m GTP, and 1 m EGTA. Glycerol was added to give a final concentration of 20% (v/v), and the mixture was brought to 37°C for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 37°C in a Beckman TL-100 table top ultracentrifuge. Supernatants and pellets thus obtained were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synapsin I isolated from bovine brain using acid extraction as described under “Experimental Procedures” was digested either with trypsin or with lysyl endoprotease, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed with the LC/MS. The total ion current chromatogram obtained with the tryptic digests is shown in Fig. 1. The mass of each peptide eluted from the reversed-phase column was determined with the mass spectrometer and compared with the theoretical one calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (24Südhof T.C.

Most of the peptides that account for more than 98% of the whole sequences of both synapsin Ia and Ib were easily identified solely from the mass as shown in Table I. One interesting point to note is that the N-terminal peptide is clearly Nα-acetylated.TABLE I.Assignment of synapsin I tryptic peptidesPeakPeptideResiduesMass of MH+ObservedCalculatedDa1T31325-328540.2540.32T54 (Ib)663-670769.3769.4T24270-2791012.51012.43T9129-131457.1457.3T28312-315552.2552.3T50577-5871053.41053.5T48557-565925.4925.54T30319-324722.3722.45T49566-5761099.41099.6T52 + Pi603-6121122.21122.56T12135-142925.1924.57T52603-6121042.41042.58T51588-6021485.61484.89T32329-336878.3878.410T39414-420786.3786.411T47 + Pi532-5562517.42517.7aAverage mass.

Open table in a new tab Two tryptic peptides were found partially phosphorylated as shown in Fig. 2. One peptide corresponds to T52 (from Gln603 to Arg612), and the other corresponds to T47 (from Gln532 to Arg556). The former contains one of the two phosphorylation sites by CaM kinase II, i.e. Ser605 (25Czernik A.J. Pang D.T. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7518-7522Google Scholar). Since the peptide contains only one phosphorylatable amino acid, we conclude that the Ser605 is the major in vivo phosphorylation site. The latter peptide, T47, contains more than one possible phosphorylatable residue and was subjected to further analysis. A similar analysis on a synapsin I purified by detergent extraction indicated that these peptides were not phosphorylated, suggesting that dephosphorylation occurred during purification. To determine the phosphorylation sites, the phosphopeptide T47 was isolated by reversed-phase column chromatography and subjected to Edman degradation. Since serine forms both phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of serine (PTH-Ser) and dithiothreitol adduct of dehydroalanine (DTT-Ser), phosphoserine can be detected unambiguously by comparing the yields of the two products (10Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Google Scholar, 26Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the first two of three serine residues in the peptide showed peaks of PTH-Ser and DTT-Ser. The ratios of the two peaks were 0.27 and 0.21, at the second cycle (Ser533) and at the 20th cycle (Ser551), respectively. These values correspond well to those observed with normal serine under the conditions employed. On the contrary, the yield of PTH-Ser peak at the 22nd cycle was under the detection limit, although that of DTT-Ser (2.6 pmol) was comparable with that observed at the 20th cycle (2.9 pmol). Since the phosphopeptide fraction subjected to the analysis contained only singly phosphorylated species as was confirmed by mass spectrometry, these results indicate that Ser553 is the sole phosphorylation site in the peptide. The phosphorylation site is immediately followed by a proline residue, suggesting that synapsin I is an in vivo substrate of so-called proline-directed protein kinase.TABLE II.Determination of phosphoserine in peptide T47 by Edman analysisCyclePTH-SerDTT-SerPTH-Ser/DTT-Serpmolpmol24.617.20.27200.62.90.2122NDaNot detected.2.60a Not detected. Open table in a new tab To identify the protein kinase involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of synapsin I at the novel sites identified, three protein kinases with serine (threonine)-proline specificity that are highly expressed in the brain were tested for their ability to phosphorylate purified synapsin I in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3, significant incorporation of radioactivity was observed with MAP kinase and Cdk5-p23. On the other hand, very little, if any, phosphorylation was observed with GSK3β. Since phosphorylation of tau protein by Cdk5-p23 is a prerequisite for the subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3β (22Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Google Scholar), a mixture of the two kinases was also tested. The extents of the phosphorylation did not differ appreciably between the sample incubated with Cdk5-p23 alone and that with the mixture. The final level of the phosphorylation reached around 3 mol/mol of synapsin I with MAP kinase, while that obtained with Cdk5-p23 was around 1 mol/mol. To determine the in vitro phosphorylation sites, synapsin I phosphorylated by MAP kinase or by Cdk5-p23 was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptide mixtures were directly analyzed by LC/MS as described above. Since most of the peptides have already been assigned, phosphorylated peptides were easily detected by the increase of their mass by 80 Da. Peptide T47 that contained the newly found in vivo phosphorylation site, Ser553, was almost stoichiometrically phosphorylated when MAP kinase was used (Fig. 4, a and b). Interestingly, only singly phosphorylated peptide with a mass of 2516 Da was observed, and no peak corresponding to doubly phosphorylated species was detected. Another peptide found phosphorylated was peptide T5 (from Ala54 to Lys85) (Fig. 4, c and d). In this case quantitative incorporation of two phosphoryl groups was observed. While the doubly phosphorylated species was the major product, very little, if any, singly phosphorylated or triply phosphorylated species were observed. The peak areas of the deconvoluted mass spectra correlate well with the amounts of the peptides under the conditions employed (10Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Google Scholar). Peptide T4 (positions 8-53) near the N terminus was also found phosphorylated to varying degrees depending on the incubation conditions (less than 30%; data not shown). Since no other peptides were found phosphorylated to a significant degree, we concluded that the MAP kinase phosphorylates synapsin I at three major sites and probably at one minor site. This corresponds well to the stoichiometry determined from the phosphorylation experiments using [32P]ATP as described above. When similar experiments were conducted with Cdk5-p23, only one peptide, namely T47, was found phosphorylated to a significant extent (Fig. 5). Judging from the peak intensities of the deconvoluted mass spectra, about 80% of the peptide was found in the singly phosphorylated state. No peak corresponding to doubly phosphorylated species was detected. Peptides T5 and T4 and other peptides identified by LC/MS were not phosphorylated to a significant degree, suggesting that Cdk5-p23 phosphorylates synapsin I at a single site. As shown in Table III, the ratios between PTH-Ser and DTT-Ser remained fairly constant during the degradation of the phosphopeptide T5, which was obtained from MAP kinase-phosphorylated synapsin I, except at two positions, i.e. at cycles 9 and 14. Yields of PTH-Ser were reduced to about 10%, while those of DTT-Ser showed expected values. These Ser residues correspond to Ser62 and Ser67, exactly the two Ser residues predicted from the recognition sequence of the kinase. These results demonstrate again how the method works. On the other hand, peptide T47 contains two Ser residues immediately followed by Pro, namely Ser 551 and Ser 553, the latter being the sole in vivo phosphorylation site found in the peptide. When phosphopeptide T47 obtained from synapsin I phosphorylated with MAP kinase was subjected to the same analysis, only one Ser residue at cycle 20 showed a reduced yield of PTH-Ser (Table IV). The other two Ser residues showed yields corresponding to normal serine. From these results we conclude that the first Ser in the Ser-Pro-Ser-Pro sequence is the sole phosphorylation site in the peptide. This is, in a sense, not surprising, since Ser553 is in a preferred recognition sequence of the kinase (Pro-Xaa-Ser-Pro) (27Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C.

The ratios of the yields of PTH-Ser and those of DTT-Ser showed intermediate values between 0.2 (serine) and 0.02 (phosphoserine) both at cycle 20 (Ser551) and cycle 22 (Ser553). Since the isolated phosphopeptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry to contain only singly phosphorylated species free from nonphosphorylated and doubly phosphorylated species (data not shown), the total content of phosphoserine in the peptide should be exactly one mol/mol of peptide. The results obtained indicate that the one phosphoserine is distributed between the two positions. When we assume the PTH-Ser/DTT-Ser ratios of 0.03 and 0.20 for serine and phosphoserine, respectively, we can roughly estimate the contents of phosphoserine. At cycle 20, roughly 55% is phosphoserine, and at cycle 22 about 35% is phosphoserine. Since the sum (90%) corresponds fairly well to the theoretical value of 100%, such a calculation is feasible. When synapsin I purified by detergent extraction, which lacks the in vivo phosphorylated species, was used, about 50% of Ser551 and 40% of Ser553 were found phosphorylated. These results suggest that Cdk5-p23 phosphorylates synapsin I both at Ser551 and Ser553 and that the former is slightly favored over the latter. Furthermore, the phosphorylation at the two positions is mutually exclusive, since doubly phosphorylated species was not observed to significant extent as described above (Fig. 5). This was also the case with the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Although the synapsin I preparation used contained in vivo phosphorylated species, no doubly phosphorylated T47 peptide was observed with the MAP kinase phosphorylated synapsin I as shown in Fig. 4b. Thus, MAP kinase did not phosphorylate Ser551 when Ser553 had been already phosphorylated. To understand physiological function of phosphorylation by MAP kinase or Cdk5-p23, we studied the effect of the phosphorylation on the F-actin bundling activity of synapsin I (23Bähler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1986; 326: 704-707Google Scholar). The bundling of actin filaments was measured by the increase in light scattering. As shown in Fig. 6a, light scattering of F-actin solution increased drastically with the addition of increasing amounts of dephosphosynapsin I (23Bähler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1986; 326: 704-707Google Scholar). On the other hand, the addition of synapsin I phosphorylated by MAP kinase caused only a slight increase in the light scattering, suggesting that the phosphorylation of synapsin I abolishes the F-actin bundling activity of the protein. These results were further confirmed by sedimentation experiments. Under the conditions employed, only large aggregates of bundled F-actin can be precipitated by low speed centrifugation, while individual actin filaments and synapsin I remain in the supernatant. Consistent with the light-scattering measurements, the addition of dephosphosynapsin I to F-actin led to sedimentation of bundled actin filaments, and most of the synapsin I added was also found in the pellet (Fig. 6b). On the other hand, the addition of synapsin I phosphorylated by MAP kinase caused no significant increase of actin found in the pellet. Synapsin I also remained in the supernatant. Note that the mobility of synapsin I in the gel changed after phosphorylation by MAP kinase. These results demonstrated that the phosphorylation of synapsin I by MAP kinase drastically decreases the affinity of the protein to actin filaments. Contrary to the drastic effects caused by the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation, synapsin I phosphorylated by Cdk5-p23 retained the ability to bind to actin filaments and to bundle them as shown in Fig. 6b. Since synapsin I has been reported to bind another major cytoskeletal component, tubulin (29Baines A. Bennett V. Nature. 1986; 319: 145-147Google Scholar), we then analyzed effects of the phosphorylation on the synapsin I-tubulin interaction. When synapsin I was mixed with polymerized tubulin, incubated at 37°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, most synapsin I cosedimented with tubulin (Fig. 7, lane 6). Similarly, when synapsin I phosphorylated by MAP kinase was mixed with tubulin, most of phosphorylated synapsin I was found in pellets with tubulin (Fig. 7, lane 8). Phosphorylation by Cdk5-p23 did not show any significant effect on the binding either (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to actin bundling activity, phosphorylation of synapsin I by the two proline-directed protein kinases has little influence on the synapsin I-tubulin interaction. Synapsin I, one of the prominent endogenous phosphoproteins in the nerve terminals, has been characterized as a substrate protein of various protein kinases such as CaM kinases I and II and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (2Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Google Scholar). Physiological functions of synapsin I, i.e. the cross-linking between synaptic vesicles and cytoskeletons seems to be regulated by phosphorylation by these kinases (1Valtorta F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7195-7198Google Scholar, 2Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Google Scholar). The detailed analysis on the in vivo phosphorylation site described in the present study, however, revealed a novel phosphorylation site. The phosphorylated serine is immediately followed by a proline, suggesting that synapsin I is an in vivo substrate of so-called proline-directed protein kinase. We have previously shown that the two prominent in vivo substrate proteins of protein kinase C, MARCKS and GAP-43, are also phosphorylated by these kinases in vivo (10Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Google Scholar). These results suggest that the physiological functions of various proteins are regulated by multiple protein kinases in a very complex manner and that cross-talks between various signaling pathways occur not only upstream of the pathways but also at the substrate protein level. Of the three proline-directed protein kinases tested, only MAP kinase and Cdk5-p23 phosphorylated synapsin I in vitro, and GSK3β did not phosphorylate the protein to a significant extent. The phosphorylation by the two kinases was site-specific; only one of two serine residues (Ser551 and Ser553) was phosphorylated by Cdk5-p23, while three serine residues were phosphorylated by MAP kinase. Since bovine synapsin I contains 11 Ser (The)-Pro motifs, there should be structural determinants other than the adjacent proline in the substrate recognition by the kinases. As for MAP kinase, Ser551 is within a well known recognition sequence of the kinase, Pro-Xaa-Ser-Pro, where Xaa is usually a small neutral amino acid (27Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Google Scholar, 28Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Google Scholar). Since the other two sites have a proline either at −3-position or at −1-position, the presence of a proline preceding the phosphorylation site serine/threonine may be important for the recognition. It should be noted that peptide T4 (from Leu8 to Arg53), which was phosphorylated to some extents, contains a single Ser-Pro motif (Ser39), which is preceded by a proline. On the other hand, only one phosphopeptide was observed with synapsin I phosphorylated by Cdk5-p23. This kinase seems to phosphorylate both Ser551 and Ser553, but the phosphorylation at these two sites is mutually exclusive, suggesting that the incorporation of negative charges in the neighborhood changes the substrate specificity. Ser551 is preferentially phosphorylated, although the difference may not be significant. The recognition sequence of the kinase has yet to be defined, but an arginine at +3-position may be an important determinant. Only one kinase, so-called proline-directed protein kinase has been so far reported to phosphorylate synapsin I in these regions (30Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6944-6948Google Scholar). The kinase has later been identified as Cdc2-cyclin A complex (31Hall F.L. Braun R.K. Mihara K. Fung Y.-K.T. Berndt N. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17430-17440Google Scholar). Since Cdc2 kinase is not expressed in the brain to a significant extent, this phosphorylation reaction lacks physiological relevance. However, it is of interest to note that the kinase also phosphorylates Ser551 preferentially (30Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6944-6948Google Scholar). Whether the kinase phosphorylates Ser553 is not clear, because of the limitation of the technique used in determining the phosphorylation site. The radiosequencing employed in the study suffers from a massive carryover, which obscures the determination of successive phosphorylation sites. In any case, it is interesting that the three proline-directed protein kinases so far tested phosphorylate Ser551 exclusively or preferentially. Only Cdk5-p23 phosphorylates Ser553, but the kinase phosphorylates Ser551 as well, although only the former was found phosphorylated in vivo as has been shown in the present study. One possibility is that a protein kinase or kinases other than the ones tested are responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser553. The other explanation is that Ser551 is preferentially dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase(s). Since the present study on the in vivo phosphorylation state of synapsin I represents only a “snapshot” of the total brain, similar studies conducted with cells and tissues under various physiological stimulations may give an answer to the question. The in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation sites so far identified are summarized in Fig. 8. Phosphorylation of synapsin I at Ser568 and at Ser605 by CaM kinase II abolishes the bundling activity of actin filaments (23Bähler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1986; 326: 704-707Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, phosphorylation by MAP kinase showed a similar effect on the F-actin bundling activity, while Cdk5-p23-dependent phosphorylation had practically no effect. Since MAP kinase and Cdk5-p23 both phosphorylate a similar site in the tail region of synapsin I (Ser551 or Ser553), the effects caused by the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation should be due to the phosphorylation of the two serine residues in the head region (Ser62 and Ser67). The major actin-binding site has been reported in the globular head domain of the synapsin I molecule (32Bähler M. Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 111-126Google Scholar), and the presence of a second binding site in the tail region has been predicted (33Petrucci T.C. Morrow J.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 413-421Google Scholar). At the moment it is not clear whether the region around the two phosphorylation sites by MAP kinase is directly involved in the synapsin I-actin binding or if the conformational change caused by the phosphorylation is responsible for the diminished interaction. On the contrary, the binding of synapsin I to tubulin was not affected by the phosphorylation either by MAP kinase or Cdk5-p23. This may suggest that the binding sites for the two major cytoskeletal elements are different, and the interactions with them may be regulated differentially. Physiological function of the phosphorylation at the novel site found in the present study (Ser553), therefore, still remains to be established. Studies on the interaction of synapsin I with other cellular components such as synaptic vesicles and Grb2, a SH3-containing signal transduction protein (34McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Google Scholar) may give an answer to the question. Whether the MAP kinase- or Cdk5-p23-dependent phosphorylation occurs in vivo and whether the phosphorylation reactions are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release still remains to be seen. However, it should be noted that a mobility shift of synapsin I in SDS gel electrophoresis occurs in PC12 cells after nerve growth factor stimulation (35Romano C. Nichols R.A. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1300-1306Google Scholar). According to these authors nerve growth factor induces a novel phosphorylation site of synapsin I at a site other than those by CaM kinase and by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation has previously been attributed to that by Cdc2-cyclin A (1Valtorta F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7195-7198Google Scholar, 30Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6944-6948Google Scholar), but the present study demonstrated that the mobility shift is induced only by MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation but not by Cdk5-p23-dependent phosphorylation. The fact that phosphorylation by Cdk5-p23 or that by Cdc2-cyclin A does not cause any detectable mobility shift (30Hall F.L. Mitchell J.P. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6944-6948Google Scholar) suggests that the protein kinase involved in nerve growth factor-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I in PC12 is MAP kinase. In conclusion, proline-directed protein kinases that include MAP kinase, Cdk5-p23, and (probably) other unknown protein kinases seem to play important roles in the physiological regulation of cytoskeletal components during neurotransmitter release, and there seem to be complex interactions between various protein kinases not only upstream of the signal transduction pathways but also at the substrate protein level (10Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2037159473,"Lipoxygenases are ubiquitous enzymes in eukaryotes. In plants, lipoxygenases are involved in the synthesis of the hormone jasmonic acid that regulates plant responses to wounding and, in addition, is an inducer of tuberization in potato.We have isolated potato lipoxygenase cDNA clones. From their deduced amino acid sequences, three distinct classes are defined (Lox1, Lox2, and Lox3). They are encoded in gene families that display organ-specific expression, lox1 being expressed mostly in tubers and roots, lox2 in leaves, and lox3 in leaves and roots.Consistent with their organ-specific expression pattern, Lox1 expressed in bacteria preferentially uses as substrate linoleic acid, abundant in membrane lipids of tubers, whereas linolenic acid, prevalent in leaves, is the preferred substrate for the other two classes of lipoxygenase. Analyses on reaction products of the enzymes expressed in bacteria reveal that Lox1 primarily produces 9- hydroperoxides. In contrast, the jasmonic acid precursor, 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid, is the major product of the action of Lox2 and Lox3 on linolenic acid. Upon wounding, the levels of Lox2 and Lox3 transcripts rise markedly in leaves. While Lox3 mRNA accumulation peaks as early as 30 min after wounding, Lox2 shows a steady increase over a 24-h time course, suggesting different roles for these lipoxygenase isoforms in the synthesis of the plant hormone jasmonic acid.

Lipoxygenases are nonheme iron-containing enzymes that catalyze the dioxygenation of fatty acids with a 1,4-pentadiene structure and are ubiquitous among eukaryotes (1Siedow J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Google Scholar). In most, if not all, of the plant species studied so far lipoxygenases are encoded by gene families. The expression of their individual members is subject to tight developmental control, although frequently more than one gene is active at a given developmental stage, accounting for the presence of multiple lipoxygenase isoforms in the tissues analyzed (2Rosahl S. Z. Naturforschung. 1996; 51c: 123-138Google Scholar). In soybean seeds, one of the best studied examples, there are three major lipoxygenase isoforms. Their prevalence declines upon germination, when at least two new isoforms appear in expanding hypocotyls and radicles. In leaves of adult soybean plants, a range of lipoxygenase isozymes are present whose relative prevalence varies throughout development and upon wounding (1Siedow J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Google Scholar, 2Rosahl S. Z. Naturforschung. 1996; 51c: 123-138Google Scholar). Although the specific function accomplished by the various isoforms is unknown, they may differ in a number of characteristics such as substrate preference, kinetic parameters, and positional specificity of substrate oxygenation. Linoleic and linolenic acids, the most abundant fatty acids in plant membrane lipids, are major substrates for lipoxygenase that can catalyze the addition of molecular oxygen at either the C-9 or C-13 residue of the fatty acid. This oxygenation step is a branch point starting a cascade of reactions referred to as the lipoxygenase pathway (3Vick B.A. Moore T.S. Lipid Metabolism in Plants. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 167Google Scholar) in which the hydroperoxides produced by lipoxygenase activity are substrates for subsequent action of hydroperoxide lyase and allene oxide synthase. The role of 9-lipoxygenase activity in plants is poorly understood. Whereas 9-hydroperoxides are not substrates for allene oxide synthase (4Vick B.A. Feng P. Zimmerman D.C. Lipids. 1980; 15: 468-471Google Scholar), the action of hydroperoxide lyase on the 9-hydroperoxides of linoleic or linolenic acids gives rise to aldehydes and oxoacids with 9-carbon moieties, which are part of the characteristic flavors and odors in fruits and leaves (2Rosahl S. Z. Naturforschung. 1996; 51c: 123-138Google Scholar). On the other branch of the lipoxygenase pathway, 13-lipoxygenase activity leads to the formation of 13-hydroperoxy linoleic and linolenic acids. The latter is a precursor for the plant growth regulators traumatin and jasmonic acid (JA). 1The abbreviations used are: JAjasmonic acidABAabscisic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. Traumatin is formed by the action of hydroperoxide lyase on 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid and was identified as the compound responsible for inducing callus growth that accompanied wound healing (3Vick B.A. Moore T.S. Lipid Metabolism in Plants. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 167Google Scholar). jasmonic acid abscisic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. Alternatively, 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid is also a substrate for allene oxide synthase, giving rise, after reduction and a series of β-oxidations, to jasmonic acid, which has been implicated as a key regulator in the plant response to wounding (5Farmer E.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1423-1437Google Scholar). A model has been proposed for the activation of defense genes via the octadecanoid pathway, in which linolenic acid is released upon wounding from cell membranes by the action of a lipase, subsequently oxidized by a lipoxygenase, and finally converted to JA that activates the transcription of genes involved in defense reactions (6Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 129-134Google Scholar). In addition, both JA and the structurally very similar tuberonic acid can induce tuber formation in potato (7Koda Y. Kikuta Y. Tazaki H. Tsujino Y. Sakamura S. Yoshihara T. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 1435-1438Google Scholar, 8Pelacho A.M. Mingo-Castel A.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1253-1255Google Scholar). In fact, the glycosyl derivative of tuberonic acid, the 3-oxo-2-(5′-β—glucopyranosyl-2′-cis-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-acetic acid, has been identified as the main component of the tuber-inducing activity found in the leaves of potato plants kept under tuberizing conditions (9Yoshihara T. Omer E.A. Koshino H. Sakamura S. Koda Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2835-2837Google Scholar). Despite the pivotal role that JA may play in tuberization and in the response to wounding, little is known of the potato genes encoding enzymes involved in JA biosynthesis, lipoxygenase in particular (10Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Google Scholar, 11Casey R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 265-266Google Scholar). We therefore set out to characterize thoroughly the lipoxygenase gene family in potato. To this end, we have studied the expression patterns of three classes of potato lipoxygenases in different organs and their responses to wounding with regard to their ability to synthesize the 13-hydroperoxide precursor of jasmonic acid. 13-Lipoxygenases are important enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of JA, and consequently, their activity could be a determinant for regulating the intracellular levels of JA and for the control of processes affected by this phytohormone. 9-Lipoxygenases may, on the other hand, divert any linolenic acid released from membrane lipids for the formation of products other than JA, whose role, if any, is unknown. On the basis of the results obtained, the role these lipoxygenases may play in plant development and, in particular, in controlling the endogenous levels of jasmonic acid in the different organs of the plant, both prior to and after wounding, is discussed. cDNA expression libraries in λZAPII (Stratagene) from RNA of potato tubers and leaves (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Desirée) were screened using a polyclonal antiserum against a previously described potato root lipoxygenase (10Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Google Scholar) using standard techniques (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were excised in vivo and sequenced. To obtain full-length coding sequences for clones H1 and H3, rapid amplification of cDNA 5′ ends was performed using a Marathon™ cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Total RNA (1 µg) isolated from potato leaves 30 min or 24 h after wounding was reverse transcribed using the H3 primer 5′-TGACACTAGCGCGGACC-3′ or the H1 primer 5′-TGTAAAGGAACACCACG-3′ respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction amplification was conducted using the Clontech AP1 primer and either the H1 primer 5′-ACTAGTTCGAGTCGGCG-3′ or the H3 primer 5′-ACCTAGGTACAGTCACG-3′, and the products obtained were cloned in pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene) and sequenced. Genomic DNA was isolated from potato leaves (S. tuberosum cv. Desirée) (13Doyle J.J. Doyle J.L. Focus. 1990; 12: 13-15Google Scholar). 10 µg of the genomic DNA were digested with restriction enzymes, separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels, denatured, and transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Corp.). The inserts of clones to be used as probes were 32P-labeled by the Rediprime labeling system (Amersham) and hybridized in 0.25 phosphate buffer, 0.25 NaCl, 1 m EDTA, 7% SDS, 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 40% formamide, 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42°C. Filters were washed at 65°C with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 m NaCl, 15 m sodium citrate), 0.5% SDS (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Potato plants were grown in soil under a 16-h day/8-h night photoperiod. For wounding experiments, two leaflets of a fully expanded leaf were damaged by crushing the leaf blade three or four times with a forceps. After the indicated time periods, the directly wounded and the intact (systemic) leaflets of the same leaf were separately collected. For jasmonic acid (mixed isomers; Apex Organics) and abscisic acid (mixed isomers; Sigma) treatments, potato plants were sprayed and watered once with a 50 µ aqueous solution of the corresponding phytohormone, and leaves were collected after the indicated time intervals. Roots from potato plants grown in vitro in 50 ml of solid Murashige and Skoog medium (ICN) supplemented with 2% sucrose under a 16-h light/8-h darkness regime were used for wounding and JA treatments. For wounding experiments, roots from 10-cm-long plants were damaged with a forceps and left in the medium before harvesting at the indicated times. For JA treatments, 2.5 ml of a 50 µ JA solution were added to the medium where plants were growing, and roots were collected at the indicated times. Roots from untreated plants were taken as controls. Total RNA isolation and separation on agarose-formaldehyde gels (10 µg/lane) was as described (14Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Google Scholar). RNAs were subsequently blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham) following standard conditions (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization of the filters was carried out as described for Southern analysis. The pRSET expression vectors (Invitrogen) were used to express the lipoxygenase sequences in E. coli. These vectors provide a start codon, and a 6 × His tag is added to the amino terminus of the different lipoxygenases. The entire insert of the cDNA clone H1 was released from pBluescript SK(−) as an EcoRI fragment and cloned into the EcoRI site of pRSET-C to yield SET-H1. The first residue of the lipoxygenase H1 contained in SET-H1 is the Asn at position 46 in Fig. 1. Similarly, an EcoRI fragment containing the whole insert of the cDNA clone H3 was ligated into the EcoRI site of pRSET-C. The first lipoxygenase H3 residue in the resulting SET-H3 clone is the Asn at position 68 in Fig. 1. Thus, upon expression in E. coli, both H1 and H3 proteins have a 45-amino acid-long NH2-terminal extension, including the polyhistidine tag, derived from vector sequences. Finally, the insert of cDNA clone T8 was liberated as a SalI/RcaI fragment, its ends filled in with Klenow enzyme and cloned into a previously blunted EcoRI site of pRSET-B to obtain SET-T8 that contains the whole coding region of lipoxygenase T8. The first ATG is provided by the pRSET vector and is in frame with the authentic T8 ATG, resulting in a 44-amino acid-long vector-derived NH2 extension. The cloning junctions of all constructs were checked by sequencing prior to the expression studies. The constructs were introduced into BL21 (DE3) cells (15Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) that carried the plasmid pSB161 (10Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Google Scholar). Freshly transformed bacteria were grown to midlog phase at 37°C in 25 ml of LB medium and induced by adding isopropylthio-β-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 m. The cultures were subsequently incubated at 25°C for 14 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (50 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 m EDTA, 500 m NaCl). Bacterial suspensions were freeze-thawed twice and subjected to sonication. Supernatants of the crude extracts were used to determine enzyme activity. Lipoxygenase activity was determined by two different methods. Spectrophotometric detection of the increase in A235, caused by the formation of conjugated -diene structures, was performed as described (16Shimuzu T. Honda Z.I. Miki I. Seyama Y. Izumi T. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 296-306Google Scholar). Bacterial extracts were incubated in 100 µ linoleic acid, in 100 m sodium acetate buffer, for pH 5.0 and 6.0, and 100 m Tris-HCl buffer for pH 7.0 and 8.0, at room temperature. Tween 20 was added to a final concentration of 0.005%. Consumption of oxygen with linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acid as substrates in 100 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.1% Tween 20 was determined with a Clark oxygen electrode at 30°C (17Delieu T. Walker D.A. New Phytol. 1972; 71: 201-225Google Scholar). Lipoxygenase activity was calculated in nmol of oxygen or hydroperoxy linoleic acid/min/µl of bacterial extract, since the assays were performed with crude protein mixtures. The pRSET B vector was used as a negative control. Linolenic acid (25 µmol) was incubated with the E. coli-expressed lipoxygenase T8 (6.7 µmol of hydroperoxidiene/min), H1 (6.85 µmol/min), and H3 (7.05 µmol/min), in 25 ml of oxygen-saturated 50 m sodium phosphate buffer at appropriate pH, 6.12 for T8 and H1 lipoxygenases and 7.06 for H3 lipoxygenase. Enzymatic reactions were carried out at 20°C with a constant flow of oxygen for 15 min and then stopped by adjusting to pH 3 with 2 HCl. The incubation mixture was passed through a reverse-phase C18 microcolumn (Waters, Milford, MA), and the products were eluted with methanol. The concentrated products were esterified with diazomethane (18Cohen J.D. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 313: 194-196Google Scholar), and the presence of positional and geometrical isomers was analyzed by HPLC with a LiChrosorb Si-60 (250 × 4 mm, 5 µm) column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), with n-hexane/diethyl ether (92:8, v/v) as solvent, flow rate 1.25 ml/min, and detection at 234 and 280 nm. The retention times of the reaction products were compared with those of authentic 13- and 9-hydroperoxy isomers from linolenic acid produced according to the methods of Hamberg and Samuelsson (19Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Google Scholar) and Galliard and Phillips (20Galliard T. Phillips D.R. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 431-438Google Scholar). Each separated product was identified by GLC-MS analysis (VG AEI MS-30, Manchester, United Kingdom) performed on a DB5-MS capillary (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.5 µm) column (JW Scientific, Folsom, CA), operated at 190°C and then programmed at 4°C/min to 230°C, ionization potential 70 eV. Hydroperoxides were reduced with NaBH4 and analyzed after hydrogenation with H2/PtO2 as trimethylsilyl derivatives. In most of the plant species so far analyzed, lipoxygenases are encoded by large gene families whose members show clear sequence divergence and complex expression patterns. To characterize the potato lipoxygenase family we used a polyclonal antibody raised against a previously described potato root lipoxygenase (10Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Google Scholar) for screening tuber and leaf cDNA expression libraries. Six different cDNA clones (T4, T6, T8, T10, T12, and T13) were selected from the tuber cDNA expression library, and two (H1 and H3) were selected from the leaf library. Sequence comparison with a previously reported tuber cDNA clone (11Casey R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 265-266Google Scholar) revealed that T8 codes for a full-length lipoxygenase. The other tuber cDNAs isolated contained truncated lipoxygenase sequences highly similar to T8 and have not been further investigated. The isolated leaf H1 and H3 cDNA clones lacked part of the N termini of the putative lipoxygenases, and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA end experiments were undertaken to get the missing 5′ regions. The resulting H3 clone contains an open reading frame starting with an ATG codon preceded by an in-frame stop codon, indicating that it contains the complete coding region. We have not found an equivalent stop codon upstream of the first ATG found in the open reading frame of lipoxygenase H1; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some part of its coding region is still missing. The lipoxygenases encoded by the tuber cDNAs we have isolated and the previously described tuber (11Casey R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 265-266Google Scholar) and root (10Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Google Scholar) potato lipoxygenases constitute a group of very similar sequences that are more than 95% identical at the amino acid level (Fig. 1 and Table I). The gene product predicted from the open reading frame present in clone T8 has 861 amino acids and a molecular mass of 97 kDa (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the leaf cDNA clones H1 and H3 code for two clearly different proteins of 899 amino acids and 101 kDa (H1) and 914 amino acids and 103 kDa (H3). H1 is more related to the leaf lipoxygenases Lox2:Os:1 from rice (21Peng Y.-L. Shirano Y. Ohta H. Hibino T. Tanaka K. Shibata D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3755-3761Google Scholar) and AtLox2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (22Bell E. Mullet J.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1133-1137Google Scholar) than to the potato tuber and root lipoxygenases, whereas H3 cannot be grouped with any of these lipoxygenases.TABLE IPairwise comparison of identities and similarities between plant lipoxygenasesT8H1H3AtLox1AtLox2H143(63)H34847(65)(66)AtLox1674446(80)(63)(64)AtLox243574645(63)(73)(64)(63)Lox2:Os:14455464452(62)(71)(63)(61)(69) Open table in a new tab Despite their sequence divergence, the amino acid residues that are considered to be important for a functional enzyme are preserved in all the potato lipoxygenases characterized in this work (Fig. 1). These include three His residues and one Ile residue shown to be involved in binding the iron atom essential for the enzymatic activity of lipoxygenases and the Asn that has been implicated with less confidence in the same function (23Boyington J.C. Gafnney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Google Scholar, 24Nelson M.J. Seitz S.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 878-884Google Scholar). The 12 highly conserved amino acids lining the internal cavity of the enzyme that is likely to accommodate the fatty acid substrate and a number of residues in the C-terminal half of the protein, including two His residues of unknown function but conserved among plant and animal lipoxygenases, are also present in the clones described. The sequence comparison shown in Fig. 1 reveals that H1 and H3 proteins are more than 50 amino acids longer at their amino termini than the tuber and root lipoxygenases. There are no significant similarities between the amino acid sequences of these amino-terminal extensions nor with those present at equivalent positions in the rice Lox2:Os:1 (21Peng Y.-L. Shirano Y. Ohta H. Hibino T. Tanaka K. Shibata D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3755-3761Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis AtLox2 (22Bell E. Mullet J.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1133-1137Google Scholar) leaf lipoxygenases. However, all of them share some characteristic features of transit peptides for translocation of proteins into chloroplasts, including a high proportion of the hydroxyl amino acids Ser and Thr, and a low abundance of acidic residues (25von Heijne G. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 1-3Google Scholar). AtLox2 has been recently shown to be indeed targeted to chloroplasts (26Bell E. Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8675-8679Google Scholar). These results indicate the presence of at least three classes of lipoxygenase proteins in potato; the Lox1 class includes our six tuber cDNA clones and the tuber and root cDNAs described previously, the Lox2 class is represented by cDNA clone H1, and the Lox3 class is represented by H3. Genomic Southern analysis using the inserts of clones T8, H1, and H3 as probes revealed different patterns of multiple hybridizing bands (Fig. 2). Comparison with the restriction maps of the corresponding cDNA clones suggests that each of the three lipoxygenase classes is encoded by few genes in the potato genome, perhaps a single one in the case of H3. The relatively high number of different cDNA clones isolated for Lox1 class (eight) with very few nucleotide exchanges is suggestive of allelic variability. Lipoxygenase expression in the studied plant species is under a strict developmental control. This is likely related to the involvement of the different isozymes in separate tasks such as nutrient mobilization, membrane degradation, and defense against pests and pathogens (2Rosahl S. Z. Naturforschung. 1996; 51c: 123-138Google Scholar). To characterize the expression in potato of the three classes of lipoxygenase genes mentioned above, total RNA isolated from leaves, roots, tubers, and green floral buds was subjected to Northern blot analysis using the inserts of clones T8, H1, and H3 as probes (Fig. 3). Transcripts corresponding to the Lox1 class were predominantly detected in tubers and roots and to a much lesser extent in buds and leaves. Along tuber formation, Lox1 class transcripts were detected at the stolon stage, and their steady state levels increased during the early stages of tuber development, reaching a peak in tubers of about 1.2 g. (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Expression of Lox1 class lipoxygenases during tuber development. Northern analysis was performed to detect the presence of Lox1 transcripts in total RNA from stolons (lane 1) and from tubers with an average weight of 0.1 g (lane 2), 0.5 g (lane 3), 1.2 g (lane 4), 2.5 g (lane 5), and 5 g (lane 6). T8 cDNA was used as radioactive probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Both Lox2 and Lox3 transcripts were present in leaves and to a lesser extent in green floral buds. Lox3 was also expressed in roots, attaining a higher steady-state level than in leaves and, weakly, in tubers. The levels of Lox2 transcripts in these organs were below the detection limit. An increase upon wounding of the endogenous levels of jasmonic acid, most likely due to de novo synthesis of this hormone, is strictly required for the transcriptional activation of the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene (pin2) and other wound-responsive genes (27Peña-Cortés H. Albrecht T. Prat S. Weiler E.W. Willmitzer L. Planta. 1993; 191: 123-128Google Scholar). One could therefore expect that the expression of the lipoxygenases involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid would be modulated by wounding. To test this possibility, mRNA levels of the three classes of potato lipoxygenases were determined by Northern analysis in leaves of wounded plants or plants treated with either JA or ABA. As shown in Fig. 5, there were significant increases in the steady-state levels of the Lox2 and Lox3 mRNAs both in the locally wounded and in the adjacent, systemic leaflets. The time courses of induction and the transcript levels attained were similar in local and systemic tissues. Spraying the leaves with JA also resulted in higher steady-state levels of Lox2 and Lox3 transcripts, following time courses that resembled the wounding treatments. However, both upon wounding and JA treatment, the lox3 class displayed a faster and more transient response than lox2. Thus, maximal Lox3 levels were attained around 30 min after wounding or JA treatment, when the Lox2 level started to rise steadily up to 24 h after treatment. At the latter time point Lox3 transcripts had long returned to basal levels. ABA has been shown to trigger the wound response in potato plants by activating the JA biosynthetic pathway (28Peña-Cortés H. Fisahn J. Willmitzer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4106-4113Google Scholar). We have only detected very modest increases in the accumulation of Lox2 and Lox3 transcripts, but again, the observed effect was faster and more transient, as well as more pronounced, for Lox3 than for Lox2. However, ABA treatment resulted in induction of the wound-responsive proteinase inhibitor II gene. Further work will be needed to clarify the role of this phytohormone in lipoxygenase expression. None of these treatments affected appreciably the low levels of Lox1 transcripts detectable in leaves (data not shown). As expected, pin2 mRNA accumulated upon wounding, both in the locally damaged and in the systemic tissue and after JA or ABA treatments (Fig. 5). pin2 mRNA accumulation mirrored the Lox2 time course of induction and was clearly delayed as compared with Lox3. In roots, Lox3 mRNA levels increased upon wounding and JA treatment following a time course very similar to the one in leaves (Fig. 6). An increase in the steady-state levels of Lox1 transcripts was observed 2 h after JA treatment and 24 h after wounding. In contrast, Lox2 levels in roots remained in both cases below the limit of detection (data not shown). The proteins encoded by the three classes of lipoxygenase cDNA clones identified in this paper have significant sequence divergence. To determine whether all them indeed have lipoxygenase activity, we expressed in E. coli the T8, H1, and H3 cDNA clones as translational fusions to a T7-Tag and tested the enzymatic activity of the resulting protein extracts. T8 was chosen as full-length cDNA representative for the Lox1 class. It is likely that, due to the high degree of sequence conservation in the Lox1 class, the enzymatic properties determined for T8 would be shared by the other members of the class. The T7-Tag consists of six His residues shown to permit the correct functionality of the downstream protein (29Janknecht R. de Martynoff G. Lou J. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8972-8976Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies with the rice seedling lipoxygenase L-2 indicated that the enzymatic properties of a fusion protein carrying 18 additional residues at its N terminus were indistinguishable from those of the authentic lipoxygenase purified from rice seedlings (30Shirano Y. Shibata D. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 128-130Google Scholar, 31Ohta H. Shirano Y. Tanaka K. Morita Y. Shibata D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 331-336Google Scholar). Upon isopropyl-β—thiogalactopyranoside induction, crude extracts of bacteria expressing the fusion proteins displayed a novel protein with the expected molecular mass of about 100 kDa, as detected by Western blotting. As estimated by quantitative scanning analysis, the relative accumulation of H1 and T8 was about 10 and 5 times higher than of H3, respectively (data not shown). Enzyme activity in the bacterial extracts was determined by oxygen consumption, using linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acid as substrates. The results summarized in Table II indicate that the three proteins indeed have lipoxygenase activity, linoleic acid being the preferred substrate for T8, whereas H1 and H3 are more active against linolenic acid, consistent with the prevalence of these fatty acids in the respective organs wher"

Proteases belonging to this family exist in the cytosol as zymogens that require accurate processing at internal aspartate residues to generate the two-chain active enzymes. As such, CED-3/ICE family members are capable of activating each other in a manner analogous to the protease zymogens of the coagulation or complement cascades. At present, it is unknown whether such mutual processing exists in vivo, and if so whether it is sequential, implying an order to the death pathway. Using a cell-free apoptosis system, recombinant ICE proteases and both biochemical and morphological criteria, we demonstrate an ordering of the mammalian ICEs that are most related to the Caenorhabditis elegans death protease CED-3.

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, a process of fundamental importance to all multicellular organisms, occurs in a morphologically distinct fashion in the absence of a concomitant inflammatory response (1Kerr J.F.

Identification of genes involved in cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans has been of pivotal importance in deciphering components of the death pathway (3Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O.

While there is one ced-3 gene in C. elegans, mammals possess numerous related genes, not all of which appear to play a prominent role in apoptosis (6Henkart P. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Google Scholar). Mammalian ICE itself, for example, appears to be primarily involved in the proteolytic maturation of the cytokine IL-1β (7Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S.

Upon receipt of an apoptotic signal, the endogenous zymogen form of these enzymes is rapidly converted to the active dimeric species by cleavage into large and small subunits whose intimate association is required for proteolytic activity (18Walker N.P.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18738-18741Google Scholar, respectively). Bound antibody was visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant active forms of Yama, LAP3, and Mch2 were expressed using the pET 23b vector (Novagen) and purified with the QIAexpress system (Qiagen). N-terminal sequencing of each recombinant protease on an Applied Biosystems model 476A sequencer confirmed purity and demonstrated that the following cleavage sites resulted in removal of the N-terminal (pro) peptides and generation of the large and small catalytic subunits: Mch2 at aspartates 23 and 193; Yama at aspartates 28 and 175 (minor cleavage at aspartate 179); LAP3 at aspartates 23 and 206 (minor cleavage at aspartate 198). Cytosolic extracts were prepared from nonapoptotic Jurkat cells as described (21Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H. Reed J.C. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Google Scholar) and from apoptotic Jurkat cells treated for 2 h at 37°C with 100 ng/ml αFas/Apo1 as described (22Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from HeLa cells as described (23Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Google Scholar). The in vitro apoptotic reactions were performed by the addition of 106 HeLa nuclei to naive or apoptotic extract (∼8 mg/ml), in the presence or absence of recombinant protease. DNA fragmentation analysis was performed as described (21Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H. Reed J.C. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Google Scholar). Recombinant CED-3-like proteases added directly to indicator HeLa nuclei did not induce DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 6, and 8). In the presence of naive extract, however, the active proteases Mch2 (Fig. 1, lane 3), Yama (Fig. 1, lane 5), or LAP3 (Fig. 1, lane 7) induced DNA fragmentation. As nonspecific proteolysis occurs in the presence of excess protease, a careful titration of each preparation of purified recombinant protease was performed to determine the minimal amount capable of triggering the DNA fragmentation. Surprisingly, the morphology of the indicator HeLa nuclei varied depending on the protease used to trigger DNA fragmentation. As expected, HeLa nuclei incubated with naive extract (Fig. 2, A and F) displayed normal morphology, whereas HeLa nuclei incubated with apoptotic extracts (Fig. 2, B and G) exhibited a classic apoptotic morphology where condensed chromatin formed apoptotic bodies. Similarly, a combination of Mch2 (Fig. 2, C and H) and naive extract induced the appearance of apoptotic nuclear morphology. In contrast, a distinct intermediate morphology of margination was observed when naive extract and HeLa nuclei were incubated with either Yama (Fig. 2, D and I) or LAP3 (Fig. 2, E and J). The chromatin was condensed at the nuclear rim, producing a halo effect, but there was little evidence of apoptotic body formation. These results indicated for the first time that the activity of each CED-3-like protease was potentially unique. In addition, the production of overt apoptotic morphology by Mch2 indicates that this protease either has the ability to cleave most of the substrates required to produce the morphology, or that it acts in concert with other downstream proteases to bring this about. To further investigate distinct properties of the CED-3-like proteases, we analyzed the state of the indicator apoptotic substrates PARP (14Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985Google Scholar), U1-70 kDa (20Tewari M. Beidler D.R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18738-18741Google Scholar, 25Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Google Scholar), and lamin A (26Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of naive extract. As expected, these substrates remained intact upon incubation with naive extract (Fig. 3, A-C, lane 1), but apoptotic extracts induced cleavage to the indicated signature apoptotic fragments (Fig. 3, A-C, lane 2). Cleavage of both PARP and U1-70 kDa, but not lamin A, was induced upon addition of Yama (Fig. 3, A-C, lanes 3 and 4) or LAP3 (Fig. 3, A-C, lanes 5 and 6), regardless of the presence or absence of naive extract. Importantly, Mch2 alone, in the absence of any extract, induced cleavage of lamin A (Fig. 3C, lane 7) and partial cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3A, lane 7), but did not cleave U1-70 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 7). In contrast, Mch2 endowed upon the naive extract the ability to cleave all three substrates to their respective diagnostic apoptotic fragments (Fig. 3, A-C, lane 8). This result is consistent with the notion that Mch2-mediated cleavage of U1-70 kDa and PARP is indirectly being propagated by the activation of downstream proteases present in the naive extract (possibly Yama or LAP3). In such an experimental paradigm, it appeared reasonable to assume that if the added exogenous protease did not process a particular endogenous ICE-zymogen then this zymogen was unlikely to be a physiological substrate for the added protease. Conversely, if the added protease processed the ICE-zymogen into an active dimeric species, then this zymogen could potentially be a physiologic substrate for the added protease. As expected, all three endogenous CED-3-like proteases were present as single chains in naive cytosolic extract, indicative of zymogen status, (Fig. 4, A-C, lane 1) but became processed in Fas/Apo1-stimulated apoptotic extracts (Fig. 4, A-C, lane 2). Addition of Mch2 to naive extract resulted in cleavage of both endogenous Yama (Fig. 4B, lane 3) and LAP3 (Fig. 4C, lane 3) consistent with their activation. When Yama was added, a small fraction of endogenous LAP3 was processed (Fig. 4C, lane 4), but Mch2 remained in its zymogen form (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Significantly, however, when LAP3 was added, both endogenous Mch2 (Fig. 2A, lane 5) and Yama (Fig. 2B, lane 5) remained in the zymogen form, despite the induction of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1, lane 7). Therefore, the zymogen substrate specificity of the CED-3-like proteases is consistent with Mch2 acting upstream of both Yama and LAP3. These results support the finding that Mch2 directly activates Yama in cell extracts (27Liu X. Kim C.N. Pohl J. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13371-13376Google Scholar). Since recombinant LAP3 cannot cleave pro-Yama but Yama can cleave pro-LAP3, we do not rule out the possibility that Yama can act as an intermediate between Mch2 and pro-LAP3. Future studies will delineate the upstream activators of both Mch2 and LAP3. Our results are consistent with a sequential pathway that allows Mch2 to initiate the activation of pro-Yama and pro-LAP3, thereby amplifying the range of death substrates cleaved during apoptosis (Fig. 5). These studies provide an experimental and conceptual framework that should allow the positioning of other ICE members in the enzymatic death cascade.

INTRODUCTIONSte20, a component of the pheromone-response pathway in budding yeast, represents the first identified member of a new family of serine/threonine protein kinases (1Leberer E. Dignard D.

Those that do not have recognizable GTPase binding sites but are quite conserved throughout the catalytic domain to Ste20 and Paks include Sps1, and three human kinases, GC kinase, Mst1, and Mst2 (9Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Google Scholar, 10Katz P. Whalen G. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16802-16809Google Scholar, 11Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

Sps1 is involved in the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates spore formation (9Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Google Scholar), and recent work has demonstrated that GC kinase activates a stress-activated protein kinase pathway (13Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). The pathway in which Mst1 functions is not known; however, it does not appear to activate either the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and −2 or the stress-activated protein kinases Jnk and p38 (11Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar). 2C. L. Creasy and J. Chernoff, unpublished observations.Here we report a structure/function analysis of Mst1. We find that there are two distinct functional domains within the COOH-terminal half of Mst1. The extreme COOH-terminal 57 amino acids encode a dimerization domain, while a 63-amino acid region, spanning amino acids 331-394, contains an inhibitory domain. The implications of these findings are discussed.DISCUSSIONTwo distinct functional domains have been localized within the COOH-terminal half of Mst1, one that affects kinase activity and one that mediates dimerization. A series of COOH-terminal and internal deletions indicates that amino acids 331-394 function to inhibit Mst1 catalytic activity. There are at least four mechanisms by which this region may inhibit kinase activity. First, an inhibitory molecule may bind this region, as has been suggested for the related GC kinase (13Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). However, our present and previous data argue against this scenario, as a COOH-terminal truncation of Mst1 is much more active than the full-length molecule, whether kinase activity is measured using immunoprecipitates (this study) or an in-gel assay (11Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar). Associated proteins are lost in this latter assay since the kinase is denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, then renatured. Second, this region may contain regulatory phosphorylation sites. Several serine and threonine residues lie within this region. Threonine is a potential phosphorylated residue within two consensus protein kinase C sites, one within amino acids 331-360 and another between 360 and 394. However, we do not believe these sites are utilized since phorbol ester treatment does not affect Mst1 activity, and in vivo 32P-labeling indicates that Mst1 is phosphorylated only on serine residues (data not shown). In addition, serine phosphorylation is not lost when amino acids 331-394 are absent (data not shown). Third, the inhibitory domain may contain pseudosubstrate sites. We do not believe this region contains inhibitory autophosphorylation sites since amino acids 276-487 are unable to serve as a substrate for Mst1 in an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). Nevertheless, it does not rule out the possibility that there are pseudosubstrate sites within this region. Fourth, loss of the inhibitory domain may simply result in a conformational change such that the active site is more accessible.Using a combination of techniques we have also established that Mst1 dimerizes and have localized the dimerization domain to the extreme COOH-terminal 57 amino acids. This region is predicted to be highly α-helical and a point mutation that disrupts the putative helix abolishes dimerization in vivo. While gel filtration chromatography indicates that Mst1 exists in a large molecular weight complex greater than that of a Mst1:Mst1 dimer, in vitro cross-linking demonstrates that Mst1 does not form high order multimers; therefore, Mst1 may be in association with additional proteins. Deletion of the dimerization domain (Fig. 1) has little effect on Mst1 kinase activity and the L444P point mutation had no effect on kinase activity (data not shown) indicating that the inhibitory and dimerization domains are distinct. Mst2, a very close homolog to Mst1, contains nearly identical sequences in these regions, indicating that both the inhibitory and dimerization domains are likely to be conserved between the two proteins (12Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 303-306Google Scholar).Recently, it has been suggested that the structurally related GC kinase may oligomerize; however, this has not been demonstrated directly (13Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of the Mst1 dimerization and inhibitory domains to other kinases in this family indicates that these domains are not conserved at the amino acid level. The only family member with any potential similarity is Sps1, which is predicted to have a highly α-helical COOH terminus. The ability of Sps1 to dimerize has not been examined (9Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Google Scholar).While dimerization of receptor protein kinases is quite common, dimerization of cytosolic protein kinases is unusual and can be either inhibitory or activating. Kinases that dimerize include the serine/threonine protein kinases Akt, cGMP, and cAMP-dependent kinases, and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (22Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.-I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Google Scholar, 23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Lincoln T.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11855-11863Google Scholar). While removal of the dimerization domain had no effect on the activity of Mst1 unless the inhibitory domain was also removed, this domain may be important for the recognition by an effector molecule or may allow it to phosphorylate its natural substrates. Phosphorylation by cGMP kinase illustrates this latter possibility. While monomers of cGMP kinase are able to phosphorylate histone and peptides, only the dimer is able to phosphorylate vimentin, a protein suspected to be an in vivo substrate (23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Lincoln T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8035-8043Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of dimerization with respect to Mst1 activity may become clear following the identification of natural substrates.Although effectors of Mst1 have not been identified, mapping of a region important in the inhibition of Mst1 kinase activity suggests that this kinase, and by homology Mst2 as well, are highly regulated. Work is currently underway to determine the biological effects of Mst1 kinase activity.

Chernoff, unpublished observations. p21-activated kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene fluoride phosphate-buffered saline. Here we report a structure/function analysis of Mst1. We find that there are two distinct functional domains within the COOH-terminal half of Mst1. The extreme COOH-terminal 57 amino acids encode a dimerization domain, while a 63-amino acid region, spanning amino acids 331-394, contains an inhibitory domain. The implications of these findings are discussed. DISCUSSIONTwo distinct functional domains have been localized within the COOH-terminal half of Mst1, one that affects kinase activity and one that mediates dimerization. A series of COOH-terminal and internal deletions indicates that amino acids 331-394 function to inhibit Mst1 catalytic activity. There are at least four mechanisms by which this region may inhibit kinase activity. First, an inhibitory molecule may bind this region, as has been suggested for the related GC kinase (13Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). However, our present and previous data argue against this scenario, as a COOH-terminal truncation of Mst1 is much more active than the full-length molecule, whether kinase activity is measured using immunoprecipitates (this study) or an in-gel assay (11Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar). Associated proteins are lost in this latter assay since the kinase is denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, then renatured. Second, this region may contain regulatory phosphorylation sites. Several serine and threonine residues lie within this region. Threonine is a potential phosphorylated residue within two consensus protein kinase C sites, one within amino acids 331-360 and another between 360 and 394. However, we do not believe these sites are utilized since phorbol ester treatment does not affect Mst1 activity, and in vivo 32P-labeling indicates that Mst1 is phosphorylated only on serine residues (data not shown). In addition, serine phosphorylation is not lost when amino acids 331-394 are absent (data not shown). Third, the inhibitory domain may contain pseudosubstrate sites. We do not believe this region contains inhibitory autophosphorylation sites since amino acids 276-487 are unable to serve as a substrate for Mst1 in an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). Nevertheless, it does not rule out the possibility that there are pseudosubstrate sites within this region. Fourth, loss of the inhibitory domain may simply result in a conformational change such that the active site is more accessible.Using a combination of techniques we have also established that Mst1 dimerizes and have localized the dimerization domain to the extreme COOH-terminal 57 amino acids. This region is predicted to be highly α-helical and a point mutation that disrupts the putative helix abolishes dimerization in vivo. While gel filtration chromatography indicates that Mst1 exists in a large molecular weight complex greater than that of a Mst1:Mst1 dimer, in vitro cross-linking demonstrates that Mst1 does not form high order multimers; therefore, Mst1 may be in association with additional proteins. Deletion of the dimerization domain (Fig. 1) has little effect on Mst1 kinase activity and the L444P point mutation had no effect on kinase activity (data not shown) indicating that the inhibitory and dimerization domains are distinct. Mst2, a very close homolog to Mst1, contains nearly identical sequences in these regions, indicating that both the inhibitory and dimerization domains are likely to be conserved between the two proteins (12Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 303-306Google Scholar).Recently, it has been suggested that the structurally related GC kinase may oligomerize; however, this has not been demonstrated directly (13Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of the Mst1 dimerization and inhibitory domains to other kinases in this family indicates that these domains are not conserved at the amino acid level. The only family member with any potential similarity is Sps1, which is predicted to have a highly α-helical COOH terminus. The ability of Sps1 to dimerize has not been examined (9Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Google Scholar).While dimerization of receptor protein kinases is quite common, dimerization of cytosolic protein kinases is unusual and can be either inhibitory or activating. Kinases that dimerize include the serine/threonine protein kinases Akt, cGMP, and cAMP-dependent kinases, and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (22Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11855-11863Google Scholar). While removal of the dimerization domain had no effect on the activity of Mst1 unless the inhibitory domain was also removed, this domain may be important for the recognition by an effector molecule or may allow it to phosphorylate its natural substrates. Phosphorylation by cGMP kinase illustrates this latter possibility. While monomers of cGMP kinase are able to phosphorylate histone and peptides, only the dimer is able to phosphorylate vimentin, a protein suspected to be an in vivo substrate (23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Lincoln T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8035-8043Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of dimerization with respect to Mst1 activity may become clear following the identification of natural substrates.Although effectors of Mst1 have not been identified, mapping of a region important in the inhibition of Mst1 kinase activity suggests that this kinase, and by homology Mst2 as well, are highly regulated. Work is currently underway to determine the biological effects of Mst1 kinase activity.

The evolution of V-ATPases appears to be related to that of F-ATPases, the F1Fo-ATP synthases of mitochondrial, chloroplast, and eubacterial phosphorylating membranes (2Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Like their sister F-ATPases, they are multisubunit heteromeric proteins composed of two structural domains, a membrane-spanning complex and a peripheral catalytic complex. The latter forms ball and stalk structures, portasomes, that in electron micrographs look remarkably similar to the corresponding structures of F-ATPases (3Harvey W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). As an analogy to F-ATPases, the peripheral domain of V-ATPases has been designated the V1 complex and the membrane-spanning domain has been designated the Vo complex (4Nelson N. Curr. Opin.

At least three V1 subunits are common to all V-ATPases, subunits A and B that are homologous to the F1 subunits β and α, respectively, and subunit E. Like the corresponding F1 subunits, subunits A and B occur in three copies/complex, whereas subunit E occurs in only one copy (5Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol.

V1 complexes from other V-ATPase preparations have been obtained by treatment of the membrane-bound V-ATPase with chaotropic salts followed by reassociation of the dissociated V1 subunits by dialysis (9Lepier A.

In contrast to F1 complexes that are always associated with membranes, V1 complexes also occur in a soluble form in the cytosol as was shown for yeast and for a bovine kidney epithelial cell line (20Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These cytosolic V1 complexes were detected by immunoprecipitation, but they were not quantified or purified in greater amounts. We expected to detect considerable quantities of cytosolic V1 complexes in the midgut of molting tobacco hornworms since Sumner et al. (22Sumner J.P. Dow J.A.T. Earley F.G.P. Klein U. Jäger D.

The tobacco hornworm V-ATPase may serve as a valuable model for V-ATPases in general since it is well characterized (23Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 335-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and all five of its known V1 subunits have been cloned and sequenced (8Gräf R. Lepier A. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

In this paper, we show that the midgut cytosolic extract from molting tobacco hornworms is a rich source for the purification of enzymatically active V1 complexes. We present evidence that the size of the cytosolic V1 pool depends on the feeding condition of the M. sexta larvae. Larvae of M. sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) were reared under long day conditions (16 h of light) at 27°C on a synthetic diet modified according to Bell and Joachim (27Bell R.A. Joachim F.G. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1974; 69: 365-373Crossref Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out on larvae that were molting from the fourth to fifth instar (molting larvae) and on fifth instar larvae after the molt (intermolt larvae). Molting larvae were in stages E or F (approximately 20 h after the entry into the molt (22Sumner J.P. Dow J.A.T. Earley F.G.P. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)) and weighed about 1.5 g, whereas intermolt larvae weighed about 5 g. Whole midguts were dissected from larvae that had been kept on ice for about 15 min. Approximately 1 g of midgut tissue (wet weight) was homogenized in 5 ml of an ice-cold buffer consisting of 300 mM mannitol, 5 mM Na-EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 17 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) using an Ultraturrax homogenizer (IKA, Germany) at 20,500 rpm for 60 s. After centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 4 min at 4°C, the supernatant was supplemented with Pefabloc SC (BIOMOL) to a final concentration of 5 mM and was centrifuged again at 186,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtrated through a 0.2-µm filter using a 5-ml syringe. The volume was adjusted to 5 ml, and an equal volume of ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate was slowly added while stirring on ice. The precipitation of cytosolic proteins was allowed for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of a buffer consisting of 16 mM Tris-HCl, 0.32 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl (pH 8.1). Aliquots of 0.5 ml each were layered onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (2 ml of 40%, 1 ml of 30%, 1 ml of 20%, and 0.8 ml of 10% sucrose (w/v) dissolved in the same buffer that now contained 9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged in a vertical rotor at 220,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The 20% sucrose fraction containing the V1 complex was chromatographed on a Mono Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using an elution buffer composed of 0.05-0.4 M NaCl (linear gradient) and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) was performed for 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The V1 complex, represented by two peaks, was collected in two fractions (about 0.26 and 0.3 M NaCl). Both fractions were concentrated to final volumes of approximately 120 µl using Centricon 100 microconcentrators, and 100 µl of each were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel chromatography column (Pharmacia) for further purification. FPLC was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, using a running buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). The V1 complex was found in the fraction containing proteins of approximately 450 kDa (using ferritin as standard). Assays were performed at 30°C and had a final volume of 80 µl. Cytosolic V1-ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 50 mM Tris-MOPS (pH 8.1), 20 mM KCl, 4-10 mM NaCl, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, and 3 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM MgCl2 and 25% methanol instead of CaCl2. The protein content was 3-5 µg in assays of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and 0.5-1 µg in assays of Mg2+/methanol-dependent ATPase activity. For assays of the membrane-bound holoenzyme activity, partially purified goblet cell apical membranes were used (28Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures had a protein content of 10 µg and consisted of 50 mM Tris-MOPS (pH 8.1), 20 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM vanadate, 0.5 mM azide, and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. All further conditions, including the determination of inorganic phosphate, were as described previously (29Wieczorek H. Cioffi M. Klein U. Harvey W.R. Schweikl H. Wolfersberger M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Isolation and purification of the V-ATPase from M. sexta midgut goblet cell apical membranes, protein determination with Amido Black, standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting on nitrocellulose membranes (BA85), and immunostaining were performed as described previously (8Gräf R. Lepier A. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3767-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that V1 subunits were removed from the membrane during molt. Although it was not clear whether the V1 complex remained complete or whether the V1 subunits disintegrated, there was some evidence for the first alternative since cytosolic V1 pools had already been described in yeast and in a kidney cell line (20Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose the midgut cytosol of molting M. sexta larvae as a putative source for the purification of the V1 complex and established an isolation protocol. The result of each purification step was monitored by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and the fractions containing the main part of the V1 subunits were used for the next purification step. In brief, proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was dissolved and size-fractionated by density gradient centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient. The 20% sucrose fraction was collected, and proteins were separated by FPLC on a Mono Q ion exchange column applying a linear NaCl gradient from 0.05 to 0.4 M. V1 subunits were found in two fractions containing distinct peaks at approximately 0.26 and 0.3 M NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1). The proteins in both fractions were subjected separately to further size fractionation by gel chromatography. In both cases, protein exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of ∼450 kDa could be detected in a sharp peak (Fig. 1, inset). The amount of protein in the peak obtained from ion exchange fraction 2 (peak 2) was 1.5-5 times higher than that from fraction 1 (peak 1). After SDS-gel electrophoresis of both peaks, comparison of their protein band patterns with that of the purified M. sexta V-ATPase holoenzyme (28Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as staining of Western blots with an antiserum to the V-ATPase holoenzyme, revealed that both peaks contained the V1 complex (Fig. 2). There were almost no proteins except the V1 subunits, and no major difference could be detected between the peaks. In both cases, the V1 complex was composed of the established subunits A, B, and E along with the 14-kDa subunit F (8Gräf R. Lepier A. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3767-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the novel 13-kDa subunit G (9Lepier A. Gräf R. Azuma M. Merzendorfer H. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8502-8508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The amount of V1 complex obtained from the cytosol was unexpectedly high. The final amounts of purified V1 complex from both fractions made up 1.64 ± 0.23% of the total cytosolic protein (mean ± S.D., five independent preparations). Thus, approximately 0.4 mg of V1 complex could be purified from 1 g of midgut tissue within about 7 h (Fig. 5). This is the first time that a native V1 complex has been purified from the cytosol in such high quantity.Fig. 2Cytosolic V1 complex purified from molting M. sexta larvae. SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel stained with Coomassie Blue (lanes 1-4) and a Western blot stained with an antiserum to the V-ATPase holoenzyme (lane 5 (30Wieczorek H. Putzenlechner M.

Since the V1 complexes from both peaks had the same subunit composition, we concluded that peak 1 contained a partially inactivated form of the V1 complex. Therefore, the following experiments were performed with the V1 complex from peak 2. Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity decreased with increasing incubation time; and after 5 min, the activity had dropped to approximately 35% of the 1-min value, indicating increasing product inhibition (not shown). The use of the ATP regenerating system employing pyruvate kinase was impossible since pyruvate kinase itself is dependent on Mg2+ and since even 0.1 mM Mg2+ inhibited the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of the V1 complex almost completely. Therefore, we worked in most cases at two different incubation times (2 and 5 min) and verified identical enzyme properties at both times. 0.1 mM vanadate, 0.5 M azide, or 1 µM folimycin did not affect the ATPase activity (not shown), but N-ethylmaleimide did inhibit it with an IC50 of approximately 0.1 µM (Fig. 3). ATP was the preferred substrate of the V1 enzyme, followed by GTP (Table I). Unlike ATPase activity, GTPase activity was not inhibited with increasing incubation times. UTP and CTP were not effective substrates (Table I), and ADP or p-nitrophenyl phosphate was not hydrolyzed (not shown). Neither ATPase nor GTPase activity of the V1 complex was detected when Ca2+ was replaced by Mg2+. Both 30 and 0.3 mM Ca2+ led to a significant decrease in ATPase activity, and at 30 µM Ca2+, almost no activity could be measured. Thus it is very unlikely that the V1 complex is a functional Ca2+-dependent ATPase in vivo. On the other hand, its Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity proves that the purified V1 complex is a functional enzyme. Therefore, we suggest the term V1-ATPase for the native V1 complex.TABLE ISubstrate specificity of peak 2 V1-ATPase from molting larvaeNTP hydrolysisCa2+-dependent without methanolMg2+-dependent with methanolµmol Pi·mg−1·2 min−1ATP1.462.68GTP0.961.24CTP0.020.14UTP0.020.18 Open table in a new tab Mg2+-dependent Enzyme Activity of the Cytosolic V1-ATPase in the Presence of Methanol Organic solvents, especially methanol, are known to be effective enhancers of Mg2+-dependent enzyme activity of F1-ATPases from bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria (31Hicks D.B.

Gomez Puyou A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 679: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent enzyme activity of the M. sexta cytosolic V1-ATPase is strongly reminiscent of the characteristics of the purified F1-ATPase from Bacillus firmus (31Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12896-12902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of the CF1-ATPase from spinach chloroplasts (35McCarty R.E. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 129-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the effect of methanol on the activity of the M. sexta V1-ATPase was investigated. The presence of 25% methanol in the incubation mixture caused a dramatic change in the enzymatic properties of the V1-ATPase. It exhibited a high Mg2+-dependent specific ATPase activity of 1.8 ± 0.5 units/mg of protein (mean ± S.D., five independent preparations), whereas the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was reduced approximately 10-fold. In contrast to the assays performed in the absence of methanol, the enzyme activity did not change with incubation time, suggesting that product inhibition was no longer occurring. ATP was the preferred substrate, GTP was still a reasonably good substrate, UTP and CTP were not effective substrates (Table I), and p-nitrophenyl phosphate was not hydrolyzed (not shown). Like the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, Mg2+-dependent activity was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide with an IC50 of approximately 0.1 µM. This is the first time that Mg2+-dependent enzyme activity of a native V1-ATPase has been demonstrated. Since the cytosol of midguts from molting larvae contains a large pool of V1-ATPase, it was tempting to speculate that this pool consisted mainly of V1 complexes that had dissociated from the plasma membrane during molt. Consequently, the midgut cytosol of intermolt larvae should contain a significantly lower amount of V1-ATPase. Therefore, the cytosolic V1-ATPase from feeding larvae was purified by the same method as that used for midguts from molting larvae. The V1-ATPase again eluted in two peaks from the anion exchange column, but the yield with respect to the tissue wet weight or to the total protein content in the cytosolic extract was consistently about 70% lower than that obtained with midguts from molting larvae (0.56 ± 0.04%; mean ± S.D., three independent preparations). The specific ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ without methanol, or of Mg2+ with methanol, was in the same range as the V1-ATPase activity from molting larvae (not shown). SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed no difference between the V1 complexes obtained from the molting and intermolt larvae. These results were in line with the hypothesis that a large part of the V1-ATPase pool in the cytoplasm of molting larvae is formed by the dissociation of intact V1 complexes from the plasma membrane V-ATPase, leaving the Vo parts in the membrane. The physiological condition of starved intermolt larvae should be similar to that of molting larvae since both suffer from a lack of food. Therefore, we purified the cytosolic V1-ATPase from starving intermolt larvae and found that the amount of V1 complex obtained after 17-19 h of starvation was as high as that obtained from molting larvae (approximately 0.4 mg/g of tissue (Fig. 5) or 1.68 ± 0.24% (mean ± S.D., three independent preparations) of total cytosolic protein). As expected, ATPase activity tests and SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed no differences between the V1 complex preparations from the molting and feeding intermolt larvae (not shown). In line with the high amount of cytosolic V1-ATPase, Coomassie Blue stainings of SDS gels from partially purified goblet cell apical membranes showed that the amount of V1 subunits was reduced (Fig. 4). Consequently, the membrane-bound V-ATPase activity was reduced drastically by about 70% (Fig. 5). When larvae were allowed to feed for 2 h after starvation, the amount of cytosolic V1-ATPase again approached the low level found in feeding intermolt larvae (0.67 ± 0.20% total cytosolic protein; mean ± S.D., three independent preparations), and membrane-bound V-ATPase activity recovered concomitantly (Fig. 5). Dissociation of the V1 complex from the membrane Vo part appears to be a method for down-regulation of V-ATPase activity not only during the molt but also during starvation and, most likely, under other physiological conditions. We describe, for the first time, the purification of the native catalytic V1 complex of a V-ATPase from the cytosol. This V1-ATPase could be isolated in considerable amounts and purity. The high yield (∼0.4 mg/g of tissue) is on the same order of magnitude as that of the preparation of chloroplast F1-ATPase from spinach leaves (36McCarty R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 431-441PubMed Google Scholar). Since the V1-ATPase occurred in vivo in the cytosol, it could be isolated without disintegration of the V-ATPase holoenzyme. As shown before for the reconstituted Vc complex of the V-ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles, the native insect V1 complex exhibited Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. For the first time, Mg2+-dependent enzyme activity of a native V1-ATPase has now been demonstrated under conditions similar to those used for studies of enzyme activity in F1-ATPases.

In the process of carrying out this study we have found that the number of sequences with the ability to form tetraplexes is larger than previously thought, and that such sequences are ubiquitous in eukaryote genomes. A number of recent studies have shown that certain guanine-rich DNA sequences form interstrand and intrastrand DNA tetraplexes. Interstrand tetraplexes are formed between G-rich tracts located on 2 or 4 different DNA strands. Intrastrand tetraplexes are formed by a single strand of DNA that contains at least 4 G tracts (Fig. 1). Gs from each of the G tracts interact to form a planar array of 4 guanines (a tetrad) held together by Hoogsteen bonds (1Zimmerman S.B. Cohen G.H. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 92: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that (G + C)-rich tracts can also form tetrads of the form G·C·G·C (2Leonard G.A. Zhang S.

In the case of intrastrand tetraplexes, this stem is bounded by three loops formed by the bases between the G tracts. Interstrand tetraplexes have been implicated in the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis (4Sen D. Gilbert W.

Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the sequence constraints governing the formation and stability of intrastrand tetraplexes. We have recently shown that a G-rich sequence from the chicken β-globin promoter provides a K+-dependent block to DNA synthesis, whose properties are consistent with the formation of an intrastrand tetrahelical structure (15Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the K+-dependent structure showed it to be an unusual “cinched” tetraplex containing a number of non-guanine bases in the tetraplex stem (2 Ts and a C) and stabilized by interactions between one of the tetraplex loops and bases in the flanking sequence (16Howell R.M. Woodford K.J. Weitzmann M.N. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). (CGG)n tracts also form K+-dependent blocks to DNA synthesis consistent with tetraplex formation (17Usdin K. Woodford K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This tetraplex may contain a mixture of G tetrads and G·C·G·C tetrads (2Leonard G.A. Zhang S. Peterson M.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23090-23096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using a series of known tetraplex-forming model sequences, we show that the ability to block DNA synthesis in a K+-dependent manner is not a peculiar property of these unusual tetraplexes, but rather is diagnostic of intrastrand tetraplexes in general. This property provides a rapid and simple assay for these structures and for studying the parameters that affect tetraplex formation. This assay can be carried out under physiological conditions and can detect tetraplexes at concentrations that are orders of magnitude less than those required by classical analytical techniques such as CD-spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and NMR, even when tetraplexes constitute only a small fraction of DNA molecules in the population. We have used this assay to identify a number of tetraplex-forming sequences in eukaryote genomes. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an ABI 381A oligonucleotide synthesizer and cloned into either the plasmid pMS189Δ or M13mp18 as described previously (15Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Usdin K. Woodford K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Plasmids were replicated in Escherichia coli MBM7070, isolated by alkaline lysis, and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation according to standard procedures. Single-stranded phage DNA was purified as described elsewhere (17Usdin K. Woodford K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The plasmid (C)1 was a gift of R. Howell. DNA was methylated with the SssI methylase (New England Biolabs), using the buffers and reaction conditions recommended by the supplier. After phenol extraction, the methylated DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM Na2EDTA (TE) at a final concentration of approximately 1 µg/µl. Methylation was confirmed by testing for protection from HpaII digestion. Arrest of DNA synthesis was monitored in a modified linear amplification sequencing reaction. Primers for these reactions were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, 3000-6000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicentre Technologies, Inc. and a K+-free kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2). Reaction conditions for this assay are based on that recommended by Epicentre Technologies for use in their SequiTherm™ sequencing kits. Each reaction contained 2 nM of template, 0.16 nM of primer, 10 µM each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and 7-deaza-dGTP, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.3), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and one of the following dideoxynucleotides at the concentration indicated in parenthesis: ddATP (0.3 mM), ddGTP (0.017 mM), ddCTP (0.2 mM), ddTTP (0.6 mM), in a total volume of 6 µl. Cations were added to this mix at the indicated concentrations. Reactions were subjected to 30 cycles of heating and cooling (30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C). One half volume (3 µl) of stop buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 10 mM EDTA (pH 9.5), 10 mM NaOH, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was then added and reactions heated at 90°C for 5 min prior to loading on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The effect of acidic pH on tetraplex formation was tested by comparing the extent of polymerase arrest in buffers containing 50 mM MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidDMSdimethyl sulfate. and 10 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.5 and 6.5. 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid dimethyl sulfate. DMS protection assays were performed on gel purified oligonucleotides using the method of Williamson et. al. (5Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. End-labeled oligonucleotide (1 ng/reaction) was resuspended in 18 µl of TE buffer and heated for 1 min at 90°C. Potassium chloride (1 µl) was added to appropriate tubes to a final concentration of 50 mM. Reactions were then heated for 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C, cooled to room temperature or 55°C, and reacted for 1 min with 1 µl of DMS (diluted 1:10 in water). Reactions were terminated by addition of 20 µl of 2 M pyrrolidine (diluted in cold water) and cleavage effected at 90°C for 15 min. Carrier DNA (E. coli genomic DNA; 2 µg) was added, and samples were precipitated with 1.2 ml of butan-1-ol. The samples were dried under vacuum, redissolved in 10 µl of 42.5% (v/v) formamide, 5 mM EDTA (pH 9.5), 5 mM NaOH, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, denatured for 5 min at 90°C, and run on a 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. When the known tetraplex-forming sequence (T2G4)4 (5Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) is used as a template in in vitro DNA synthesis reactions, a set of premature polynucleotide chain termination products is observed at the beginning of the tetraplex-forming sequence (Fig. 2A). The major chain termination product comigrates with the base immediately preceding the 3′ most G in the (T2G4)4 tract (indicated by an arrow, Fig. 2A). The premature chain termination products or arrests are seen only when KCl is included in the reaction. No arrest is observed in the absence of monovalent cation (Fig. 2A), or when LiCl, NaCl, RbCl, CsCl, or NH4Cl are substituted for KCl (data not shown). Potassium glutamate also produces the same premature chain termination products, confirming that it is the cation rather than anion that is responsible for the formation of the block to DNA synthesis (data not shown). K+-dependent arrest of DNA synthesis occurs with all DNA polymerases tested including Taq polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, Sequenase™ (a modified T7 DNA polymerase), avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and SequiTherm™ polymerase (data not shown), indicating that arrest of DNA synthesis is not polymerase-specific. Since DNA synthesis in the region preceding the tetraplex-forming sequence is similar in the presence or absence of K+, it is apparent that the arrest of DNA synthesis is not due to an adverse effect of K+ on the polymerase. The effect of K+ is not ameliorated by the use of polymerase accessory proteins such as E. coli single-stranded binding protein or gene 32 protein, or the inclusion of glycerol, formamide, or dimethyl sulfoxide (data not shown), reagents which have been shown to reduce premature chain termination (19Kaspar P. Zadrazil S. Fabry M. Nucl. Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The K+-dependent block to DNA synthesis is strand-specific since no block to DNA synthesis is observed when the pyrimidine-rich strand is used as a template (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, these blocks to DNA synthesis are seen even when single-stranded phage DNA containing these sequences is used as the template (data not shown). This rules out incomplete melting of the duplex or the formation of an interstrand structure involving the complementary strand, e.g. a triplex. Interstrand triplexes have been previously shown to block DNA synthesis, but blockage is independent of K+, requires the presence of both DNA strands, and is seen only when the pyrimidine-rich strand is used as a template (20Samadashwily G.M. Dayn A. Mirkin S.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4975-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The same blocks to DNA synthesis are seen when the (T2G4)4 sequence is cloned in different orientations or in different vectors, indicating that the (T2G4)4 sequence itself is sufficient to block DNA synthesis (data not shown). Formation of these blocks to DNA synthesis is rapid since they are seen even when templates are incubated for less than 10 min in the presence of K+, and the amount of DNA synthesis arrest does not increase with longer incubations before polymerase addition (data not shown). These blocks are also very stable since they are still observed when templates are incubated at 85°C before addition of the polymerase. These data suggest that the extent of premature chain termination observed reflects the amount of underlying structure formed under any given set of circumstances, rather than their stability or rate of formation. The sequence G13C13, which is 2 bases longer than (T2G4)4 and is able to form a fully Watson-Crick base paired hairpin, produces very little DNA synthesis arrest and the small amount of arrest seen is K+-independent (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that a hairpin is not responsible for the K+-dependent arrest of DNA synthesis seen on the (T2G4)4 templates. Both the number of different premature chain termination products at the beginning of the (T2Gn)4 sequence (S1 in Fig. 3A), and the amount of each product increases as the number of Gs in each repeat tract increases (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with both an increase in the number of potential structures and an increase in the proportion of molecules that form such structures as the number of Gs increases. Some K+-dependent polymerase blockage is seen at the beginning of the second G tract when the number of Gs in each tract is 5 or more (S2 in Fig. 3A). These blocks are orientation-dependent (data not shown), suggesting that they represent interactions between the G tracts and 5′-flanking bases. A small amount of K+-independent DNA synthesis arrest is also seen at the beginning of the first guanine tract (S1) when the number of Gs in each tract is 6 or more (Fig. 3B). This might be due either to the presence of a structure such as a hairpin which is unaffected by [K+], or a small amount of tetraplex formed in the absence of K+. Some monovalent cation-independent DNA synthesis arrest is seen in the middle of the (T2Gn)4 sequence where n ≥ 6 (S3 in Fig. 3, A and B) and is characteristic of triplexes formed between the template and the nascent strand (21Baran N. Lapidot A. Manor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). K+-dependent arrest of DNA synthesis is seen over the template concentration range 0.02-40 mM, with a greater proportion of plasmid template molecules blocking DNA synthesis as the template concentration decreases (data not shown). This suggests that arrest of DNA synthesis involves the formation of intrastrand rather than interstrand structures, and that their formation is favored when reannealing of the template strand with its complement is reduced. These data are consistent with the underlying physical basis of the K+-dependent arrest of DNA synthesis on (T2Gn)4 templates being intrastrand tetraplex formation. To check that these are simple tetraplexes rather than “cinched tetraplexes” (16Howell R.M. Woodford K.J. Weitzmann M.N. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or some other unusual tetraplex, we probed an oligonucleotide containing the sequence (T2G7)4 with DMS. The N-7 position of guanines in tetraplexes is involved in hydrogen bonding and is thus protected from modification by DMS, a reagent which reacts specifically with guanines at the N-7 position. As Fig. 4A shows, the sequence (T2G7)4 has distinctly different patterns of DMS reactivity in the presence or absence of K+. In the absence of K+ strong uniform DMS modification is seen throughout the sequence; however, in its presence the extent of DMS modification is considerably reduced. The bases at the ends of the G tracts are modified about 50% less than they are in the absence of K+ as judged by densitometric analysis, while bases in the middle of the G tracts are modified only 10-25% as much. The pattern and extent of DMS reactivity is most consistent with the formation of a number of simple tetraplexes in which the inner bases in each G tract are more often involved in tetrads than the outer Gs which are more likely to reside at least part of the time within the loops. The simplest interpretation of the data is that the most stable tetraplexes formed are two conformers, both of which have at least 3 bases in each loop. Two possible structures are shown in Fig. 4, B and C. These experiments demonstrate that K+-dependent arrest of DNA synthesis is not a unique feature of the previously described “cinched” tetraplex (16Howell R.M. Woodford K.J. Weitzmann M.N. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but rather is a property of tetraplexes in general. We have used this property to examine the effects of the length and composition of the stem and spacer regions, as well as the effect of pH and methylation status on tetraplex formation. The shortest sequence capable of producing a block to DNA synthesis in this assay was (T2G3)4 (Fig. 3A). In experiments not shown here, neither single-stranded templates containing (T2G2)4 or the thrombin-binding aptamer, G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2 (22Macaya R.F. Schultze P. Smith F.W. Roe J.A. Feigon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3745-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) blocked DNA synthesis even after prolonged incubation in the presence of K+. The thrombin-binding aptamer has recently been shown by NMR to form an intrastrand tetraplex in which loops 1 and 3 each contain 2 bases, while loop 2 has 3 bases (22Macaya R.F. Schultze P. Smith F.W. Roe J.A. Feigon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3745-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). However, the NMR observations of tetraplex formation were made at low temperature (20°C or below) or in the presence of more than 100 mM KCl. Our DMS modification data indicate that, for (T2G7)4, the most stable structures formed have at least 3 bases in each loop. The negative results with (T2G2)4 and the thrombin-binding aptamer suggest that at least 2 tetrads and 3 loop bases are essential for stable tetraplex formation under these conditions. This would be consistent with the observations of Balagurumoorthy and Brahmachari (23Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21858-21869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the human telomeric sequence (T2AG3)4. Sequences of the form (TxGy)4, were used to examine the effect of loop size and base composition on the amount of tetraplex formed. In initial experiments, a template containing only a single T residue in each repeat, i.e. x = 1, and y = 5 was compared to templates where x = 2, and y = 4 or 5. In these experiments equally strong tetraplex formation was observed for all templates where y = 5 (Fig. 5). Assuming that 3 bases are required for each loop, (TG5)4 must have 2 Gs and a T in each loop, with 3 tetrads in the stem, while (T2G5)4 must have 2 Ts and a G, with 4 tetrads in the stem. The fact that (TG5)4 blocked DNA synthesis to a similar extent as (T2G5)4, in spite of having fewer potential tetrads, suggests that Gs in the loop stabilize tetraplexes perhaps by means of interloop interactions or stacking energy contributions. This is consistent with our previous observation that the sequence G26 forms a much stronger block to DNA synthesis than any of these templates, completely blocking chain extension (16Howell R.M. Woodford K.J. Weitzmann M.N. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the next set of experiments, the size and base composition of the central spacer region (spacer 2 in Fig. 1A) of the sequence (T2G4T2G4XnG4T2G4) was altered. Xn represents the altered bases which would fall into loop 2 of the tetraplex. There was a small but reproducible increase in the amount of tetraplex formed when loop 2 contained a G residue (Fig. 6A). This is consistent with our earlier observation that Gs in the loop stabilize tetraplexes. The base composition of loop 2 had little effect for spacer lengths of 3 where guanine was not one of the loop bases (Fig. 6A). For spacer regions consisting of TTTT, TTTA, CCCC, or AAAA, the pure C and A tracts were more destabilizing than pure T or T-rich tracts. The greater stability of T-rich loops may be the result of base stacking or interactions between loop bases. The potential for T:T base pairing in the loops has been proposed from NMR data (22Macaya R.F. Schultze P. Smith F.W. Roe J.A. Feigon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3745-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and model building studies (24Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. Mohanty D. Bansal M. Sasisekharan V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Tetraplex formation occurred even when spacer 2 consisted of 10 Ts (Fig. 6B). The optimal spacer length was found to be between 4 and 6 bases consistent with studies of DNA hairpins, where a loop size of 4-5 nucleotides has been found to be optimal (25Haasnoot C.A.G. Hilbers C.W. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Singh U.C. Pattabiraman N. Kollman P.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1986; 3: 843-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Templates with 6 Ts in loop 1 (T2T2T6 in Fig. 7) formed a similar amount of tetraplex as did templates with 6 Ts in loop 2 (T2T6T2 in Fig. 7). Increasing the number of bases to 6 in both spacer regions 1 and 3, or in all 3 spacers had little effect on the amount of polymerase arrest seen. Two pathways for tetraplex folding are currently favored (24Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. Mohanty D. Bansal M. Sasisekharan V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The first involves the formation of two hairpins (i.e. between G tracts 1 and 2, and between G tracts 3 and 4, Fig. 1A) that then interact to form the tetraplex. In this model the loops of the two hairpins become loops 1 and 3 of the tetraplex, while the bases between the two hairpins form loop 2 of the tetraplex. The second model involves the formation of a single large hairpin that becomes folded over to form a tetraplex. The loop of this hairpin forms loop 2 of the tetraplex. The fact that tetraplex formation is not affected by the addition of extra bases to loops 1 or 2 is most consistent with the first model, since these bases would be expected to adversely affect the stability of the folding intermediate in the second model. The cinched tetraplex formed in the chicken β-globin gene promoter (15Woodford K.J. Howell R.M. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Howell R.M. Woodford K.J. Weitzmann M.N. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is able to incorporate a number of non-G bases into the stem of the tetraplex. Much of the destabilizing effect expected of these bases we believe to be offset by stability provided by the “cinch” (16Howell R.M. Woodford K.J. Weitzmann M.N. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To test whether non-G bases could be incorporated into a normal tetraplex, and to examine the effect of different non-G bases on tetraplex stability, we altered a model tetraplex-forming sequence so that it would contain a single non-G base in the stem. The introduction of either a single A or C into the stem of the sequence (T2G5)4 greatly reduces the extent of polymerase arrest (Fig. 8A, panels (A)1 and (C)1), consistent with the effect of disruption of a tetrad. The effect of the C residue is added proof that hairpin formation is not involved in K+-dependent DNA synthesis arrest since the substitution of a G-C pair for a G-G one should not reduce the stability of such a hairpin. Cytosine methylation had no effect on DNA synthesis arrest (Fig. 8B), nor did lowering the pH to 6.5 (data not shown). To see whether tetraplex formation was possible at physiological temperatures, we carried out DNA synthesis arrest assays on templates containing the sequence (T2Gn)4, where n = 2-4. Templates were heated and cooled, in the absence of K+, and then K+ added after the reaction had equilibrated at 37°C for 5 min. K+-dependent tetraplex formation was seen for templates in which n ≥ 3 even under these conditions (data not shown). Arrest of DNA synthesis is seen with as little as 5 mM K+ and increases as the K+ concentration increases (data not shown). Since intracellular K+ concentrations range from 100 to 150 mM in mammalian cells (26Lau Y.T. Yassin R.R. Horowitz S.B. Science. 1988; 240: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), these results suggest that tetraplexes could be formed in vivo by relatively short G-rich sequences whenever DNA is single-stranded for short periods of time. We have shown here that the formation of a K+-dependent block to DNA synthesis is a general diagnostic feature of intrastrand tetraplexes. The K+ ion specificity is probably related to the fact that K+ is unique among the monovalent cations in being both small enough to enter the stem cavity and large enough to stabilize tetraplexes by forming a coordination complex with Gs in adjacent tetrads (4Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). The K+ effect on polynucleotide chain extension makes a simple, rapid, and specific assay for sequences able to form such structures that is easy to visualize and very sensitive. Structures can be resolved at single base resolution on sequencing gels, and it is possible to detect multiple structures simultaneously even when only a small fraction of the molecules have formed a tetraplex. Tetraplex formation can be observed under conditions that might reasonably be expected to occur in cells, and the assay is amenable to studies of factors that affect tetraplex stability. We have used this assay to explore some of the sequence parameters that affect tetraplex formation and stability. We show that at least 3 bases in each loop are needed, and that Gs in the loops have a stabilizing effect. Ts, Cs, and As all have similar effects on tetraplex stability for loop sizes of 3, but when the loop sizes were increased, Ts are slightly more stabilizing than either As or Cs. At least 10 Ts can be tolerated in the central loop, with 4-6 being optimal. Our data indicate that a folding mechanism that involves the interaction of two small hairpin intermediates to form the tetraplex is a significant pathway for the formation of these structures. We also show that even a single non-G base in the putative tetraplex stem severely destabilizes the structure, although some arrest is still observed. These structures are, however, relatively insensitive to differing numbers of bases in the constituent loops. This is interesting since it indicates that sequences lacking a recognizable 4 G-repeat motif may still be able to form tetraplexes. This vastly increases the number of sequences that can potentially form such structures. From the experiments described in this report we were able to identify a number of sequences in GenBank™ that might form strong intrastrand tetraplexes (Table I). In addition to DNA tetraplexes, it is probable that transcripts containing these sequences also form tetraplexes, and an effect of these structures at the RNA level is thus also possible.TABLE IList of potential tetraplex-forming sequencesGenBank numberGenBank DescriptionStrandPotential tetraplex forming sequence5′ Regulatory regions/promotersX15316Heterodontus fransciscii lambda immunoglobulin light chain gene−GGGGGGGTGGGGGGGCGGGGGGGTTGGGGGGM38191Human 5-lipoxygenase gene+GGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGM34901Human argininosuccinate synthetase gene+GGGGGCCGGGGCCCGGGGGCGGGGX68969Human gene for beta I integrin+GGGGGTGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGX02158Human gene for erythropoietin−GGGGCCCACCGGGGATGGGGACCGCTGGGGM24428Human liver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene+GGGGAGGGGTTGGGGCCGGGGGCGGGGGAGGGGGM94250Human retinoic acid inducible factor (MK) gene+GGGGGGGTGGGGAGAGGGGGCGGGGGX77900M. fascicularis apolipoprotein gene C-III+GGGGCACACAGGGGTGGGGGCCGGGTGGGGGGX62826M. musculus pva gene for parvalbumin+GGGGAGGGGGCCAGGGGCTGGGGGZ22784M. musculus troponin I gene+GGGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGATX54077Mouse intracisternal A-particle IAP DNA containing HOX-2.4 gene−GGGGGAGGGGTGGGGGAGGGGTTGTCGGGGGX56850Mouse retinoic acid receptor beta gene+GGGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGGAGGGM34651Pseudorabies virus+GGGGGGCCGGGGCGAGGGGAAGGGGM10613Rat alpha-1 procollagen(II) gene−GGGGGCGGGGATTTCAGGGGTAGGGGIntronsM29384Herpes simplex virus type 2 immediate-early (IE4) protein+GGGGGGCCGGGGGGCCGGGGGGCCGGGGGGGGGM95740Human alpha-L-iduronidase gene+GGGGGGGTGGGGTCCGGGGCGGGGGM26313Human CD8, genomic organization and nucleotide sequence+GGGGATGGGGCGGGCGGGGGGCGGGGGX06079Human gene for HLA-DR alpha+GGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGX13546Human HMG-17 gene for non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-17−GGGGGCGGGGCACGGGGGAGGGGM14949Human R-ras gene−GGGGGCACAGGGGGGATGGGGGTCCAGGGGGX63240M. musculus mAmh gene for anti-Mullerian hormone+GGGGGAGGGGGGTTTGGGGGAGGGGGD90360Mouse gene for cytokeratin endo A−GGGGGAGCGGGGGGGCGGGGGTTGACGGGGX13337Neurospora crassa mitochondrial DNA with duplications of tRNA-Met+GGGGGGGGAAGGGGGGATTAGGGGGGGGGGAAATTAGGGGGGX05117R. norvegicus CaMI gene for calmodulin+GGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGExons/coding regionsM33699Herpes simplex virus type 1 infected-cell protein (ICP34.5) gene−GGGGGCGCTGGGGGCGCTGGGGGCGCTGGGGGCGCAGGGGGM77381Human acrosin gene−GGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGX74628M. musculus gene for MUC18 glycoprotein−GGGGGGAGGGGTCGGAGGGGGTCGGGG5′-Untranslated regionsX74028B. taurus TSPY gene−GGGGTGGGGGGGAGGGGGTGGGGM76558Human neuronal DHP-sensitive, voltage-dependent, calcium channel−GGGAAGGGGTAAGGCGGGGGCGGGGM20488Human platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene+GGGGGTGGGGGGGAGGGGGTGGGG3′-Untranslated regionsX55068Human c-erbA-1 gene+GGGGCAGGGGGTGGGGGGAGGGGD26535Human gene for dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase+GGGGGTGGGGGAGGGGGGAAGGGGStructural rnaX07201Mouse H19 gene+GGGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGGM97168Human X (inactive)-specific transcript (XIST)−GGGGGGATGGGGGGATGGGGGGATGGGGGGM15703X. laevis 28S ribosomal RNA gene+GGGGGGCCGCGGGGGCGGGGGGGCGCGGGGGGMiscellaneousM55173D. hydei Z-DNA flanking regions+GGGGGCTGGGGGCTGGGGGCTGGGGGX15844H. annuus mitochondrial plasmid-like DNA (P1) repeat sequences−GGGGGAGGGGCCTGGGGAGGGGGS51329Human AAVS1 = adeno-associated virus integration site−GGGGACGTAGGGGGAAGGGGACGTAGGGGGU09115Human retrotransposable L1 element LRE2+GGGGTCGGGGGAGGGGGGAGGGG Open table in a new tab A number of the sequences listed in Table I are located in the 5′-regulatory region of a variety of eukaryote genes. It is possible that these structures have a regulatory role by affecting protein binding to the promoter. For example, the tetraplex in the chicken β-globin promoter overlaps with the binding site of an erythroid-specific DNA binding protein (27Lewis C.D. Clark S.P. Felsenfeld G. Gould H. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We speculate that tetraplex formation may block binding of this protein and thus represents one level at which regulation of the β-globin gene could be accomplished. Tetraplex-forming sequences are also located in the 5′-untranslated regions, introns, and 3′-untranslated regions of a number of interesting genes including the human genes encoding argininosuccinate lyase (28Abramson R.D. Barbosa P. Kalumuck K. O'Brien W.E. Genomics. 1991; 10: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), erythropoietin (29Lin F.-K. Suggs S. Lin C.-H. Browne J.K. Smalling R. Egrie J.C. Chen K.K.

Adham I.M. Engel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A number of nontranslated RNAs also have tetraplex-forming potential. Examples of this class of sequences include the 28 S ribosomal RNA gene in Xenopus (31Ware V.C. Tague B.W. Clark C.G. Gourse R.L. Brand R.C. Gerbi S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7795-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the human X (inactive)-specific transcript (32Brown C.J. Ballabio A. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Grompe M. Tonlorenzi R. Willard H.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), and the product of the mouse H19 gene, a developmentally regulated gene under the control of raf and Rif (33Pachnis V. Brannan C.I. Tilghman S.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that at least one of the sequences shown in Table I, the one found in the 3′-untranslated region of the human retrotransposable element known as L1 (34Dombroski B.A. Mathias S.L. Nanthakumar E. Scott A.F. Kazazian H.J. Science. 1991; 254: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), does indeed form a tetraplex. 2R. Howell and K. Usdin, manuscript in preparation. This structure may play a role in L1 retroposition because it has been conserved for the ∼100 million years since the mammalian radiation in the absence of sequence conservation.2 These structures may act in other contexts as cell cycle check points by slowing replication through these regions. We would also expect that such structures would block transcription and translation. Transcriptional blocks may function to prevent unwanted transcriptional read through from an upstream promoter, while translational blocks may prevent inappropriate protein synthesis by blocking scanning by the 40 S ribosomal subunit. The biological significance of intrastrand DNA tetraplexes is obviously contingent on their ability to form in vivo. In order for such structures to form, the DNA must be single-stranded. In the assay described here, single strands were obtained by heat denaturation. In eukaryotic cells it is thought that only relatively small regions of DNA are unpaired during replication, although it has been suggested that many hundreds of bases would be unpaired under some circumstances (35Kunkel T.A. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, even if this were so, much of this DNA would probably be bound by single-stranded binding proteins. On the other hand, tetraplex formation has been demonstrated in supercoiled plasmids in vitro (36Voloshin O.N. Veselkov A.G. Belotserkovskii B.P. Danilevskaya O.N. Pavlova M.N. Dobrynin V.N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that under some conditions these structures may be formed in otherwise duplex DNA. Direct evidence for tetraplex formation in vivo has been obtained for at least one sequence, that of the human insulin promoter (8Hammond-Kosack M.C. Kilpatrick M.W. Docherty K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that formation of DNA tetraplexes by sequences such as those shown in Table I might in fact be possible. Our exploration of sequence variations in tetraplex-forming sequences is clearly not exhaustive. It does, however, illustrate the flexibility of the requirements for tetraplex formation, and greatly expands the category of known tetraplex-forming sequences. We thank Herbert Tabor and Deborah Hinton for critical reading of this manuscript, and Anthony V. Furano for many helpful discussions."

In addition, expression of a dominant negative mutant of the GTPase, Cdc42, blocks activation of the JNK pathway by Gα12 and Gα13 but does not alter inhibition of ERK activation by the same Gα proteins; conversely, mutationally activated Cdc42 stimulates the JNK pathway but has no effect on the ERK pathway. Our results show that different mechanisms mediate two effects of Gα12 and Gα13: the ERK pathway inhibition is mediated at the level of MAP kinase kinase in a Ras- and Raf-independent fashion, whereas the JNK pathway stimulation is mediated by Cdc42.

Mutation of a cluster of five cysteine residues present in the cytoplasmic tail of ETA into serine or alanine residues completely prevented palmitoylation of the receptor. The ligand binding affinity of the non-palmitoylated ETA mutants was essentially unchanged as compared to the palmitoylated wild type ETA suggesting that the replacement of the cysteine residues did not alter the overall structure of the receptor. Furthermore, the ligand-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by the mutant ETA was unaffected by the mutation. In contrast, the mutated non-palmitoylated receptors but not the wild type receptor failed to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by phospholipase C activation upon challenge by endothelin-1.

Mammalian neurofilaments are obligate heteropolymers assembled from three polypeptides, neurofilament (NF)-H, NF-M, and NF-L, each of which undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites.

In order to explore the possible role(s) of O-GlcNAcylation in NF functions, we extend further our original study and show that not only NF-M and NF-L but also NF-H are modified by O-GlcNAc. Most strikingly, we document that multiple serines in the ∼50 KSP repeats of the tail domain of NF-H are O-GlcNAcylated, suggesting that it regulates the properties of the tail domain by directly competing and modulating phosphorylation. Spinal cords were taken from 6-month-old or older male rats. UDP-[6-3H]galactose (38 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Bovine milk galactosyltransferase (GT'ase), chymotrypsin, and aprotinin were purchased from Sigma, and GT'ase (37 unit/ml) was pregalactosylated as described (36Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing grade trypsin was from Boehringer Mannheim. Mixed monosaccharide standards were from Dionex. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. Total NFs comprising mainly NF triplet proteins were prepared from about 15 g of frozen rat spinal cord as described (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J.

The Triton X-100 insoluble pellet from repeated sucrose cushions was resuspended in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 8.0 M urea, and 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, filtered through a 0.20-µm filter, and loaded onto a 45-ml DE52 cellulose column. NF-H was separated from the remaining of cytoskeletal proteins including NF-M and NF-L in a 250-ml sodium phosphate gradient from 20 to 500 mM of above buffer. NF-M and NF-L were further purified to homogeneity as described (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total NFs (25 µg) or 5 µg of each purified NF subunit (NF-H, NF-M, or NF-L) was labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose and GT'ase on ice as described (36Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications according to Dong et al. (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled mix was precipitated with 8 volumes of cold acetone. The pellet was resuspended in gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified NF subunits were labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose and GT'ase and subjected to mild alkali-induced β-elimination (35Torres C.-R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 14: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar). The [3H]galactose-labeled β-elimination products were separated on a Sephadex G-50 column and then analyzed on a TSK Fractogel HW-40C column (1.5 × 200 cm, Tosoh Corp) and further examined on a CarboPAc-MA1 column (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stoichiometry estimation of O-GlcNAc on NF-H was determined as described previously (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified NF-H was acid-hydrolyzed in 6.0 M HCl for 5 h under nitrogen gas at 110°C (for glucosamine analysis) or for 24 h at 110°C (for amino acid composition analysis). The exact amount of protein was quantified by amino acid composition analysis. The amount of glucosamine was determined by the ratio of the peak area of glucosamine between the standard run and acid hydrolyzed NF-H run by high pH anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) on a CarboPAc PA1 column using 1 nmol of 2-deoxyglucose as an internal standard. Purified NF-H was first digested with chymotrypsin (weight ratio, 200:1) in 0.1% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.25, 10% CH3CN, for 2 h at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged in a Microcon-30 (Amicon), and the flow through containing small chymotryptic fragments was lyophilized. Purified NF-H (0.48 mg) was first digested with trypsin (weight ratio, 20:1) in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5, and 10% CH3CN at 37°C for 18 h, and the digestion was continued for another 10 h with an addition of the same amount of trypsin. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 µl of aprotinin (2 mg/ml). The trypsinized peptides were desalted through two Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters), eluted with 60% CH3CN, and dried. Peptides from chymotrypsin digestion of NF-H were labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose and 1.5-fold of nonradioactive UDP-galactose (27.5 µM final) in GT'ase buffer in the presence of aprotinin at 37°C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was acidified with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a Sep-Pak cartridge. The labeled peptides were eluted with 60% CH3CN, dried, and then separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm, Rainin) in the following gradient of 0-60% CH3CN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid: 0-60 min, 0-24%; 60-70 min, 24-60%; 70-85 min, 60% (all RP-HPLC gradients described hereafter were linear in the specified time window, the flow rate was 1 ml/min, fractions were collected every minute, and the absorbance of the elutant was monitored at 214 nm). Peptides from trypsin digestion of NF-H were labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose followed by 20-fold excess of unlabeled UDP-galactose. They were then desalted through two Sep-Pak cartridges before injecting onto a C18 column for RP-HPLC analysis. The gradient was 120 min, 0-60% CH3CN in 5 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.1 M sodium perchloride, pH 6.9, in the following order: 0-100 min, 0-27%; 100-115 min, 27-60%; 115-120 min, 60%. Each tritium-labeled peptide peak was pooled and then further separated by a second dimension RP-HPLC on the C18 column, with a 85 min, 0-60% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Tryptic [3H]galactose-labeled peptides of both NF-M and NF-L were prepared according to Dong et al. (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For both subunits, there were four major radioactive peaks (named as Peaks 1, 2, 3, and 4 for NF-M, and Peaks A, B, C, and D for NF-L, in the order of elution time) on the first dimension RP-HPLC, and each radioactive peptide was separated again on the second dimension RP-HPLC (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first two radioactive peptide peaks of NF-M on the first dimension RP-HPLC, Peaks 1 and 2, were purified by the second dimension RP-HPLC, and both eluted as a single radioactive peak. The fractions of [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides of Peak 2 were combined, dried, and resuspended in 30% CH3CN. The radioactive peptide peak of Peak 1 containing multiple peptides from two runs of RP-HPLC was further purified on a third dimension RP-HPLC in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0-60% CH3CN gradient: 0-60 min, 0-24%; 60-70 min, 24-60%; 70-85 min, 60%. The tritium-labeled glycopeptide was eluted at 24 and 25 min, and both fractions were dried. Peak A, the first [3H]galactose-labeled peptide peak of NF-L eluted on the first dimension RP-HPLC, was further purified by a third dimension RP-HPLC in 5 mM sodium phosphate and 0.1 M sodium perchloride, pH 6.9, and elution with a linear CH3CN gradient: 0-5 min, 0%; 5-60 min, 0-15%; 60-80 min, 15-60%. The single radioactive and corresponding major mass peak, which eluted at 31-32 min, was dried, resuspended in water, and desalted through a Sep-Pak cartridge. The fourth and predominant tritium peak of NF-L, Peak D, was partially digested with chymotrypsin (20:1 by weight) and separated by RP-HPLC in a 85 min gradient of 0-60% CH3CN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid: 0-60 min, 0-24%; 60-70 min, 24-60%; 70-85 min, 60%. Following the first, second, or third dimension RP-HPLC, purified glycopeptides of NF proteins were sequenced by automated Edman degradation in a model 470A gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). MED sequencing of glycopeptides was performed by covalent coupling of peptides to Sequelon-AA membranes (MilliGen/Biosearch of Millipore), followed by repeated coupling of phenyl isothiocyanate and trifluoroacetic acid extraction as described (47Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), except that the membrane (or filter) from each cycle was extracted and washed with 0.5 ml of trifluoroacetic acid and then washed with methanol twice, and all extraction and washes were combined, dried, and neutralized with 100 µl of 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.8, before scintillation counting. NF proteins were analyzed by 8.0% SDS-PAGE (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or treated with En3HANCE (DuPont NEN), dried, and fluorographed. Protein concentration was determined by Amido Schwarz dye binding procedure (49Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A common and sensitive method to detect O-GlcNAcylation of proteins is to covalently label the protein-bound sugar with UDP-[3H]galactose and GT'ase (36Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 14: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar). Total NFs, comprised primarily of the three NF subunits, NF-H (200 kDa), NF-M (145 kDa), and NF-L (62 kDa), were isolated from rat spinal cord (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Each protein subunit was purified to near homogeneity as described above (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 2, and 3). Total NFs and each purified subunit were separately labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose and GT'ase, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fluorographed. As shown in Fig. 1B, NF-M and NF-L were strongly radiolabeled by [3H]galactose both in the total cytoskeletal pellet (Fig. 1B, lane 4) and in the purified form (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Purified NF-H and the tail domain of NF-H could only be labeled with GT'ase if they were first denatured by treating with 0.5% SDS and boiling prior to an extended incubation with GT'ase. Even so, NF-H was only weakly labeled in the purified form (Fig. 1B, lane 3), and the lengthy incubation resulted in several labeled bands around 50 kDa that are degradation products of NF-H (see below). The carboxyl-terminal tail domain of NF-H, consisting of 52 KSP repeats, was labeled even more weakly (data not shown). The relatively weak [3H]galactose incorporation into the purified NF-H is due, at least in part, to the tendency of purified NF-H to self-aggregate during GT'ase labeling. The labeling of NF-H was improved in the total NFs fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Relative to NF-M and NF-L, purified NF-H can be labeled more efficiently at 4°C or on ice than at room temperature or at 37°C because the aggregation of NF-H in the GT'ase lableling reaction is very severe at 37°C. GT'ase labeling of NF-H was also somewhat enhanced by dephosphorylation prior to labeling (data not shown), also suggesting that the phosphates may block accessibility of GT'ase. That the addition of [3H]galactose to each NF subunit represented O-GlcNAcylation was demonstrated by the resistance to peptide/N-glycosidase F treatment and virtually 100% accessibility to mild alkali-induced β-elimination (see below). In order to identify the sugar residues modified on NF-H, purified NF-H was labeled with GT'ase, subjected to alkaline-induced β-elimination, and analyzed on a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column (Fig. 2). The β-elimination products chromatographed as a single Vi peak on the column (Fig. 2A). The Vi peak (fractions 28-31) was run on a high resolution gel filtration TSK Fractogel column. The labeled sugar moieties migrated as a single peak between standards of one and two GlcNAc residues, with Kav of 0.845 (Fig. 2B). The radioactive peak from TSK chromatography was further analyzed on a Dionex CarboPAc-MA1 column with HPAEC-PAD. The [3H]galactose-labeled sugars from NF-H exactly co-migrated with authentic Galβ1-4GlcNAcitol (Fig. 2C), thus demonstrating that single GlcNAc moieties were O-glycosidically linked to NF-H. Similar results have previously been shown for NF-M and NF-L (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry of GlcNAc on purified NF proteins, GlcNAc was released from a known amount of polypeptides by 6 M HCl acid hydrolysis (converting it to glucosamine) and analyzed on Dionex CarboPAc PA1 column with HPAEC-PAD (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The average stoichiometry of purified NF-H from rat spinal cord was determined by this method to be 0.3 mol of GlcNAc/mol of NF-H, a molar ratio higher than the 0.15 and 0.1 mol of O-GlcNAc previously found for NF-M and NF-L, respectively (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This establishes a minimum estimate because O-GlcNAc may be removed during NF purification (50 mM GlcNAc was always included in the homogenization buffer, but this only partially inhibits both cytosolic N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (38Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lysosomal hexosaminidases (data not shown)). Identified O-GlcNAc sites on both NF-M and NF-L are predominantly localized on the head domains (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mild digestion of NF-H with chymotrypsin results in the fragmentation of head and rod domains of NF-H but leaves the carboxyl terminus (beginning at Ile432 (19Elhanany E. Jaffe H. Link W.T.

Ph.D. thesis, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.Google Scholar)) intact. Purified NF-H was thus digested with chymotrypsin, and peptides from the head and tail domains were isolated and labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose and GT'ase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radiolabeled peptides were separated by RP-HPLC on a C18 column. As shown in Fig. 3, only a single chymotryptic peptide from the head and rod domains of NF-H was labeled (bottom panel), and this peak corresponded to the major mass peak at elution time of 37 min (top panel). Gas-phase sequencing revealed the peptide sequence of 51ARTSVSSVSASPSRF65, located in the middle of the head domain of NF-H (20Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MED sequencing, a method successfully used to determine O-GlcNAc sites on glycopeptides of both NF-M and NF-L (33Dong D.L.-Y. Xu Z.-S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), repeatedly failed to identify the site(s) of O-GlcNAcylation on this peptide, primarily because the peptide did not efficiently attach covalently to the membrane. The reason(s) for this remains unclear. In order to examine the natural sites of O-GlcNAcylation of NF-H protein, purified NF-H was first digested with trypsin and then labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose by GT'ase as performed previously on both NF-M and NF-L (33Dong D.L.-Y.

Radiolabeled peptides were separated by RP-HPLC on a C18 column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As seen in Fig. 4, a minimum of eight [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptide peaks were resolved.

The protein, called onconase or P-30, is isolated from oocytes and/or early embryos of Rana pipiens and is 30% homologous to bovine RNase A. Main active site residues and three of the four disulfide bonds characteristic of pancreatic RNases are conserved in onconase. However, onconase appears to have a unique catalytic mechanism due to an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue (<Glu1) that folds into the active site (7Mosimann S.C. Ardelt W. James M.N.G. J. Mol.

CD4-positive H9 lymphocyte cells persistently infected with HIV-1 IIIB strain and the MN strain of HIV-1 were obtained from Dr. Robert Gallo (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD). H9 cells were also persistently infected with the MN strain of HIV-1, and U937 cells were persistently infected with either the IIIB strain or the MN strain of HIV-1. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml gentamycin. Prior to use in onconase inhibition studies, persistently infected H9 cells were washed extensively to reduce levels of free virus and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml for use in experimental protocols. Either 1 × 10−8 or 5 × 10−8 M onconase was added to washed cells, and cultures were sampled daily over a 5-day period. After the incubation, cells and medium were harvested by centrifuging the culture at 400 × g for 10 min. The supernatant medium was filtered through a 0.45-mm pore size membrane, aliquoted, quickly frozen, and stored at −70°C. Cell pellets were processed to analyze RNA, and the supernatant was used to determine p24 antigen levels. The p24 antigen concentrations were determined by quantitative HIV-1 p24 antigen capture enzyme immunoassay performed according to kit specifications (Coulter). Growth of normal H9 and U937 cells was determined in the presence of onconase up to 3 days. Each initial 50-ml culture had 2 × 105 cells/ml, and viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. 1 × 107 H9 cells (cultured in 75-cm2 flasks) were incubated with 1 × 10−8 M and 5 × 10−8 M onconase for 5 days. Each day one flask of cells was processed as follows to analyze the RNA. Total RNA was extracted using RNAzol™ according to the protocol supplied by Tel-Test Inc. (Friendswood, TX). Northern blot analysis was carried out according to protocols described in Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vol 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37Google Scholar). Briefly ∼1.5 µg of total RNA from each set was denatured for 15 min at 55°C in 20 µl of 20 mM morpholinopropane sulfonic acid NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM sodium acetate and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 50% formamide, and 6.5% formaldehyde and 2 µl of RNA sample buffer (50% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) and a small amount of ethidium bromide. These samples were electrophoresed on a denaturing 1.4% agarose gel containing 6.7% formaldehyde and 1 × MOPS buffer (20 mM morpholinopropane sulfonic acid NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM sodium acetate and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) at 100 V for 3-4 h. The gels were equilibrated in 20 × SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 45 min before overnight capillary blotting onto Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in 10 × SSC. RNA was fixed on to filters by UV cross-linking (UV Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Prehybridization was carried out at 42°C for 6 h in hybridization buffer (0.2% polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (Mr 40,000), 0.2% ficoll (Mr 400,000), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M sodium chloride, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate (Mr 500,000), and denatured salmon sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml)). Following prehybridization, hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 42°C using the 32P-Nick translated ([α-32P]dCTP, DuPont NEN) HIV-1-specific ∼8-kb DNA probe (AvaI digested 8,088-base pair DNA fragment of pNL4-3;) (14Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was washed twice in 2 × SSC/1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min each and once in 0.2 × SSC/1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Autoradiography was carried out with intensifying screens at −70°C and developed by X-Omat (Kodak). The addition of onconase to cells blocked p24 production from chronically HIV-1IIIB-infected H9 cells. Onconase at 1 × 10−8 M completely blocked p24 antigen production for 2 days, and 5 × 10−8 M onconase completely blocked p24 antigen production for at least 5 days (Fig. 1A). In H9 cells chronically infected with another strain of HIV-1, MN (15Gallo R.C. Salahuddin S.Z. Popovic M. Shearer G.M. Kaplan M. Haynes B.F. Palker T.J. Redfield R. Oleske J. Safai B. White G. Foster P. Markham P.D. Science. 1984; 224: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar), onconase at the same concentration inhibited HIV-1 production 60-75% over a 5-day period (Fig. 1B). We also studied U937 cells persistently infected with these two HIV-1 strains (IIIB and MN) and found that onconase also inhibited p24 antigen production of both strains (Fig. 2, A and B). The mammalian cells were persistently infected with HIV, indicating that steps in the HIV-1 life cycle subsequent to genomic integration are susceptible to ribonuclease intervention.Fig. 2A, time course of HIV-1 p24 protein production at 1 × 10−8, 5 × 10−8, and 1 × 10−7 M onconase in chronically HIV-1IIIB strain-infected U937 cells.

Wu Y.-N. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. Hamilton R.S. Newton D. D'Alessio G. Gravell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we examined whether onconase in the 10−8 M concentration range slowed the rate of cell division in H9 cells (Fig. 3A) and U937 cells (Fig. 3B). At 5 × 10−8 M, onconase was not cytotoxic to cells and only slightly inhibited the H9 cell growth rate and did not affect U937 cell growth rate (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). Therefore, onconase directly inhibits HIV-1 production within viable and dividing cells. These results disprove our previous “Trojan horse” model for onconase antiviral activity (6Youle R.J. Wu Y.-N. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. Hamilton R.S. Newton D. D'Alessio G. Gravell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and beg the question of mechanism. To investigate the molecular basis of RNase anti-viral action leading to the reduction in HIV p24 antigen, the levels of HIV-1 RNA at various times during exposure to onconase were analyzed. Northern blot analysis of the total RNA from uninfected H9 cells and chronically HIV-1IIIB-infected H9 cells treated with different doses of onconase showed that onconase caused a large decrease in the levels of all the HIV-1 RNA transcripts (Fig. 4A). The higher molecular weight HIV-1 transcripts were most susceptible to onconase (Table I). Onconase at 20-100-fold higher doses (1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−5 M) can enter the cell cytosol in great enough amounts to degrade cellular RNA (16Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, experiments such as Fig. 4 provide the first evidence that an RNase at one one-hundredth the cytotoxic concentration can actually enter cells and degrade viral RNA species. Consistent with this model are recent results showing that disruption of intracellular traffic through the Golgi apparatus can greatly increase the delivery of onconase to the cytosol (17Wu Y.N. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Gadina M. Mikulski S.M. De Lorenzo C. D'Alessio G. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17476-17481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Tao-Cheng J.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The most dramatic decrease in HIV-1 RNA levels occurred with 5 × 10−8 M onconase and lasted up to 4 days. After 4 days of exposure to the initial onconase dose, HIV-1 RNA levels began to increase (Fig. 4A). This increase in HIV-1 RNA level after 4 days of inhibition precedes the increase in p24 antigen concentrations seen in Fig. 1A. The onconase treatment at 1 × 10−8 M resulted in a similar inhibition of HIV-1 RNA levels, although the inhibition at this lower dose of onconase was shorter in duration than for the 5 × 10−8 M onconase-treated cells. This may reflect the half-life of onconase within cultured cells. When cells were treated with 1 × 10−8 M onconase, the eventual reappearance of the HIV-1 RNA after 3 days corresponded with renewed p24 antigen production (Figs. 1A and 4A). These results also show that the ribonuclease is not lethal to the cells because they re-express HIV-1 RNA and p24 antigen with increased time after ribonuclease exposure.TABLE IQuantitation of different HIV-1IIIB RNA speciesHIV-1 RNA species5 × 10−8 M Onconase1 × 10−8 M OnconaseDay 1Day 2Day 3Day 4Day 5Day 1Day 2Day 3Day 4Day 5%∼8 kb45625271431436119∼4 kb3347376078644461100118∼2 kb37273523475975357792 Open table in a new tab Because of the eventual resynthesis of HIV-1 RNA, we added a second dose of onconase at 1 × 10−8 M, 2 days after an initial onconase treatment at 1 × 10−8 M on day zero. The second dose of onconase caused a significant further decrease in p24 antigen production and in cell division rate. However, the inhibition of p24 antigen by the second treatment was less than that of the first exposure to onconase (data not shown). Comparing the RNA from H9 cells treated on day 0 only and those treated at day 0 and day 2 with 1 × 10−8 M onconase revealed that the increase in HIV-1 RNA levels seen 4 and 5 days after a single inoculum of onconase (Fig. 4A) was blocked by the second addition of onconase (Fig. 5A). Thus repeated application of ribonucleases has repeated antiviral effects. Examining the ribosomal RNA from the same H9 cell samples where viral RNA was destroyed showed no effect of onconase on rRNA (Fig. 4B). We also examined the levels of messenger RNAs encoding human actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the transferrin receptor in 5 × 10−8 M onconase-treated and control H9 cells (Fig. 6). No decrease in mRNA levels was found in three out of the three mRNAs examined. Thus onconase expressed a surprising selectivity for HIV-1 RNA species within cells, a finding consistent with its low cytotoxicity and minor effect on cell growth rate. However, tRNA may be also highly susceptible to degradation by onconase and certain homologous RNases (19Lin J.J. Newton D.L. Mikulski S.M. Kung H.F. Youle R.J. Rybak S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Saxena S.K. Rybak S.M. Davey R.T. Youle R.J. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21982-21986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As onconase is not likely to express sequence specificity for HIV RNA, perhaps proteins complexed with RNA protect endogenous cellular RNAs from onconase to a greater extent than the HIV-1 RNAs. Although onconase blocks virus production by a new and unknown mechanism, the HIV-1 DNA integrated into the mammalian genome eventually begins virion production at some time following the ribonuclease exposure (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Thus it will be important to examine effects of ribonucleases on viral penetration and integration because these steps may also be uniquely susceptible to ribonucleases and allow a permanent elimination of virus production. We compared HIV-1 infectivity titers on virus harvested from onconase-treated H9 cells and untreated controls. Titers of virus from onconase-treated and untreated cells standardized for the same amount of p24 antigen showed no relative difference in infectivity (data not shown). Thus the virus eventually produced by onconase-treated cells was not defective. The RNA genome and associated primer tRNAs (21Peters G.G. Glover C. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 708-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) packaged into virus particles appear to function correctly when packaged from onconase-treated cells. In the future it may be possible to enhance onconase antiviral activity by engineering amino acid sequences into onconase that package it into HIV virions (22Natsoulis G. Seshaiah P. Federspiel M.J. Rein A. Hughes S.H. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or that target it selectively to HIV-infected cells (23Newton D.L. Nicholls P.J. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26739-26745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rybak S.M. Newton D.L. Mikulski S.M. Viera A. Youle R.J. Drug Delivery. 1993; 1: 3-10Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Previously it was found that human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and bovine pancreatic RNase A, both members of the ribonuclease family homologous to onconase in sequence, lacked antiviral activity (6Youle R.J. Wu Y.-N. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. Hamilton R.S. Newton D. D'Alessio G. Gravell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We constructed several recombinant forms of onconase (8Boix E. Wu Y.N. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and used these variants to probe the structural differences between human pancreatic RNase and onconase that generate antiviral activity (Fig. 7A). When onconase was expressed with an N-terminal methionine instead of the pyroglutamyl residue found in the native frog protein, ribonuclease activity was decreased 80-90% (8Boix E. Wu Y.N. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We compared the antiviral activity of native onconase, recombinant onconase expressed with an N-terminal methionine residue, and recombinant onconase treated with cyanogen bromide to reconstitute the N-terminal pyroglutamyl residue. Fig. 7B shows that whereas native onconase and the recombinant pyroglutamyl form of onconase expressed potent antiviral activity, the N-terminal methionine form of onconase completely lacked activity. Thus antiviral activity correlates with the degree of ribonuclease activity as the two pyroglutamyl forms of onconase are more active in both respects than the N-terminal methionine form. When the N-terminal 11 amino acid residues of human RNase are exchanged for the N-terminal 9 amino acids of onconase, the chimera expresses greater enzyme activity than native or recombinant onconase (8Boix E. Wu Y.N. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, when antiviral activity is analyzed (Fig. 7C), the human RNase/onconase chimera lacks antiviral activity. Thus, although ribonuclease activity appears to be required for antiviral activity, it is not sufficient and some feature in the N-terminal 9 amino acids beyond RNase activity appears essential for the antiviral effect. Ribonucleolytic antiviral activity is reminiscent of the pathway by which interferon inhibits replication of a number of viruses including HIV-1 (25Ho D.D. Hartshorn K.L. Rota T.R. Andrews C.A. Kaplan J.C. Schooley R.T. Hirsch M.S. Lancet. 1985; 1: 602-604Abstract PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Schroder H.C. Kelve M. Muller W.E.G. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1994; 14: 176-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interferon induces a 2′-5′ oligoadenylate-dependent ribonuclease (27Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetases that when triggered by virus produce the allosteric activator of the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate-dependent RNase. The activated 2′-5′ A-dependent RNase cleaves HIV viral RNA as well as ribosomal RNA and can inhibit HIV replication in vitro (28Schröder H.C. Wenger R. Kuchino Y. Müller W.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5669-5673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and interferon can ameliorate the clinical symptoms of HIV-1, at least temporarily (29Carter W.A. Strayer D.R. Brodsky I. Lewin M. Pellegrino M.G. Einck L. Henriques H.F. Simon G.L. Parenti D.M. Scheib R.G. Schulof R.S. Montefiori D.C. Robinson W.E. Mitchell W.M. Volsky D.J. Paul D. Paxton H. Meyer I. Kariko K. Reichenbach N. Suhadolink R.J. Gillespie D.H. Lancet. 1987; 1: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Like onconase, interferon induction of the 2′-5′ A-dependent RNase also slows cell division rates (30Hassel B.A. Zhou A. Sotomayor C. Maran A. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Another important feature shared by onconase and interferon is that they both inhibit viral production even when administered after cells are infected with HIV-1 (31Poli G. Orenstein J.M. Kinter A. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. Science. 1985; 244: 575-577Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This contrasts with reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as azidothymidine that block new infection cycles but do not inhibit viral production from chronically infected cells. This is a particularly important attribute shared by interferon and onconase that may have therapeutic importance. It has already been noted that combinations of agents such as azidothymidine and interferon, which act early and late in the infection cycle, respectively, act synergistically (32Hartshorn K.L. Sandstrom E.G. Neumeyer D. Paradis T.J. Chou T.C. Schooley R.T. Hirsch M.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Hartshorn K.L. Vogt M.W.

Consistent with these results and the suggestion that onconase and interferon work at similar steps in viral infection, we find that combinations of an interferon and onconase do not act synergistically or additively. 2S. K. Saxena, M. Gravell, Y.-N. Wu, S. M. Mikulski, K. Shogen, W. Ardelt, and R. J. Youle, unpublished data. Given the high viral production and turnover during AIDS that continues for days even after inhibition of new viral infection cycles with noncompetitive reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (34Wei X. Ghosh S.K. Taylor M.E. Johnson V.A. Emini E.A. Deutsch P. Lifson J.D. Bonhoeffer S. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. Saag M.S. Shaw G.M.

Nature. 1995; 373: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (3810) Google Scholar), onconase administered simultaneously with protease and/or reverse transcriptase inhibitors may block virus production from persistently infected cells and may decrease the probability of new variant HIV-1 particles arising that are resistant to the antiviral agents. The time course of viral production and cell turnover coincide well with the safe regimens of onconase currently in clinical trials for cancer (10Mikulski S.M. Grossman A.M. Carter P.W. Shogen K. Costanzi J.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 57-64PubMed Google Scholar). These results also suggest a new physiologic step in the diverse activities of extracellular ribonucleases. Onconase is homologous to a family of proteins, many of which exist in mammals, that has well understood biochemical properties and evolutionary relationships but poorly understood physiological roles. The pancreatic RNase family members have a variety of biologic effects on cells and tissues that depend upon RNase enzyme activity (1Youle R.J. Newton D. Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Rybak S.M. Crit. Rev. Ther.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, all members of this superfamily have a signal peptide that directs their secretion or sequestration within vesicles (38Beintema J.J. Schuller C. Irie M. Carsana A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1988; 51: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), segregating them from any known RNA. How extracytoplasmic RNases may alter cells via RNA substrates has been difficult to explain (39Benner S.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results, showing that one member of the pancreatic ribonuclease family can enter cells and alter specific RNA transcript levels without blocking cell growth, suggest that other members of this family may have related activities that could contribute to their diverse biologic properties. Furthermore, these results suggest that certain members of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily may have physiologic roles as anti-viral proteins. We thank Drs. Veena Vasandani and Ester Boix for many valuable discussions and for supplying recombinant forms of onconase."

In myocardium the majority of phospholipase A2 activity is catalyzed by a calcium-independent phospholipase A2, which is selective for plasmalogen substrate containing arachidonic acid (1Wolf R.A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Google Scholar). Since this enzyme neither requires calcium as an obligatory cofactor in catalysis nor employs calcium for membrane association, it has traditionally been assumed that calcium ion does not directly regulate the activity of this enzyme (1Wolf R.A.

However, alterations in calcium homeostasis play prominent roles in cardiac physiology, the predominant phospholipid constituents in the electrically active membrane of myocytes are plasmalogens containing arachidonic acid (7Gross R.W.

Herein we describe a novel mechanism through which calcium ion regulates nominally “calcium-independent” myocardial phospholipase A2 through its physical association with, and functional coupling to, the intracellular calcium transducer, calmodulin. We now report that myocardial phospholipase A2 specifically and tightly binds to calmodulin in a calcium-dependent fashion, that this interaction is titrated over physiologic increments of calcium ion, that the interaction between calmodulin and the phospholipase A2 catalytic complex regulates phospholipase A2 activity in vitro, and that pharmacologic ablation of this interaction by three structurally disparate calmodulin antagonists results in the release of arachidonic acid by nominally “calcium-independent” phospholipase A2 in intact muscle cells. The preparation of rabbit myocardial cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2 and the synthesis of 1-O-(Z)-hexadec-1′-enyl-2-[9,10-3H]octadec-9′-enoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2-H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (BEL) 1The abbreviations used are: BEL(E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2-H-tetrahydropyran-2-onePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. were performed as described previously (13Han X. Zupan L.A. Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 119-124Google Scholar, 14Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 166: 7227-7232Google Scholar). Recombinant 85-kDa calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 was purified from a baculovirus expression system as described previously (15de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Google Scholar). A-10 muscle cells (ATTC CRL 1476) were cultured and labeled according to established methods (16Lehman J.J. Brown K.A. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20713-20716Google Scholar). (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2-H-tetrahydropyran-2-one polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ventricular myocardium from New Zealand White rabbits was placed in ice-cold buffer (250 m sucrose, 10 m imidazole, 10 m KCl, 5 m EDTA, pH 7.5) and homogenized utilizing a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × gmax for 20 min, and the resultant supernatant was heat-treated (90°C for 3 min) and rapidly cooled, and precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 × gmax for 20 min). The resultant cytosol was dialyzed against 20 m imidazole, 1 m magnesium acetate, pH 7.5 (Buffer A) at 4°C and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 8.0 cm), and adsorbed protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (100 m-1 NaCl). The calcium-dependent inhibitor was concentrated (Amicon Centriplus-10) and diluted 3-fold with buffer A, and 500 µg of protein was loaded onto a PC 1.6/5 Mono-Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) prior to elution with a linear 1 NaCl gradient in buffer A. Calcium-dependent inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2 was assessed by incubating partially purified phospholipase A2 (150 µg) with column fractions (25 µl) or bovine brain calmodulin in a final volume of 200 µl in 100 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing either 10 m CaCl2 or 4 m EGTA for 2 min at 25°C. Phospholipase A2 activity was quantified by the release of [3H]oleic acid from 1-O-(Z)-hexadec-1′-enyl-2-[9,10-3H]octadec-9′-enoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (plasmenylcholine) (2 µ) as described previously (2Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10633Google Scholar). The indicated free calcium ion concentrations employed in the assays were prepared using buffered CaCl2/EGTA solutions (17Portzehl H. Caldwell P.C. Ruegg J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 79: 581-591Google Scholar). Protein samples (500 µ CaCl2 final concentration) were loaded onto calmodulin-Sepharose columns pre-equilibrated with 50 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) (buffer B) containing 500 µ CaCl2. After application of 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer, columns were washed with buffer B containing 4 m EGTA. For experiments involving W-7 agarose, 75 µl of Mono-Q-purified calcium-dependent inhibitor was adjusted to either 1 m CaCl2 or 4 m EGTA prior the addition of W-7 agarose equilibrated in 20 m imidazole, pH 7.5. After a 60-min incubation at 4°C, the W-7 agarose was pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed (3 times) with 20 m imidazole, pH 7.5, containing either 1 m CaCl2 or 4 m EGTA prior to resuspension. Previously, we have demonstrated that calcium ion inhibits over 80% of crude myocardial cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity (1Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7259-7303Google Scholar) and have repeatedly observed this effect in multiple independent preparations ( = ∼96 pmol/mg·min in the presence of EGTA and ∼ 18 pmol/mg·min in the presence of 10 m calcium ion). During the course of investigating this phenomenon, we observed that highly purified preparations of myocardial phospholipase A2 did not manifest the calcium-mediated inhibition of enzymic activity, which was present in the crude cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1). The calcium-mediated inhibition of purified phospholipase A2 activity could be reconstituted by the addition of heat-treated cytosol (which did not contain measurable phospholipase A2 activity) to highly purified preparations of myocardial phospholipase A2 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, incubation of heat-treated cytosol with trypsin completely ablated its ability to reconstitute calcium-mediated inhibition of purified myocardial phospholipase A2 activity. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that a heat-stable protein constituent present in myocardial cytosol was responsible for the calcium-mediated inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2 activity. To identify the protein constituent mediating these effects, heat-treated cytosol was subjected to anion exchange chromatography. A single, well resolved peak of calcium-dependent inhibition was identified (Fig. 1B), pooled, and subjected to Mono-Q chromatography (Fig. 1C). The calcium-dependent inhibitor of myocardial phospholipase A2 eluted as a single, well resolved UV peak at ∼300 m NaCl, which contained an 18-kDa doublet that precisely cochromatographed with the observed calcium-dependent inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2 (Fig. 1D). SDS-PAGE in the presence of EGTA demonstrated the collapse of the doublet to a single band. Since calmodulin is a heat-stable, acidic 18-kDa protein that migrates as a doublet on SDS-PAGE in the presence of calcium ion and a single band in the presence of EGTA (18Coyne M.D. Cornelius P. Venditti N. Toscano D.G. Gross M.K. Toscano Jr., W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 629-637Google Scholar, 19Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Google Scholar), the active fractions from Mono-Q chromatography were further analyzed by Western blotting utilizing antibodies directed against calmodulin. The 18-kDa protein doublet, which cochromatographed with calcium-dependent inhibition, was recognized by anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1). Moreover, authentic bovine brain calmodulin both cochromatographed with the homogeneous calcium-dependent inhibitor of myocardial phospholipase A2 (utilizing identical conditions for Mono-Q chromatography) and inhibited myocardial phospholipase A2 activity in a calcium-dependent fashion. To further substantiate the identity of the calcium-dependent inhibitor of myocardial phospholipase A2 as calmodulin, W-7 agarose affinity resin was employed (20Moore P.B. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9663-9667Google Scholar). W-7 agarose beads bound the Mono-Q-purified calcium-dependent inhibitor in the presence of calcium ion, and the inhibitor was completely released by subsequent incubation with 4 m EGTA (Fig. 2A). No binding was manifest in the presence of buffer containing 4 m EGTA. The partitioning of the protein mediating calcium-dependent inhibition onto W-7 agarose in the presence of calcium ion and its subsequent release with EGTA correlated with the amount of calcium-dependent inhibition of phospholipase A2 (Fig. 2, B and C). Since the 18-kDa polypeptide, which cochromatographed with calcium-dependent inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2, was: 1) recognized by antibodies directed against calmodulin; 2) cochromatographed with authentic calmodulin; 3) bound to W-7 agarose beads in a calcium-dependent fashion; 4) possessed identical electrophoretic characteristics as authentic calmodulin; and 5) calmodulin entirely reproduced the calcium-dependent inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2, we conclude that the cytosolic protein constituent mediating calcium-dependent inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2 was calmodulin. To determine the calcium dependence of calmodulin-mediated inhibition of myocardial phospholipase A2 activity, measurements of phospholipase A2 activity were conducted with highly purified myocardial phospholipase A2 (50,000-fold purified; 10 ng of protein) and authentic calmodulin. Half-maximal inhibition was manifest at 200 n calcium ion (Fig. 2D), which closely parallels the Kd of calcium ion for calmodulin (21Crouch T.H. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3692-3698Google Scholar, 22Haiech J. Klee C.B. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3890-3897Google Scholar, 23Ogana Y. Tanokura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 19-28Google Scholar). The calcium-induced calmodulin-mediated inhibition was reversible by subsequent chelation of calcium ion. To distinguish between the potential mechanisms that were responsible for the calmodulin-induced alterations in myocardial phospholipase A2 activity (i.e. phospholipid substrate sequestration versus a direct interaction between calcium-activated calmodulin and myocardial phospholipase A2) calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography was employed (24Sharma R.K. Wang T.H. Wirch E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5916-5923Google Scholar, 25Sharma R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1152-1157Google Scholar). The application of myocardial cytosol (in buffer containing 500 µ CaCl2) to a calmodulin-Sepharose affinity column resulted in the adsorption of less than 5% of the applied protein while myocardial phospholipase A2 activity was completely adsorbed. Phospholipase A2 activity was quantitatively desorbed by application of buffer containing 4 m EGTA (Fig. 3A). The load and the void contained an identical protein banding pattern and protein masses (39 versus 38.5 mg for load and void, respectively), while the EGTA eluent contained only 0.5 mg of protein, which possessed a completely different banding pattern (Fig. 3B). Myocardial cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity applied to a calmodulin-Sepharose column in the presence of EGTA was not adsorbed, demonstrating that activated calmodulin was required for association with the myocardial phospholipase A2 catalytic complex. Moreover, 100-fold increases in substrate concentration (from 2 to 200 µ) did not attenuate calmodulin-mediated phospholipase A2 inhibition. To determine whether the interaction between activated calmodulin and myocardial phospholipase A2 present in myocardial cytosol was an inherent component of the myocardial phospholipase A2 complex, highly purified myocardial phospholipase A2 (>50,000-fold purified from the ATP affinity chromatography eluent in Ref. 2Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10633Google Scholar) was utilized. Similar to results with crude fractions, activity was quantitatively absorbed in the presence of calcium ion and desorbed by washing with 4 m EGTA. For comparison, highly purified recombinant 85-kDa calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 was not adsorbed onto calmodulin-Sepharose. To determine the biologic significance of calmodulin-mediated regulation of phospholipase A2 in intact cells, we examined the effects of three structurally disparate calmodulin antagonists on arachidonic acid release in cultures of A-10 muscle cells, a cell line that predominantly contains “calcium-independent” phospholipase A2 (14Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 166: 7227-7232Google Scholar). Exposure of prelabeled A-10 muscle cells to W-7 resulted in over an 8-fold increase in [3H]arachidonic acid release (Fig. 4). Furthermore, half-maximal effects were manifest at a concentration of W-7, which parallels the Kd for binding of W-7 by calmodulin (26Hidaka H. Yamaki T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hayashi H. Kobayashi R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 66-72Google Scholar, 27Laporte D.C. Wierman B.M. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3814-3819Google Scholar, 28Tanaka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11078-11080Google Scholar). Moreover, preincubation of A-10 muscle cells with BEL prior to the addition of W-7 ablated the release of [3H]arachidonic acid (Fig. 4). Finally, utilization of two structurally disparate calmodulin antagonists, calmidazolium and trifluoperazine, resulted in similar increases in [3H]arachidonic acid release from A-10 cells with effective concentrations that approximated the Kd for the binding of calmidazolium and trifluoperazine to calmodulin (<1 µ and ∼1 µ, respectively) (29Levin R.M. Wiess B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 690-697Google Scholar, 30Levin R.M. Wiess B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1979; 208: 454-459Google Scholar, 31Gietzen K. Biochem.

No significant differences in [3H]arachidonic acid incorporation into phospholipids were manifest in the presence of W-7. The results of this study identify the physical association of calmodulin with the myocardial phospholipase A2 catalytic complex, the role of calcium ion in facilitating this association, and the importance of this interaction in modulating phospholipase A2 activity in intact muscle cells. Since calcium ion is neither an obligatory cofactor in catalysis nor necessary for the membrane association of this enzyme (in contrast to secretory phospholipase A2 (34Dennis E.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1983: 307Google Scholar) and calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (35Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Google Scholar, 36Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Google Scholar, 37Clark J.D. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7708-7712Google Scholar)), it has traditionally been assumed that calcium ion does not play an important role in modulating the activity of this enzyme in intact cells (1Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7259-7303Google Scholar, 2Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10633Google Scholar, 3Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Google Scholar, 6Gross R.W. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 131-137Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate the importance of calcium ion and the intracellular calcium transducer, calmodulin, in regulating the activity of nominally “calcium-independent” myocardial phospholipase A2. The calmodulin antagonists resulted in release of [3H]arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipids even at ambient cytosolic calcium concentrations (≈100 n) implying that at least a portion of the calmodulin·phospholipase A2 catalytic complex is likely present in subcellular loci containing calcium ion in concentrations greater than that present in the cytosolic compartment (e.g. membranous intracellular calcium pools, subsarcolemmal locations at or near calcium channels). During the cardiac cycle, concentrations of calcium vary from 150 n during diastole to 600 n during systole (38Brandes R. Figueredo V.M. Camacho S.A. Baker A.J. Weiner M.W. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1973-1982Google Scholar, 39Thandroyen F.T. Morris A.C. Hagler H.K. Ziman B. Pai L. Willerson J.T. Buja L.M. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 810-819Google Scholar, 40Kihara Y. Grossman W. Morgan J.P. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1029-1044Google Scholar). The electrophysiologically active membrane of myocytes is highly enriched in plasmalogen molecular species (7Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 158-165Google Scholar, 8Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1662-1668Google Scholar) containing arachidonic acid (the preferred substrate of this enzyme), and nonesterified arachidonic acid is a potent modulator of ion channel function (9Piomelli D. Volterra A. Dale N. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Belardetti F. Nature. 1987; 328: 38-43Google Scholar, 10Kim D. Clapham D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11000-11004Google Scholar). Thus, these results constitute the first description of a biochemical mechanism that can mediate the cardiac cycle-dependent alterations in phospholipase A2-catalyzed liberation of arachidonic acid, thereby modulating the function of critical sarcolemmal proteins in a cardiac cycle-dependent fashion.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and share a conserved region of ∼290 amino acids. This region exhibits DNA binding activity and shows a limited sequence similarity to the DNA binding and dimerization domains of dorsal/rel/NFκB transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 23Nolan G.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 795-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Another common feature of these proteins is the presence of the repeated motifs of serine-proline residues (SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX(D/E)(D/E)) in the NH2-terminal region (20Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most (if not all) NFAT family proteins appear to undergo dephosphorylation in response to stimuli increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration. It has been suggested that they are either direct or indirect substrates for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin which is sensitive to the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506. For example, NFATp acts as an in vitro substrate of calcineurin (24Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 25McCaffrey P.G. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3747-3752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and becomes dephosphorylated upon treatment with ionomycin prior to its nuclear translocation. This dephosphorylation process is blocked by CsA and FK506 (5Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylated NFATp fails to bind to the IL-2 NFAT binding site, suggesting that CsA not only affects nuclear translocation but also DNA binding ability of NFAT family proteins (26Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that NFAT also plays an important role in production of cytokines by non-T cells of the immune system. Although originally described as a T cell-specific transcriptional factor, NFAT proteins, in particular NFATp, have been detected in several other hematopoietic cells including B cells (27Yaseen N.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) albeit with no well defined function. We have been characterizing NFAT function in human B cells and showed that B cell NFAT complex was indistinguishable from that detected in T cells (9Yaseen N.R. Park J. Kerppola T. Curran T. Sharma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6886-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Yaseen N.R. Maizel A.L. Wang F. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that CsA leads to phosphorylation of nuclear NFATp in transformed B and T cells and inhibits its DNA binding (26Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this regard, CsA has been shown to directly inhibit B cell activation elicited by anti-Ig, SAC, or ionomycin which induce Ca2+ mobilization during the signaling processes (reviewed in Ref. 33Klaus G. Transplantation. 1988; 46: 11S-14SCrossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, it also prevents TNF-α production by B cells stimulated through their surface Ig receptor (34Goldfeld A.E. Flemingtn E.K. Boussiotis V.A. Theodos C.M. Titus R.G. Strominger J.L. Speck S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12198-12201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in murine T cells, a transcription factor similar or identical to NFATp has been shown to bind to the CsA-sensitive regulatory element (κ3 element) in the TNF-α promoter (17Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35McCaffrey P.G. Goldfeld A.E. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30445-30450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NFAT appears to mediate CsA-sensitive transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α and other yet unidentified, activation-associated genes in B cells by similar mechanisms operational in T cells. To further understand the structural complexity and function of NFAT, we screened a cDNA library derived from Raji B cells to isolate a unique NFAT family protein(s). Here, we report cDNA cloning and initial characterization of a new isoform, designated NFATc.β of NFAT family member NFATc.α. 2To distinguish NFATc isoforms, we have used an arbitrary nomenclature in which NFATc previously reported by Northrop et al. (21Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) is referred to as NFATc.α. This molecule exhibits a unique expression pattern and likely plays a role in the mutually exclusive expression of cytokine genes. A cDNA library constructed in λgt10 vector was purchased from Clontech Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) and was derived from a human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji using both random and oligo(dT) primers. The cDNA library was screened under low stringency conditions using a radiolabeled DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1-1257 in the published murine NFATp sequence (18McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) as a probe. The DNA probe contained NH2-terminal of the rel similarity domain and its upstream sequence. This was obtained from murine NFATp cDNA clone (kindly provided by Drs. A. Rao and P. Hogan) by double digestion with HindIII and AccI. Positive clones were isolated by three rounds of hybridization, and inserts were subcloned into Bluescript plasmids. The clone containing the longest cDNA insert was sequenced on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and polymerase chain reaction sequencing (Promega) methods. A Northern blot with poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from multiple human tissues was purchased from Clontech Inc. For the common probe of NFATc.α and NFATc.β, we used a 467-base pair NsiI-NcoI fragment of a NFATc.β cDNA clone. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment is identical between NFATc.α and NFATc.β, and corresponds to nucleotides 383-848 in the published NFATc.α cDNA sequence (19Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and to nucleotides 180-646 in the NFATc.β cDNA of this study (Fig. 1). For the NFATc.β unique probe, we used a 418-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment encompassing the region encoding amino acids 676-814 located downstream of the rel similarity domain of NFATc.β. The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was used to quantitate the amounts of RNA loaded in each lane. DNA probes were labeled by random priming and hybridization was carried out in 5 × SSPE, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, 100 µg/ml herring sperm DNA at 42°C. The filter was washed in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature, and subsequently in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C. The same filter was used for all subsequent hybridizations. Escherichia coli expression plasmids for three deletion derivatives of NFATc.β proteins were constructed into pQE30 (Qaigen, CA) by subcloning the NFATc.β cDNA fragments, which express recombinant proteins tagged with a hexahistidine at the NH2 terminus. Using the NFATc.β cDNA clone as template, a polymerase chain reaction fragment was generated with 5′- and 3′-primers containing restriction linker sites, BamHI and KpnI, respectively, and subsequently the restricted polymerase chain reaction products subcloned into pQE30 to generate the NFATc.β (amino acids 214-814) (Fig. 4) expression vector. The other two deletion mutants, NFATc.β (amino acids 214-769) and NFATc.β (amino acids 214-703) (Fig. 4), were derived from the NFATc.β (214-814) expression plasmid by blunt end ligation of the plasmid after restriction digestion with either SmaI and EcoRV or AgeI and EcoRV, respectively. Murine NFATp expression vector pNFATpXS(1-297), constructed in pQE31 (Qaigen, CA), was kindly provided by Drs. A. Rao and J. Jain (36Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously with minor modifications (36Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Expression was induced by addition of 2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to E. coli culture at OD600 0.7-0.9, and the cultures were harvested after 4 h incubation at 37°C. The cells were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 8 M urea, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The lysates were spun in microcentrifuge for 10 min to remove insoluble particulates. Proteins were purified from the soluble fractions of the extracts with nickel-chelate resin (Ni-NTA-agarose; Qaigen). After washing the resin column with 10 mM imidazole in the same buffer, proteins were eluted with 100 mM imidazole. The eluates were dialyzed against a buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 4 M urea for 6 h, and overnight against an urea-free dialysis buffer. Proteins were stored in small aliquots at −70°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. To verify the purification, 0.2 µg of each purified protein was separated in SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purified recombinant c-Fos(1-321) and c-Jun(199-334) proteins were kindly provided by Drs. T. Curran and T. Kerppola and have been described elsewhere (37Abate C.D. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Binding reactions (16 µl) were performed with 0.16 ng to 0.3 µg of purified NFATc.β and NFATp proteins, 300 ng of poly(dI)·poly(dC), and 0.2-0.3 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotides in a binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Ficoll (Mr 400,000), 0.125 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For competition assays, 25-100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction mixtures as indicated in the figure legends. Where indicated, c-Fos and c-Jun proteins were included in the binding reaction mixtures to test their association with NFAT proteins. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction products were separated on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (27Yaseen N.R. Maizel A.L. Wang F. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in DNA binding assays were as follows: 1) human NFAT, a 30-mer containing the distal NFAT site within the human IL-2 promoter (5′-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′); 2) murine NFAT, a 33-mer containing the distal NFAT site in the murine IL-2 promoter (5′-gatcGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATACAG-3′); 3) mutant NFAT, a 30-mer containing 5 base changes at the 5′-end of the human IL-2 NFAT site (5′-GAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT 3′); 4) nonspecific oligonucleotide, a 33-mer (5′ AAGAAGGAGAAAATACCTTTTTGATTTTCACA 3′); 5) AP-1, a 24-mer containing the AP-1 binding site (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′); 6) κ3 element, a 30-mer containing the NFAT-binding site within the human TNF-α promoter (5′-gatccGAGCTCATGGGTTTCTCCACCAAGG-3′) (35McCaffrey P.G. Goldfeld A.E. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30445-30450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length coding region of NFATc.β was subcloned into the expression vector containing the SRα promoter (38Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NFATp expression vector, in which NFATp expression is under the control of the SV40 promoter, was kindly provided by Drs. A. Rao and P. Hogan (Harvard Medical School). The reporter plasmid 5B3.1, a kind gift from Dr. G. Crabtree (Stanford University), expresses chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by three IL-2 NFAT sites upstream of a minimal γ-fibrinogen promoter (39Durand D.B. Shaw J.-P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The human TNF-α promoter (−614/+20)-luciferase plasmid constructed in pGL2 basic vector was kindly provided by Dr. F. de la Brousse, Tularik, Inc. (40Nedwin G.E. Naylor S.L. Sakaguchi A.Y. Smith D. Jarrett-Nedwin J. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. Gray P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6361-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The pTKGH plasmid which expresses human growth hormone (hGH) under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter serves as an internal control for the efficiency of transfection. Exponentially growing Jurkat or Raji cells (1 × 107 cells) were transfected with 5 µg of 5B3.1 or the TNF-α promoter-luciferase plasmid, 2.5 µg of pTKGH, and 15 µg of either NFATc.β or NFATp expression vector by electroporation at 240 V, 960 microfarads. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1.5 µM ionomycin. After 8 h of treatment, the cells were harvested, and CAT and luciferase activities were determined using the established techniques. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by hGH assays using Allegro HGH kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, CA). Cloning of NFATc.β—To isolate a cDNA clone(s) which putatively encodes an NFAT family protein from B cells, we screened a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji cDNA library (approximately 7 × 105 plaques) with a cDNA probe encoding NH2-terminal and the rel similarity domain of the murine NFATp at low stringency (18McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Several positive clones were isolated and divided into two different groups closely related to NFATc.α (5 clones) and NFATp (10 clones), respectively, by initial analysis using restriction digestion and partial sequencing. Interestingly, one clone related to the NFATc.α gene showed nucleotide sequence differences in both 5′- and 3′-end regions, and further sequencing analysis of this clone, designated NFATc.β, revealed an open reading frame encoding a new protein of 827 amino acids with deduced molecular mass of 89.5 kDa that is closely related to NFATc.α previously reported by Northrop et al. (19Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). At the amino acid level, this clone displayed perfect sequence identity with NFATc.α in the region corresponding to amino acids 30-684 with the exception of 2 amino acids at positions 219(Ser) and 222(Arg) in which the corresponding amino acids of NFATc.α are Gly and Gln, respectively. The identical region includes the rel similarity domain and NH2-terminal containing the SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX(D/E)(D/E) repeat motifs that are well conserved in the NFAT family proteins, suggesting that the new NFAT family protein may play a similar biological role as other NFAT proteins (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, two unique regions were found in NFATc.β. The first NH2-terminal 29 amino acids of NFATc.β differ from that of NFATc.α and are rich in acidic amino acid content (8 of 29 amino acids), suggesting that this region may constitute a transactivation domain. Another unique region of NFATc.β is represented by an additional sequence of 142 amino acids at the COOH terminus, and this region, rich in proline residues (∼20%), shows no significant sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of other NFAT family members (Fig. 2A). Thus, the cDNA clone isolated here appears to encode a new isoform of NFATc.α that most likely resulted from alternative splicing and/or transcription from separate promoters. Expression Pattern of NFATc.β mRNA in Human Tissues Previous reports have shown that Northern analysis of NFATc using 5′-end fragments of NFATc cDNA as a probe displayed two hybridizing bands with apparent sizes of 2.7 and 4.5 kb (20Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To examine whether the new clone NFATc.β can be specifically assigned to one of these two bands, and to determine the tissue distribution of NFATc.β expression, we carried out Northern analysis of multiple human tissues using two separate probes. As expected, when a common sequence of NFATc.α and NFATc.β was used as a probe, two mRNA species with previously observed sizes were detected (Fig. 3). However, an NFATc.β unique probe corresponding to the region downstream from the rel similarity domain detected only the 4.5-kb band, indicating that this band represents NFATc.β mRNA. The 2.7-kb mRNA, on the other hand, appears to encode NFATc.α (19Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), as assessed by the reported cDNA size and its tissue distribution. The expression pattern of these two mRNA species was distinct in different tissues. NFATc.α mRNA was predominantly expressed in the thymus and peripheral leukocytes, and at lower levels in the spleen. On the other hand, NFATc.β mRNA was preferentially expressed in the spleen and at lower levels in all other tissues tested. Interestingly, its expression level was higher than that of NFATc.α in all tissues except the thymus and peripheral leukocytes. Thus, it appears that expression of these two isoforms may be differentially regulated in a cell type-specific manner. To characterize biochemical properties of NFATc.β, we generated three recombinant derivatives of NFATc.β that were tagged with a hexahistidine at the NH2 terminus. NFATc.β(214-814) contains 601 amino acids corresponding to residues 214 to 814 which include the rel similarity domain (∼290 amino acids) and most residues at the COOH terminus of NFATc.β. The other two polypeptides were derived from NFATc.β(214-814) by further truncation of the COOH terminus as shown in Fig. 4A. The NFATc.β(214-703) polypeptide is devoid of most COOH-terminal residues of NFATc.β, and thus resembles NFATc.α. A deletion derivative of NFATp, NFATpXS(1-297), which contains the rel similarity domain of NFATp (36Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was also purified and used as a positive control in DNA binding assays. The deletion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography. The same amounts (2 µg) of purified proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. As shown in Fig. 4B, the protein preparations exhibited highly purified forms although there was evidence of partial degradation in the NFATc.β(214-814) recombinant protein. Using the purified NFATc.β(214-814), we tested sequence-specific DNA binding"
https://openalex.org/W2042417337,"A new gene, RRN11, has been defined by certain rrn mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which are defective specifically in the transcription of 35 S rRNA gene by RNA polymerase I (pol I). We have cloned the gene and found that it encodes a protein of 507 amino acids. We have used a strain with the chromosomal RRN11 deleted and carrying HA1 epitope-tagged RRN11 on a plasmid to isolate a protein complex containing the protein encoded by RRN11. This protein complex complemented rrn6 mutant extracts, which were previously shown to be deficient in the essential pol I transcription factor called Rrn6/7 complex or core factor (CF). The CF complex was previously shown to consist of three proteins, the 102- and 60-kDa subunits encoded by RRN6 and RRN7, respectively, and the 66-kDa subunit. The results of the above complementation experiments combined with mobility of Rrn11p in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis relative to Rrn6p and Rrn7p led to the conclusion that RRN11 encodes the 66-kDa subunit of CF. Glutathione S-transferase-Rrn11p fusion protein was found to bind strongly to 35S-labeled Rrn6p and Rrn7p but only weakly to 35S-labeled TATA-binding protein. Similarly, glutathione S-transferase-Rrn7p fusion protein bound strongly to 35S-labeled Rrn6p and Rrn11p but only weakly to 35S-labeled TATA-binding protein. These results are consistent with the fact that one can purify CF consisting of Rrn6p, Rrn7p, and Rrn11p from yeast cell extracts, but the purified complex does not contain TATA-binding protein. RRN11 was shown to be an essential gene, and [3H]uridine pulse experiments demonstrated directly that RRN11 is essential for rDNA transcription by pol I in vivo. Thus all three subunits of CF are essential for rDNA transcription. Because of the resemblance of CF to mammalian essential pol I transcription factor SL1, the amino acid sequences of Rrn11p and the other two subunits of CF were compared with those of the three TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs) in the human SL1, TAFI48, TAFI63, and TAFI110. No significant similarity was detected between two sets of the proteins. Similarity as well as differences between CF and SL1 are discussed.

Transcription of rRNA genes is central to the overall regulation of ribosome synthesis and has been studied extensively. In eukaryotes, the genes for large rRNA (rDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: rDNAgenes for large rRNApol IRNA polymerase IUBFupstream binding factorSL1promoter selectivity factorTBPTATA-binding proteinTAFTATA-binding protein-associated factorUAFupstream activation factorCFcore factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferasekbkilobase(s)CITEcap-independent translational enhancer. are tandemly repeated in the nucleolus, and RNA polymerase I (pol I) is devoted to their transcription. For comprehensive understanding of rDNA transcription and its regulation, it is essential to identify and characterize molecular components of the transcriptional machinery that participate in rDNA transcription. Since there is some evidence that growth rate regulation of rDNA transcription takes place at the step of transcription initiation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sollner-Webb B. Tower J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 801-830Google Scholar, 2Reeder R.H. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcription Regulation.

Structures of the rRNA gene promoters appear to be similar among various eukaryotes including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The rRNA gene promoter, which covers about 150 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site and extends slightly into the transcribed region, consists of two domains, a core promoter element covering the transcription initiation site and an upstream element. In a variety of experimental systems, it has been shown that the core element is necessary and sufficient for specific initiation, while the upstream element greatly stimulates initiation. These two cis-elements probably operate in concert to achieve efficient transcription from the promoter (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sollner-Webb B. Tower J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 801-830Google Scholar, 2Reeder R.H. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcription Regulation.

Raven Press, New York1994: 83Google Scholar, 4Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 25-66Google Scholar). Regarding trans-acting protein factors, extensive studies using metazoan in vitro transcription systems have identified at least two factors, UBF and SL1 (5Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Google Scholar), also known by other names, e.g. TIF-IB (6Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Google Scholar). UBF interacts with both the upstream element and the core element and helps the binding of SL1, which enables recruitment of pol I. The genes for UBF, which is a single polypeptide, have been cloned and characterized from a variety of organisms (4Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 25-66Google Scholar, 7Jantzen H.-M. Admon A. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Nature. 1990; 344: 830-836Google Scholar). In contrast to the cellular abundance of UBF, SL1 is present in much smaller amounts (5Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Google Scholar), but its purification from human (8Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Google Scholar) and mouse (9Eberhard D. Tora L. Egly J.-M. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4180-4186Google Scholar) has been achieved, revealing the presence of TBP and three other polypeptides (TAFs). The genes for the three human TAFs have recently been cloned and sequenced, and active human SL1 has been reconstituted from these four recombinant proteins (10Comai L. Zomerdijk J.C.M.B. Beckmann H. Zhou S. Admon A. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 1966-1972Google Scholar, 11Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Beckmann H. Comai L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 2015-2018Google Scholar). Despite the impressive progress coming from these in vitro studies, however, many questions remain. For example, UBF is a DNA-binding protein with low sequence specificity (12Copenhaver G.P. Putman C.D. Denton M.L. Pikaard C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2651-2657Google Scholar, 13Hu C.H. McStay B. Jeong S.-W. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2871-2882Google Scholar) and binds not only to the upstream element but also to the core element as well as other regions of the template. Thus, the relationship between the stimulatory activity of the upstream element as a cis-element and that of UBF as a trans-factor has remained unclear. The question of how SL1, singly or together with UBF, makes pol I recruitment possible has also remained unexplored. We have been studying transcription of rDNA by pol I in the yeast S. cerevisiae using both genetic and biochemical approaches. By using a fusion gene (pGAL7-35 S rDNA), which consists of the 35 S rRNA coding region fused to the galactose-inducible GAL7 promoter (pGAL7), we isolated mutants (rrn mutants) that showed no or only very poor growth on glucose media but could grow on galactose media because of transcription of the 35 S rDNA by pol II (14Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7026-7030Google Scholar). Mutants were classified into at least 12 complementation groups defining genes whose function is specifically involved in rDNA transcription by pol I (14Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7026-7030Google Scholar, 15Thuriaux P. Mariotte S. Buhler J.-M. Sentenac A. Vu L. Lee B.-S. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24252-24257Google Scholar, 16Keys D.A. Lee B.-S.

Five of these genes, RRN1, RRN2, RRN4, RRN12, and RRN13, were shown to encode pol I-specific subunits of the polymerase, the A190, A135, A12, A43, and A49 subunits, respectively (14Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7026-7030Google Scholar, 15Thuriaux P. Mariotte S. Buhler J.-M. Sentenac A. Vu L. Lee B.-S. Nomura M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 114-122Google Scholar).2 By analyzing RRN6 and RRN7, we have previously demonstrated that these genes encode the 102- and 60-kDa subunits, respectively, of a complex (Rrn6/7 complex) that also contains another protein (p66) with an apparent molecular mass of about 66 kDa (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar). By in vitro transcription experiments using crude extracts from rrn6 or rrn7 mutant cells, it was demonstrated that the Rrn6/7 complex is essential for forming a transcription-competent preinitiation complex, but its stable binding to the promoter depends on the initial binding of some other factor(s) (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar). More recently, we have demonstrated that the stimulation of transcription by the upstream element is mediated by a multiprotein transcription factor, UAF, which contains three proteins encoded by RRN5, RRN9, and RRN10 genes, respectively, and probably two additional uncharacterized proteins. It was also found that UAF alone interacts with the upstream element and forms a stable complex, helping to recruit other factor(s) including the Rrn6/7 complex to the promoter and committing the template to transcription (16Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Google Scholar). Like the upstream element of the promoter, UAF is greatly stimulatory but not absolutely required for rDNA transcription. In contrast, the Rrn6/7 complex is essential; rDNA transcription requires the presence of the Rrn6/7 complex regardless of whether template contains the upstream element or not (16Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Google Scholar, 18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar) 3D. Lalo, J. S. Steffen, D. A. Keys, J. A. Dodd, and M. Nomura, manuscript in preparation.; that is, this complex must function in conjunction with the core element of template. Thus, we now call this complex core factor or CF. As discussed previously (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar) and also in this paper, CF interacts, although weakly, with TBP and appears to be similar to SL1 in metazoan systems. By studying a newly defined RRN gene RRN11 we have now demonstrated that this gene encodes the previously uncharacterized subunit p66 of the Rrn6/7 complex or CF. In this paper, we first describe cloning and characterization of RRN11 and then examine interactions of the three CF subunits, Rrn6p, Rrn7p, and Rrn11p among themselves and with TBP in vitro. Independently, RRN11 was also cloned and characterized by Reeder and co-workers. 4R. Reeder, personal communication. Yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in Table I and Fig. 1. The two plasmids pNOY345 and pNOY346 (see Fig. 1A) were isolated from the ATCC77164 yeast genomic library (CEN6 ARS4 TRP1) prepared from the strain YPH1 5C. Connelly and P. Hieter, personal communication. (provided by C. Connelly and P. Hieter). pNOY349 (CEN6 ARS4 TRP1 RRN11) was constructed by cloning the 2.6-kb ApaI-NheI fragment from pNOY346 into pRS314 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) between ApaI and SpeI (see Fig. 1B). pNOY350 (CEN6 ARS4 URA3 RRN11; Table I) is a derivative of pRS316 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) carrying the 2.6-kb KpnI-SacI fragment from pNOY349 cloned between KpnI and SacI sites. pNOY351 (CEN6 ARS4 TRP1 rrn11Δ::LEU2) was constructed from pNOY349 by replacing the 1.8-kb SpeI-Eco47III RRN11 fragment with the 2.2-kb XbaI-HpaI LEU2 fragment isolated from YEp351 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1993; 2: 163-167Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). pNOY354 (Table I) was constructed as follows: a NotI site was first inserted immediately upstream of the RRN11 stop codon of plasmid pNOY349 by site-directed mutagenesis as described by Kunkel et al. (21Kunkel T.D. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 362-382Google Scholar). The 0.5-kb NotI-SphI fragment, which carries the nucleotide sequence encoding three tandem copies of the HA1 epitope peptide (HA1)3 (for the exact sequence of the peptide, see Ref. 16Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Google Scholar) and part of the ADC1 terminator and was isolated from plasmid pNOY330 (16Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Google Scholar) was then inserted into the corresponding NotI-SphI sites, yielding pNOY354. Similarly, pNOY303 (Table I) was constructed in the following way: A NotI site was first created immediately downstream of the RRN7 methionine codon of pNOY3165, which is a pBluescript II KS(−) derivative carrying an RRN7 fragment between XhoI and XbaI sites, yielding pNOY3246. The 0.1-kb NotI fragment carrying (HA1)3 from the GTEP1 plasmid (22Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Google Scholar) was then inserted into the NotI site of this plasmid. Next, the KpnI-EcoRI fragment of the resultant plasmid was cloned between the corresponding KpnI and EcoRI sites of pNOY252, which carries HA1-RRN7 and is similar to pNOY209 but is a derivative of pRS314 rather than pRS316 (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar), replacing HA1-RRN7 by (HA1)3-RRN7 and yielding pNOY303.TABLE IYeast strains and plasmidsDesignationDescriptionYeast StrainsNOY418Mata ade2 ade3 ura3 leu2 lys2 can1 pNOY103 (14Nogi Y.

Similarly, pNOY3241 (Table I) was constructed by cloning the 1.5-kb NotI-SpeI fragment from plasmid pNOY355 carrying the RRN11 into pNOY3247 that was cut by NotI and XbaI. pNOY355 was constructed from pNOY349 (see Fig. 1) by creating a NotI site immediately downstream of the methionine initiation codon of the RRN11 gene using site-directed mutagenesis (21Kunkel T.D. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 362-382Google Scholar). Plasmids used to make 35S-labeled TBP, Rrn6p and Rrn11p in vitro, pNOY3171, pNOY3173, and pNOY3245, respectively (Table I), were all constructed as derivatives of pNOY3168. Plasmid pNOY3168 is a derivative of pBS(−) (Stratagene) and was constructed by inserting a 1.7-kb EcoRI-StuI fragment from pCITE™-1 vector (Novagen) between EcoRI and SmaI of pBS(−), placing this fragment carrying the CITE sequence between the T7 promoter and several cloning sites of pBS(−). Plasmid pNOY3171 carries a 1.1-kb fragment DNA inserted between the BalI and BamHI sites of pNOY3168, placing the entire TBP coding region as an open reading frame starting from the AUG codon of the CITE. The 1.1-kb DNA was derived from pAB24 (23Schmidt M.C. Kao C.C. Pei R. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7785-7789Google Scholar) and its 5′-end was created by polymerase chain reaction so that the required proper fusion took place in the final construct. Plasmid pNOY3173 was similarly constructed by inserting a 3.1-kb fragment carrying RRN6 between the BalI and PstI sites of pNOY3168, placing the entire RRN6 coding region as an open reading frame starting from the CITE AUG codon. The fusion to the CITE AUG codon was achieved by the use of polymerase chain reaction. It should be noted that the second amino acid of Rrn6p encoded by the final construct (pNOY3173) is now glycine (GGT) rather than serine (AGT) as a result of the fusion to the CITE sequence. Plasmid pNOY3245, which carries the RRN11 coding sequence fused to the CITE AUG codon, was also constructed. A 1.6-kb DNA fragment, which carries RRN11 (from the codon encoding the second amino acid) and the distal nontranslated DNA sequence present in pNOY349 (Fig. 1B), was inserted between BalI and SphI of pNOY3168. The fusion was achieved by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, which resulted in the insertion of a glycine codon (GGC) between the first ATG (for methionine) and the second TTT (for phenylalanine) codons of RRN11 in the the final construct (pNOY3245). Plasmid pNOY221 used to make 35S-labeled HA1-Rrn7p was constructed from pNOY209 (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar) by deleting the AflII-KpnI fragment. All genetic techniques are standard procedure (24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). NOY728 (Table I) was constructed by transformation of the EagI-SmaI fragment (carrying rrn11Δ::LEU2), which was obtained from plasmid pNOY351 (Fig. 1B), into NOY397, selecting Leu+. NOY729, NOY730, and NOY731 were constructed from NOY728 using pertinent plasmids as indicated in Table I. NOY732 was obtained after transformation of yeast NOY553 (same as NOY552 but Matα) (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar) with pNOY303 and eliminating the resident pNOY209 plasmid using 5-fluoroorotic acid. A complex containing (HA1)3-Rrn11p was isolated from extracts of strain NOY731 expressing (HA1)3-Rrn11p using anti-HA1 antibodies attached to protein G-Sepharose as described previously (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar). Detail of in vitro transcription reactions was also described previously (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar). Transcription extracts PC-300 (eluting from the phosphocellulose column at 300 m KCl) and D-300 (eluting from DEAE column at 300 m KCl) fractions (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar) were prepared from rrn6 deletion mutant strain NOY567. The DNA template used was a circular supercoiled DNA (pSIRT) containing a yeast rDNA minigene which generates a specific transcript of approximately 765 nucleotides that is apparently unprocessed and correctly terminated (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out for 40 min at room temperature, and radioactive RNA synthesized was analyzed by 5% urea-PAGE followed by autoradiography. GST-Rrn7p and GST-Rrn11p fusion proteins were prepared by induction of Escherichia coli strains carrying pNOY3244 and pNOY3241, respectively, with isopropyl-β—thiogalactoside, followed by affinity purification of fusion proteins using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) as described previously (25Azuma Y. Tabb M.M. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5159-5163Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled TBP, Rrn6p, Rrn7p, and Rrn11p were synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega), and pNOY3171, pNOY3173, pNOY221, and pNOY3245, respectively, were used as template (Table I; see above). These 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with GST-Rrn11p (or GST-Rrn7p or control GST), which were attached to glutathione beads and prewashed with and suspended in buffer A (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 m; MgCl2, 5 m; CaCl2, 5 m; NaCl, 200 m; Nonidet P-40, 0.1%) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 200 µl. After 1 h at room temperature, the beads were recovered and washed extensively with buffer A (without bovine serum albumin) and proteins bound were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Like many other rrn mutants (14Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7026-7030Google Scholar), three mutants were independently isolated from NOY418, which carries the GAL7-35 S rDNA fusion on a plasmid (pNOY103) as mutants that grow on galactose but not on glucose. By standard genetic crosses with other rrn mutants and with each other, we have shown that these three mutations represent a new complementation group, which now defines the RRN11 gene. We used one of the mutants (NOY727, isolation number 1016) carrying rrn11-1 to clone the RRN11 gene. The mutant cells were transformed with a yeast genomic library, and transformants with the growth characteristics of the wild type (RRN11) were isolated on glucose plates, the plasmids were recovered, and partial sequencing of isolated yeast genomic inserts showed that the region covering the RRN11 locus had already been determined as part of the yeast genome sequencing project. By constructing the plasmid pNOY349 (Fig. 1B), which complements the mutation, we were able to conclude that RRN11 corresponds to an open reading frame called YM9827.09c and is located between PRP39 and CAT2 on chromosome XIII. The amino acid sequence of Rrn11p deduced from the nucleotide sequence is shown in Fig. 2. The protein (Rrn11p) encoded by RRN11 is 507 amino acids in size with a calculated molecular weight of 59,200 and a calculated isoelectric point of 5.9. No significant homology to any sequence in the current data banks was observed. We note that the DNA sequence in the data bank indicates the presence of two Ty1 elements that are absent in the DNA fragments we recovered from the genomic library (Fig. 1A). This difference reflects a DNA polymorphism caused by transposition of Ty1 element and is consistent with the known preference of Ty1 integration near tRNA genes (26Ji H. Moore D.P.

A diploid strain (NOY728) with one wild-type copy of RRN11 and one copy completely deleted and replaced by LEU2 (Fig. 1B) was constructed and sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. Tetrad analysis showed the expected two viable and two nonviable segregation pattern at all temperatures studied, which ranged from 20 to 37°C, and cosegregation of spore viability and leucine auxotrophy, demonstrating that RRN11 is an essential gene (Fig. 1C). We constructed a haploid strain with the chromosomal RRN11 deleted and carrying the pGAL7-35 S rDNA on the pNOY103 plasmid. This strain, (NOY730) was used to examine effects of the deletion of RRN11 on rDNA transcription in vivo. The strain was grown in galactose medium, shifted to glucose medium to repress rRNA synthesis from the GAL7 promoter, and then incorporation of [3H]uridine into large rRNAs was examined and compared with the control wild-type (RRN11) strain. As shown in Fig. 3, the synthesis of large rRNAs (18 S, 25 S, and 5.8 S rRNAs and other precursor rRNAs) was not detected in the mutant in glucose medium, while the synthesis of 5 S RNA and tRNAs continued as in galactose medium (Fig. 3, lane 4 compared to lane 3). Quantitation showed that the synthesis of large rRNAs relative to 5 S RNA plus tRNAs in the mutant is less than 1% of that in the wild type. The results confirm the conclusion that RRN11 is an essential gene and is specifically required for transcription of rDNA. Based on two observations, we considered the possibility that RRN11 encodes the p66 subunit of the Rrn6/7 complex (18Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Google Scholar) (CF), the essential transcription factor containing Rrn6p, Rrn7p, and uncharacterized p66. First, the RRN11 gene is essential like RRN6 and RRN7 both for viability and for rDNA transcription in vivo and is different from RRN5, RRN9, and RRN10, which are not essential for viability and are not absolutely required for rDNA transcription, al"

In humans and mice, several abnormalities have been linked to deficiencies in Pax gene dosage, indicating that normal development is particularly sensitive to the level of Pax gene expression.

In this study we define the transactivation domains of murine Pax-2, an essential factor in kidney organogenesis.

INTRODUCTIONPax genes are defined by a 128-amino acid DNA binding motif, termed the paired domain (PD), 1The abbreviations used are: PDpaired domainHAhemagglutininCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCMVcytomegalovirus. which has been conserved in animal species ranging from sea urchin to humans (1Burri M. Tromvoukis Y. Bopp D. Frigerio G. Noll M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1183-1190Google Scholar, 2Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Google Scholar) and which was originally identified in the Drosophila gene paired (3Bopp D. Burri M. Baumgartner S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Cell. 1986; 47: 1033-1040Google Scholar). In the mouse, there are at least nine known members of the Pax family which are subdivided into classes largely based upon conservation of amino acids outside the PD (4Walther C. Guenet J.L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Google Scholar). The unique spatio-temporal expression pattern of these genes strongly suggested a role in patterning of the early mouse embryo. To underscore this hypothesis, lesions in three different Pax genes, Pax-1, −3 and −6, were found in three naturally occurring mouse mutants; undulated, splotch, and small eye, respectively (5Balling R. Deutsch U. Gruss P. Cell. 1988; 55: 531-535Google Scholar, 6Epstein D.J. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Google Scholar, 7Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L.M. Ton C.C. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T. Hastie N.D. van Heyningen V. Nature. 1992; 354: 522-525Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, each of these genes is expressed in the primordia that give rise to affected tissues in the mutants. Moreover, the abnormalities are found in heterozygotes, whereas homozygotes typically exhibit more severe phenotypes including embryonic lethality (8Stuart E.T. Kioussi C. Gruss P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 219-236Google Scholar). Together, these findings have clearly established that the Pax family of transcription factors is essential for the development of diverse tissues and organs during early patterning events in the embryo.The Pax-2 gene is required for the development of the mammalian urogenital system from the intermediate mesoderm (9Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Google Scholar, 10Sanyanusin P. Schimmenti L.A. McNoe L.A. Ward T.A. Pierpont M.E.M. Sullivan M.J. Dobyns W.B. Eccles M.R. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 358-364Google Scholar), including the specification and proper differentiation of the renal tubular epithelium from uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (11Dressler G.R. Wilkinson J.E. Rothenpieler U.W. Patterson L.T. Williams-Simons L. Westphal H. Nature. 1993; 362: 65-67Google Scholar, 12Rothenpieler U.W. Dressler G.R. Development. 1993; 119: 711-720Google Scholar). The murine Pax-2 gene encodes two proteins, Pax-2a and Pax-2b, which differ by 23 amino acids inserted in-frame in Pax-2a (13Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Google Scholar). Pax-2, −5, and −8 constitute a subfamily of Pax proteins which possesses specifically conserved amino acids within the PD as well as stretches of homology within the COOH terminus. Among these are a conserved octapeptide, a region rich in proline, serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (PSTY), and the first two helices of the paired type homeodomain. Experiments with Pax-5 have shown that the truncated homeodomain does not bind DNA (14Adams B. Doerfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Google Scholar) and that DNA recognition is mediated exclusively by the PD, which consists of NH2- and COOH-terminal subdomains, each capable of binding distinct regions within recognition sequences in vitro (15Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Google Scholar). DNA recognition sequences for the PD of the Pax-2, −5, and −8 subfamily have been described (15Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Google Scholar, 16Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 381-391Google Scholar, 17Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Google Scholar), and a number of genes are now known to be positively and negatively regulated by Pax-5 (14Adams B. Doerfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Google Scholar, 15Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Google Scholar) and Pax-8 (19Holst B.D. Goomer R.S. Wood I.C. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22245-22252Google Scholar, 20Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. DiLauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar). Apart from DNA binding properties, however, relatively little is known about the biochemistry of Pax protein transcription.To understand how the Pax-2 protein acts as a transcription regulator, we examined the COOH-terminal regions of Pax-2, which confer transcriptional activation or repression. Extensive deletion and mutation analysis was used to delineate domains that are responsible for transcriptional regulatory properties of Pax-2 in transfected cells. Full activation required multiple COOH-terminal regions that were essential but not sufficient by themselves. Surprisingly, the octapeptide sequence acts as a repressor of activation potential, both within the context of the Pax-2 PD and the heterologous GAL4 DNA binding domain.RESULTSTo delineate the domains responsible for the transcription regulatory functions of Pax-2 we first generated a set of COOH-terminal deletions depicted in Fig. 1A. A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was incorporated at the COOH terminus of each construct to facilitate isolation and identification of the recombinant proteins. The transactivation potential was then assessed in transient transfections using a CAT reporter construct that contained five tandem copies of a Pax-2 binding site, PRS4 (16Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 381-391Google Scholar), upstream of a minimal promoter. A summary of the data obtained from experiments performed in P19 cells is presented in Fig. 1A. Similar results were obtained with NIH 3T3 and 293 cells (data not shown). Full-length Pax-2a and −2b proteins (1-415) stimulated transcription 11-fold and 9.3-fold, respectively, above that observed with control plasmid. Transactivation was abolished by deletions after the PD or amino acid 204, demonstrating that the transactivation potential of Pax-2, like other Pax proteins (20Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. DiLauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar, 26Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Google Scholar, 27Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dörfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Google Scholar), resides within the COOH terminus and includes the PSTY region. Deletion of the last 40 amino acids reduced transactivation by approximately 10%, whereas larger deletions of Pax-2 resulted in much less potent transactivators. For example, constructs encoding amino acids 1-279 or 1-333 gave roughly a 2-fold increase in transcription above background, indicating that amino acids between 279 and 373 are essential for maximum Pax-2 transactivation. Transactivation was not observed using reporters devoid of Pax-2 binding sites.We next constructed a series of internal deletions, depicted in Fig. 1B. As expected, deletion of the PD completely eliminated the transactivation activity of the Pax-2 protein. Analysis of deletions in the COOH-terminal portion which keep the PD intact revealed that amino acids 278-415 were required to restore transactivation activity to levels observed with the full-length Pax-2 proteins. Interestingly, proteins that included additional residues between 197 and 278 activated transcription 24-32-fold, which was two to four times higher than that achieved with the full-length protein. These data indicated that a region containing amino acids 197-278 positively contributed to Pax-2 transactivation potential and suggested that a negatively acting domain lay within amino acids 144-197. This finding was supported by experiments with construct 1-204:278-415, which yielded only 2.3-fold activation compared with 12.5-fold for the 1-144:278-415 construct. This series of experiments also showed that amino acids 374-415 at the very COOH terminus of Pax-2 contribute to transactivation as activity was significantly reduced for constructs encoding amino acids up to residue 373, although this reduction was not as dramatic in the COOH-terminal deletions. Constructs encoding amino acids 1-329:349-415 activated transcription 9-14-fold, similar to that of full-length Pax-2. However, as described above, COOH-terminal deletions 1-333 activated 1.5-2.5-fold, further demonstrating the contribution by the last 40-65 amino acids of Pax-2. Taken together these data indicate that amino acids 278-373 are necessary, but not sufficient, for Pax-2 transactivation activity and that additional residues between amino acids 197 and 415 are required.To verify that these proteins were properly expressed, Western blot analyses were performed on extracts from transiently transfected cells. Fig. 2, A-C, shows typical results obtained using an anti-Pax-2 antiserum. The Pax-2 antiserum was raised against a COOH-terminal fragment and therefore does not recognize Pax-2 proteins truncated after amino acid 204. It also reacted weakly with proteins containing only amino acids 338-415 of the COOH terminus, indicating that the major determinants for Pax-2 antiserum recognition lie between amino acids 204 and 338. However, these proteins could be detected in Western blots using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (data not shown). Although a slight variation was observed in protein expression levels, this did not correlate with the transactivation activity. In fact, many of the deletion mutants showed equal or greater amounts of Pax-2 protein compared with wild type Pax-2a or Pax-2b. Thus, the reduced levels of transactivation observed with the mutants are not due to increased protein instability. The results also illustrate that the 23 amino acids encoded by the additional exon in Pax-2a are unlikely to play a major role in transactivation.The site-specific DNA binding activity of these proteins was assessed in gel mobility shift assays, and none of the proteins tested exhibited reduced DNA binding activity, except for the deletion just after the PD (1-144). Typical results from assays using the H2A-2.2 binding site (14Adams B. Doerfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Google Scholar) for COOH-terminal and internal deletions are shown in Fig. 2, D and E, respectively. Identical results were obtained using the PRS4 binding site which is present in the reporter plasmid used to assay Pax-2 transactivation (data not shown). DNA-protein complexes were formed efficiently in each case, and the specificity of these complexes was verified by competition and antibody supershift experiments (data not shown). Many of the proteins defective in transactivation bound DNA to an extent equal to or greater than that of the wild type Pax-2 proteins, further illustrating that reductions in transactivation were not due to reduced protein levels. The faster migrating complexes found with full-length and COOH-terminal deletions of Pax-2 were determined to be the result of proteolytic cleavage after the PD and near amino acid 200 which occur during the extraction procedure. Note that the DNA-protein complexes marked with an asterisk (Fig. 2D) do not change in mobility as the COOH-terminal deletions increase and that the 1-204 protein (Fig. 2E) migrates at that same position. In addition, we have examined the localization of these proteins by indirect immunofluorescence and confirmed their nuclear localization (data not shown). With one exception, these data show that the deficiencies in transactivation by mutant Pax-2 proteins were not due to improper expression nor their failure to bind target DNA.Since the transactivation activity increased in deletion mutants that spanned the conserved octapeptide we made substitution mutants by replacing the eight wild type amino acids in this element with unrelated amino acids. Experiments performed with these octapeptide mutants showed a 2-3-fold increase in transactivation compared with wild type Pax-2 (Fig. 3A), which was similar to the increase observed for deletions covering the octapeptide region. These results demonstrate that the elimination of the octapeptide sequence was responsible for the increase in Pax-2 transactivation and suggest that this region acts to down-modulate Pax-2 activity. To test this possibility further, the octapeptide region in Pax-8, which is closely related to Pax-2 and recognizes similar DNA target sequences, was deleted. When tested in transient transfection assays, the activation potential of Pax-8 was also elevated 2-3-fold in the deleted version (Fig. 3A). The increase in transactivation was also demonstrated by using increasing amounts of effector plasmids (Fig. 3B), indicating that these effects were dose-dependent. This experiment also showed that Pax-2 and −8 did not exhibit a decrease in transactivation potential at high effector concentrations, which has been observed for Pax-6 (2Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Google Scholar) and Pax-3 (26Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Google Scholar), and may indicate that different mechanisms of transactivation are utilized by these classes of Pax proteins.Fig. 3The octapeptide motif down-regulates the transcriptional activation activity of Pax-2 and Pax-8. Panel A, a schematic diagram of mutant Pax-2 and Pax-8 proteins is shown to the left and transcriptional activation activity to the right. The octapeptide (O) is boxed in gray for the wild type sequence (Pax-2: Tyr-Ser-Ile-Asn-Gly-Ile-Leu-Gly; Pax-8: Tyr-Ser-Ile-Asn-Gly-Leu-Leu-Gly). The checkered box indicates octapeptide substitution mutants (Pax-2a: Asp-Pro-Val-Ala-Leu-Ala-Arg-Gly; Pax-2b: Asn-Asp-Pro-Val-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly). Other features of the Pax proteins are as indicated in Fig. 1. Recombinant Pax-2 and Pax-8 expression constructs (4 µg) were cotransfected into P19 cells with PRS4-CAT reporter construct (1 µg) and assayed for CAT activity 48 h later. Constructs were examined in at least three independent experiments, and the mean value for activation activity is shown relative to control expression plasmid, which was assigned a value of 1.0. Panel B, plot of CAT activity, expressed as fold activation (y axis), versus the amount of Pax effector plasmid transfected (x axis). For each transfection the amount of CMV-based expression plasmid was kept constant by adding in pCB6+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To verify the assignment of transactivation domains made by the experiments described above, chimera were generated between the heterologous DNA binding domain of GAL4 and various portions of the Pax-2 COOH terminus. A diagram of the chimeric constructs and a summary of the results from these experiments are presented in Fig. 4. A region spanning amino acids 197-415 of Pax-2 was capable of activating transcription 48-61-fold over that of the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone. In comparison, a similar region from human PAX-6 which was previously shown to act as an independent transactivation domain (22Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edwards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 463-471Google Scholar) stimulated transcription 15-fold, whereas an activation domain from GAL4 (21Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Google Scholar) gave nearly 57-fold activation in these studies. Thus the COOH terminus of Pax-2 contains a strong transactivation domain that can function on a heterologous DNA binding domain. Deletions made within the Pax-2 COOH-terminal fragment sharply reduce transactivation potential. For example, GAL4:278-415 and GAL4:197-373a possess 8-fold and 27-fold activity, respectively, underscoring the importance of residues flanking amino acids 278-373.Several of the GAL4 chimera were then used to test the effect of reintroducing the octapeptide sequence. Addition of the octapeptide to two different Pax-2 chimera, GAL4:278-415 and GAL4:197-415b, resulted in a roughly 2-4-fold decrease in transactivation (Fig. 4). As a control, an unrelated stretch of amino acids placed within the same position showed no reduction in transactivation. Activation by a chimera bearing two copies of the octapeptide was reduced almost 20-fold, dramatically demonstrating that the level of repression correlated with the number of octapeptide sequences. To examine the effect of the octapeptide in another context we introduced the Pax-2 octapeptide sequence between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the Pax-6 transactivation domain. The octapeptide reduced transactivation from 15- to 2.2-fold in the Pax-6 chimera. Note that the Pax-6 protein does not normally contain the octapeptide. These results suggest that the octapeptide can act as a repressor domain and that its effects are additive.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have utilized a series of deletion mutants to define the regions of Pax-2 which underlie its transcriptional regulatory properties. We find that full transactivation by Pax-2 requires a COOH-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 197-415 which encompasses the partial homeodomain and the PSTY region. A smaller region within this fragment, namely amino acids 350-373, appears to be essential for transactivation activity. This result is consistent with findings from a previous report which showed that a Pax-2 protein truncated at amino acid 349 was unable to activate transcription (16Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 381-391Google Scholar). Studies of Pax-3 (26Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Google Scholar), Pax-6 (3Bopp D. Burri M. Baumgartner S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Cell. 1986; 47: 1033-1040Google Scholar, 22Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edwards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 463-471Google Scholar), and Pax-8 (27Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dörfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Google Scholar) have also found that portions of the COOH terminus are required for transactivation, and each of these regions is characteristically rich in proline, serine, and threonine residues. Examination of the primary amino acid sequence in these regions shows no clear stretches of homology apart from some short sequences conserved between Pax-2 and Pax-8 which do not possess any obvious structural or functional motifs. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that multiple regions are essential for full transactivation and suggest that several domains act in concert either through conformational effects or by additive interactions with other proteins.This report also demonstrates that the Pax-2 and Pax-8 octapeptides act as transcriptional repressor domains. How this small element functions is presently unknown, although its ability to repress within a heterologous context suggests that it acts as an independent domain. The presence or absence of the octapeptide did not correlate with protein levels observed in this study (see for example Fig. 2C). Chalepakis et al. (28Chalepakis G. Goulding M. Read A. Strachan T. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3685-3689Google Scholar) observed dimerization of truncated Pax-3 proteins and suggested that sequences around the octapeptide may mediate dimer formation. These Pax-3 dimers were dependent in part on the alignment of half-sites in the DNA recognition sequence and thus may be mediated by DNA binding to specific sequences that allow association of two proteins on the DNA target. No evidence of dimerization was observed with full-length Pax-3 proteins (28Chalepakis G. Goulding M. Read A. Strachan T. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3685-3689Google Scholar). In our experiments, Pax-2 bound as a monomer to a single DNA site (H2A-2.2). This is evident by the single protein-DNA complex when intact, full-length Pax-2 is bound (for example, see Fig. 2E) and agrees with previous studies using Pax-2 (13Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Google Scholar, 16Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 381-391Google Scholar, 18Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Google Scholar). Furthermore, mixing experiments using full-length and truncated Pax-2 bound to H2A-2.2 do not show any intermediate complexes indicative of heterodimer formation (data not shown).The dosage effect of the octapeptide sequence, resulting in nearly 20-fold repression with two copies, and the fact that a similar insertion of unrelated amino acids does not alter transactivation support the view that the downstream transactivation domains are not disrupted by the octapeptide. This element could affect the way in which Pax proteins interact with other factors involved in transcription, and this may determine the efficiency of transactivation. The octapeptide element appears to act in cis in that we have failed to find repression of transactivation in trans by the octapeptide in cotransfection experiments. This indicates that its function is specific to the protein in which it is contained. Down-modulation of Pax transcriptional activation in vivo by the octapeptide could conceivably establish a threshold of Pax function which is acutely affected by gene dosage or haploinsufficiency.Since multiple COOH-terminal domains contribute to transcriptional activity it is unlikely that single amino acid substitutions would completely inactivate Pax-2 and lead to a true loss of function. Indeed, the majority of Pax mutations described to date eliminate the DNA binding activity of the PD or result in large deletions of the COOH terminus which is consistent with this hypothesis (5Balling R.

One example for Pax-2 has recently been described in which a family displaying renal abnormalities carries a mutation leading to a truncated protein with an altered octapeptide (10Sanyanusin P. Schimmenti L.A. McNoe L.A. Ward T.A. Pierpont M.E.M. Sullivan M.J. Dobyns W.B. Eccles M.R. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 358-364Google Scholar). It is possible that point mutations in the COOH terminus have subtle consequences on Pax-2 activity which cannot be easily detected phenotypically. On the other hand, the possibility that a specific mutation in the COOH terminus could completely inactivate Pax-2 cannot be ruled out, and further characterization of naturally occurring mutations in Pax-2 and other Pax genes will help to clarify this question. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that our studies utilized an artificial Pax-2 reporter, and it will be important to evaluate the activity of Pax-2 mutants on endogenous targets of Pax-2 regulation, such as the recently identified candidates p53 (31Stuart E.T. Haffner R. Oren M. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5638-5645Google Scholar) and En-2 (32Song D.-L. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Joyner A.L. Development. 1996; 122: 627-635Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONPax genes are defined by a 128-amino acid DNA binding motif, termed the paired domain (PD), 1The abbreviations used are: PDpaired domainHAhemagglutininCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCMVcytomegalovirus. which has been conserved in animal species ranging from sea urchin to humans (1Burri M. Tromvoukis Y. Bopp D. Frigerio G. Noll M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1183-1190Google Scholar, 2Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Google Scholar) and which was originally identified in the Drosophila gene paired (3Bopp D. Burri M. Baumgartner S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Cell. 1986; 47: 1033-1040Google Scholar). In the mouse, there are at least nine known members of the Pax family which are subdivided into classes largely based upon conservation of amino acids outside the PD (4Walther C. Guenet J.L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Google Scholar). The unique spatio-temporal expression pattern of these genes strongly suggested a role in patterning of the early mouse embryo. To underscore this hypothesis, lesions in three different Pax genes, Pax-1, −3 and −6, were found in three naturally occurring mouse mutants; undulated, splotch, and small eye, respectively (5Balling R. Deutsch U. Gruss P. Cell. 1988; 55: 531-535Google Scholar, 6Epstein D.J. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Google Scholar, 7Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L.M. Ton C.C. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T. Hastie N.D. van Heyningen V. Nature. 1992; 354: 522-525Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, each of these genes is expressed in the primordia that give rise to affected tissues in the mutants. Moreover, the abnormalities are found in heterozygotes, whereas homozygotes typically exhibit more severe phenotypes including embryonic lethality (8Stuart E.T. Kioussi C. Gruss P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 219-236Google Scholar). Together, these findings have clearly established that the Pax family of transcription factors is essential for the development of diverse tissues and organs during early patterning events in the embryo.The Pax-2 gene is required for the development of the mammalian urogenital system from the intermediate mesoderm (9Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Google Scholar, 10Sanyanusin P. Schimmenti L.A. McNoe L.A. Ward T.A. Pierpont M.E.M. Sullivan M.J. Dobyns W.B. Eccles M.R. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 358-364Google Scholar), including the specification and proper differentiation of the renal tubular epithelium from uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (11Dressler G.R. Wilkinson J.E. Rothenpieler U.W. Patterson L.T. Williams-Simons L. Westphal H. Nature. 1993; 362: 65-67Google Scholar, 12Rothenpieler U.W. Dressler G.R. Development. 1993; 119: 711-720Google Scholar). The murine Pax-2 gene encodes two proteins, Pax-2a and Pax-2b, which differ by 23 amino acids inserted in-frame in Pax-2a (13Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Google Scholar). Pax-2, −5, and −8 constitute a subfamily of Pax proteins which possesses specifically conserved amino acids within the PD as well as stretches of homology within the COOH terminus. Among these are a conserved octapeptide, a region rich in proline, serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (PSTY), and the first two helices of the paired type homeodomain. Experiments with Pax-5 have shown that the truncated homeodomain does not bind DNA (14Adams B. Doerfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Google Scholar) and that DNA recognition is mediated exclusively by the PD, which consists of NH2- and COOH-terminal subdomains, each capable of binding distinct regions within recognition sequences in vitro (15Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Google Scholar). DNA recognition sequences for the PD of the Pax-2, −5, and −8 subfamily have been described (15Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Google Scholar, 16Fickenscher H.R. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 381-391Google Scholar, 17Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Google Scholar), and a number of genes are now known to be positively and negatively regulated by Pax-5 (14Adams B. Doerfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Google Scholar, 15Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Google Scholar) and Pax-8 (19Holst B.D. Goomer R.S. Wood I.C. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22245-22252Google Scholar, 20Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. DiLauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar). Apart from DNA binding properties, however, relatively little is known about the biochemistry of Pax protein transcription.To understand how the Pax-2 protein acts as a transcription regulator, we examined the COOH-terminal regions of Pax-2, which confer transcriptional activation or repression. Extensive deletion and mutation analysis was used to delineate domains that are responsible for transcriptional regulatory properties of Pax-2 in transfected cells. Full activation required multiple COOH-terminal regions that were essential but not sufficient by themselves. Surprisingly, the octapeptide sequence acts as a repressor of activation potential, both within the context of the Pax-2 PD and the heterologous GAL4 DNA binding domain."

Early studies from other laboratories demonstrated that cyclic AMP (cAMP) antagonizes the mitogenic effects of platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs; p42, p44) group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in several cell types. This report examines the role of ERKs and Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) groups of mitogen-activated protein kinases in thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in VSMCs using agents such as forskolin and dibutyrylcyclic AMP that increase intracellular cAMP levels. Both agents significantly inhibited thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMCs. These agents, however, had no effect on thrombin induction of ERKs activation and c-Fos expression, suggesting divergence of the latter two events from the growth-signaling events of thrombin that are sensitive to inhibition by cAMP. Thrombin activated JNK1 and induced c-Jun expression in VSMCs in a time-dependent manner. In contrast to ERKs and c-Fos, thrombin-induced JNK1 activation and c-Jun expression were sensitive to inhibition by forskolin, suggesting an association of these events with thrombin-stimulated growth in these cells. Thrombin also increased AP-1 activity, and this response was significantly blunted by forskolin.

Cultured skin fibroblasts from two unrelated individuals (OI-197 and OI-165) with the typical features of OI type IB produced shortened α2(I) chains. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the α2(I)-cDNA revealed deletions in the triple helical domain of 5 exons (exons 7-11) in OI-197, and 8 exons (exons 10-17) in OI-165. This exon skipping was caused by genomic deletions in one allele of COL1A2 with the breakpoints located in introns 6 and 11 in OI-197, and introns 9 and 17 in OI-165. The secretion and deposition of the mutant collagen into the matrix was measured in vitro in cultures of skin fibroblasts and bone osteoblasts, grown in the presence of ascorbic acid to induce collagen matrix formation and maturation, as well as in collagen extracts from skin and bone. The secretion of mutant collagen was impaired and long term cultures of fibroblasts showed that the mutant collagen was not incorporated into the mature collagenous matrix produced in vitro by skin fibroblasts from both patients. Likewise, the shortened α2(I) chain was not demonstrable in skin extracts. In contrast, bone extracts from OI-197 showed the presence of the mutant collagen. This incorporation of the abnormal collagen into the mature matrix was also demonstrated in long term cultures of the patient's osteoblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2006655316,"In order to delineate structural motifs regulating substrate affinity and recognition for the human dopamine transporter (DAT), we assessed [3H]dopamine uptake kinetics and [3H]CFT binding characteristics of COS-7 cells transiently expressing mutant DATs in which the COOH terminus was truncated or substituted. Complete truncation of the carboxyl tail from Ser582 allowed for the expression of biphasic [3H]dopamine uptake kinetics displaying both a low capacity (Vmax∼0.4 pmol/105 cells/min) high affinity (Km ∼300 nM) component and one exhibiting low affinity (Km ∼15 µM] and high capacity (Vmax∼5 pmol/105cells/min) with a concomitant 40% decrease in overall apparent Vmax relative to wild type (WT) DAT. Truncation of the last 22 amino acids or substitution of the DAT-COOH tail with sequences encoding the intracellular carboxyl-terminal of either dopamine D1 or D5 receptors produced results that were identical to those with the fully truncated DAT, suggesting that the induction of biphasic dopamine uptake kinetics is likely conferred by removal of DAT-specific sequence motifs distal to Pro597. The attenuation of WT transport activity, either by lowering levels of DAT expression or by pretreatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 µM), did not affect the kinetics of [3H]dopamine transport. The estimated affinity of dopamine (Ki ∼180 nM) for all truncated/substituted DAT mutants was 10-fold lower than that of WT DAT (∼2000 nM) and appears selective for the endogenous substrate, since the estimated inhibitory constants for numerous putative substrates or uptake inhibitors were virtually identical to those obtained for WT DATs. In marked contrast, DAT truncation/substitution mutants displayed significantly reduced high affinity [3H]CFT binding interactions with estimated Ki values for dopamine and numerous other substrates and inhibitors tested from 10-100-fold lower than that observed for WT DAT. Moreover, co-expression of truncated and/or substituted DATs with WT transporter failed to reconstitute functional or pharmacological activities associated with both transporters. Instead, complete restoration of uniphasic low affinity [3H]dopamine uptake kinetics (Km ∼2000 nM) and high affinity substrate and inhibitor [3H]CFT binding interactions attributable to WT DATs were evident. These data clearly suggest the functional independence and differential regulation of the dopamine translocation process from the characteristics exhibited by its ligand binding domain. The lack of functional phenotypic expression of mutant DAT activities in cells co-expressing WT transporter is consistent with the contention that native DATs may exist as multisubunit complexes, the formation and maintenance of which is dependent upon sequences encoded within the carboxyl tail.

This is now seen to be a bradytrophy, rather than an absolute auxotrophy, since lack of Cys merely imposed a growth lag and escape from this growth lag did not involve genetic reversion. This Cys bradytrophy was not seen in the SOD-competent parental strain, and it was relieved by a cell-permeant mimic of SOD activity; hence, it was due to 2. It was also relieved by an osmolyte, such as sucrose; hence, it appears due to leakage from the cell of some component needed for Cys biosynthesis. Medium conditioned by the aerobic growth of the SOD-defective strain relieved the growth lag. Bioassays with Cys mutants suggested that the conditioned medium contained SO3−3 or its equivalent, and sulfite per se was able to eliminate the growth lag. However, some component of the conditioned medium reacted with added sulfite and interfered with attempts to assay for it colorimetrically.These results suggest that the cell envelope of the SOD-defective strain was weakened, directly or indirectly, by O2 and then leaked sulfite.

https://openalex.org/W2001370192,"We recently reported that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induces a novel form of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy characterized by an increase in protein content but an absence of the fetal program of skeletal α-actin or β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) gene expression (Palmer, J. N., Hartogensis, W. E., Patten, M., Fortuin, F. D., and Long, C. S. (1995) J. Clin. Invest. 95, 2555-2564). Because of the apparent disparity between this myocardial phenotype and that seen with other hypertrophic agents in culture, such as catecholamines, we investigated the effect of IL-1β on α1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Although there was no augmentation in total protein when IL-1β and phenylephrine were given simultaneously, IL-1β attenuated the increase in contractile protein mRNAs (skeletal α-actin and β-MHC) in response to phenylephrine. Transient transfection studies with skeletal α-actin and β-MHC promoter constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-reporter gene indicate that repression occurred at the level of gene transcription. In view of the previously reported activity of the zinc finger protein YY1 in the negative regulation of the skeletal α-actin promoter in cardiomyocytes (MacLellan, W. R., Lee, T. C., Schwartz, R. J., and Schneider, M. D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16754-16760), we investigated the potential role of this factor in the IL-1β-mediated effects. Using transient transfection, we found that a mutation in the YY1 binding site of the skeletal α-actin promoter abolished the inhibitory effect of IL-1β. We further found that the 127-base pair fragment of the skeletal α-actin promoter required for the IL-1β effect is also required for inhibition by the overexpression of YY1 in the myocytes. Furthermore, increased levels of YY1 protein are found in IL-1β treated myocytes. Taken together these results suggest that the repression of contractile protein gene transcription by IL-1β may be due, at least in part, to activation of the negative transcription factor YY1.

Cytokines may play an important role in the cardiovascular dysfunction observed during inflammatory myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiac allograft rejection (1Wu C.J. Lovett M. Wong L.J. Moeller F. Kitamura M. Goralski T.J. Billingham M.E. Starnes V.A. Clayberger C. Transplantation. 1992; 54: 326-332Google Scholar, 2Lange L. Schreiner G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 145-151Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the inflammatory response associated with these pathophysiological states results from the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocyte/macrophages, which leads to the transient suppression of cardiac contractility (3Finkel M. Oddis C. Jacob T. Watkins S. Hattler B. Simmons R. Science. 1992; 257: 387-389Google Scholar). Similar reversible negative inotropic effects are also observed during the reperfusion phase following myocardial infarction or cardiopulmonary bypass, commonly referred to as “stunned myocardium” (4Engler R. Cowell J.W. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 20-28Google Scholar, 5Westlin W. Mullane K.M. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1828-1836Google Scholar, 6Nose P.S. J. Cardiovasc. Surg. (Torino). 1993; 8 (Suppl. 2): 305-308Google Scholar). Taken together, such observations have led to the suggestion that cytokines could be, at least in part, responsible for stunning (7Finkel M.S. Hoffman R.A. Shen L. Oddis C.V. Simmons R.L. Hattler B.G. Am. J. Cardiol. 1993; 71: 1231-1232Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that cytokine-induced myocardial depression is due to alterations in intracellular calcium regulation, with both abnormal channel activity and myofilament calcium sensitivity being reported (8Kinugawa K.-I. Takahashi T. Kohmoto O. Yao A. Aoyagi T. Momomura S.-I. Hirata Y. Serizawa T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 285-295Google Scholar, 9Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D. J. Clin.

Since the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of the myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA 2a) plays a major role in the regulation of myocyte calcium homeostasis, it too could play an important role in the myocyte response to cytokines (11Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1093-1099Google Scholar). Since increased catecholamine levels are a major cause of both increased contractility and intracellular Ca2+, it is noteworthy that cytokines are able to modulate adrenergic stimulation in the heart. For instance, after treatment with IL-1β, myocytes exposed to catecholamines show an inhibition of the β-adrenergic mediated increase in cyclic AMP content and an uncoupling of adenylate cyclase from the β-receptor (12Gulick T. Chung M. Pieper S. Schreiner G. Lange L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 1-9Google Scholar, 13Chung M. Gulick T. Rotondo R. Schreiner G. Lange L. Circ.

In addition, observations in systemic blood vessels demonstrate that IL-1β can induce relaxation after precontraction with the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (14Petitclerc E. Abel S. DeBlois D.

We demonstrated recently that IL-1β induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy while inhibiting cardiac fibroblast proliferation. This myocyte hypertrophy is associated with an increase in total protein content and the re-initiation of DNA synthesis. Despite the increase in protein, however, no enhanced expression of contractile protein mRNA in myocytes could be detected after 48 h of IL-1β treatment (18Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Google Scholar). This is in marked contrast to other forms of hypertrophy induced by catecholamines, vasoactive peptides, or other peptide growth factors, which are accompanied by characteristic changes in contractile protein isogene expression (19Bishopric N.H. Simpson P.C. Ordahl C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1194-1199Google Scholar, 20Waspe L.E. Ordahl C.P. Simpson P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1206-1214Google Scholar, 21Parker T.G. Packer S.E.

A. 1990; 87: 7066-7070Google Scholar) and suggests that IL-1β may induce an even more “primitive” developmental phenotype than these other agents. Using the α1-adrenergic model of myocardial hypertrophy, we and others have shown previously that stimulation with norepinephrine results in the preferential up-regulation of skeletal α-actin, β-MHC, and atrial natriuretic factor gene expression (the “fetal/neonatal program”), while the cardiac α-actin and α-MHC isogenes, predominantly expressed in the adult heart, are not activated. This specific isogene switching is reflected by changes in both mRNA and protein levels and is the direct result of action at the transcriptional level (23Long C.S. Ordahl C.P. Simpson P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1078-1082Google Scholar, 24Lee H.R. Henderson S.A. Reynolds R. Dunnmon P. Yuan D. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7352-7358Google Scholar). Using transient transfection of a series of promoter constructs for the skeletal α-actin and β-MHC genes, our co-workers have identified both potential second messenger signaling pathways and the minimal promoter elements required for α1-adrenoreceptor-mediated induction of these two genes (25Kariya K. Farrance I.K.G. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26658-26662Google Scholar, 26Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar). In view of the antagonistic effects of cytokines on adrenergic signaling in vivo and our observations on the failure of IL-1β to induce the fetal program of gene transcription, we hypothesized that IL-1β could act as a negative modulator of the myocyte proteins regulated by catecholamines. Accordingly, we co-treated neonatal cardiac myocytes with the α1-agonist phenylephrine and IL-1β to examine a possible effect of IL-1β on myocyte gene expression. Our results show that IL-1β acts as a negative regulator of α1-adrenergic induced skeletal α-actin and β-MHC gene expression. This repression is a direct result of action at the transcriptional level and may involve the bifunctional transcription factor YY1. To our knowledge this is the first report on the active repression of an induced cardiomyocyte phenotype in culture. Furthermore, these findings may provide a mechanism for the reported negative inotropic effect of cytokines such as IL-1β on myocardial function in vivo and may provide new insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for the expression of the differentiated phenotype by cardiac myocytes. The promoter constructs for rat β-MHC and mouse skeletal α-actin driving the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene were used as described previously (26Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar, 27Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3775-3782Google Scholar).

The chicken β-actin-CAT plasmid was obtained from J. Mar and C. Ordahl (29Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6404-6408Google Scholar) and the c-fos-CAT construct from G. M. Cooper (30Cai H. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Google Scholar). The chicken skeletal α-actin promoter (−394 to +24) linked to the firefly luciferase gene with and without mutations in the YY1 binding sequence and the YY1-expression vector were kindly provided by M. Schneider and R. J. Schwartz (31MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Google Scholar, 32Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052Google Scholar), respectively. The SV40-SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase) reporter plasmid was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The −113 skeletal α-actin mutant was generated by PCR using site-directed mutagenesis of the parent construct. The mutated 5′ oligonucleotide, 5′-GAGCTCGGTACCCACTCTAGTGCCCGACACCCAAATATGGCgcGGGAAGGG-3′, and a 3′ oligonucleotide complementary to the SP6 polymerase binding site were amplified, cut with KpnI and XmaI, and subcloned into −46-skAct-CAT generated from SP64-CAT (26Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar), thus recreating a YY1 site in the −113 construct. The incorporation of the mutated sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing on an automated sequencer (Biomolecular Research Core, University of California San Francisco). Low density (150-200 cells/mm2) primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were established and maintained in 60-mm dishes as described previously (33Long C.S. Henrich C.J. Simpson P.C. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1081-1095Google Scholar). Contaminating fibroblasts were <10% of total cell number. Twenty-four hours after plating, medium was changed to minimum Eagle's medium with Hanks' salts containing 5% calf serum and 30 m HEPES, pH 7.5. Duplicate dishes were transfected using the CaPO4 method (26Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of CAT-reporter plasmids (1.8 pmol, 5-8 µg) or luciferase-reporter constructs (7.5 µg) were transfected together with variable amounts of salmon sperm DNA to adust total DNA to 25 µg/dish. In co-expression experiments, 2 µg of the YY1-EMSV expression vector were used. SV40-SEAP plasmid (0.04 pmol, 0.2 µg) was included in all dishes to correct for transfection efficiency. After 2 h the CaPO4 precipitate was removed from the cells, and the medium was changed to serum-free medium (minimum Eagle's medium) supplemented with porcine insulin (10 µg/ml) (Lilly), bovine transferrin (10 µg/ml) (HyClone, Logan, UT), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) (Intergen number 3130-00, Armour Pharmaceutical, Kankakee, IL), and bromodeoxyuridine (0.1 m) (Sigma). After overnight incubation, fresh serum-free medium was added, and the cells were treated with 1 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-1β (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and/or 20 µ -phenylephrine HCl (Sigma) or their vehicles (100 µ ascorbic acid for phenylephrine and 1 × phosphate-buffered saline + 1% bovine serum albumin for IL-1β). After 48 h, 75 µl of medium was taken to measure SEAP activity, and cells were harvested for CAT assay. Preparations of cell extracts and CAT assays were performed as described previously (34Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the c-fos promoter were harvested after 24 h, and CAT assays were performed using 20% of the cell extract. Luciferase assays for the chicken skeletal α-actin constructs were performed with 20% of cell extract. The amount of secreted alkaline phosphatase was detected in culture medium after 48 h using the Great EscAPe Detection Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SEAP activity was similar among groups with different reporter plasmids and was not affected by treatment with IL-1β or phenylephrine (data not shown). CAT, luciferase, and SEAP activities were assayed within the linear range and CAT or luciferase activities were normalized relative to the SEAP activity in the same dish. Co-transfected SV40-SEAP did not show any promoter competition with the CAT reporter plasmids used in this study. All transfection studies were performed with at least two independent plasmid preparations. For Northern analysis, 100-mm dishes of low density neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were incubated in serum-free medium and treated with IL-1β and/or -phenylephrine or their vehicles as described above. After 48 h, total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Fifteen µg of total RNA per lane was size-fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and immobilized by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots were hybridized with rat α- or β-MHC-specific oligonucleotides (Oncogene Science, San Diego, CA). Probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 4-6 × 107 cpm/µg DNA using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After hybridization for 20 h at 42°C, blots were washed in 6 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42°C and in 1 × SSC and 1% SDS for 15 min at 42°C. Gene-specific riboprobes were used for c-fos, c-myc, and GAPDH mRNA expression. The antisense probes were labeled with α32P-UTP to a specific activity of 4-6 × 107 cpm/µg DNA using the Maxiscript T7/T3 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). After hybridization for 20 h at 65°C, blots were washed in 150 m NaPO4, 1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. All blots were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Biomax-MR) at −70°C using an intensifying screen. Gene-specific signals were quantified by scanning densitometry (Scan Analysis, Biosoft) and normalized to GAPDH expression as described previously (36Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Stewart A.F. Karns L.R. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1177-1184Google Scholar). Skeletal α-actin and SERCA 2a mRNA were detected using RNase protection (RPAII, Ambion). For these studies, 2.5 µg of total RNA were hybridized overnight at 52°C with [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense probes complementary to 195 bp of the last coding exon of the skeletal α-actin gene (18Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Google Scholar), 331 bp of the SERCA gene (37Rohrer D. Dillmann W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6941-6944Google Scholar), and a 316-bp fragment of the rat GAPDH gene (Ambion). Following digestion with RNase A/T1 (1:100), protected fragments were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, subjected to autoradiography, and normalized to GAPDH expression (36Rokosh D.G. Bailey B.A. Stewart A.F. Karns L.R. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1177-1184Google Scholar). For Western blotting, 100-mm dishes of low density neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were incubated in serum-free medium and treated with IL-1β or vehicle for 72 h. 50 µg of total protein was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose (Scheicher & Schuell) was performed at 4°C for 1 h at 100 mV using a 25 m Tris, 192 m glycine, 20% methanol transfer buffer. Following blocking in 5% milk for 1 h, blots were incubated with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal YY1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) 1:1000 for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the blots were incubated for 2 h with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, a donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.). Blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham), subjected to autoradiography, and protein signals quantified by scanning densitometry. Blots were stained with 0.1% Ponceau, 5% acetic acid to correct for differences in loading. Results are presented as mean ± standard error. Treated/control ratios were tested for deviation from unity by calculation of confidence limits and differences between treatments were analyzed by a paired t test using Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparisons. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Work by a number of laboratories indicate that cardiac myocytes, both in vivo and in vitro, respond to stress with the induction of a characteristic set of genes and gene products. Similar to that seen previously by our co-workers with norepinephrine, cardiac myocytes exposed to the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (20 µ) for 48 h showed an increase over control in mRNA expression for both skeletal α-actin and β-MHC (19Bishopric N.H. Simpson P.C. Ordahl C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1194-1199Google Scholar, 20Waspe L.E. Ordahl C.P. Simpson P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1206-1214Google Scholar). In contrast, co-treatment with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) repressed this α1-adrenergic mediated stimulatory effect, while IL-1β alone had only a modest inhibitory effect on basal mRNA expression. To determine whether the IL-1β-mediated inhibition of the α1-adrenergic induced gene expression was transcriptional in nature, a transient transfection assay was utilized (26Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar). In this approach several promoter constructs linked to a CAT reporter gene were transfected into cardiac myocytes (Figs. 1, C and D). Transfections with the −1400 skeletal α-actin or the −3300 β-MHC promoter sequences indicated a significant decrease in CAT activity when co-treatment with phenylephrine and IL-1β was compared with phenylephrine alone. Under basal conditions, IL-1β had a slight down-regulatory (skeletal α-actin) or no effect (β-MHC) relative to control. To determine whether IL-1β acts on the same minimal promoter sequences required for α1-adrenergic mediated activation (26Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar, 34Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Google Scholar), the −113 skeletal α-actin and −215 β-MHC promoter sequences were transfected into myocytes and exposed to phenylephrine and IL-1β for 48 h. Although responsive to phenylephrine treatment, these minimal promoter sequences for both genes were not affected by IL-1β, indicating that IL-1β and phenylephrine do not act through the same promoter sequences. Consistent with the transcriptional nature of the IL-1β effect, skeletal actin mRNA half-life was determined following 24-h exposure to phenylephrine ± IL-1β followed by treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (0.5 µg/ml). RNA harvested after various time intervals (2-24 h) was analyzed for actin mRNA and signals compared. Consistent with the findings of others (38Medford R.M. Nguyen H.T. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11063-11073Google Scholar), the t1/2 for actin is quite long and was unaffected by IL-1 co-treatment (data not shown). In addition to the characteristic induction of fetal program genes such as skeletal α-actin and β-MHC, the myocyte expression of several adult, myocyte-specific proteins also respond to hypertrophic stimuli both in vivo and in vitro. For example, the myocyte expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase and α-MHC genes have been reported to be repressed in response to several growth factors (11Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1093-1099Google Scholar, 21Parker T.G. Packer S.E. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 507-514Google Scholar, 39Wu P.S. Knowlton K.U. Dillmann W.H. J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 224AGoogle Scholar). To determine the IL-1β effect on the phenylephrine regulation of SERCA 2a and α-MHC mRNA, we treated myocytes with IL-1β, phenylephrine, both, or neither. As shown by Northern analysis, both IL-1β and phenylephrine had a negative effect on basal SERCA and α-MHC gene expression. In contrast to what found with skeletal α-actin and β-MHC, however, co-treatment of myocytes with IL-1β and phenylephrine did not reverse the α1-adrenergic mediated effect, but showed an apparently additive inhibitory effect on both genes. Transfection studies with full-length promoter constructs confirmed the transcriptional nature of the IL-1β effects on these genes. The data indicated above suggest that, despite stimulating an overall increase in myocyte protein content, IL-1β treatment results in a decrease in transcriptional activity. To determine whether the decrease in gene expression seen with IL-1β was the result of a generalized decrease in polymerase II activity, we examined the effect of IL-1β on two immediate early genes (c-myc and c-fos) and the β-actin housekeeping gene. As has been seen previously, treatment with the α1-agonist phenylephrine resulted in an increase in the steady-state mRNA levels for all three of these genes (40Starksen N.F. Simpson P.C.

Using transfection of c-fos and β-actin promoter constructs, we found that IL-1β increased c-fos promoter activity and had no demonstrable inhibitory effect on phenylephrine-induced β-actin expression (Fig. 4).Fig. 4IL-1β does not cause a generalized decrease in transcription. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with promoter-CAT constructs of c-fos (A) and β-actin (B) as described. Cells were then treated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml), phenylephrine (20 µ), or diluent for 48 h (24 h for c-fos). All dishes were co-transfected with SV40-SEAP (0.2 µg) to control for transfection efficiency. CAT activities were calculated relative to the SEAP activity in the same dish. The lower figures illustrate representative autoradiographs showing the differences in CAT activity under basal and stimulated conditions. The relative CAT activity of the control samples was set at 1. Results shown are from n = 3-5 different experiments (performed in duplicate) for each condition. CON, control; PHY, phenylephrine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous reports on the induction of the skeletal α-actin gene by transforming growth factor β indicate that the transcription factor YY1 is a negative regulator of skeletal α-actin gene expression in cardiac myocytes (31MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Google Scholar). Specifically, prevention of YY1 binding to sequences overlapping the proximal serum response element (SRE1) resulted in an increase in both basal and growth factor-stimulated skeletal α-actin transcription. To examine whether the negative effect of IL-1β on phenylephrine-induced cardiac gene transcription might involve YY1, we transfected the chicken skeletal α-actin promoter sequence (−394 to +24) used by these investigators (with and without the mutated YY1 binding site) into cardiac myocytes, followed by treatment with IL-1β and/or phenylephrine as described above. As seen with the full-length (−1400) mouse construct, the phenylephrine response of the wild type chicken skeletal α-actin promoter was inhibited by approximately 75% with IL-1β co-treatment. Similar to the findings of MacLellan, when the YY1 binding site of the SRE1 in the chicken skeletal α-actin gene (−81 to −79) is mutated, both basal and induced promoter activity is higher than in transfections with the wild type promoter construct, consistent with the hypothesis that YY1 is a negative regulator of skeletal α-actin gene transcription (42Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Google Scholar) and confirming the presence of YY1 in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes under basal conditions (31MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Google Scholar). In contrast, the IL-1β-mediated inhibitory effect on phenylephrine-induced skeletal α-actin transcription was lost in the presence of the mutated YY1 binding site. Since the mouse −113 skeletal α-actin promoter also contains a proximal SRE1, it was unclear why there was no IL-1β-mediated inhibitory effect seen with this construct (Fig. 1C). In an effort to explain the differences seen between the chicken and mouse skeletal α-actin constructs, the sequences adjacent to the proximal SRE's of the two promoter elements were compared. As shown in Fig. 5B, alignment with the mouse skeletal α-actin promoter showed that the SRE1 in the −113 skeletal α-actin promoter does not contain the YY1 consensus sequence, with a T for G substitution at a position critical for YY1 binding (31MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Google Scholar). To determine whether this single base pair difference in SRE1 between the mouse and the chicken skeletal α-actin promoter was responsible for the IL-1β-mediated effect, we examined the effect of creating an “artificial” YY1 binding site in the mouse −113 skeletal α-actin promoter element (GC for TT substitution). As indicated in Fig. 6, transfections with the −113 skActin-Mutant-CAT construct restored the IL-1β-mediated repression of phenylephrine induction confirming that an intact YY1 binding site is both necessary and sufficient for the IL-1β effect in th"

These different inducers mainly act through the activation of NF-κB complexes that bind to the NF-κB sites located upstream of the TATA box. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome long terminal repeat phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate tumor necrosis factor-α chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thimidine kinase electrophoretic mobility shift assay dithiothreitol trans-activation response initiator element. We previously showed that DNA alkylating agents induce the HIV-1 expression in human B lymphocytes (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Tat, the full induction of HIV-1 LTR required the integrity of both the NF-κB sites upstream of the TATA box and the +34/+37 sequence of TAR. Moreover, DNA alkylating agents rapidly induced a DNA-binding activity to the two NF-κB sites in the HIV-1 enhancer, as well to the +24/+47 sequence of TAR DNA. These results suggested that a mutagen-responsive element is located within the TAR DNA region of HIV-1 (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the Tat-independent enhancer activity of TAR. For this purpose, a set of TAR mutants were used in transient expression and DNA band shift assays to identify the sequence of TAR required for the enhancement of HIV-1 expression and binding to cellular proteins in response to activating stimuli, such as DNA alkylating agents, PMA and TNF-α. Results demonstrate the presence of a NF-κB consensus in the TAR region, which is required for the full induction of HIV-1 expression by NF-κB activating stimuli. The NF-κB site encompasses nucleotides +31 to +40 of the 5′-untranslated leader region of HIV-1; it binds to p50·p65 NF-κB complex and enhances the HIV-1 expression either in cooperation with or in absence of the NF-κB enhancer upstream of the TATA box. The characterization of a novel NF-κB enhancer in the HIV-1 LTR provides additional information to understand the NF-κB-mediated regulation of HIV-1 transcription. The plasmid pHIVCAT0, carrying the HIV-1 LTR from positions −644 to +78 upstream of the cat gene, and the derivative base pair substitution TAR mutants pHIVCAT1, pHIVCAT2, pHIVCAT3, pHIVCAT4, pHIVCAT5, pHIVCAT6, pHIVCAT7, pHIVCAT9, and pHIVCAT11 (40Feng S.

The CAT activity was evaluated 48 h after treatment and expressed as percent specific acetylation of [14C]chloramphenicol per 1 µg of protein per 3 h.

Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Nature. 1992; 359: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Italy), 3 mM glutamine, and 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.2 (Life Technologies, Inc., Italy). Cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (3 × 106) in exponential growth phase were washed and resuspended in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 plus 20% fetal calf serum in presence of the reporter plasmid DNA (5-10 µg). Cells were subjected to two electrical pulses (0.2 kV, 960 microfarads) using a Bio-Rad apparatus, recovered, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 days later collected for CAT assay. To measure transfection efficiency, pRSV-β-gal (2 µg) was cotransfected, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For chemical treatments, 12 h after transfection cells were divided in equivalent aliquots to be treated or left untreated. Two days post-treatment the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and collected for CAT assay. At least four independent experiments with different plasmid preparations were performed to evaluate the transient expression of the cat gene. The chemicals used were mitomycin C (Kyowa, Japan), PMA (Sigma), and human recombinant TNF-α (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.2 ml of 0.25 M Tris, pH 7.8, and the CAT assay was performed as described previously (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each CAT assay contained 1-50 µg of proteins, 20 µl of 4 mM acetyl coenzyme A (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), 1 µl (0.5 µCi) of [14C]chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN) in a final volume of 150 µl of 0.25 M Tris, pH 7.8. The cell extracts were used at protein concentrations ensuring linear conversion of substrate in each reaction. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 3 h, extracted with ethyl acetate, dried, and spotted on Polygram Sil G silica gel plates (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Plates were run in a TLC tank containing chloroform:methanol (95:5). After a 16-h autoradiography, the TLC plates were cut, and samples were counted in a Beckman LS5000TD scintillation counter. The percent acetylation of [14C]chloramphenicol was determined by scintillation counting the unacetylated and the acetylated forms resolved by thin layer chromatography. The CAT activity was expressed as the percent acetylated chloramphenicol per µg of protein per 3 h. Nuclear extracts and gel retardation assays were performed as described previously (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysing buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% v/v Nonidet P-40) for 5 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min), rinsed with Nonidet P-40-free lysing buffer, and resuspended in 150 µl of buffer containing 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were then subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. The suspension was cleared by centrifugation (7000 × g, 15 min), and aliquots were immediately tested in gel retardation assay or stored in liquid phase N2 until use. TAR oligonucleotide probes used are represented in Fig. 2A. HIV-1 NF-κB oligonucleotide was 5′-CAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAG-3′ and Sp1 oligonucleotide was 5′-GGGAGGTGTGGCCTGGGCGGGACTGGGGAGTGGCG-3′. The TAR probe was annealed to its complementary strand and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Int., Buckinghamshire, UK) using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Equal amounts (5 µg) of cell extracts were incubated in a 20-µl reaction mixture containing 10% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2 µg of poly[d(G-C)] (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) for 5 min on ice. One µl of γ-32P-labeled double-stranded probe (0.2 ng, 4-6 × 104 cpm) was then added with or without a 25-200-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and run on a 6% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (30:1) gel in 22.5 mM Tris borate, 0.5 mM EDTA. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Nuclear extracts (100 µg) obtained from MC3 cells treated for 1 h with mitomycin C (10 µM) were incubated with 100 ng of streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Dynal, Norway) bound to the biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's instructions in a 20-µl binding solution containing 10% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 10 µg of poly[d(G-C)] for 30 min at room temperature. As negative control, equal amounts of extracts were also incubated with unconjugated beads. Binding proteins were extensively washed with the binding solution and eluted with 20 µl of elution buffer containing 125 mM Tris-HCl, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS at 100°C for 5 min. The eluate was separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The immunoblotting was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal of human p50 or C-terminal of human p65 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham, United Kingdom). The rabbit anti-p50 and anti-p65 antiserum (43Rice N.R. Mackichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. N. Rice, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD. In the absence of Tat, the TAR region functionally cooperates with the NF-κB enhancer upstream of the TATA box of HIV-1 to confer the maximal induction of HIV-1 gene expression by DNA alkylating agents (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the mutagen-responsive sequence within TAR, the pHIVCAT0 plasmid, carrying the HIV-1 LTR fused to the cat reporter gene, and the derivative plasmids, carrying base pair substitutions within the region +28 to +51, were used in transient expression assays (Fig. 1A). For this purpose, MC3 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell line (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected with these plasmids and treated with the DNA alkylating agent mitomycin C. MC3 cells constitutively express a low level of NF-κB activity that is rapidly increased by NF-κB activating stimuli (45Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Mezza E. Scala G. Quinto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31244-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, they are representative of in vivo target cells for HIV-1 infection (46Monroe J.E. Calender A. Mulder C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47De Rossi A. Roncella S. Calabro M.L. D'Andrea E. Pasti M. Panozzo M. Mammano F. Ferrarini M. Chieco-Bianchi L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2041-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, base pair substitutions of the GGGAGCT sequence extending from +31 to +37 (pHIVCAT 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11) significantly reduced the activation by mitomycin C, whereas mutations flanking this sequence (pHIVCAT 1, 2, 7, 12, 13) were irrelevant. These findings confirm the results previously obtained with pHIV14, a mutant in which the +34/+37 sequence had been deleted (Fig. 1, A and B) (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they indicate that the mutagen-responsive element maps from +31 to +37. This tract overlaps the potential NF-κB site GGGAGCTCTC located from nucleotides +31 to +40 (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the +31/+37 sequence is contained in the TAR region from +19 to +42 that generates the upper stem-loop RNA structure required for an efficient transactivation by Tat (Fig. 1, A and C) (2Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 26Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Soultanakis E. Wu F. Mitsuyasu R. Gaynor R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 40Feng S. Holland E.C. Nature. 1988; 334: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These evidences suggest a dual role of the TAR sequence from +31 to +37 in both the mutagen-mediated and the Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. DNA alkylating agents induced a binding activity to the double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide representing the +24/+47 TAR sequence (34Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Baldassarre F. Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26719-26724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence contains a CTF/NF-1-binding site (5Jones K.A. Luciw P.A. Duchange N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), as well as a potential NF-κB site (Fig. 2A). To identify the minimal sequence required for the binding activity to TAR DNA, EMSA was performed by using mutant TAR oligonucleotides to compete the TAR DNA-binding activity. The mutant oligonucleotides contained deletions or base pair substitutions in the +24/+47 region (Fig. 2A). In particular, competitor oligonucleotides were mutated either at the NF-κB site (mTAR1, mTAR4) or in the flanking regions (mTAR2, mTAR3, mTAR5) (Fig. 2A). Base pair substitutions outside the NF-κB consensus competed for the TAR DNA-binding activity (Fig. 2B). In contrast, base pair mutations of the +31/+37 sequence (mTAR4) or the deletion of the +34/+37 sequence (mTAR1), which both eliminate the NF-κB site, abolished the ability to compete for the binding to TAR DNA (Fig. 2B). The +24/+35 and +36/+47 oligonucleotides, which do not contain the NF-κB consensus, were also unable to compete for the TAR binding activity (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that the sequence from nucleotide +31 to +38 of TAR, overlapping the potential NF-κB site, was required for the TAR DNA-binding activity. Moreover, the TAR DNA-binding activity was not due to the binding of CTF/NF-1 since it was still observed when the CTF site located from +40 to +45 was mutated (see mTAR2 and mTAR3 in Fig. 2, A and B). The possibility that NF-κB factors were involved in the TAR DNA-binding activity was further supported by the evidence that the oligonucleotide representing the HIV-1 NF-κB enhancer competed for the TAR DNA binding as efficiently as the TAR oligonucleotide (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the binding activity to the HIV-1 NF-κB probe was competed by the TAR oligonucleotide (Fig. 3). Next, we tested whether NF-κB/Rel proteins could bind to the NF-κB site within the TAR region. For this purpose, nuclear extracts from MC3 cells treated with mitomycin C were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated beads bound to biotinylated oligonucleotides including either the wild-type +24/+47 TAR or the mutants mTAR1 and mTAR4, lacking the NF-κB consensus (Fig. 2A). The retained proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting using antisera raised against p50 and p65 Rel proteins. Both p50 and p65 proteins were specifically retained by the wild-type TAR oligonucleotide, whereas they were not recovered from mTAR1, mTAR4, or from an unrelated oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A). The presence of p50 and p65 proteins in the TAR binding complex was further analyzed in EMSA by the use of antisera raised against p50 or p65 Rel proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, both antisera inhibited the TAR DNA-binding activity, whereas they were ineffective in the presence of the relative antagonist peptides. The observation of inhibition rather than supershift by anti-p50 and anti-p65 antiserum was peculiar of DNA band shift using as a probe the TAR oligonucleotide. In fact, the same antisera were able to supershift the HIV-1 NF-κB oligonucleotide (not sh"

To analyze the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, we determined the genomic organization of the β1,4GalNAc-T gene. The gene consists of at least 11 exons and spans >8 kilobase pairs. The coding region is located in exons 2-11. To determine the transcription initiation sites, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis and ribonuclease protection assays were performed using RNA obtained from the human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-31. Consequently, we defined three transcription initiation sites and the alternative usage of three exons. Exons 1a and 1b partially overlap; the latter is part (3′-side) of the former and corresponds to the 5′-noncoding region of the cDNA clone previously isolated. The third transcript, exon 1c, corresponds to nucleotides −520 to −412 (position +1 = A of ATG of β1,4GalNAc-T cDNA), which are considered to be in intron 1 based on the cloned cDNA sequence. Ribonuclease protection assays revealed the corresponding protection bands in samples of the gene-expressing cell lines. 5′-Flanking regions of individual initiation sites showed promoter activity when analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay in SK-MEL-31 cells.

They have an N-terminal presequence that allows recognition by the mitochondrial import apparatus and subsequent import into mitochondria. These presequences are rich in positive charges, mainly arginines. The role of these positive charges in the 19-amino acid presequence of rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase was investigated by systematically replacing them with the polar but uncharged residue, glutamine. The single substitution of any of the four Arg residues in the helical segments did not affect import. Substitution of both Arg residues in the N-terminal segment (R3Q/R10Q) caused a dramatic decrease in import competence. This could be restored by using the mutant lacking the three-amino acid (RGP) linker that separates the two helical domains, determined by two-dimensional NMR (Thornton, K., Wang, Y., Weiner, H., and Gorenstein, D. G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19906-19914). CD and NMR spectra of the peptide corresponding to the linker-deleted presequence showed that it was substantially more prone to helix formation than the native peptide over its entire length. A similar analysis of the peptide corresponding to the R3Q/R10Q presequence revealed that this peptide was only somewhat more helical than the native peptide and that the greater helicity did not include the residues near the N terminus. It is concluded that positively charged residues in the presequence play a vital role in the import of precursor aldehyde dehydrogenase.

https://openalex.org/W2069202127,"Human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is composed of multiple α-chains associated with a single β-chain. Each chain is composed of homologous, tandemly arranged repeats of so-called short consensus repeats (SCRs). We have previously shown that the three SCR modules of the β-chain contain a high affinity binding site for anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein S. On the basis of experiments using synthetic peptides, residues 31-45 of the amino-terminal SCR (SCR-1) in the β-chain were suggested to be involved in protein S binding, but it is not known whether SCR-1 contains the entire protein S-binding site. To address this question, two different truncated forms of the β-chain (β1,2 and β2,3) were expressed in a prokaryotic expression system. The β1,2 construct (SCR-1 + SCR-2) contained the high affinity binding site for protein S in contrast to β2,3 (SCR-2 + SCR-3), which did not bind protein S. Unfortunately, it was not possible to express SCR-1 alone in this system. To further elucidate whether the protein S-binding site is fully contained in SCR-1 or whether SCR-2 is also required, recombinant α/β-chain chimeras were constructed.

Protein S is an anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein that functions as a cofactor to activated protein C in its degradation of coagulation factor Va and factor VIIIa (6Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11128-11131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 70% of protein S in human plasma circulates in complex with C4BP. Only free protein S acts as an activated protein C cofactor, and deficiency of free protein S is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic disease (7Comp P.C. Nixon R.R. Cooper M.R. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2082-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). C4BP is composed of two kinds of subunits, the α- and β-chains (Fig. 1A). Most of the C4BPs in human plasma contain seven α-chains and one β-chain, but other isoforms also exist (8Hillarp A. Hessing M. Dahlbäck B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each chain is composed of internally homologous repeats called short consensus repeats (SCRs), complement control proteins, or Sushi domains. The α-chain contains eight SCRs, and the β-chain contains three (9Chung L.P. Bentley D.R. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each SCR is composed of ∼60 amino acids and contains several conserved residues including four cysteines, which form intradomain disulfide bridges (Cys1-Cys3 and Cys2-Cys4). In addition, each chain contains a carboxyl-terminal non-repeat region with two cysteines, which link the chains together through disulfide bridging. SCR modules are found in many complement and non-complement proteins. Some SCRs are involved in ligand binding, while others seem to function merely as spacers. Using a recombinant truncated β-chain that was expressed in a prokaryotic system, we previously showed that the protein S-binding site was located within the three SCR modules of the β-chain (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide comprising amino acids 31-45 of the C4BP β-chain (located in SCR-1) has been reported to inhibit the binding of protein S to C4BP (12Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2535-2540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide also bound directly to protein S with a KD that was ∼60 times weaker than that of plasma C4BP-protein S binding (13Villoutreix B.O. Fernández J.A. Teleman O. Griffin J.H. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibodies against this peptide inhibited the binding of protein S to C4BP. These results suggest that amino acids 31-45 contain an important part of the binding site for protein S, but it is not known whether this region of SCR-1 constitutes the entire binding site or whether other parts of the β-chain are involved in forming the binding site.

To further characterize the C4BP-protein S interaction, two different truncated forms of the β-chain were expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and tested for their protein S binding capacity. A recombinant protein composed of SCR-1 + SCR-2 bound protein S equally well as plasma-purified C4BP, whereas a construct containing SCR-2 + SCR-3 did not bind protein S. However, it was not possible to further localize the protein S-binding site in this system. We were unable to express SCR-1 by itself, and due to folding problems, the system was unsuitable for site-directed mutagenesis. Attempts to express truncated or intact β-chain in various eukaryotic expression systems were also unsuccessful. 2Y. Härdig and B. Dahlbäck, unpublished observations. Instead, recombinant C4BP cDNA chimeras composed of C4BP α-chains with SCR-1, SCR-1 + SCR-2, or SCR-1 + SCR-2 + SCR-3 replaced by corresponding SCRs from the β-chain were constructed and expressed in eukaryotic cells. Protein S binding studies using these recombinant proteins showed that β-chain SCR-1 contains the entire protein S-binding site and that neither β-chain SCR-2 nor SCR-3 contributes to the high affinity binding between C4BP and protein S.

The extinction coefficients (ϵ1%1 cm) used were 14.1 for intact C4BP (17Perkins S.J. Chung L.P. Reid K.B. M Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas we chose to use 10 as the extinction coefficient for the recombinant proteins that were expressed in the prokaryotic expression system. The monoclonal antibody HPC4 was a kind gift from Dr. C. T. Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). The polyclonal antibodies against intact C4BP were prepared and characterized as described previously (19Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11300-11307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 36 (mAb 36) was raised against the three SCRs of the C4BP β-chain, and its epitope has been shown to be located in the third SCR of the β-chain,2 whereas mAb 67 and mAb 96 recognized the C4BP α-chain. Protein S and C4BP were radiolabeled with 125I (Amersham Corp.) using IODO-BEAD™ (Pierce) and purified as described previously (19Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11300-11307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-chain cDNA constructs were made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology (20Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S.

Full-length human C4BP β-chain cDNA was used in the PCR amplification (10Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems Model 381A DNA synthesizer: 1, TAGAGCACTGTCCAGAGCTTCC; 2, TATTACCTACTTTTGCAGATGGGAA; 3, CTCCACTGTCCTGATCCTGTG; and 4, TATTAGATCAACTTGCAGACTGGAA. Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were used to amplify the DNA encoding SCR-1 + SCR-2 of the β-chain (β1,2), and oligonucleotides 3 and 4 to amplify SCR-2 + SCR-3 (β2,3). Oligonucleotide 1 contained a SalI/HincII site (underlined), which introduced an amino-terminal Asp in the recombinant protein, while oligonucleotide 3 contained a NaeI site (underlined). Oligonucleotides 2 and 4 contained one PstI site (underlined) and one stop codon (boldface) each. The DNA fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene), sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Model 373 DNA sequencer, and then cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pIN-III-pelB, which fused a calcium-dependent epitope for a human protein C monoclonal antibody (HPC4) to the recombinant protein expressed (21Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 3: 453-460Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cDNA chimeras were constructed by overlapping PCR using full-length α- and β-chain cDNAs cloned into the pBluescript vector as templates (9Chung L.P. Bentley D.R. Reid K.B.M. Biochem.

Boldface letters represent β-chain oligonucleotides, with the remainder being α-chain oligonucleotides. In addition, universal and reverse primers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were used. The resulting constructs were called β1α, β2α, and β3α. To construct β1α, universal primer and oligonucleotide 5 were used to amplify the α-chain leader peptide, and oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were used to amplify β-chain SCR-1 (Fig. 2B). These two DNA fragments, containing overlapping tags, were then annealed and amplified using universal primer and oligonucleotide 2. The carboxyl-terminal part of the α-chain was amplified using oligonucleotide 6 and reverse primer. Finally, the fragment composed of the α-chain leader peptide and β-chain SCR-1 was annealed to the amplified carboxyl-terminal part of the α-chain, and the resulting construct was amplified using universal and reverse primers. The other two constructs, β2α and β3α, were prepared in a similar way, but with oligonucleotide 2 being replaced by oligonucleotides 3 and 4, respectively, and oligonucleotide 6 by oligonucleotides 7 and 8, respectively. The chimeric part of the β1α construct was isolated after HindIII and SnaBI cleavage, ligated to α-chain cDNA in the pBluescript vector cut with the same enzymes, and sequenced. Similar procedures were repeated for the β2α and β3α constructs, but with SnaBI being replaced by BlnI. Finally, the constructs were cloned into HindIII- and NotI-cleaved pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The truncated β-chains were expressed in the bacterial strain JA221 as described previously (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of an overnight culture of the transformed bacteria in LB medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin was used to inoculate 25 ml of the same medium and grown to A600 = 0.8. This culture was then grown in 1 liter of LB medium to the same cell density. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mM), and incubation was continued for 12 h at room temperature. After centrifugation of the bacteria (10,000 × g, 30 min, room temperature), the periplasmic extract was prepared by hypotonic shock of the bacterial pellet in 100 ml of H2O for 30 min at 4°C and centrifugation as described above. The periplasmic extract and the supernatant obtained after the first centrifugation were mixed and supplemented with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mM CaCl2, and 50 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor. Glutathione (reduced form; 1 mM) was added to facilitate the formation of correctly folded recombinant proteins. The recombinant proteins were purified using monoclonal antibody HPC4 coupled to Affi-Gel as described previously (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AV 12-664 cells (a Syrian hamster cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, v/v; Integro B. V.), penicillin (50 IU/ml; ICN), streptomycin (50 µg/ml; ICN), and glutamine (4 mM; ICN) at 37°C in 5% CO2. The cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described earlier (23Härdig Y. García de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluency and lysed with a single detergent buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% NaN3, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 µg/ml leupeptin). A pulse-chase experiment was performed to check for expression and secretion of recombinant β1α. A pulse containing 300 µCi of [35S]Cys and [35S]Met (Amersham Corp.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to each 100-mm plate containing 90% confluent cells and left for 30 min. The cells were lysed either directly after the pulse or after a 240-min chase with unlabeled complete medium. The medium and the cell lysates were preincubated for 2 h at 4°C with polyclonal rabbit IgG (3 µg) and protein A-Sepharose (50 µl, 40 mg/ml) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to reduce nonspecific binding. The protein A-Sepharose was then pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min; a polyclonal antibody to C4BP was added; and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C. The next day, protein A-Sepharose was added at the same concentrations as above, and after another 2-h incubation, the immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min. The pellet was washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer and dissolved in sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE of the samples, the gel was dried, and the labeled proteins were detected using a PhosphorImager™ SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) (24Blobel G.G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 17: 835-851Crossref Scopus (1817) Google Scholar, 25Maizel Jr., J.V. Methods Virol. 1971; 5: 179-246Crossref Google Scholar). Microtiter wells were coated with three different monoclonal antibodies (mAb 36, mAb 67, and mAb 96) (50 µl, 10 µg/ml) in 75 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) (coating buffer) at 4°C overnight. The next day, the wells were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (washing buffer). The plates were then quenched with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature; after washing, plasma-purified C4BP and the recombinant proteins in their cell lysate were added at a concentration of 1 µg/ml, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed; incubated with biotinylated mAb 67; washed again; and then developed using streptavidin, biotinylated horseradish peroxidase, and 1,2-phenylendiamine (Dakopatts AB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microtiter wells were coated with mAb 67 (50 µl, 10 µg/ml) in coating buffer, washed, and quenched as described above. After washing, a trace amount of 125I-labeled C4BP was added together with increasing amounts of unlabeled C4BP (0.017-35 nM) or recombinant proteins (cell lysate) in Tris-buffered saline (final volume, 50 µl). After overnight incubation, the wells were washed, and the bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The concentration of recombinant C4BP was calculated against the standard of plasma-purified C4BP. Purified β1,2 and β2,3 and cell lysates from cells expressing β1α, β2α, or β3α were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a semidry Electroblotter (JC Biotechnical Instruments ApS.). After blotting, the membranes were quenched with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% fish gelatin and 0.02% NaN3 for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibody HPC4 (which was directed against the epitope fused to β1,2 and β2,3) or with a polyclonal antibody to C4BP (β1α, β2α, and β3α), washed in washing buffer, and then incubated either with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antiserum (Dakopatts AB) (β1,2 and β2,3) or with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antiserum (Dakopatts AB) (β1α, β2α, and β3α). After a final washing procedure, the blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 9.5). After quenching with fish gelatin, the membranes were incubated with 125I-labeled human protein S in 2 mM CaCl2 for 120 min. After washing in washing buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2 for 3 × 10 min, the signals were detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Recombinant proteins expressed in the prokaryotic system were tested for direct binding to protein S essentially as described previously (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β1,2, β2,3, or plasma-purified C4BP was immobilized in microtiter wells, and the wells were quenched as described above. 125I-Labeled protein S was then allowed to compete with increasing concentrations of unlabeled protein S (1.9-120 nM) for binding to the immobilized proteins, and the amount of bound protein S was measured in a γ-counter. Direct binding of the recombinant α/β-chain chimeras to protein S was measured in the following way. mAb 67 (50 µl, 10 µg/ml) was immobilized in microtiter wells; the wells were quenched; plasma-purified C4BP or cell lysates containing the various recombinant proteins (1 µg/ml; final volume, 50 µl) were added; and the wells were incubated for 2 h. The rest of the assay was identical to that described for measuring direct protein S binding to β1,2 and β2,3. The ability of the recombinant proteins to displace protein S binding to immobilized C4BP was tested essentially as described previously (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma-purified C4BP was immobilized in microtiter wells. After quenching with 1% bovine serum albumin, increasing amounts of plasma-purified C4BP (0.03-400 nM) or of the various recombinant proteins (0.0008-1000 nM) were added together with a trace amount of 125I-labeled protein S. After an overnight incubation, the amount of bound protein S was detected as described above. Two different truncated forms of the C4BP β-chain were expressed in a prokaryotic expression system using the pIN-III-pelB vector. β1,2 was composed of SCR-1 + SCR-2 (Glu4-Arg120) of the β-chain, and β2,3 was composed of SCR-2 + SCR-3 (Gly62-Ile177) (Fig. 1B). One liter of culture medium yielded ∼1 mg of recombinant protein. The recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and shown to have a Mr of ∼14,000 (Fig. 3A). After reduction, the respective Mr values were 18,500 (β1,2) and 16,000 (β2,3). In a ligand blot assay using 125I-protein S, unreduced β1,2 gave a positive binding signal, whereas β2,3 did not bind protein S (Fig. 3B). Reduction of recombinant β1,2 was followed by a total loss of protein S binding capacity. To compare protein S binding to the recombinant truncated β-chain with that to plasma-purified C4BP, two different binding assays were performed. In the first assay, immobilized β1,2 bound to protein S with high affinity and with a half-maximum binding of 9 nM (as compared with 5 nM for plasma-purified C4BP), whereas β2,3 did not bind protein S (Fig. 4A). In the second assay, β1,2 completely inhibited the binding of protein S to C4BP, whereas β2,3 did not interfere with the C4BP-protein S interaction (Fig. 4B). cDNA constructs composed of the C4BP α-chain with one, two, or three of its amino-terminal SCRs replaced by corresponding SCRs from the β-chain were expressed in a eukaryotic expression system. β1α was composed of the leader peptide and the amino-terminal asparagine from the α-chain (Met−48-Asn1), SCR-1 and the amino acids between SCR-1 and SCR-2 from the β-chain (Cys6-His63), and SCR-2-SCR-8 and the carboxyl-terminal region from the α-chain (Cys65-Leu549) (Fig. 2C). Similarly, β2α contained SCR-1, SCR-2 and the amino acids between SCR-2 and SCR-3 from the β-chain (Cys6-Asp121), and SCR-3 and the carboxyl-terminal region from the α-chain (Cys127-Leu549). β3α contained the three amino-terminal SCRs from the β-chain (Cys6-Cys174), whereas the region between β-chain SCR-3 and α-chain SCR-4, together with the remaining part of the construct, was derived from the α-chain (Glu187-Leu549). After transfection of the cells, none of the recombinant proteins were detected in the medium. A pulse-chase experiment was performed in which cells transfected with β1α, intact α-chain, or intact expression vector (mock-transfected cells) were labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys and then chased with unlabeled medium as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 5). After immunoprecipitation, the recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and it was confirmed that the chimeric recombinant proteins were captured inside the cells and not exported to the medium. Directly after the pulse, both β1α and recombinant intact α-chain were found only in the cell lysate. After a 4-h chase experiment with unlabeled medium, a small amount of intact α-chain was detected in the cell lysate (most of it was found in the medium), whereas recombinant β1α was present only in the cell lysate. Like intact α-chain, β1α appeared as two distinct bands on unreduced SDS-PAGE. In both cases, these bands probably correspond to molecules containing seven and eight disulfide-bridged chains. Neither cell lysate nor medium from mock-transfected cells contained any C4BP. The cell lysates were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and were developed with a polyclonal antibody against the α-chain to confirm that the bands detected in the pulse-chase experiment corresponded to recombinant C4BP (Fig. 6). The reduced recombinants were of approximately the same size as the plasma-purified C4BP α-chain (70 kDa). To investigate whether the recombinant proteins were correctly folded, they were tested for binding to three different monoclonal antibodies against C4BP in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. mAb 67, which recognized all three recombinant proteins, and mAb 96, which recognized only β1α, were both raised against intact C4BP. A third monoclonal antibody, mAb 36, which has earlier been shown to bind to SCR-3 of the β-chain,2 reacted only with the recombinant protein containing this module, i.e. β3α. To determine the concentrations of β1α, β2α, and β3α in the cell lysates, 125I-labeled plasma-purified C4BP was allowed to compete with the recombinant proteins for binding to mAb 67, and the concentrations were calculated using a standard of plasma-purified C4BP. From each 100-mm dish, 1-20 µg of recombinant protein was obtained. The protein S binding capacity of the recombinant α/β-chain chimeras was analyzed using a ligand blot assay (Fig. 7). Cell lysates containing β1α, β2α, or β3α were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a membrane and incubated with 125I-protein S. Plasma-purified C4BP, purified recombinant C4BP composed of intact α-chains, and cell lysate from mock-transfected cells were used as controls. Bound 125I-protein S was quantified using a PhosphorImager, and it was found that the signals from the three recombinant α/β-chains were equally strong and approximately four times stronger than the signal derived from plasma-purified C4BP, whereas neither recombinant intact α-chain nor cell lysate from mock-transfected cells bound protein S. Reduced proteins did not bind protein S (data not shown). To confirm that β-chain SCR-1 contains the entire protein S-binding site, both a direct binding assay and a competition assay were performed. Protein S binding to immobilized β1α, β2α, and β3α was saturable and of high affinity. Scatchard analysis of the data showed that the affinity constants for protein S binding to the recombinant chimeras and to plasma-purified C4BP were almost identical (Ka = 2.3 × 108± 0.2 and 2.1 × 108± 0.3 M−1, respectively) (Fig. 8A) (26Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17759) Google Scholar). In the competition assay, all three recombinant proteins were equally efficient (and on a molar basis, approximately four times more efficient than plasma-purified C4BP) in displacing binding of protein S to immobilized plasma-purified C4BP, whereas cell lysate from mock-transfected cells did not interfere with the C4BP-protein S interaction (Fig. 8B). Human C4b-binding protein forms a high affinity, noncovalent complex with anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein S (3Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2512-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 5Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 1: 49-61Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the protein S-binding site was contained within the three SCR modules of the β-chain (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In peptide binding experiments, amino acids 31-45, located in SCR-1 of the β-chain, were found to constitute an important part of the binding site for protein S (12Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2535-2540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homology modeling (based on the NMR structures of SCR-15 and SCR-16 of factor H) suggested that the β-chain was mainly covered by a negative contour, but that an area in the carboxyl-terminal region of SCR-1 (including amino acids 31-45) had a positive electrostatic potential (13Villoutreix B.O. Fernández J.A. Teleman O. Griffin J.H. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic patch that was accessible to the solvent was also found in this region. Several hydrophobic residues are also found in SCR-3, however; and the homology modeling study did not rule out the possibility that some of these residues are in close contact with SCR-1 and thus are able to interact with protein S. In the study presented here, two truncated forms of the β-chain (lacking SCR-1 and SCR-3, respectively) were expressed in a prokaryotic expression system, and it was shown that deletion of SCR-3 had no effect on protein S binding, whereas deletion of SCR-1 resulted in a total loss of protein S binding. The binding assays showed that protein S bound to C4BP with somewhat higher affinity than to β1,2. However, the protein S binding of β1,2 was equally strong compared with that of a recombinant protein composed of all three β-chain SCRs described earlier, and the difference compared with plasma-purified C4BP could probably be explained by the fact that not all of the recombinant proteins produced in the prokaryotic expression system were correctly folded (11Härdig Y. Rezaie A. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3033-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to express SCR-1 by itself in this system or intact or truncated variants of the β-chain in various eukaryotic expression systems have been unsuccessful.2 To investigate whether SCR-1 contained the entire protein S-binding site, overlapping PCR was used to construct recombinant α-chains with one, two, or three of the amino-terminal SCRs replaced by the β-chain counterpart. Cells transfected with these cDNA constructs were unable to export the recombinant proteins from the cells. A possible explanation for these difficulties in expressing and exporting the β-chain is that the β-chain contains information important for the regulation of the amount of β-chain-containing C4BP that is produced by the cell or that the presence of α-chain SCR-1 is a prerequisite for export of the protein. The polymeric form of the recombinant proteins had a molecular weight comparable to that of plasma-purified C4BP, which shows that the polymerization process is independent of the three amino-terminal SCRs of the α-chain. The constructs were recognized by three different monoclonal antibodies that bound only to unreduced C4BP, thus strongly suggesting that the recombinant proteins were correctly folded. The recombinant α/β-chain chimeras contained one β-chain SCR-1 on each α-chain and therefore provided seven or eight protein S-binding sites on each molecule, as compared with the single protein S-binding site on plasma-purified C4BP. This was reflected in the binding studies, in which the recombinant proteins bound approximately four times more protein S than did plasma-purified C4BP. The observation that all protein S-binding sites on the chimeric molecules were not available is consistent with results of studies of the C4b-C4BP interaction that showed that, even though each C4BP molecule contains six or seven binding sites for C4b, only four of them are occupied at physiological ionic strength, whereas binding of additional C4b is probably sterically hindered (27Ziccardi R.J. Dahlbäck B. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13674-13679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding studies performed in this work clearly showed that the amino-terminal SCR of the β-chain (SCR-1) contains the entire protein S-binding site. As we have earlier been unable to express the β-chain satisfactory, further characterization of the protein S-binding site using site-directed mutagenesis has not been possible. The β1α chimeric protein that we have described here is a new way of expressing the SCR-1 module from the β-chain, which will be useful in determining which amino acids in SCR-1 are involved in the C4BP-protein S interaction.

The signaling pathways regulating these important functions are incompletely characterized. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), are activated rapidly in neutrophils, suggesting that they may regulate cell activation. We found that neutrophils express two isoforms of MAP/ERK kinase (MEK), mixed-function kinases that are responsible for phosphorylation and activation of ERK. Like MEK-1, MEK-2 was found to reside in the cytosol both before and after stimulation. Studies were undertaken to define the relative abundance and functional contribution of MEK-1 and MEK-2 in neutrophils and to characterize the signaling pathways leading to their activation. Although the abundance of the two isoforms was similar, the activity of MEK-2 was at least 3-fold greater than that of MEK-1. A rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] was insufficient for MEK stimulation, and blunting the [Ca2+] change with intracellular chelators failed to prevent receptor-mediated activation of either isoform, implying that cytosolic Ca2+ transients are not necessary. In contrast, both MEK-1 and MEK-2 were activated by exposure of cells to protein kinase C (PKC) agonists. Conversely, PKC antagonists inhibited the chemotactic stimulation of both isoforms, suggesting that PKC was required for their activation. Despite these similarities, clear differences were also found in the pathways leading to activation of the MEK isoforms. In particular, MEK-2 was considerably more sensitive than MEK-1 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Phosphorylation and activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 were also reduced by this inhibitor. In summary, MEK-2 is stimulated in formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-treated neutrophils, where it appears to be functionally the predominant isoform.

https://openalex.org/W1591041622,"Glucocorticoids play important roles in lung development and function by modulating the expression of a variety of genes. The type 1 vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) receptor gene is highly expressed in the lung where it mediates VIP physiological functions. In this study, the effect of glucocorticoid on VIP receptor gene expression was examined. Dexamethasone (100 n) suppresses endogenous VIP receptor mRNA expression in cultured lung cells. Transient transfection of lung cells with fusion constructs containing various portions of the VIP receptor 5'-flanking sequences linked to the luciferase reporter gene shows that 126 base pairs (bp) of the VIP receptor upstream sequences are sufficient to mediate transcriptional repression by glucocorticoid. DNase I footprinting demonstrates that purified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds to the VIP receptor promoter between -21 and -36 bp relative to the transcription start site. Point mutations within this binding site not only abolish GR binding and GR-mediated transcriptional repression of the VIP receptor gene, but basal transcription is also reduced to background levels. Co-transfection of GR expression vector and the VIP receptor GR binding site linked to the thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase shows that this sequence is sufficient to confer glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional repression to a heterologous promoter. These results indicate that the VIP receptor gene contains a negative glucocorticoid response element between -21 and -36 bp that may act to regulate both basal and glucocorticoid-mediated expressions of the VIP receptor gene in lung cells."

Probing of lysates from these cells with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins corresponding to the individual domains of GRB2 revealed that this interaction was mediated exclusively by the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of GRB2. Importantly, a GST fusion protein containing the PTP1D SH2 domains was not capable of generating the EGF-induced linkage to GRB2. Additional experiments indicated that neither the binding of the nucleotide exchange factor Sos to GRB2 nor tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1D was required for EGF-stimulated coupling of PTP1D to GRB2. This is the first demonstration of a growth factor- or cytokine-induced coupling of a protein through an SH3 domain and suggests that GRB2 functions to target PTP1D, in addition to Sos, to the plasma membrane in response to EGF. The Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein GRB2 and the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1D (PTP1D, also called SHPTP2, PTP2C, SHPTP3, Syp, or SHP-2) function as positive mediators of growth factor-induced mitogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2040295454,"Variant forms of human antithrombin III with glutamine or threonine substitutions at Lys114, Lys125, Lys133, Lys136, and Lys139 were expressed in insect cells to evaluate their roles in heparin binding and activation. Recombinant native ATIII and all of the variants had very similar second order rate constants for thrombin inhibition in the absence of heparin, ranging from 1.13 × 105 M−1min−1 to 1.66 × 105 M−1min−1. Direct binding studies using 125I-flouresceinamine-heparin yielded a Kd of 6 nM for the recombinant native ATIII and K136T, whereas K114Q and K139Q bound heparin so poorly that a Kd could not be determined. K125Q had a moderately reduced affinity. Heparin binding affinity correlated directly with heparin cofactor activity. Recombinant native ATIII was nearly identical to plasma-purified ATIII, whereas K114Q and K139Q were severely impaired in heparin cofactor activity. K125Q and K136T were only slightly impaired. Based on these data, Lys114 and Lys139, which are outside of the putative pentasaccharide binding site, play pivotal roles in the high affinity binding of heparin to ATIII and the activation of thrombin inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1672545271,"Rat phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) is a 32-kDa protein of 271 amino acids that transfers phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between membranes. The α isoform of rat PITP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in high yields. The purified protein contained 1 mol of phosphatidylglycerol and had a transfer activity for phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine equal to or greater than that of PITP purified from mammalian brain. Limited protease digestion was used to further define structure, activity, and function relationships in PITP. PITP alone is relatively resistant to digestion by chymotrypsin, trypsin, and Staphylococcus V8 protease but is readily cleaved by subtilisin. Phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidic acid enhance susceptibility to digestion by all four proteases. In the presence of vesicles, PITP, which migrates as a 36-kDa protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is cleaved rapidly by trypsin to a form that appears to be 2-3 kDa smaller than the native form. The tryptic fragment retains partial phospholipid transfer activity and shows an enhanced affinity for phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidic acid. Analysis of the tryptic digestion products by immunoblotting, N-terminal sequencing, and electrospray mass spectrometry showed that trypsin cleaves the C terminus of PITP at Arg253 and Arg259. Thus, removal of the C terminus enhances the affinity of PITP for vesicles and results in a dimunition of transfer activity. Overall, the data show that PITP undergoes conformation changes and that the C terminus becomes more accessible to trypsin when bound to vesicles. Hence, the C terminus is not an essential component of the membrane binding site and may be located distal to it.

PITP was first purified over 20 years ago from bovine brain, a tissue in which it is found in relatively high amounts (1Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Harvey M.S. Wirtz K.W.A. van Deenen L.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6382-6389Google Scholar). It contains a single binding site for phospholipid, and in SDS-PAGE it exhibits an apparent size of 36 kDa (2Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Subcell.

Bankaitis V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4510-4521Google Scholar). The predicted PITPs of rat, mouse, and human consist of 271-272 amino acids, have very highly conserved sequences, and have molecular masses of approximately 32 kDa. More recently, a cDNA encoding another PITP form was isolated from rat brain by complementation in yeast (9Tanaka S. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 981-984Google Scholar). Although the predicted protein is similar in size to the predicted PITPs of rat, human, and mouse, it has only 70% amino acid sequence similiarity with those previously reported. Thus, there appear to be two genes encoding PITP in rat and apparently also in bovines (10de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Google Scholar). PITPs having strong sequence similarity to that sequenced initially by Dickeson et al. (4Dickeson S.K. Lim C.N. Schuyler G.T. Dalton T.P. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16557-16564Google Scholar) have been termed PITP-α. PITPs showing strong sequence similarity to that sequenced by Tanaka and Hosaka (9Tanaka S. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 981-984Google Scholar) have been termed PITP-β. PITPs migrate anomalously in SDS-PAGE, which has given rise to incorrect mass assignments of 35-36 kDa (10de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Google Scholar). Most yeast proteins are slightly larger, around 300-310 amino acids, and show no apparent sequence similarity to the metazoan PITPs (4Dickeson S.K. Lim C.N. Schuyler G.T. Dalton T.P. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16557-16564Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that in yeast, PITP is essential for cell viability (11Aitken J.F. van Heusden G.P.H. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4711-4717Google Scholar). Interestingly, rat PITP-α can only partially complement defects in SEC14, the yeast gene encoding PITP (12Skinner H.B. Alb Jr., J.G. Whitters E.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4775-4784Google Scholar). The physiological role of PITP is becoming more clear. Recently, it has been found to be involved in both cell signaling and secretion (13Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Google Scholar, 14Thomas G.M. Cunningham E. Fensome A. Ball A. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Cockcroft S. Cell. 1993; 74: 919-928Google Scholar, 15Hay J.C.

Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 85: 659-662Google Scholar). Hay and Martin (13Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Google Scholar) found that PITP was an essential component for ATP-dependent priming of calcium-activated secretion. Interesting, yeast PITP (SEC14 gene product) was able to substitute for PITP in this reaction. PITP also is required for signaling by epidermal growth factor and for phospholipase C-mediated inositol lipid signaling (14Thomas G.M. Cunningham E. Fensome A. Ball A. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Cockcroft S. Cell. 1993; 74: 919-928Google Scholar, 16Kauffmann-Zeh A. Thomas G.M.H. Ball A. Prosser S. Cunningham E. Cockcroft S. Hsuan J.J.

It apparently stimulates the latter reaction by promoting synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-5-bisphosphate (20Cunningham E. Thomas G.M.H. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Google Scholar). The structural information available about PITP is limited. Studies by Wirtz and co-workers (21Kasurinen J. van Paridon P.A. Wirtz K.W.A. Somerharju P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8548-8554Google Scholar, 22van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W.J. Somerharju P.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6208-6214Google Scholar) suggest that the phospholipid binding site is hydrophobic and that there may be separate binding sites for the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl side chains. They also demonstrated that negatively charged phospholipids were inhibitors of the in vitro transfer reaction, apparently as a result of enhanced binding of PITP to the negatively charged vesicles (23Somerharju P. Van Paridon P. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 186-195Google Scholar). Transfer activity of PITP is inactivated by treatment with sulfhydryl reagents such as maleimides and iodoacetamide (12Skinner H.B. Alb Jr., J.G. Whitters E.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4775-4784Google Scholar, 24DiCorleto P.E. Warach J.B. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7795-7802Google Scholar). The location of the phospholipid binding site is unknown. Limited protease digestion has proven to be a powerful tool for analysis of structure and function of proteins (25Ellison D. Hinton J. Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1337-1345Google Scholar, 26Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Google Scholar, 27Price N.C. Johnson C.M. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford UK1989: 163Google Scholar). We have used this approach to characterize recombinant rat PITP. In the absence of lipid vesicles, PITP is highly resistant to digestion by trypsin. In the presence of vesicles, digestion by trypsin is greatly enhanced, and the C terminus is rapidly cleaved at Arg253 and Arg259 to generate a mixture of at least two truncated species. The truncated protein(s) have greatly reduced transfer activity, and the affinity for vesicles is significantly enhanced. The results show that structural changes in the C terminus significantly alter the affinity of PITP for lipid vesicles. PtdCho was purified from crude egg PtdCho (Sigma) by column chromatography on Silica Gel G. Bovine liver phosphatidylinositol and egg PtdCho-derived phosphatidic acid were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The following were purchased from Sigma: −1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (T-8642), α-chymotrypsin (C-3142), subtilisin (P-5380), Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (P-2922), di-isopropylfluoro phosphate (−0879), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (P-7626). Soybean trypsin inhibitor was from Cooper Biomed. A cDNA encoding rat PITP α-isoform was ligated into the pET-11C vector of Studier and co-workers (28Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar, 29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar), which confers resistance to ampicillin, so that when the lac promoter regulating PITP gene expression was induced by isopropyl β—thiogalactoside an unfused protein of 271 amino acids (31.9 kDa) would be produced. For protein expression, the resulting plasmid (pET-PITP) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-DE3, which contained an additional plasmid encoding groELS (30Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding groELS had a different origin of replication and contained a gene conferring resistance to chloramphenicol. The expression of both PITP and groELS were controlled by the lac repressor/operator. Cells were grown in the presence of both ampicillin and chroramphenicol to an optical density of one at 595 nm and induced with 200 µ isopropyl β—thiogalactoside for 18 h at 20°C. Following induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, and the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (0.05 Tris·HCL, pH 7.5, 0.1 m EDTA, 1 m DTT, 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed in an SLM Aminco French pressure cell press (SLM Instruments, Inc.). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a type 50.2 TI rotor (Beckman). The lysate supernatant from the centrifugation step (sample volume, ≤5% of bed volume) was loaded on a Sephadex G-100 column (52 mm × 90 cm) that was equilibrated with buffer B (0.05 sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m DTT). The column was eluted with buffer B, and column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The desired fractions were then pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (0.01 sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.1 m DTT), and loaded on a column (25 mm × 85 mm) containing Q Sepharose Fast Flow strong anion exchange resin equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with buffer C and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (10-300 m) in buffer C. The majority of the protein at this point appeared homogeneous with a yield of 25-30 mg of purified protein/liter of cells. In some cases, fractions containing impurities were dialyzed against buffer D (0.01 sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.1 m DTT) and further purified on a Bio-Rad hydroxylapatite column (16 mm × 110 mm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient (10-200 m) of sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1 m DTT, and 0.1 m EDTA. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein dye assay or by absorbance at 280 nm using a measured molar extinction coefficient of 79,700 −1 cm−1. Phospholipid analysis was performed as described by Bartlett (31Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). Protein sequence was determined with an Applied Biosystems model 470A sequenator updated to pulse liquid chemistry fitted with a model 120 on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. rPITP purified from E. coli contains PtdGro, whereas that purified from mammalian cells or tissue contains PtdCho and phosphatidylinositol. To exchange the bound PtdGro for PtdCho, the pooled protein from the Sephadex column was dialyzed against buffer C and then concentrated to a volume of approximately 100 ml using an Amicon concentrator and Diaflo PM10 ultrafiltration membrane. Vesicles containing 100 mol% PtdCho were added to the protein to a final concentration of 1.44 m and then incubated at room temperature for 18 h (total volume, 200 ml). This mixture was then further purified by chromatography on Q Sepharose Fast Flow and hydroxylapatite as described above. Analysis of bound phospholipid following exchange showed 0.90 ± 0.02 mol of PtdCho/mol of PITP. Phospholipid transfer activities were measured between two populations of small unilamellar vesicles, as described by Kasper and Helmkamp (32Kasper A.M. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 664: 22-32Google Scholar). Vesicles used in assays were prepared by injection of chloroform solutions into buffer; vesicles used for binding studies were prepared by extensive sonication. Radiolabeled phospholipid substrates for assays were phosphatidyl[3H]inositol and 2-[3H]oleoyl-PtdCho. Control incubations were carried out in the absence of transfer protein. Activity is calculated as the percentage of donor phospholipid (40 nmol) transferred in a 30-min assay. Recovery of acceptor vesicles ranged between 94 and 100%; activity in the absence of transfer protein rarely exceeded 6%. rPITP (final concentration, 0.30 mg/ml) was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and S. aureus V8 protease in the presence or the absence of 80/20 PC/PA vesicles. Digestions were performed in 10 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m EDTA, 50 m NaCl at 37°C using the following ratios of protease to PITP: trypsin and chymotrypsin (1:25 (w/w) ratio); subtilisin and S. aureus V8 protease (1:100 (w/w) ratio). Aliquots were removed at specific times, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling at 100°C for 10 min. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. PITP (final concentration in reaction, 0.25 mg/ml) was digested with a 1:150 (w/w) ratio of trypsin/PITP for 5 min at 37°C in the presence or the absence of 1 m 80/20 PC/PA vesicles. Digestion was performed in 10 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m EDTA, 50 m NaCl. The reaction was stopped by addition of di-isopropylfluoro phosphate to 2 m. Samples were left at room temperature for 1 h and then analyzed for transfer activity. Control experiments showed that transfer activity of undigested PITP was not significantly affected by this treatment. Activity is expressed as the percentage of transfer of donor PtdCho during a 30-min assay using 98/2 PC/PA vesicles (40 nmol). Gel filtration was performed using a TosoHaas G2000SWXL 2000 column with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was monitored by fluorescence (excitation, 280 nm; emission, 340 nm) or absorbance at 280 nm. The buffer contained 10 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m EDTA, and 50 m NaCl. The void volume eluted at approximately 5.5 min. Samples of 20-30 µl were injected. rPITP (∼1 mg in 0.7 ml) was digested for 5 min in 10 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m EDTA, and 50 m NaCl with a 1:25 (w/w) ratio of trypsin/PITP at 37°C in the presence of 1 m 80/20 PC/PA vesicles. The digestion was stopped by addition of 1.3 molar equivalents of soybean trypsin inhibitor and placed on ice prior to loading onto a Sephadex G-100 column. SDS-PAGE confirmed that PITP had been completely converted to the more rapidly migrating product(s). The trypsin-digested PITP was purified at 4°C using a 14-ml Sephadex G-100 column (12 mm × 170 mm). The column was equilibrated and protein eluted with 10 m HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m EDTA. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions were pooled. The pooled trypsin-digested PITP and a similar preparation of undigested PITP were then dialyzed for 2 h at 4°C against equimolar ratios of acetonitrile and water containing 1% acetic acid. The proteins were subsequently analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry in the Biotechnology Center at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). The α isoform of rat PITP was expressed in E. coli using the procedures outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Crude cell extracts were fractionated by gel chromatography and assayed by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions were pooled. This material was then further purified by chromatography on Q Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchanger followed by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. After purification, PITP appeared homogenous in SDS-PAGE. Yields normally ranged from 25-30 mg of purified PITP/liter of cell culture, if groELS was overexpressed and cells were grown at 20°C. PITP was analyzed for bound lipid and found to contain 0.92 ± 0.08 mol of PtdGro/mol of protein (n = 4). PITP purified from mammalian brain exists as isoforms containing PtdCho and phosphatidylinositol. Prior to determination of transfer activity, PITP was incubated with vesicles containing 100 mol% PtdCho to exchange PtdGro. Vesicles were removed, and the protein was shown to contain 0.90 ± 0.02 mol of PtdCho/mol of protein. Transfer activities were then measured before and after lipid exchange. Both the PtdCho and PtdGro forms have approximately equal transfer activity in the standard assay, and the activity is equal to or greater than the activity of PITP purified from mammalian brain (data not shown). Often the susceptibility to protease digestion is altered by interaction with ligands. We have therefore examined the digestion of PITP by chymotrypsin, trypsin, subtilisin, and S. aureus V8 protease in the presence or the absence of phospholipid vesicles. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of vesicles, PITP is resistant to digestion by chymotrypsin, trypsin, and V8 protease. Even after 1 h there is little digestion. In contrast, subtilisin produces two major fragments of approximately 25-30 kDa in size, and the digestion appears to be complete by 30 min. Thus, PITP is relatively resistant to protease digestion in the absence of vesicles, with the exception of subtilisin. Vesicles containing the anionic lipid, phosphatidic acid, enhance digestion by all proteases (Fig. 1B). Some new fragments are observed in the chymotrypsin-digested PITP and less of the undigested material remains. In the case of trypsin (lanes 4 and 5), conversion to a form that has an apparent size 2-3 kDa smaller than PITP is complete within 5 min. This product(s) then appears to be digested more slowly to smaller fragments. Subtilisin digestion is also enhanced; after 30 min little undigested material remains. V8 protease also digests PITP more readily in the presence of vesicles. Thus, PITP is more susceptible to digestion by a number of proteases if vesicles are present during the digestion. Moreover, both the PtdCho and PtdGro isoforms of PITP show the same patterns of protease sensitivity. To further characterize the digestion of PITP by trypsin, samples were digested in the absence of vesicles, with 98/2 PC/PA vesicles, or with 80/20 PC/PA vesicles, as described in Fig. 1. Samples were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2A), immunoblotted with antibodies against the N terminus of PITP (Fig. 2B), or immunoblotted with antibodies to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of PITP (Fig. 2C). In the absence of vesicles (lanes 1-3), PITP is relatively resistant to digestion by trypsin, as described above. The immunoblots (Fig. 2, B and C) confirm that there is little if any digestion in the absence of vesicles. If, however, digestion is performed in the presence of vesicles containing 98/2 PC/PA, a band appears after 5 min of digestion that runs slightly below the main band in Coomassie-stained gels (lanes 4-6). This band reacts with antibody to the N terminus (Fig. 1B) but does not react with the antibody to the C terminus (Fig. 2C). When digestion is performed in the presence of vesicles containing 80/20 PC/PA the conversion to the slower migrating band is complete within 5 min (lanes 8 and 9). This slower migrating band, which appears to be smaller than PITP by about 2-3 kDa, reacts with antibody to the N terminus of PITP but shows no reaction with the antibody to the C terminus (lanes 8 and 9, Fig. 2C). Thus, the data suggest that trypsin cleaves rapidly the C terminus of PITP in the presence of 80/20 vesicles, thereby eliminating the antigenic determinant(s) associated with the C-terminal 12 amino acids of PITP. Conceivably, the C-terminal peptide produced by trypsin might remain associated noncovalently with the larger N-terminal fragment. Attempts to detect a small peptide of 13-18 amino acids by SDS-PAGE were not successful. Thus, we presume that the C-terminal peptide is released and degraded or that cleavage occurs from the C terminus in a sequential manner. Control experiments were performed to determine whether vesicles affected the action of trypsin on another protein, beef brain tubulin; no significant effects were observed upon the rate of digestion or the products produced. Thus, the enhanced digestion of PITP in the presence of vesicles is apparently a specific effect and not a general effect of vesicles on trypsin digestion of proteins. Fig. 2 shows that digestion of PITP by trypsin (1:15 (w/w) ratio) is complete by 5 min. To further characterize the enhanced sensitivity to trypsin in the presence of vesicles, digestion was performed with 80/20 PC/PA vesicles using smaller ratios of trypsin to PITP. Digestion with a ratio of trypsin to PITP of 1:200 was complete by 5 min, as measured by SDS-PAGE, (data not shown). Thus, vesicles with a high content of phosphatidic acid enhance susceptibility to trypsin by orders of magnitude. The immunoblotting studies suggested that digestion by trypsin occurred at the C terminus of the molecule. To further characterize the digestion products, PITP was digested briefly with trypsin in the presence of 80/20 PC/PA vesicles, which completely converted it into the smaller form, as measured by SDS-PAGE. The protein was then isolated, and N-terminal sequence analyses were performed. These studies showed that the majority of the digested protein retained the initiating Met residue, as was found in undigested controls (data not shown). Further characterization of the tryptic digestion products was performed using electrospray mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of PITP, which had not been digested with trypsin, was determined to be 31,914 Da, in good agreement with a mass calculated for the predicted protein of 31,909, based on amino acid sequence. PITP, which had been subjected to trypsin digestion displayed two components of lesser mass. One component had a mass of 30,607 ± 3; a second had a mass of 29,846 ± 4. These data were consistent with two components resulting from cleavage at Arg253 and Arg259. The masses for these fragments were calculated to be 30,622 Da and 29,850 Da, respectively. The in vitro transfer activity of control and trypsin digested PITP was examined using standard assay conditions and 98/2 PC/PA donor and acceptor vesicles (Table I). PITP showed about a 75% reduction in transfer activity following digestion with trypsin. Control experiments showed that this reduction in activity was dependent on digestion with trypsin. The addition of 80/20 PC/PA vesicles to undigested PITP had no inhibitory effect in the assay. Thus, removal of the C-terminal 12-18 amino acids of PITP greatly reduced but did not eliminate transfer activity as measured in the standard assay.TABLE IEffects of tryptic digestion on transfer activity of phosphatidylinositol transfer proteinTrypsinVesiclesTransfer activity% transfer/µg/30 min−−8.5 ± 3.3+−8.5 ± 0.4++2.1 ± 0.5−+8.8 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Digestion of PITP by trypsin occurred much more rapidly in the presence of 80/20 PC/PA than 98/2 PC/PA vesicles. This suggested differences in interaction of PITP with vesicles of differing lipid composition. To explore the binding of PITP to vesicles, PITP was added to either 80/20 PC/PA or 98/2 PC/PA vesicles to give a final vesicle concentration of 1 m and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Following incubation, the solutions were analyzed by HPLC gel chromatography on a TosoHaas TSK-GEL G2000SWXL column. Elution was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence at 340 nm or absorbance at 280 nm. In the absence of vesicles, PITP elutes as a homogeneous peak at about 8.7 min (Fig. 3). In the presence of 1 m 80/20 PC/PA vesicles, about 30-40% of the fluorescence (PITP) elutes within the void volume at about 5.5 min; the remainder elutes in the position of free PITP (the total fluorescence intensity is not significantly affected by vesicles). With 98/2 PC/PA vesicles, in contrast, only a very small peak elutes in the void volume with vesicles (data not shown). Following digestion with trypsin, only traces of free PITP (eluting at 8.7 min) are observed, and there is an increase in the material eluting in the void volume. Similar results were obtained if protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm (data not shown). Control experiments showed that vesicles alone eluted in the column void volume. Thus, it appears that removal of the C-terminal 12-18 amino acids of PITP significantly enhances its affinity for vesicles so that essentially all PITP remains bound to vesicles during gel chromatography. This has been confirmed by producing the truncated proteins (residues 1-253 and 1-259) in an E. coli expression system and examining their interaction with vesicles. 2J. M. Tremblay, G. M. Helmkamp, Jr., and L. R. Yarbrough, manuscript in preparation. Using the pET vector system, we have developed procedures for expression in E. coli and purification in large amounts of the α isoform of rat PITP. We have employed a combination of low cell growth temperature and overexpression of groELS to significantly enhance solubility of PITP produced in E. coli. Previous studies by a number of investigators have shown that low cell growth temperature (33Schein C.H. Noteborn M.H.M. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 291-294Google Scholar, 34Schein C.H.

(6Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Google Scholar) for mouse PITP, we find that if expressed at 37°C, PITP is mostly insoluble. In contrast, if expressed at 20°C with elevated levels of groELS, approximately half the PITP produced is in soluble form. Our yields (25-30 mg of PITP/liter of cell culture) are about an order of magnitude greater than the 3 mg of PITP/liter of cell culture reported for mouse PITP (6Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Google Scholar). rPITP is active and contains 1 mol of PtdGro as was previously reported for mouse PITP (6Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis are consistent with the majority of the protein retaining its initiating Met residue. The data we have obtained demonstrate that PITP is highly resistant to digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease in the absence of phospholipid bilayer. However, in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, digestion by trypsin is greatly enhanced, and the conversion to a C-terminally truncated product is complete within 5 min, even at relatively low ratios of enzyme to PITP. Under the conditions used for digestion, a significant fraction of PITP is bound to vesicles. Moreover, increased binding to vesicles, as measured by gel filtration, is associated with a more rapid rate of digestion by trypsin. Thus, the C terminus of PITP becomes highly susceptible to digestion by trypsin when bound to vesicles. This would appear to be due to changes in conformation of the C terminus. There may also be conformational changes in regions other than the C terminus of PITP because the susceptibility to other proteases is also enhanced when it is bound to vesicles. Studies of sulfhydryl reactivity and tyrosine second derivative spectra show that binding of PITP to vesicles is associated with increased exposure or reactivity of these residues. Overall, the data suggest that vesicle binding leads to a somewhat looser and more flexible conformation. Similarly, a more relaxed conformation has been described for two C-terminal truncated species (residues 1-253 and residues 1-259). 3P. Voziyan, J. M. Tremblay, L. R. Yarbrough, and G. M. Helmkamp, Jr., Biochemistry, in press. However, the changes in conformation of PITP on binding to vesicles apparently do not involve significant changes in secondary structure because the far UV CD spectrum is not significantly altered by binding to vesicles. 4J. M. Tremblay and L. R. Yarbrough, unpublished data. Why some proteins are subject to limited digestion by specific proteases is not clear. Conformational or segmental mobility and exposure or accessibility have been suggested previously as important determinants of proteolytic susceptibility (27Price N.C. Johnson C.M. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford UK1989: 163Google Scholar). The interaction of trypsin with substrates and protein inhibitors has been studied extensively. X-ray crystal structures for several trypsin-protein inhibitor complexes have been determined. It has been suggested that the susceptible region of a protein that is cleaved by trypsin must assume a conformation similar to the conformation of that portion of the trypsin inhibitor (loop) that binds to the active site of the enzyme (26Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Google Scholar). Recent studies of tryptic cleavage sites of several native proteins using molecular modeling supports the conclusion that these “nick” sites are able to assume a loop-like conformation similar to that of the bound trypsin inhibitors (26Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Google Scholar). Based on the results of these studies and the known specificity of trypsin, we have developed a model for the digestion of PITP by trypsin (Fig. 4). In the absence of vesicles, the C terminus of PITP is bound to the remainder of the protein and hence is resistant to digestion. When PITP binds to vesicles the conformation and/or stability of the C terminus is altered resulting in weaker binding to the protein core. Consequently, the more flexible C terminus can then more readily assume a conformation, which is necessary for binding and cleavage by trypsin. Predictive methods based on the amino acid sequence of PITP suggest that the C-terminal 18 amino acids are highly hydrophilic, located on the surface, and flexible. The model has the membrane binding site distal to the C terminus. This is based on the assumption that the C terminus would be unavailable to trypsin because of steric effects if it were a part of the membrane binding site. The C-terminally truncated PITP shows a significantly enhanced affinity for lipid vesicles (Fig. 3). Thus, the C terminus is not essential for binding to membranes. Indeed, the presence of the C-terminal amino acids apparently reduces the affinity of PITP for vesicles. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is not clear. It is possible that the C terminus sterically alters the accessibility of a region(s) of PITP that binds to membranes. Thus, removal of the C terminus could permit stronger or more extensive interactions with the vesicle. For example, removal of the C terminus of PITP could expose positively charged residues on the trypsin-resistant core, which could enhance interaction with negatively charged vesicles. However, this mechanism envisions the C terminus as very near or a part of the membrane binding site. As noted above, we feel that this is unlikely. If the C terminus were part of the region that interacts with membranes, it appears that it would be unavailable for cleavage by trypsin when it is bound to membranes. Consequently, it appears more likely that there are global conformational changes induced by binding of PITP to vesicles. These conformational changes lead to an enhanced affinity of PITP for vesicles once the C terminus is removed. As shown in Fig. 3, PITP that has been digested with trypsin binds much more avidly to membrane vesicles. However, because the mass spectral data suggest that the tryptic product is a mixture of species cleaved at Arg253 and Arg259, a detailed analysis of the effect of the C terminus on transfer activity and membrane binding requires the study of homogeneous truncated derivatives. The increased affinity of trypsin-digested PITP for vesicles is an important contributor to the decrease in transfer activity. Previous studies have shown that PITP binds more tightly to negatively charged phospholipids and that transfer activity is reduced under these conditions (23Somerharju P. Van Paridon P. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 186-195Google Scholar). We have found that the transfer activities of derivatives of PITP truncated at Arg253 and Arg259 are highly dependent on the lipid composition of the donor and acceptor vesicles and the position of truncation.2 Both of these derivatives bind much more avidly to vesicles than full-length PITP. Although membrane binding is a necessary condition for lipid transfer, if it becomes too tight, transfer activity may be greatly reduced or eliminated. The in vivo function of PITP is only now becoming clear. In view of the greatly enhanced binding of truncated PITP derivatives to vesicles, it is possible that there might be significant biological effects if these derivatives were introduced into cells. Because of the greatly enhanced binding affinity they could form tight complexes with membranes, which might then affect interactions with the normal protein. Thus, the truncated PITP derivatives may be useful in further elucidating the in vivo function of this protein. We thank Greg Grant (Washington University, Saint Louis, MO) for performing the mass spectral analysis of PITP and its digestion products.

https://openalex.org/W2001231126,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a member of a family of glycoprotein hormones which are heterodimers containing two nonidentical subunits: a common α and a hormone-specific β subunit. One of the distinguishing features of the CGβ subunit is the presence of four serine acceptors clustered within the last 25 amino acids. We previously demonstrated that this carboxyl-terminal region is important for maintaining its biologic half-life, and when the sequence was genetically fused to either the common α or follitropin β subunits, O-glycosylation was observed. Because this carboxyl-terminal sequence is located at the end of the subunit, we considered this region a convenient in vivo model for studying O-linked glycosylation in domains containing multiple serine recognition sites. A CGβ gene was engineered in which the N-linked sites were inactivated to eliminate background from those carbohydrate groups. Using this construct, we made a series of truncation and amino acid substitutions of acceptor serines, and these mutants were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. O-Glycosylation was determined by [3H]glucosamine incorporation and glycanase sensitivity of the products on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We show that the O-linked sites comprise independent repetitive regions in which each acceptor serine has a recognition signal bounded by the next carboxy acceptor serine within four to five amino acids. It is also apparent that recognition of one site is not dependent on the glycosylation of another acceptor. Amino acid mutations in the acceptor regions demonstrated the importance of proline as a necessary feature for O-linked recognition in the CGβ sequence."

We have previously published sequences corresponding to the DNA binding domains of seven forkhead genes, which we named FREAC-1 to FREAC-7 (forkhead-related activators), together with data on DNA binding properties and tissue distribution of expression (15Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 1354: 5002-5012Google Scholar). In this paper we focus on one of these genes, FREAC-4. Genomic and cDNA sequence of FREAC-4 is presented as well as determination of the transcription start. Two kidney-derived cell lines, both expressing FREAC-4 mRNA, were identified and used in transfection experiments. These experiments demonstrated that FREAC-4 is regulated by two tumor suppressor genes, WT-1 and p53. We also identify a cis-element in the promoter of FREAC-4 that binds recombinant WT-1. Isolation of original cDNA clones for FREAC-4 has been described previously (15Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 1354: 5002-5012Google Scholar). A human λ DASH genomic library was screened with probes derived from FREAC-4 cDNA clones. Inserts from positive phages were subcloned and sequenced bidirectionally. In some instances, exonuclease III was used to generate a set of nested deletions that served as templates for sequence reactions (32Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Google Scholar). A Pharmacia ALF sequencer using T7 polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or Thermosequenase (Amersham Corp.) and either fluorescein-labeled primer or fluorescein-dATP was used. Some regions were also sequenced with [α-35S]dATP and Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Total RNA was prepared as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose- formaldehyde gel and blotted onto Hybond-C extra filters (Amersham (34Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Google Scholar); hybridized at 44°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC and washed at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 62°C). Probe was made from a DNA fragment outside of the conserved DNA binding region (nucleotides 3896-4216 in Fig. 1). A genomic DNA fragment spanning from nucleotide 2122 to 2485 (Fig. 1) was subcloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene). T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP were used to label a cRNA antisense probe. Various restriction enzymes were used to produce templates for T3 and T7 RNA polymerases in order to create run-off transcripts of defined lengths, to be used as size markers. Labeled antisense probe, approximately 170,000 cpm Cerenkov for each reaction, was added to 50 µg of total RNA in a hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 100 m sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 m sodium acetate, pH 6.4, 1 m EDTA) at 52°C overnight. After digestion with RNase A and RNase T1, the protected fragment was electrophoresed together with size standards on a 5% sequencing gel. All cells were obtained through the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC): 3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts; ATCC CL-173), HeLa (human cervix cancer; ATCC CRL-7923), 293 (human embryonic kidney; ATCC CRL-1573), and COS-7 (monkey-transformed kidney; ATCC CRL-165). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A typical transfection contained 100 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid and 100 ng of cotransfected plasmid, expression constructs encoding various transcription factors, or an expression vector void of insert as a control. These plasmids were diluted into 560 µl of OptiMEM together with 2 µg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to a subconfluent monolayer of cells cultured in a gelatin-coated (Sigma) 16-mm tissue culture well. Cell harvest and luciferase assay were performed according to Promega Corp. (Technical Bulletin 101). To compensate for differences in transfection efficiency, 10 ng of a β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid, pCMVβgal (Clontech), was added to each transfection. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a Lumiβ-galactosidase assay (Clontech). Luciferase values were normalized against β-galactosidase activities. For transfections, a FREAC-4 luciferase (FREAC-4- luc) construct was used. To make this reporter gene construct, a DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1-2654 (Fig. 1) was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites, upstream of the luciferase gene, in pGL2-basic (Promega). Exonuclease III was used to create various 5′-deletions of FREAC-4-luc (32Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Google Scholar). Double-stranded ologonucleotides with 5′-overhangs were used. Oligonucleotide A (nucleotides 2253-2277, Fig. 1) and oliginucleotide B (nucleotides 2345-2389, Fig. 1) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP (Amersham) and Klenow fragment. For competition experiments a 50-fold molar excess of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a WT-1 binding site from the TGF-β1 promoter known to bind WT-1 (GGGGGCCGCCCCCGCTCCCGCCCCGTG, from Dey et al. (35Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher III, F.J. Kim S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Google Scholar)) was used. Binding reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 µl containing 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 70 m NaCl, 0.1 m EGTA, 1 m EDTA, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 µg of poly(dI-dC). Reactions were conducted at room temperature for 20 min, and the samples were then resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) in Tris-glycine buffer (25 m Tris, 190 m glycine, 1 m EDTA) with 5% glycerol at +4°C and 15 V/cm for 90 min. Human recombinant WT-1 protein was produced as described by Morris et al. (36Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348Google Scholar). In brief, a plasmid with a flanking T7 RNA polymerase promoter site harboring the full-length amino acid coding sequence of human WT-1 and a plasmid void of insert (a control) were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. The RNAs were translated in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [S35]methionine. An aliquot from the translation mixtures was analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the molecular mass of the WT-1 translation product (a single band) was estimated to be 53 kDa (not shown), in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of human WT-1. The translation mixture with the control plasmid rendered no detectable band. A cDNA extending from nucleotide 2521 to 4792 in Fig. 1 was isolated from two cDNA libraries as three overlapping clones. An open reading frame encoding the characteristic forkhead domain was identified. The conceptual translation product of this reading frame predicts a protein of 465 amino acids. The initiation codon was assigned to the first in-frame ATG within a Kozak consensus sequence (37Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar). A polyadenylation signal was identified at positions 4755-4760 (Fig. 1), 32 nucleotides downstream of which a poly(A) tail was located. Apart from the DNA binding forkhead domain (amino acids 123-222, Fig. 1), FREAC-4 has a hyperacidic NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1-122, Fig. 1) and a COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 223-465, Fig. 1) with several stretches of homopolymeric runs of alanines and prolines, often seen in transcription factors. The NH2-terminal domain is extraordinary in its high density of charged amino acids; 40 out of the 100 most NH2-terminal amino acids carry a charged side chain. Of the 80 most NH2-terminal amino acids, 33 are either aspartic or glutamic acid; they are grouped in two “hyperacidic clusters.” This situation is very similar to what has been described for the COOH terminus of the nucleolar transcription factor UBF. In UBF this region is essential for transactivation and is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (38Voit R. Schnapp A. Kuhn A. Rosenbauer H. Hirschmann P. Stunnenberg H.G. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2211-2218Google Scholar). As in UBF, there are potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II in the corresponding region of FREAC-4 (39Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Google Scholar). Within the COOH-terminal domain of FREAC-4 we have identified a region (amino acids 241-312), by means of a computer homology search, as having similarities with the NH2-terminal region of WT-1. The main feature of this region is two homopolymeric runs of prolines separated by 45 amino acids. This region is located in the NH2-terminal part of WT-1, and deletions of these proline-rich regions partially inactivate the repressor function of WT-1 (40Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720Google Scholar). A genomic fragment of 5181 nucleotides from the FREAC-4 gene was also sequenced, and the cDNA was found to be collinear with the genomic sequence. Since the FREAC-4 transcript is estimated to be approximately 2.5 kilobase pairs (see Fig. 4) and the cDNA sequence spans a region of 2272 nucleotides, starting in the 3′-end at the first nucleotide that is not part of the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1), this gene is most likely intronless. A cRNA antisense probe of 364 nucleotides, corresponding to nucleotides 2122-2485 (Fig. 1), was synthesized together with size markers (see “Experimental Procedures”). The radiolabeled cRNA probe was hybridized with total RNA derived from the following cell types: yeast, 3T3, HeLa, and 293 cells. In total RNA derived from 293 cells, a fragment slightly larger than a size marker of 210 nucleotides was protected. The size of the protected fragment was estimated to be 212 nucleotides (Fig. 2). Thus, the transcription start is located 212 nucleotides upstream of nucleotide 2485, i.e. at nucleotide 2274 (Fig. 1). The 5′-end of the transcript is located at nucleotide 2274 and the 3′-nucleotide at 4792. This predicts a transcript size of 2519 nucleotides, which agrees well with an estimated transcript size on Northern blots of 2.5 kilobase pairs (Fig. 3). The transcription start is located some 30 nucleotides downstream of a canonical TATAA-motif. Notably, only total RNA from the kidney-derived cell line 293 contained the FREAC-4 transcript.Fig. 3Northern blot with total RNA from COS-7, 293, and HeLa cells, probed for FREAC-4 and β-actin transcripts. The FREAC-4 transcript has been estimated to be 2.5 kilobase pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to study transcriptional activation of the FREAC-4 gene we fused a genomic fragment (nucleotides 1-2654; Fig. 1) upstream of a luciferase reporter construct to make FREAC-4-luc. Using a Northern blot assay we could detect FREAC-4 mRNA in COS-7 and 293 cells, both of kidney origin, whereas a non-kidney-derived cell line such as HeLa cells did not express FREAC-4 (Fig. 3). When the FREAC-4-luc construct was transfected into COS-7 and 293 cells, we observed significant reporter gene activity. In HeLa cells no activity above that of background could be detected (Fig. 4), as was the case with a reporter gene construct lacking the FREAC-4 sequence (not shown). This demonstrates a cell type-specific promoter activity derived from the genomic upstream FREAC-4 fragment (nucleotides 1-2654; Fig. 1). When the FREAC-4-luc construct was cotransfected with a WT-1 expression plasmid, approximately a 3-fold induction was observed (Fig. 5). A dominant negative mutation of WT-1 has been identified in a patient with Wilms' tumor. In this case the third of four zinc fingers in the COOH terminus of WT-1 has a deletion (41Haber D.A. Buckler A.J. Glaser T. Call K.M. Pelletier J. Sohn R.L. Douglass E.C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 1257-1269Google Scholar). This mutation, WTAR, can suppress the activity of wild-type WT-1 in a trans-dominant fashion (42Haber D.A. Timmers H.T. Pelletier J. Sharp P.A. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6010-6014Google Scholar). When FREAC-4-luc was cotransfected with a WTAR expression plasmid, no significant difference in reporter gene activity was observed as compared with that of a cotransfection with an expression plasmid void of insert (Fig. 5). Another tumor suppressor gene, p53, has recently been implicated as a modulator of WT-1. It has been suggested that WT-1 acts as a repressor of transcription in the presence of wild-type p53 and as an activator in the absence of wild-type p53 (43Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Google Scholar). To test whether p53 is involved in the regulation of FREAC-4 we transfected a p53 expression plasmid together with FREAC-4-luc; this represses reporter gene activity approximately 4-fold (Fig. 5). In contrast, cotransfections with a mutated form of p53 (Arg175→ His) increases reporter gene activity by a factor of 7. This p53 mutation has been shown to inhibit the activity of wild-type p53 (44Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar). Thus, the induction can be seen as the release of a “p53 break” that in the presence of wild-type p53 reduces FREAC-4 reporter gene activity. Since high levels of p53 (45Schmid P. Lorenz A. Hameister H. Montenarh M. Development. 1991; 113: 857-865Google Scholar) and WT-1 (46Sharma P.M. Yang X. Bowman M. Roberts V. Sukumar S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6407-6412Google Scholar) are expressed in the kidney during embryogenesis, it is conceivable that these genes take part in the regulation of FREAC-4. Two derivatives of FREAC-4-luc, −527-luc and −152-luc extending 527 and 152 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start, were used to study the inducibility conferred by WT-1 in cotransfection experiments. As can be seen in Fig. 6, both −527-luc and −152-luc are induced approximately 3-4-fold as compared with mock transfections. Since the luciferase vector void of any FREAC-4 promoter sequence is not induced by WT-1 cotransfections, we concluded that the FREAC-4 promoter sequence in −152-luc (nucleotides 2274-2654 in Fig. 1), most likely contains binding site(s) for WT-1. Three potential WT-1 binding sites, conforming to the GNGNGGGNG consensus sequence (47Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Google Scholar), were identified on this DNA segment (nucleotides 2261-2269, 2353-2361, and 2371-2379 according to Fig. 1). We used a gel mobility shift assay to find out if any of these potential WT-1 binding sites would indeed interact with WT-1. Two double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring the potential WT-1 binding sites (oligonucleotide A, nucleotides 2253-2277, and oligonucleotide B, nucleotides 2345-2389, according to Fig. 1) were synthesized. They were used in a gel mobility shift assay as can be seen in Fig. 7B. Oligonucleotide A renders a retardation band that is specific for the WT-1-containing extract. This interaction seems to be specific, since it can be extinguished by including a 50-fold excess of an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, containing a known WT-1 binding site from the TGF-β1 promoter (35Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher III, F.J. Kim S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Google Scholar), in the gel shift binding reaction (see “Experimental Procedures”). In Fig. 7A the WT-1 binding site of oligonucleotide A is compared with other cis-elements known to interact with WT-1. Oligonucleotide B does not interact with recombinant WT-1 in the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 7A). Thus, the FREAC-4 promoter contains at least one binding site capable of interacting with WT-1.Fig. 7Panel A, sequence comparison of five sites known to interact with WT-1, numbering relative to the start of transcription (human transforming growth factor β1 (hTGF-β1), human insulin-like growth factor II (hIGF-II), human platelet-derived growth factor A chain (hPDGF-A), mouse immediate early growth response gene 1 (mEGR-1), and a WT-1 binding site present in the FREAC-4 promoter (this site is present on oligonucleotide A (Oligo A) used in the gel mobility shift experiments shown in Fig. 8B). Panel B, gel mobility shift experiments with probes containing potential WT-1 binding sites within the FREAC-4 promoter; oligonucleotide A (A) (nucleotides 2253-2277 in Fig. 1) and oligonucleotide B (B) (nucleotides 2345-2389 in Fig. 1) were used as probes. Extracts containing recombinant human WT-1 (WT) and a control extract (C) were used (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). A 50-fold molar excess of an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a known WT-1 binding site derived from the human TGF-β1 promoter was used as a specific competitor (W) (for details see “Experimental Procedures”. An arrow points out the retardation product specific for the WT-1-containing extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have sequenced cDNA and genomic clones corresponding to FREAC-4. A hyperacidic motif in the NH2-terminal part and a proline-rich region in the COOH-terminal domain of FREAC-4 are, based on sequence similarities with the transcription factors UBF and WT-1, identified as possible effector sites. Computer homology searches have identified BF-2 (48Hatini V. Tao W. Lai E. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1293-1309Google Scholar), a recently cloned mouse cDNA with a high degree of sequence similarity to that of FREAC-4, as a good candidate for the mouse homolog of FREAC-4. This notion is underscored by matching patterns of expression, i.e. predominantly brain and kidney cells 1P. Carlsson and S. Enerbäck, unpublished observations. (48Hatini V. Tao W. Lai E. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1293-1309Google Scholar). In a previous publication we have shown that mRNA derived from kidney, of adult as well as fetal origin, together with testis are the only tissues out of 21 different sources of RNA that express FREAC-4 mRNA (15Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 1354: 5002-5012Google Scholar). In situ hybridization data from Hatini et al. (48Hatini V. Tao W. Lai E. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1293-1309Google Scholar) as well as our unpublished observations1 demonstrate a similar pattern of expression to that of WT-1, i.e. the area around the IV ventricle, medulla spinalis, kidney, and testis (46Sharma P.M. Yang X. Bowman M. Roberts V. Sukumar S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6407-6412Google Scholar, 49Rackley R.R. Flenniken A.M. Kuriyan N.P. Kessler P.M. Stoler M.H. Williams B.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1023-1031Google Scholar, 50Armstrong J.F. Pritchard-Jones K. Bickmore W.A. Hastie N.D. Bard J.B. Mech. Dev. 1993; 40: 85-97Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that (i) WT-1 and FREAC-4 both are transcription factors, (ii) WT-1 transactivates a FREAC-4 reporter gene construct in a cotransfection assay, and (iii) they have similar patterns of expression. Cotransfection experiments indicate the tumor suppressor genes p53 and WT-1 as potential regulators of FREAC-4. A WT-1 binding site within the FREAC-4 promoter is identified. Thus, there is evidence of circumstantial nature of several overlapping characteristics between FREAC-4 and WT-1. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that only about 10% of Wilms' tumors have mutations in the coding region of the WT-1 gene (51Little M.H. Prosser J. Condie A. Smith P.J. Van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4791-4795Google Scholar, 52Schneider S. Wildhardt G. Ludwig R. Royer-Pokora B. Hum. Genet. 1993; 91: 599-604Google Scholar, 53Hofmann W. Royer H.D. Drechsler M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3123-3132Google Scholar). This suggests that mutations are either present in regions other than the coding parts of the WT-1 gene (e.g. introns and cis-regulatory regions) or that mutations in other genes contribute to tumor formation. In this context we would like to speculate that FREAC-4 could play a role. In a recent publication we have assigned FREAC-4 to the chromosomal position of 5q12-13 (54Larsson C. Hellqvist M. Pierrou S. White I. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. Genomics. 1995; 30: 464-469Google Scholar). Patients with chromosomal duplications in this region exhibit common clinical features such as dysplastic kidneys and mental disorders (55McGillivray B.C. Bassett A.S. Langlois S. Pantzar T. Wood S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1990; 35: 10-13Google Scholar, 56Breslau-Siderius E.J. Wijnen J.T. Dauwerse J.G. de Pater J.M. Beemer F.A. Khan P.M. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 481-485Google Scholar). The anatomical sites for these clinical findings seem to match the tissue distribution of FREAC-4 mRNA. Hence, an increased gene dosage of FREAC-4 could not be ruled as a possible cause of these abnormalities. We thank Drs. Daniel Haber, Frank J. Rauscher III, and Bert Vogelstein for sharing plasmids with us."

One of the ultimate outcomes of the metabolism of nutrients is the establishment of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. F1F0-ATP synthase, located on the inner surface of the inner membrane, converts energy derived from the gradient into ATP (reviewed in References 1 and 2). Its activity is partly regulated by the availability of substrates and the proton flux through the membrane (1Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol.

The 1.1-kb e subunit gene was mapped to Chromosome 5 (Chr 5) near D5Mit9 by scoring a PstI RFLP in PCR-amplified (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 × C57BL/6J (BSB) segregants of The Jackson Laboratory Backcross DNA panel (9Rowe L.B.

We have also analyzed the relative abundance and temporal regulation of e subunit/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels in heart tissue of BALB/cHnn mice during a fast/refeed regimen following their 2-week ad libitum consumption of diets containing 3%, 10%, and 20% corn oil. Statistically significant differences in main effects were observed between e subunit mRNA levels when there were differences in dietary corn oil concentrations and in times after eating. Similar results were obtained with liver. DNA probes for Southern and Northern hybridization analyses were prepared by random priming (Amersham Corp.) of pLMC-1, a cDNA clone encoding BALB/cHnn Lfm1 (murine e subunit gene; Ref. 8Elliott T.S.

Primer sequences and cDNA are referred to as Lfm1, while genomic sequences and mRNA are designated as the e subunit. In some experiments, e subunit probes were prepared by PCR with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Irvine, CA). Primers were either e subunit-specific (see Fig. 2) or T7 and SP6 (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Commun. 1993; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and unpublished sequence data about the mouse cDNA Lfm1 gene were used to design 4 oligonucleotides for amplifying e subunit sequences from genomic DNA. These are shown in Fig. 2. One µg of BALB/c genomic DNA was amplified with oligonucleotides complementary to +36 →+61 and +222 →+198 (referred to as internal primers) in 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5-9.5), 15 mM NH4SO4, 2 mM MgCl2 (Buffers B, F, or J of the Invitrogen Optimizer™ kit; Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA), 0.5 mM in each dNTP in a total volume of 20 µl. Reactions were heated to 95°C for 2 min followed by addition of 0.25 µl of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction conditions were 3 min at 95°C, 35 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 1 min at 50°C or 55°C, and 3 min at 72°C. Products were directly cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) according to manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen pCRII™ kit). A second amplification was done with oligonucleotides complementary to −29 →−4 and +233 →+208 (external primers) of the Lfm1 cDNA sequence, and the fragments were cloned in pCRII. Cloned DNAs were sequenced with double-stranded sequencing methods with Sequenase II kits (US Biochemical Corp.) following conditions suggested by the manufacturer. GenBank (National Center for Biological Information, National Library of Medicine, NIH) was searched for similar sequences. Comparisons between published sequences were done with ALIGN and AALIGN programs (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Two hundred ng of M. spretus, C57BL/6J, and the BSB backcross panel DNAs were substrates for DNA amplification in 10 µl with Buffer J as described above. The primers were Lfm1 (e subunit)-specific encoding nucleotides +36 →+61 and sequences complementary to +198 →+222. Following amplification, the reactions were adjusted to 50 µl with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA (TE buffer) and the DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of cold 100% EtOH. DNA precipitates were pelleted for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, resuspended in 10 µl of TE buffer, and digested with PstI (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 20 ml. Digestion products were resolved on a 1% agarose Tris acetate/EDTA gel (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Klingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar) with ethidium bromide. BSS Backcross Panel DNA blots were hybridized and washed with Church hybridization buffers at 65°C (11Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Allele typings were compared to all previously mapped loci in the appropriate Jackson interspecific backcrosses and matched to their best-fit map positions by minimizing double crossovers and inferring phenotypes for untyped noncrossover animals. Animals, diet composition, 2All diets contained a base of 20 g of alcohol-extracted casein, 5 g cellulose, 1 g of AIN-76A vitamin mix (25American Institute, Nutrition J.

In addition, the 3% corn oil diet contained 3 g of corn oil, 40 g of corn starch, 14.5 g of sucrose, 0.3 g of DL-methionine, 2.5 g of AIN-76A mineral mix (25American Institute, Nutrition J.

The 10% corn oil diet contained the base plus 9.8 g of corn oil, 28.1 g of corn starch, 11.2 g of sucrose, 0.3 g of DL-methionine, and 3.5 g of mineral mix for a total of 91.7 g. The 20% corn oil diet contained the base plus 16.6 g of corn oil, 16.1 g of corn starch, 7.9 g of sucrose, 0.4 g of DL-methionine, and 4.5 g of mineral mix for a total of 83.1 g. and liver RNA isolation for the experiments reported briefly here are described by Paisley et al. 3Paisley, E. A., Park, E. I., Swartz, D. A., Mangian, H. J., Visek, W. J., and Kaput, J. (1996) J. Nutr., in press. BALB/cHnn mice (Harlan-Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were fed a semipurified diet containing 3% corn oil for 1 week and then randomly assigned for 2 weeks to the same 3% corn oil diets or otherwise identical diets, with 10% or 20% corn oil replacing carbohydrates isocalorically. Room lighting was on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Groups of animals were killed at predesignated times at the end of the 2-week feeding period as follows; at the end of a 12-h light cycle (ad libitum fed), after 12 h without food (−2 h, fasted), and at the end of a 12-h fasting phase followed by a 2-h period with food provided (0 h). All uneaten food was removed from the cages at 0 h, and three other groups were killed at 1, 2, and 6 h after the end of the 2-h period with food available. The quantity of food placed in the cages at the beginning of the 2-h feeding period was 80% of the average daily food consumption during the proceeding 2 weeks.3 Total RNA was extracted from ground livers and hearts by the Ultra-SpecII RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Houston, TX). Twenty µg of total heart RNA were resolved by electrophoresis in gels containing 1.2% agarose and 2.2 M formaldehyde at 110 V for 2.5 h. Sizes were estimated by comparison to a 0.24-9.5-kb ladder of synthetic RNA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gels were stained with 0.5 mg/liter ethidium bromide, photographed, and blotted onto nylon membranes (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) following standard protocols (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Klingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Hybridizations were in 7% SDS, 0.5 M NaPO4 (pH7.2), 1 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS at 65°C with one 4% SDS, 40 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA wash at 65°C for 15 min and three 15-min washes with 1% SDS, 40 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA at 65°C (11Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) 425S PhosphorImager, and autoradiograms were obtained by placing blots next to preflashed film (0.25-s flash through a diffusion plate to give A540 nm = 0.2). The e subunit mRNAs were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels because two actin mRNAs are expressed in heart tissues. The e subunit/GAPDH mRNA ratios from individual hearts were normalized to the ratio of e subunit/GAPDH in identical aliquots (approximately 20 µg) of a control RNA analyzed on each of the five blots. The control RNA, isolated from 5 pooled hearts of BALB/c mice fed 10% corn oil diets ad libitum, was used to control for blot to blot variation. Based upon the specific activity of the probes, PhosphorImager counts and efficiency, and the duration of exposure, there were approximately 107 molecules of e subunit mRNA/20 µg of total RNA. Liver RNA hybridizations and analyses were as described previously (8Elliott T.S. Swartz D.A. Paisley E.A. Mangian H.J. Visek W.J. Kaput J. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hepatic e subunit mRNA was normalized to β-actin mRNA as a control for loading and expressed as a ratio of e subunit/β-actin mRNAs. The data were normalized to e subunit/β-actin mRNAs in hepatic total RNA from mice fed 3% corn oil. Effects of sacrifice time and linear trends with dietary fat level were evaluated in two-way analyses of variance, followed by examination of trends with fat level at individual sacrifice times. The SAS GLM program (12SAS Institute, Inc. SAS/STAT ™ Guide for Personal Computers. SAS Institute, Cary, NC1987: 549-640Google Scholar) was employed for statistical computing, with p < 0.05 employed as nominal criterion of statistical significance. Bonferroni's method (13Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics. 3rd Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1992Google Scholar) was used to adjust for testing of fat trend at five separate times, requiring that an observed p < (0.05/5 = 0.01) be the standard of statistical significance for fat trend at any single sacrifice time. Four prominent DNA fragments A (900 bp), B (800 bp), C (350 bp), and D (200 bp) from BALB/cJ (not shown), C57BL/6J, and M. spretus genomic DNA were amplified by PCR using the internal Lfm1-specific primers, +36 →+61 and +222 →+198 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5). Fragment A encoded an e subunit gene beginning at nucleotide +36 of the cDNA sequence (with +1 the A of the initiating ATG) and ending at +216. This gene contained 3 exons and 2 introns and the sequence of the exons differed by 1 base pair (Fig. 2, nucleotide 611) from the previously reported Lfm1 cDNA sequence (8Elliott T.S. Swartz D.A. Paisley E.A. Mangian H.J. Visek W.J. Kaput J. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but lacked the expected coding nucleotides +1 to +35. A second PCR reaction was performed with oligonucleotides complementary to −29 →−4, the untranslated region of the cDNA sequence, and +233 →+208, which overlaps the TAG termination codon (+214 →+216). Three prominent DNA fragments of 1.1 kb (A′), 900 bp (B′), and 250 bp (D′) were produced (data not shown). The 1.1-kb fragment (A′) encoded the 900-bp A fragment obtained with the internal primers plus a 5′ exon and an additional intron. The sequences of the 4 exons match the cDNA sequence exactly (Fig. 2) except for two substitutions. Cytosine at 310 of the genomic clone is replaced by thymidine in the cDNA. This base overlapped the +36 →+61 primer used for the first amplification (Fig. 2). Guanosine at 611 is replaced by an adenosine in the cDNA.

With conservative amino acid substitutions considered, murine Lfm1 is 98% similar to the protein sequence of rat liver e subunit and 96% similar to bovine heart e subunit. Fragment C (370 bp) amplified by the internal set of primers encoded nucleotides +36 to +218 of the e subunit cDNA sequence joined by 4 nucleotides of unknown origin to nucleotides +38 to +222 of a second e subunit cDNA sequence (data not shown). Some of the nucleotide substitutions (5 total) in the first half of this gene created translation termination codons. The second half had seven substitutions with several termination codons and a dinucleotide deletion. This pseudogene was not found in over 200 clones of BALB/cJ, C57BL/6J, and M. spretus genomic DNAs amplified with oligonucleotides hybridizing to noncoding sequences (external primers) of the e subunit cDNA gene indicating that flanking sequences differed from those flanking the 1.1-kb gene. No e subunit sequences other than primer sequences were found within 390 and 320 base pairs of either end of fragment B′. This sequence matched no sequence in GenBank and was not further analyzed. Fragment D was not sequenced. Fig. 1 (lanes 3 and 7) shows polymorphism in amplification products between C57BL/6J and M. spretus parental DNAs after digestion with PstI (Fig. 2 at nucleotdies 426 → 432). XhoI control digestions (site at 419 → 424 in Fig. 2) produced similar 650 bp products (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 8) for DNA amplified from these strains. The 1.1-kb e subunit gene was mapped by amplifying 94 segregants in the BSB Backcross Panel DNAs from The Jackson Laboratory with the internal Lfm1 cDNA primers followed by PstI digestion (data not shown). All 94 animals were typed. The gene maps to Chr 5 (left chromosome in Fig. 3), 2.13 ± 1.49 cM distal from D5Mit9 (two crossovers out of 94 animals; Ref. 16Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), 1996, BSS and BSB Backcross Data Base, http://www.jax.org/resources/documents/cmdata.Google Scholar). We designated this locus Atp5k 5Mouse Genome Data Base (MGD) accession numbers are as follows. Atp5k on Chromosome 5 (Genome Data Base U59283) in the BSB backcross is MGD-CREX-500 (loci D5Nsd2, D5Bir13, D5Bir14, D5Mit9, D5Bir15, D5Bir16, Atp5k, D5Bir20, D5Mit30, D5Mit63) and MGD-CREX-501 in the BSS backcross (loci D5Mit9, Atp5k, Cox6a1); Atp5k-rs1 Chromosome 2 (loci D2Mit61, D2Bir9, Atp5k-rs1) is MGD-CREX-505; Atp5k-rs2, Chromosome 2 (loci D2Mit52, D2Mit25, Atp5k-rs2, Gnas, D2Mit74) is MGD-CREX 497; Atp5k-rs3, Chromosome 8 (loci D8Mit29, Gcdh, Atp5k-rs3, D8Bir23, D8Mit15) is MGD-CREX 498; Atp5k-rs4, Chromosome 11 (loci Scya11, D11Mit36, Atp5k-rs4, D11Bir11, D11Mit14) is MGD-CREX 499. in consultation with the Mouse Genome Data base and Nomenclature Committees (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Radiolabeled e subunit sequences were also hybridized to Southern blots of TaqI-digested Jackson Laboratory BSS Backcross Panel DNAs (Fig. 4). The 1.1-kb e subunit probe detected sequences on Chr 5 (5.1- and 0.9-kb bands, equivalent to the locus mapped in the BSB cross by PCR), Chr 8 (3.5 kb), Chr 11 (∼7 kb), and two sites on Chr 2 (5.8 and 0.7 kb) (Fig. 5). Similarly to the BSB PCR mapping data above, the Chr 5 e subunit-related sequences (Atp5k) map 2.13 ± 1.49 cM distal from D5Mit9 in the BSS cross if the 13 missing noncrossover typings are inferred from surrounding data (Fig. 3, right chr; Ref. 16Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), 1996, BSS and BSB Backcross Data Base, http://www.jax.org/resources/documents/cmdata.Google Scholar). Interpretation based upon combining the PCR/RFLP and Southern hybridization mapping data places the e subunit 2.13 ± 1.05 cM distal to D5Mit9 (four crossovers out of 188 animals).Fig. 5Segregation analyses of three e subunit-related sequences typed in BSS DNA Backcross DNA panel by Southern hybridization analyses.

Sequencing of the entire 6.3-kilobase gene and comparison with other mammalian seminal vesicle secretory protein genes reveals a common three-exon, two-intron organization. However, significant sequence similarity between this group of genes is largely limited to their 5′-flanking regions and first exons, which code almost exclusively for signal peptides in each case. The first intron of GP1G does contain a region with high similarity to the coding exon of a human seminal vesicle secretory protein gene, semenogelin II. The 3′ half of the GP1G gene appears to share a common ancestry with the human SKALP/elafin gene. Sequences related to the elafin promoter, coding, untranslated regions, and introns are clearly identifiable within the GP1G sequence. The elafin gene codes for a serine protease inhibitor and is expressed in a variety of different human tissues. To determine if the GP1G gene was also active outside of the seminal vesicle, RNA from a variety of guinea pig tissues was hybridized to a GP1G cDNA probe. At least three novel RNA bands hybridizing to the GP1G probe were detected in testis RNA samples, and GP1G-related mRNAs were also found in other tissues.

These data suggest that these seminal vesicle secretory proteins may have functional roles outside the reproductive system. The seminal vesicle is an androgen-dependent male reproductive organ that synthesizes and secretes a protein-filled fluid that makes up a major portion of the ejaculated semen. Although some of these secretions appear to be capable of maintaining the integrity, motility, and/or transport of spermatozoa, the role of the seminal vesicle in reproduction is not well understood (reviewed in Ref. 1Aumuller G. Steitz J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 121: 127-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In guinea pigs, the seminal vesicle synthesizes and secretes four abundant seminal vesicle secretory proteins (SVSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SVSPseminal vesicle secretory proteinUTRuntranslated regionkbkilobase pairsbpbase pair(s)ntnucleotidesSGsemenogelin. called SVP-1-4. Biochemical studies have indicated that the copulatory plug in the guinea pig is formed by the action of a prostate-secreted transglutaminase on SVP-1 (2Veneziale C.M. Deering N.C.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SVP-1 contains 8.5 repeats of a 24-amino acid glutamine- and lysine-rich clotting domain and is therefore ideally suited for a role as a transglutaminase substrate (4Moore J.T. Hagstrom J. McCormick D.J. Harvey S. Madden B. Holicky E. Stanford D.R. Wieben E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6712-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mature SVP-1 is a 22-kDa protein that is cleaved from the carboxyl terminus of a 45-kDa polypeptide precursor. The amino terminus of the 45-kDa precursor codes for both SVP-3 and SVP-4. These two acidic SVSPs can be distinguished on the basis of net charge, but partial sequencing at the protein level indicates that they share an identical primary sequence (5Hagstrom J.E. Harvey S. Madden B. McCormick D. Wieben E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of SVP-3/-4 also contains four copies of a 24-amino acid repeating domain structure, suggesting that these proteins could also be involved in clot formation. However, the amino acid repeat in SVP-3/-4 is unrelated to the SVP-1 repeat, and the function of SVP-3/-4 has yet to be determined. seminal vesicle secretory protein untranslated region kilobase pairs base pair(s) nucleotides semenogelin. The functional human homologs of guinea pig SVP-1 are the semenogelins. Semenogelin I (Sg I) is a 52-kDa protein that is cross-linked to form a clot in human semen, but the clot is rapidly digested through the action of seminal fluid proteases, including the serine protease prostate-specific antigen (6Lilja H. Abrahamsson P.-A. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Semenogelin II (Sg II) is a second secretory protein produced in both the seminal vesicle and epididymis that is approximately 80% identical to Sg I at the amino acid level (7Lilja H. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4559-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both semenogelin genes contain three exons. In each case, the first exon codes for the signal peptide, the second exon codes for the secreted protein, and the third exon contains a strictly 3′-untranslated region (8Ulvsbäck M. Lazure C. Lilja H. Spurr N.G. Rao V.V.N.G. Löffler C. Hansmann I. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18080-18084PubMed Google Scholar). These two genes are greater than 80% identical within their introns and 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, suggesting that they arose by the duplication of a common ancestral gene. Although there is little coding sequence similarity between the human and rat seminal vesicle secretory protein genes, the rat genes also have a central exon coding for the secreted protein flanked by a 5′-exon coding for the signal peptide and a 3′-exon coding for the 3′-UTR (9Harris S.E.

The conservation of gene structure within the secretory protein genes of different mammals led us to determine the gene structure for the guinea pig gene (called GP1G) that yields SVP-1, SVP-3, and SVP-4. Our data indicate that sequences homologous to the coding exon of the human Sg II gene reside in the first intron of the GP1G. Furthermore, GP1G appears to be more closely related to the human SKALP/elafin gene rather than to any of the SVSP genes. The elafin gene produces a serine protease inhibitor that contains an amino-terminal transglutaminase cross-linking domain (13Alkemade J.A.C. Molhuizen H.O.F. Ponec M. Kempenaar J.A. Zeeuwen P.L.J.M. de Jongh G.J. van Vlijmen-Willems I.M.J.J. van Erp P.E.J. van de Kerkhof P.C.M. Schalkwijk J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sallenave J. Silva A.

Commun. 1992; 185: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on this homology, we investigated the expression of the GP1G gene in other tissues. Northern blot analysis revealed that GP1G transcripts are present outside the seminal vesicle, including three larger hybridizing mRNAs in the testis. The presence of SVP-1 gene products in these tissues suggests that this protein has another function outside of its role in formation of the copulatory plug during reproduction. A guinea pig testis genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened with a 32P-nick-translated 1400-bp probe corresponding to the cDNA for GP1 (5Hagstrom J.E. Harvey S. Madden B. McCormick D. Wieben E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Five individual positive clones were selected and amplified. A 14.5-kb insert from one clone, 1321, was excised with SalI and subcloned into Bluescribe (+) (Stratagene). Restriction fragments were subcloned into M13mp18 and M13mp19 and sequenced in both orientations using either Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or automated sequencing performed with either an Applied Biosystems, Inc. or Pharmacia Biotech Inc. DNA sequencer. Four µg of guinea pig liver genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Micron Separations, Inc.) by diffusion using 10 × SSC. The blotted filter was probed with a [32P]dATP random primed 1400-bp GP1 cDNA (5Hagstrom J.E. Harvey S. Madden B. McCormick D. Wieben E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) at 42°C overnight in 8% dextran sulfate, 46% formamide, 4.5 × SSC, 9 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% SDS, 4.6 × Denhardt's solution, and 0.15 µg/ml salmon testis DNA. Following hybridization overnight at 42°C, the filter was washed in 0.1 × SSC and 0.25% SDS at 50°C for 2 h. The blot was exposed to film for 18 h at −70°C with an intensifying screen. Total RNA was isolated by the method of Cathala et al. (16Cathala G.G. Savouret J. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA (N. Y.). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), separated on a 1.0% agarose,2.2 formaldehyde gel, and transferred to MSI nylon by diffusion using 10 × SSC. The blotted filter was probed with a [32P]dATP random primed 1400-bp GP1 cDNA, washed, and exposed to film as described for the genomic Southern blot. The software package of the Genetics Computer Group was used to analyze and align nucleotide sequences (17Genetics Computer Group, Inc., 1994, Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). To estimate the number of copies of SVP-1/-3/-4-related sequences in the guinea pig genome, genomic DNA samples were hybridized with a 1400-bp cDNA probe coding for SVP-1/-3/-4 cDNA (GP1, see Ref. 5Hagstrom J.E. Harvey S. Madden B. McCormick D. Wieben E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A single band hybridizing with this probe was obtained in each case (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the guinea pig genome contains either a single copy of the gene for these secretory proteins or several copies of the gene in a similar genomic environment. To isolate genomic clones, we screened a guinea pig testis genomic library with GP1. Sequencing of one of five clones isolated from this library (1321) revealed that the SVP-1/-3/-4 gene spans approximately 6.3 kb and is organized into three exons that correspond to functional domains. The first exon is 93 nt in length and includes sequences for the 5′-UTR, the hydrophobic signal peptide, and the first 4 amino acids of mature SVP-3/-4 (Fig. 2). The second exon is 1127 nt long and encodes the vast majority of the protein coding region including the remainder of SVP-3/-4 and all of SVP-1. Exon three is 185 nts long and codes exclusively for the 3′-UTR. The primary structures of SVSPs from several mammalian species have been deduced from cloned cDNA sequences (6Lilja H. Abrahamsson P.-A. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lilja H. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4559-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10McDonald C.J. Eliopoulos E. Higgins S.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Harris S.E.

Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although many of the proteins contain repeated sequences with invariant glutamine, lysine, serine, and glycine residues, there is no specific primary sequence common to all. However, in each case, evolution has maintained a three-exon, two-intron structure with significant conservation of 5′-flanking and first exon sequences. The region of similarity includes both the TATA box and a 13-nt sequence found approximately 90 nt upstream of the transcription start site of all seminal vesicle secretory protein genes (the −90 sequence, Fig. 2). The SVP-1/-3/-4 gene has a perfect 13/13 nucleotide match to the consensus −90 sequence, which was first noted by Williams et al. (12Williams L. McDonald C. Higgins S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as a conserved element with similarity to a CCAAT box. In this regard, it is notable that GP1G also has a perfect match to the consensus CCAAT box sequence upstream of the transcription start site (underlined in Fig. 2). Similarity between GP1G and the upstream regions of the rat SVS II, IV and V genes extends beyond these sequences, and each has about 60% identity to GP1G within the first 140 nt of 5′-flanking sequence (9Harris S.E. Mansson P.E. Tully D.B. Burkhart B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Johnson C.M. Bean M.F. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Williams L. McDonald C. Higgins S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The first exons of the rat and guinea pig genes are even more related, with the predicted signal peptides of SVS IV and V having 12/21 and 10/21 identity to the GP1G product (Fig. 3). The SVSP gene with the greatest similarity to GP1G is the human Sg II gene (8Ulvsbäck M. Lazure C. Lilja H. Spurr N.G. Rao V.V.N.G. Löffler C. Hansmann I. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18080-18084PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and C). Comparison of the 5′-flanking 650 nucleotides of the GP1 gene to the corresponding region of the human Sg II gene revealed a 65% nucleotide conservation throughout this region. In addition to the 5′-flanking region, the first exons of the GP1 and Sg II genes are 78% identical at the nucleotide level and code for signal peptides with 15/21 identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the two genes may have diverged from a common ancestral gene. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the similarity between GP1G and the Sg II genes continues past the first exons. In contrast to the 4.5-kb first intron of the GP1G gene, the first intron of the Sg II gene is relatively short (0.25 kb). Homology between the two genes is not only maintained through the span of the human intron but continues with significant homology between the second exon of the Sg II gene and the 5′-end of the first intron of GP1G. The matrix comparison demonstrates that the GP1G intron contains a single copy of a sequence that is repeated 6 times in the human coding exon. This finding correlates well with the known structure of the Sg II coding sequence, which contains four copies of a 180-nt sequence (type I) and two copies of a related (type II) repeat (7Lilja H. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4559-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons of the entire second exon of Sg II with the 5′-half of the GP1G exon reveal an overall similarity of 57% through this span. However, using the BESTFIT algorithm (17Genetics Computer Group, Inc., 1994, Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, Madison, WI.Google Scholar), a 139-nt stretch of a type II Sg II repeat is found to be 69% identical to the GP1G intron without the insertion of any gaps in either sequence. This level of similarity further supports the hypothesis that the guinea pig and human genes evolved from a common ancestral gene. However, DNA sequences used by the human gene to code for the seminal vesicle secretory protein were relegated to intron status in the guinea pig lineage. While there are definite evolutionary relationships between the GP1 gene and other SVSP genes, searches of the entire GenBank data base with GP1G sequence reveal that GP1G is most closely related to the human SKALP/elafin gene (14Sallenave J. Silva A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Saheki T. Ito F. Hagiwara H. Saito Y. Kuroki J. Tachibana S. Hirose S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Homology between the elafin precursor and SVP-1 at the amino acid level has been noted previously and was used to predict the presence of a functional transglutaminase cross-linking domain in the amino terminus of the primary translation product of the elafin gene (19Molhuizen H.O.F. Alkemade H.A.C. Zeeuwen P.L.J.M. deJongh G.J. Wieringa B. Schalkwijk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12028-12032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nara K. Ito S. Ito T. Suzuki Y. Ghoneim M.A. Tachibana S. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As noted for the SVSPs, the elafin precursor has a primary structure that is based on amino acid repeats containing invariant lysine, glutamine, and glycine residues. The human elafin gene also has the same three-exon structure as the SVSP genes but spans only 1.7 kb in its entirety. Dot matrix comparison of the human elafin gene with GP1G at high stringency (16/21, requiring 76% identity over 21 nucleotides to register a match) reveals extensive similarity throughout the entire length of the elafin gene (Fig. 4, B and C). The region of homology extends to both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of the elafin gene and is maximal between the second introns and third (non-coding) exons (Fig. 5), which are 70% identical with only 4 gaps. Within the coding sequences, the similarity is highest between the amino terminus of the elafin gene product and the SVP-1 coding sequence. The elafin gene does not contain a region homologous to SVP-3/-4, nor does the GP1G gene contain a region homologous to the carboxyl-terminal protease inhibitor domain of human elafin. Our understanding of the function of SVSPs has been that these proteins are involved in providing an appropriate environment for sperm transfer to the female and in the formation of the copulatory plug. However, the presence of an elafin gene homolog embedded within the guinea pig GP1 gene suggested the possibility that sequences from this genomic locus could also be expressed outside the seminal vesicle. Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from several guinea pig tissues revealed that GP1-related transcripts are, in fact, present outside the seminal vesicle (Fig. 6). The GP1-related transcripts identified in the lung, liver, and kidney appear to be the same size as those produced in the seminal vesicle. However, the testis RNA sample yielded three bands that hybridized to the GP1 probe. The smallest of these bands migrates just slower than the GP1 mRNA produced in the seminal vesicle, whereas the two larger species appear to be at least 500 nt larger than the major seminal vesicle GP1 mRNA. The SVSPs appear to belong to a growing list of genes that code for proteins involved in reproduction that exhibit unusual divergence within protein coding regions (10McDonald C.J. Eliopoulos E. Higgins S.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Whitfield L.S. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1993; 364: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 22Tucker P.K. Lundrigan B.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 715-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4957-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). While GP1G appears to share common regulatory sequences and signal peptides with the SVSPs from other mammals, the protein coding region has little similarity to the coding exons of those genes. The 5′-end of the guinea pig gene is most closely related to the Sg II gene, which codes for a functional homolog of SVP-1. The alignment of the 5′-flanking regions and first exons of these two genes is straightforward and reveals a high level of sequence identity over a span of 750 nt (Fig. 4). By itself, this extended similarity could be interpreted as either conservation of sequence from a common ancestor or convergent evolution based on a functional requirement for specific sequences necessary to effect high level expression of these proteins in the seminal vesicle. However, the finding that sequences related to the human Sg II exon are found in the first intron of the GP1G gene argues strongly in favor of a common ancestral secretory protein gene. This hypothesis suggests that a single ancestral sequence has been selected for function as a coding exon in the human and as intron in the guinea pig. Subsequent duplications of functional domains involved in cross-linking in each lineage would account for much of the difference between the present day coding sequences. This hypothetical pattern of evolution is reminiscent of the selective amplification of different repeat segments during the evolution of the involucrin gene, which also codes for a transglutaminase substrate (24Tseng H. Green H. Cell. 1988; 54: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of the GP1G intron in the region of homology to the 3′-splice site of the Sg II gene suggests a possible explanation for this unusual evolutionary pattern. While the overall sequence similarity near the Sg II splice junctions is quite good, the GP1G gene contains an additional AG dinucleotide seven bases upstream of the 3′-splice junction that is used in the Sg II gene (Fig. 7). If the upstream AG is actually used as a splice acceptor by the splicing apparatus, it would lead to the production of a spliced product that is out of frame with the Sg II product. Under these circumstances, the use of a splice acceptor site in a downstream ancestral elafin gene could have been favored (Fig. 4C). Thus, a single A → G transition creating this AG immediately upstream of the active splice junction could have been a pivotal event in the divergence of the coding sequences for these SVSPs. Whatever the cause, it is clear that the coding sequence in the second exon of the GP1G gene is not related to that of the Sg II gene except for the presence of repeated motifs coding for invariant Lys, Gln, Gly, and Ser residues. Neither the length of the repeats nor the actual sequence of the repeating units appears to have been critical during the divergence of these genes. The preferential conservation of UTRs over coding regions has been noted before in a comparison of the sequences of two rat seminal vesicle secretory protein mRNA sequences (10McDonald C.J. Eliopoulos E. Higgins S.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The current analysis extends this observation to other members of this gene family and demonstrates that the 5′-flanking regions and introns can also maintain a higher degree of conservation than coding regions for this family of genes. It is tempting to speculate that the rapid divergence of the coding sequences might promote increased resistance of the copulatory plug to proteolysis. Thus, there might be direct positive selection for diversity in these seminal vesicle proteins as there is in acrosomal proteins of the abalone (23Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4957-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as suggested by McDonald et al. (10McDonald C.J. Eliopoulos E. Higgins S.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this unusual pattern of sequence divergence might simply reflect the lack of selection for a particular protein sequence since any repetitive sequence capable of forming intermolecular cross-links could fulfill the known role for these proteins in reproduction. The evolutionary history of other genes that have experienced unusual patterns of divergence is often obscure. In the case of GP1G, a key factor in the divergence from the Sg II gene could have been the appropriation of coding sequences from an ancestral elafin gene. Whatever the origin, the presence of a nearly full-length elafin gene embedded in the GP1G gene is unexpected and suggests that the protein products of GP1G might have additional functional roles. The only known function of the SVSPs is to participate in the formation of the vaginal plug after copulation. In the guinea pig, biochemical studies suggest that SVP-1 is the major component of the vaginal plug (3Notides A.C. Williams-Ashman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Williams-Ashman H.G. Notides A.C. Pabalan S.S. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2322-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The transient clotting of human semen appears to be due primarily to the formation of disulfide bridges between molecules of semenogelin although a contribution from transglutaminase activity has not been excluded (6Lilja H. Abrahamsson P.-A. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lilja H. Oldbring J. Rannevik G. Laurell C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although SVP-1 contains no cysteine (and therefore cannot use disulfide linkages in clot formation), both of the semenogelins are rich in glutamines and lysines and could presumably function as transglutaminase substrates. Whatever cross-linking mechanism is operative, there is no reason for proteins involved solely in the formation of the vaginal plug to be expressed outside the reproductive system. However, our data suggest that GP1G mRNAs are easily detectable in total RNA samples from the kidney, liver, and lung. At least three novel mRNAs from the testis also hybridize to a GP1 cDNA probe. Expression of the SVSP genes outside the seminal vesicle is not limited to the guinea pig. Sg II mRNA is also produced in the epididymis (6Lilja H. Abrahamsson P.-A. Lundwall AC AC AC Ao AC J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat SVS II transcripts are found in the prostate (27Dodd J.G. Kreis C. Sheppard P.C. Hamel A. Matusik R.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1986; 47: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and rat SVS IV mRNA is abundant in skeletal muscle (28Yoo-Warren H. Willse A.G. Hull J. Brownell E. J. Exp. Zool. 1993; 265: 653-658Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although rat SVS IV has been reported to have immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties (1Aumuller G. Steitz J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 121: 127-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Di Micco B. Colonna G. Porta R. Metafora S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 345-352Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Porta R. Esposito C. Metafora S. Malorni A. Pucci P. Siciliano R. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3114-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there are no data supporting a function for any of the SVSPs outside of the reproductive tract. The homology of SVP-1 to the “pro” segment of elafin (called “cementoin” by Nara et al. (20Nara K. Ito S. Ito T. Suzuki Y. Ghoneim M.A. Tachibana S. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) raises the possibility that SVP-1 might also have a role in the extracellular matrix. Whether this protein serves as an anchor segment for other extracellular proteins (SVP-3/-4?) as proposed for the cementoin product from the elafin gene or has some other role in cell physiology remains to be determined. The functions of the other products of the GP1G gene, SVP-3 and SVP-4, have not been established, and no obvious evolutionary homologs of these proteins have been identified. With reference to the data reported here, it is curious that the primary sequence of these proteins has no sequence similarity to either the protease inhibitor domain of elafin or any of the known SVSPs. Thus, it is difficult to speculate regarding possible functions of these GP1G gene products outside the reproductive system. Further studies will be needed to address this question and to determine the structure and function of the novel GP1G-related transcripts found in the guinea pig testis. We thank Dr. James Lee for preparing the guinea pig genomic DNA used for the Southern blot; Lisa Hendel, Scott Harvey, and the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility for efforts in sequencing the GP1G gene; and Debbie Pearson for assistance with the preparation of the manuscript."

We show that the Antennapedia and Abdominal-B homeodomains bind to TFIIEβ, but the even-skipped homeodomain does not. Using a two-hybrid assay performed in cultured cells, we demonstrate that the homeodomain-TFIIEβ interaction occurs in vivo. The Abdominal-B homeodomain is shown to activate transcription in vitro, and this activation can be blocked with anti-TFIIEβ antibody without affecting basal transcription levels. Together with published data demonstrating an interaction between proteins containing even-skipped class homeodomains and the TATA-binding protein (Um, M., Li, C., and Manley, J. L. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 5007-5016; Zhang, H., Catron, K. M., and Abate-Shen, C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 1764-1769), these results suggest various homeodomain containing proteins interact with different general transcription factors, an observation that may have important implications for transcriptional regulation. Homeodomain-containing proteins play a crucial role as transcriptional regulators in the process of cell differentiation. The homeodomain performs a dual function in this regard, acting as a DNA binding domain and participating in protein-protein interactions that enhance DNA binding specificity or regulatory activity.

Biol. 15, 5007-5016; Zhang, H., Catron, K. M., and Abate-Shen, C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 1764-1769), these results suggest various homeodomain containing proteins interact with different general transcription factors, an observation that may have important implications for transcriptional regulation. The homeodomain is a structural motif originally defined by homologous sequences found in the Drosophila homeotic selector proteins, a family of proteins responsible for specifying positional identity along the anterior-posterior axis of a developing embryo (1McGinnis W. Garber R.L. Wirz J. Kuroiwa A. Gehring W.J. Cell. 1984; 37: 403-408Google Scholar, 2Scott M.P. Weiner A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4115-4119Google Scholar). It is now well established that the homeodomain functions as a DNA binding domain and that homeotic proteins function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes necessary for segment identity (3Botas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1015-1022Google Scholar). The homeodomain motif was subsequently found in numerous developmentally regulated proteins from species as diverse as sponges to mammals implying a functionally conserved mechanism of regulating gene expression during development (4McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Google Scholar). The extraordinary degree of conservation found among homeodomain sequences suggests that they evolved from a common ancestor through gene duplication. Presumably, sequence variations in the homeodomain and the surrounding protein accumulated as the duplicated genes acquired new developmental roles; however, sequence divergence must have also been restricted by molecular interactions necessary for function. The mammalian Hox genes contain homeodomains that are more similar to the homeodomains found in Drosophila homeotic genes than any other homeodomain sequence. When expressed in fly embryos, some Hox genes can partially substitute for the function of their Drosophila orthologs (5Malicki J. Schughart K. McGinnis W. Cell. 1990; 63: 961-967Google Scholar, 6McGinnis N. Kuziora M.A. McGinnis W. Cell. 1990; 63: 969-976Google Scholar, 7Zhao J.J. Lazzarini R.A. Pick L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 343-354Google Scholar, 8Lutz B. Lu H.-C. Eichele G. Miller D. Kaufman T.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 176-184Google Scholar). This is an intriguing observation given that, with few exceptions, the only conserved sequence between orthologous pairs is the homeodomain itself and a short stretch of 6-9 amino acids just amino-terminal to the homeodomain. One explanation for this functional substitution is that the homeodomain, aside from recognizing specific binding sites in target promoters, also participates in interactions with other conserved proteins required for transcriptional regulation of effector genes (9Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Nature. 1989; 341: 624-630Google Scholar, 10Chan S.-K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Google Scholar, 11Johnson F.B. Parker E. Krasnow M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 739-743Google Scholar, 12Grueneberg D.A. Simon K.J. Brennan K. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3318-3326Google Scholar). One group of highly conserved proteins required for basal levels of transcription in vitro are the general transcription factors (GTFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GTFgeneral transcription factorTBPTATA-binding proteinTAFTBP-associated factorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseDTTdithiothreitolCTDcarboxyl-terminal domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseRSV LTRRous sarcoma virus long terminal repeatPCRpolymerase chain reaction. which form the transcription preinitiation complex. To establish high levels of expression, assembly of the GTFs is thought to be facilitated through protein-protein interactions with sequence specific DNA binding transcription factors (13Hori R. Cary M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 236-244Google Scholar, 14Tong X. Drapkin R. Yalamanchili R. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4735-4744Google Scholar, 15Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1783-1788Google Scholar). Interaction with the GTFs is usually mediated by a regulatory domain in the sequence specific transcription factor; however, these interactions may also involve the DNA binding domain (16Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Google Scholar, 17Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Google Scholar, 18Martin M.L. Lieberman P.M. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2110-2118Google Scholar). Of particular interest to this study is the recent demonstration that proteins containing either the even-skipped (eve) or Msx-1 homeodomains interact with an essential GTF, the TATA-binding protein (19Um M. Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5007-5016Google Scholar, 20Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Google Scholar). Although the exact role of the eve homeodomain remains undefined, it is required mediate the interaction between TBP and the eve repression domain. The binding of the TBP to Msx-1 protein, however, occurs primarily through an interaction with the Msx-1 homeodomain. general transcription factor TATA-binding protein TBP-associated factor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase dithiothreitol carboxyl-terminal domain glutathione S-transferase Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat polymerase chain reaction. Here we extend these reports of homeodomain-GTF interactions by demonstrating that the Abdominal-B (Abd-B) homeodomain can bind to the β subunit of TFIIE (TFIIEβ), but does not interact with TBP. Moreover, we show that while the diverged homeodomains Antennapedia and Abd-B interact with TFIIEβ, the even-skipped homeodomain does not. Our data indicate that the Abd-B homeodomain interaction with TFIIEβ occurs in vivo and that it can facilitate transcriptional activation in vitro. These data suggest that homeodomains mediate interactions with various basal transcription factors in a class-specific manner, which may have important implications for transcriptional regulation during development. All transfection effector plasmids are based on pHY60-1 (41Yang H. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Google Scholar), which contains sequences encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-147) cloned 3′ of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR). To make RSV-TFIIEβ, a XbaI-HindIII fragment from plasmid His6.IIEβ, encoding a histidine-tagged TFIIEβ (a gift from Dr. R. Roeder) was subcloned into pHY60-1 replacing the existing Gal4 DNA binding domain. RSV-NHD was made by replacing the Gal4 DNA binding domain of pHY60-1 with a DraI-XbaI fragment from plasmid pΔC18 encoding the entire DfdΔAC/Abd-B protein as well as some flanking Dfd cDNA sequences (25Zhu A. Kuziora M.A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1577-1587Google Scholar). The plasmid RSV-GN was made by PCR amplification of a DNA fragment encoding the N domain. The primers used for this reaction were GCTCTAGATACAATGGACACTATTCG and CGGGATCCCAGCGCCGTGTTCGT, which also introduced a BamHI and XbaI site for subsequent ligation into pHY60-1 forming an in frame fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Finally, plasmid RSV-GVP16 was made by substituting a XbaI-HindIII fragment from pGal4.VP16 (41Yang H. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Google Scholar) containing an in frame fusion of the VP16 acidic activation domain (amino acids 411-456) to the Gal4 DNA binding domain for a XbaI-BglII fragment spanning the Gal4 DNA binding domain in pHY60-1. To make the reporter plasmid −33AdhCATHB, oligonucleotides containing a high affinity Abd-B binding site (42Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Google Scholar) were annealed, multimerized, and cloned into pBluescriptIISK+ (Stratagene) at the BamHI site. A plasmid containing five tandem binding sites was selected and a HindIII fragment from the −33AdhCAT effector plasmid (a gift from Dr. J. Lopez) containing the Adh TATA box and the CAT reporter gene was inserted 3′ of the Abd-B binding sites. The reporter plasmid GB5CAT has been described previously in Yang and Evans (41Yang H. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding the three homeodomains and the N domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T (43Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) using restriction sites introduced by the PCR primers. The sequence of each set of primers is available upon request. The induction and purification of the GST fusion proteins was performed as described in Ausubel et al. (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The use of equal amounts of protein in the glutathione beads pull down assay was confirmed by equivalent staining intensities on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to transcribe and translate the GTFs and TAFs in vitro under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Plasmids encoding the Drosophila GTFs and TAFs were obtained from the laboratories of Drs. R. Tjian or J. T. Kadonaga, while the human TFIIE subunit clones were obtained from Dr. R. Roeder. Two micrograms of a preformed GST fusion protein-glutathione bead complex was incubated with the indicated amount of 35S-labeled protein at room temperature (25°C) for 30 min in a 60-µl reaction containing 1 × binding buffer (1 × BB). The 1 × BB contained 25 m Hepes (pH 7.8), 80 m KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.0 m DTT, 0.1 m EDTA, 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5.0 m MgCl2. The beads were pelleted, washed four times with 100 µl of 1 × BB, then boiled in SDS sample buffer (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Bound proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for autoradiography. Band quantitation was performed using a Fuji Phoshor-Imaging system. To confirm biological activity of the GST-eve HD fusion protein, we performed a DNA binding experiment using the DNA insert from the plasmid p3102 containing known eve binding sites obtained from Dr. M. Biggin. Ten fmol of labeled DNA was incubated with 1 µg of either GST-eveHD fusion protein or GST protein prebound to glutathione beads in 150 m NaCl, 20 m Tris (pH 7.5), 0.25 m EDTA, 10% glycerol, 6.25 m MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 m DTT, 50 µg per ml of sonicated herring sperm DNA, and 1 mg per ml bovine serum albumin at 25°C for 30 min. The beads were washed twice with binding buffer without DTT, and bound DNA was fractionated on an agarose gel. Under these conditions, DNA binding to GST was not detected while the eve HD fusion protein bound approximately 50% of the input labeled DNA. 2A. Zhu and M. A. Kuziora, unpublished results. The maintenance of the QT6 cells, transfections, and CAT assays were performed as described previously in Zhu and Kuziora (25Zhu A. Kuziora M.A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1577-1587Google Scholar). A crude nuclear extract was prepared from HeLa cells (obtained from the National Cell Culture Center) as described in Dignam et al. (45Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The in vitro transcription assay contained 300 ng of the −33AdhCATHB template, 30 ng of the GST-Abd-BHD fusion protein or 30 ng of GST protein and 100 µg of nuclear extract in a 50-µl reaction. The final concentrations of the other reaction components were: 12 m Hepes (pH 7.9), 12% glycerol, 60 m KCl, 0.12 m EDTA, 0.3 m DTT, 12 m MgCl2, and nucleotide triphosphates at 600 µ each. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 1 h and then analyzed by primer extension (44Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). A primer complementary to the CAT reporter sequence (CATTGGGATATATCAACGGTGG) was used which produced an extended cDNA product 150 bases in length. For the antibody inhibition experiments, the nuclear extract was preincubated with the indicated amount of a polyclonal anti-TFIIEβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C for 4 h before addition to the transcription reaction. Products of the primer extension reaction were fractionated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using a Fuji Phosphor-Imaging system. Transcription initiation requires a number of multisubunit GTFs, including TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. In Drosophila, TFIID is composed of TBP and at least eight TBP-associated factors or TAFs (21Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Google Scholar, 22Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Google Scholar). To investigate if homeodomains interact with GTFs or TAFs in vitro, a series of binding assays were performed with a GST-Abd-B homeodomain fusion protein and 35S-labeled Drosophila TAFs, including TAF30α, TAF30β, TAF40, TAF60, TAF80, TAF110, and TAF150. We also tested the Drosophila GTFs, TBP, and TFIIB and human TFIIEα and TFIIEβ. Of all GTFs and TAFs tested, binding at levels above that observed with GST alone was only observed with TFIIEβ. Approximately 50% of the input TFIIEβ bound to the GST-Abd-B homeodomain fusion protein (Fig. 1, lanes 1-4). The addition of 20 pmol of a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a high affinity Abd-B homeodomain binding site did not detectably alter the binding interaction with TFIIEβ or affect the negative interaction with the other GTFs and TAFs.2 Homeodomains can be divided into classes based on sequence homology within and outside the homeodomain region (23Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell G.W.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Google Scholar, 24Duboule D. Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Since the Abdominal-B homeodomain is representative of a relatively small class, we asked if sequence differences found in homeodomains of various classes can affect binding to TFIIEβ in vitro. A representative of the Antennapedia class, the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain (AntpHD), binds to approximately 60% of input labeled TFIIEβ (Fig. 1, lane 5). In contrast, a representative of a more diverged class of homeodomains, the Drosophila even-skipped homeodomain (eveHD), fails to bind TFIIEβ at levels above that retained by GST alone under identical conditions (Fig. 1, lane 6). The eveHD binds a labeled DNA fragment containing known eve binding sites, suggesting that the fusion protein retained biological activity.2 These results indicate that sequence differences among homeodomain classes can affect TFIIEβ binding affinity in vitro. We next asked if the interaction observed in vitro between the Abd-B homeodomain and TFIIEβ could occur in vivo. We reasoned that in cultured cells, artificially high concentrations of TFIIEβ might interfere with the ability of proteins containing the Abd-B homeodomain to regulate transcription by blocking interaction with the basal transcription complex. We have shown previously that the Abd-B homeodomain can weakly stimulate transcription, but at levels that would be insufficient for accurately measuring changes in response to high TFIIEβ concentration (25Zhu A. Kuziora M.A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1577-1587Google Scholar). To obtain higher levels of transcriptional activation, we used the DfdΔAC/Abd-B protein, which essentially consists of the Abd-B homeodomain fused to an activation domain found in the Deformed homeotic protein called the N domain (25Zhu A. Kuziora M.A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1577-1587Google Scholar). Sequences encoding this protein were cloned downstream of the RSV LTR promoter to create RSV-NHD (Fig. 2A). Transfection of RSV-NHD activates transcription approximately 20-fold above levels observed upon transfection of the −33AdhCATHB reporter plasmid alone (data not shown). To obtain a high cellular concentration of TFIIEβ, we constructed the expression plasmid RSV-TFIIEβ in which coding sequences from a TFIIEβ cDNA are placed downstream of a RSV LTR promoter (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, cotransfection of RSV-NHD with increasing amounts of RSV-TFIIEβ results in up to approximately 60% reduction in CAT activity without significantly affecting the level of transcription in the absence of RSV-NHD. We conclude that exogenous TFIIEβ interferes with the ability of the DfdΔAC/Abd-B protein to interact with the transcription complex. Several lines of evidence suggest that the inhibition described above is due to an interaction between TFIIEβ and the Abd-B homeodomain rather than with other regions of the DfdΔAC/Abd-B protein or other transcription factors. First, a GST-N domain fusion protein does not bind to TFIIEβ (Fig. 1, lane 7). To confirm this observation in vivo, we cotransfected a construct encoding a Gal4 DNA binding domain-N domain fusion protein (RSV-GN; Fig. 2A) and RSV-TFIIEβ with a CAT reporter plasmid bearing 5 tandem Gal4 DNA binding sites (GB5CAT; Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the level of CAT reporter activation by RSV-GN is only reduced by approximately 10% in the presence of high concentrations of TFIIEβ, indicating that TFIIEβ does not significantly interact in vivo with the Gal4-N domain fusion protein. As a third control, we made use of the observation that the VP16 acidic activation domain interacts with TAF40, TBP, and TFIIB, but does not interact with TFIIEβ (26Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, cotransfection with RSV-TFIIEβ does not significantly affect the activity of a fusion protein consisting of the VP16 acidic activation domain and the Gal4 DNA binding domain. These experiments show that only a construct containing an Abd-B homeodomain is affected by overexpression of TFIIEβ, suggesting a specific interaction is possible in vivo between the homeodomain and the TFIIE β subunit. We next asked if an interaction between the Abd-B homeodomain and TFIIEβ could enhance transcriptional regulation. We tested the ability of the GST-Abd-B homeodomain fusion protein to stimulate transcription in vitro using a HeLa cell nuclear extract. The GST-Abd-B homeodomain fusion protein stimulates transcription approximately 2.5-fold using the −33AdhCATHB reporter construct as a template (Fig. 3, columns 1-3). Activated transcription was not observed from the −33AdhCAT reporter construct which lacks Abd-B binding sites (data not shown). The modest activation mediated by the Abd-B homeodomain can be blocked by preincubating the nuclear extract with increasing amounts of anti-TFIIEβ antibody, without affecting basal transcription levels (Fig. 3, columns 4-11). These results support the hypothesis that the Abd-B homeodomain can contribute to transcriptional regulation through interaction with TFIIEβ. The three-dimensional structures of several homeodomain-DNA complexes reveal that homeodomains with diverged primary sequences are folded into remarkably similar globular structures (27Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Google Scholar, 28Wolberger C. Vershon A.K. Liu B. Johnson A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Google Scholar, 29Billeter M. Qian Y.Q. Otting G. Müller M. Gehring W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1084-1097Google Scholar, 30Ceska T.A. Lamers M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Suck D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1805-1810Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of protein-protein interactions involving the homeodomain have identified several amino acids that are involved in determining the specificity of the interaction (10Chan S.-K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Google Scholar, 31Pomerantz J.L. Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2047-2057Google Scholar, 32Lai J.-S. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2058-2065Google Scholar). In general, these amino acids are considered to be solvent exposed as they are positioned on the opposite side of the homeodomain that contacts DNA. Residues in positions 11, 14, 15, and 22 of helix one, positions 32 and 36 of helix two, and position 24 in the intervening loop have been implicated in homeodomain-protein interactions and are identical or similar in the Antp and Abd-B homeodomains, but have different biochemical properties in the eve class homeodomains. One or more of these amino acids are likely to play a role in determining the specificity of the TFIIEβ interaction with the homeodomain. How can an interaction between TFIIEβ and the homeodomain contribute to transcriptional regulation? At a biochemical level, TFIIE promotes the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II by TFIIH (33Lu H. Zawel L. Fischer L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Google Scholar, 34Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Google Scholar), but also inhibits a helicase activity shown by TFIIH that may be required to unwind the DNA prior to transcription initiation (35Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Google Scholar). Since the phosphorylated RNA polymerase II is the form of the enzyme that actively elongates transcripts (36Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12468-12474Google Scholar, 37O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Google Scholar), the ability of a homeodomain to attract TFIIE to the initiation complex would serve to stimulate transcription by enhancing the kinase activity of TFIIH, resulting in a completely phosphorylated CTD. Alternatively, since TFIIE inhibits the helicase activity of TFIIH, it has been proposed that TFIIE might be removed from the complex following CTD phosphorylation (38Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that TFIIE binds unphosphorylated RNA polymerase II, but not to the phosphorylated form (39Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 515-524Google Scholar). Together with conformational changes that occur in the transcription complex during initiation that may alter access to the GTFs (40Zawel L. Lu H. Cisek L.J. Corden J.L. Reinberg D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 187-198Google Scholar), the removal of TFIIE from the complex could be facilitated by interaction with a homeodomain. This scheme might have the added advantage of retaining TFIIE in the vicinity of the target promoter, thereby aiding subsequent rounds of initiation. Unlike the results obtained with the Abd-B and Antp homeodomains, we failed to detect and interaction between the eve homeodomain and TFIIEβ. In contrast, an interaction between the eve protein and TBP has been reported (19Um M. Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5007-5016Google Scholar). The eve homeodomain does not bind TBP in vitro, but it is required for the interaction between TBP and the eve repression domain and functions in some undetermined manner to stabilize the interaction. The mouse Msx-1 protein, which contains a homeodomain of the eve class, also interacts with TBP in vitro (20Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Google Scholar). In this case, a direct interaction between the Msx-1 homeodomain and TBP can be demonstrated. Of particular interest to this study was the finding that the Msx-1 protein does not interact with TFIIEβ (20Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Google Scholar). Thus homeodomains differ in their ability to interact with GTFs. Given the degree of sequence similarity within a homeodomain class, the interactions with specific GTFs may also be conserved. It follows that homeodomain-mediated interactions with other highly conserved proteins such as extradenticle/Pbx (10Chan S.-K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Google Scholar, 11Johnson F.B. Parker E. Krasnow M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 739-743Google Scholar) or SRF (12Grueneberg D.A. Simon K.J. Brennan K. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3318-3326Google Scholar) might be retained among members of a homeodomain class. These interactions may be sufficient for orthologous vertebrate Hox proteins to partially mimic the transcriptional regulation of appropriate target promoters in fly embryos despite the lack of significant sequence homology outside of the homeodomain region.

We examined the effect of antibodies to NDP kinase on the ATP-supported activity of atrial muscarinic K+ channels and the corresponding GIRK1/CIR channels expressed in HEK 293 cells. Inhibitory antibodies reduced ATP-induced channel openings, but this effect displayed an absolute requirement for agonist and was also seen with antibodies that do not inhibit the enzyme.

Channel activity was not affected by the antibodies in preparations where ATP-induced muscarinic channels are not under tight receptor control, namely pertussis toxin-treated atrial patches and membranes from cells expressing KACh channel subunits.

In addition to the conversion of fibrinogen into the insoluble fibrin, thrombin can initiate a number of positive and negative feedback mechanisms that either sustain or down-regulate clot formation. We have modulated the thrombin sensitivity of human blood coagulation factor VIII, an essential cofactor in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. We have substituted an acidic region of factor VIII corresponding to amino acid sequence Asp712-Ala736 by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of the thrombin inhibitor heparin cofactor II. Functional analysis of the resulting factor VIII-heparin cofactor II hybrid, termed des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, revealed an increase in procoagulant activity as measured in a one-stage clotting assay. Incubation of purified des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII with different amounts of thrombin showed that this protein was more readily activated by thrombin when compared with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII, a control protein lacking amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II. This was manifested by an increase in the second order rate constant of activation by thrombin for des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (12.0 ± 0.48 × 106−1 s−1) compared with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (1.77 ± 0.21 × 106−1 s−1).

INTRODUCTIONSelective interaction of thrombin with a number of blood coagulation factors is essential to ascertain control over both pro- and anticoagulant pathways (1Huber R. Carell R.W.

Determination of the three-dimensional structure of thrombin has greatly contributed to our current knowledge on the action of this serine protease (8Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3467-3475Google Scholar, 9Skrzypczak E. Rydel T. Tulinsky A. Fenton J.W. Mann K.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 755-757Google Scholar). Studies on the three-dimensional structure of a complex of thrombin and hirudin, an inhibitor derived from the leech Hirudo medicinalis, revealed that a positively charged area, the so-called anion binding exosite I of thrombin, interacts strongly with a stretch of negatively charged amino acids present at the carboxyl terminus of hirudin (10Grütter M.G. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2361-2365Google Scholar, 11Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton II, J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Google Scholar). Similar areas of negatively charged amino acids are present in the thrombin receptor, thrombomodulin and heparin cofactor II and have been shown to interact with anion binding exosite I of thrombin (12Liu L.W. Vu T.K.H. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16977-16980Google Scholar, 13Vu T-K. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R.

Studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to the negatively charged amino acids of the proteins mentioned above have shown that the affinity of these peptides for thrombin varies considerably (15Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Dittman W.A. Wen D. Scarpati E.M. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10602-10612Google Scholar, 16Hortin G.L. Benutto B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 437-442Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the ability of thrombin to interact with different components of the hemostatic system is, at least in part, determined by the affinity of anion binding exosite I of thrombin for stretches of negatively charged amino acids present on its substrates. Modulation of the pro- and anticoagulant activities of thrombin may be accomplished by simply exchanging negatively charged areas between the different substrates of this serine protease.Factor VIII is an essential cofactor for factor IXa in the conversion of factor X to Xa in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation (3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10364-10370Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the factor VIII cDNA revealed that factor VIII consists of a series of homologous domains which can be represented as follows: A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (17Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Amphlett G.W. Foster B. Coe M.L. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Hewick R.M.

Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of factor VIII at amino acid position Arg1648 occurs during biosynthesis of factor VIII (19Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Google Scholar). Consequently, factor VIII circulates in plasma as a metal ion-linked heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain (A1-A2-B) and light chain (A3-C1-C2). Activation of factor VIII by thrombin proceeds through limited proteolysis at amino acid positions Arg372, Arg740, and Arg1689 (19Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Google Scholar, 20Pitmann D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Google Scholar). Consequently, activated factor VIII consists of a heterotrimer of the separate A1 and A2-domains together with a thrombin cleaved light chain (21Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Google Scholar, 22Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Google Scholar). We have shown previously that an acidic region corresponding to amino acid sequence Asp713-Arg740 of factor VIII is involved in the activation of factor VIII by thrombin (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar, 24Donath, M. J. S. H., 1995, Activation and Limited Proteolysis of Human Blood Coagulation Factor VIII. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Here, we have replaced amino acid sequence Asp712-Ala736 of factor VIII by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II, a potent inhibitor of thrombin (25Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Google Scholar). Functional importance of amino acid sequence Ile50-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II in the inhibition of thrombin has been suggested by analysis of heparin cofactor II derivatives that lack this particular amino acid sequence (26Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Google Scholar). The factor VIII-heparin cofactor II hybrid constructed, designated des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, was expressed in mouse fibroblast C127 cells, and analysis of the properties of the resulting protein suggests that amino acid sequence Ile50-Ser81 of heparin cofactor II endows factor VIII with increased sensitivity towards thrombin.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have shown previously that efficient activation of blood coagulation factor VIII by thrombin is dependent on the presence of amino acid sequence Asp713-Arg740 of the factor VIII heavy chain (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar). Here, we have replaced amino acid sequence Asp713-Ala736 of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II (Fig. 1A). The modified factor VIII cDNA was expressed in C127 cells, and the properties of the resulting hybrid protein were compared with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII, a B-domain deleted factor VIII which has been previously characterized (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Characterization of the conditioned medium of transfected cells expressing des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII revealed that the factor VIII-heparin cofactor hybrid had normal cofactor activity (data not shown). Also the amount of factor VIII antigen in the conditioned medium was similar for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (data not shown). Inspection of the procoagulant activity as measured in a one-stage clotting assay showed that limited amounts of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII sufficed to effectively reduce the clotting time of plasma deficient of factor VIII (Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II endows factor VIII with improved functional properties.To determine the molecular basis of the enhanced procoagulant activity of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, we have immunopurified and characterized this hybrid protein. First, the subunit composition of the purified material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Monoclonal antibody CLB-CAg 69 directed against amino acid sequence Lys1673-Arg1689 of the factor VIII light chain (30Leyte A. Mertens K. Distel B. Evers R.F. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Groenen-Van Dooren M.M.C.L. De Bruin J. Pannekoek H. Van Mourik J.A. Verbeet M. Ph Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 187-194Google Scholar), reacted with the 200- and 80-kDa species of both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII while monoclonal antibody MAS530 directed against the heavy chain of factor VIII reacted with the 200- and 120-kDa species of these proteins (Fig. 2). These data indicate that in addition to a small amount of single chain protein both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII consist predominantly of a heterodimer composed of a light chain of 80 kDa and a heavy chain of 120 kDa, which contains a residual portion of the B-domain. Monoclonal antibody CLB-CAg 9 did not react with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, since amino acid sequence Asp712-Ala736, which constitutes the epitope of this monoclonal antibody (30Leyte A. Mertens K. Distel B. Evers R.F. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Groenen-Van Dooren M.M.C.L. De Bruin J. Pannekoek H. Van Mourik J.A. Verbeet M. Ph Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 187-194Google Scholar), has been replaced by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Subunit composition of des-(868-1562) factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and following immunoblotting proteins were visualized with anti-factor VIII antibodies. Lanes 1 and 4, CLB-CAg 69, directed against amino acid sequence Lys1673-Arg1689 of the light chain of factor VIII; lanes 2 and 5, MAS 530 (Seralab, Sussex, United Kingdom) directed against the heavy chain of factor VIII; lanes 3 and 6, CLB-CAg 9, directed against amino acid sequence Ser710-Arg740 of factor VIII. A molecular weight marker is shown at the right of the figure. The single chain (sc), heavy chain (hc), and light chain (lc) of factor VIII are indicated at the left of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that factor VIII-del(713-1637) lacks procoagulant activity in a one-stage clotting assay and is fully activated only in the presence of relatively high concentrations of thrombin (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar). The increased procoagulant activity of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII in a one-stage clotting assay suggests that this molecule is more readily activated by thrombin than des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. To study this issue in more detail the sensitivity of both des-(868-1652)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII toward thrombin was determined. Activation of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII by thrombin was monitored by probing the ability of the activated factor VIII to function as a cofactor in the factor IXa-dependent conversion of factor X into Xa (27Donath M.J.S.H. De Laaf R.T.M. Biessels P.T.M. Lenting P.J. Van de Loo J-W. Van Mourik J.A. Voorberg J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 49-55Google Scholar). Addition of various amounts of thrombin allows for determination of the thrombin sensitivity of both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (Fig. 3). Inspection of the pattern obtained when 0.1 n thrombin was used for activation of both proteins revealed that des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII is more readily activated then des-(868-1562)-factor VIII at this particular concentration of thrombin (Fig. 3). A similar pattern is observed when 0.5 and 1.0 n thrombin were used to activate the two different proteins (Fig. 3). These results provide evidence for an increased thrombin sensitivity of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII compared with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII.Fig. 3Activation of factor VIII by thrombin. Purified des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII were incubated with various concentrations of thrombin and the activation of factor VIII was monitored by probing the ability of factor VIII as a cofactor for the factor IXa-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa. Under our experimental conditions the rate of factor Xa generation was found to be dependent on the amount of thrombin added to the reaction mixture. Representative examples of factor Xa generation curves for three different concentrations of thrombin are given (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 n thrombin) for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (•) and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (∘). The solid lines represent fits to Equation 1, which is given under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to define the increased thrombin sensitivity in a quantitative manner, we have determined the second order rate constant of activation by thrombin for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII using a previously established method (24Donath, M. J. S. H., 1995, Activation and Limited Proteolysis of Human Blood Coagulation Factor VIII. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Factor Xa generation curves obtained at different concentrations of thrombin were used to calculate the first order rate constant of activation for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. Secondary plots of the first order rate constants against the concentration of thrombin yielded a second order rate constant of activation for des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (12.0 ± 0.48 × 106−1 s−1) and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (1.77 ± 0.21 × 106−1 s−1) (Fig. 4). The data obtained show that des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII is approximately 7-fold more readily activated by thrombin than des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. Our results suggest that des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII may more efficiently compete for the limited amounts of amounts of thrombin generated at a site of vascular injury than des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. This property may render des-(868-1562)-factor VIII more effective in treatment of patients with hemophilia A than currently available factor VIII preparations. Our study implies that exchange of acidic regions of other substrates of thrombin may be utilized to selectively modulate the action of this serine protease under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.Fig. 4Second order rate constant of activation of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII by thrombin. The first order rate constant (k) of activation of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII was determined at different concentrations of thrombin. For des-(868-1562)-factor VIII, k was determined in triplicate at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 n of thrombin. For des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII thrombin concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 n were analyzed in triplicate. From the slope of a plot of k against the concentration of thrombin, the apparent second order rate constant of activation by thrombin for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (•) and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (∘) was calculated. Residual activation of factor VIII in the absence of thrombin is most likely explained by limited amounts of non-acetylated factor X in the acetylated factor X preparation, which may cause feedback activation of factor VIII.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) INTRODUCTIONSelective interaction of thrombin with a number of blood coagulation factors is essential to ascertain control over both pro- and anticoagulant pathways (1Huber R.

Activation of factor VIII by thrombin proceeds through limited proteolysis at amino acid positions Arg372, Arg740, and Arg1689 (19Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Google Scholar, 20Pitmann D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Google Scholar). Consequently, activated factor VIII consists of a heterotrimer of the separate A1 and A2-domains together with a thrombin cleaved light chain (21Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Google Scholar, 22Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Google Scholar). We have shown previously that an acidic region corresponding to amino acid sequence Asp713-Arg740 of factor VIII is involved in the activation of factor VIII by thrombin (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H.

H., 1995, Activation and Limited Proteolysis of Human Blood Coagulation Factor VIII. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Here, we have replaced amino acid sequence Asp712-Ala736 of factor VIII by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II, a potent inhibitor of thrombin (25Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Google Scholar). Functional importance of amino acid sequence Ile50-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II in the inhibition of thrombin has been suggested by analysis of heparin cofactor II derivatives that lack this particular amino acid sequence (26Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Google Scholar). The factor VIII-heparin cofactor II hybrid constructed, designated des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, was expressed in mouse fibroblast C127 cells, and analysis of the properties of the resulting protein suggests that amino acid sequence Ile50-Ser81 of heparin cofactor II endows factor VIII with increased sensitivity towards thrombin. Selective interaction of thrombin with a number of blood coagulation factors is essential to ascertain control over both pro- and anticoagulant pathways (1Huber R. Carell R.W.

Determination of the three-dimensional structure of thrombin has greatly contributed to our current knowledge on the action of this serine protease (8Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3467-3475Google Scholar, 9Skrzypczak E. Rydel T. Tulinsky A. Fenton J.W. Mann K.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 755-757Google Scholar). Studies on the three-dimensional structure of a complex of thrombin and hirudin, an inhibitor derived from the leech Hirudo medicinalis, revealed that a positively charged area, the so-called anion binding exosite I of thrombin, interacts strongly with a stretch of negatively charged amino acids present at the carboxyl terminus of hirudin (10Grütter M.G. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2361-2365Google Scholar, 11Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton II, J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Google Scholar). Similar areas of negatively charged amino acids are present in the thrombin receptor, thrombomodulin and heparin cofactor II and have been shown to interact with anion binding exosite I of thrombin (12Liu L.W.

Studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to the negatively charged amino acids of the proteins mentioned above have shown that the affinity of these peptides for thrombin varies considerably (15Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Dittman W.A. Wen D. Scarpati E.M. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10602-10612Google Scholar, 16Hortin G.L. Benutto B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 437-442Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the ability of thrombin to interact with different components of the hemostatic system is, at least in part, determined by the affinity of anion binding exosite I of thrombin for stretches of negatively charged amino acids present on its substrates. Modulation of the pro- and anticoagulant activities of thrombin may be accomplished by simply exchanging negatively charged areas between the different substrates of this serine protease. Factor VIII is an essential cofactor for factor IXa in the conversion of factor X to Xa in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation (3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10364-10370Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the factor VIII cDNA revealed that factor VIII consists of a series of homologous domains which can be represented as follows: A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (17Toole J.J. Knopf J.L.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have shown previously that efficient activation of blood coagulation factor VIII by thrombin is dependent on the presence of amino acid sequence Asp713-Arg740 of the factor VIII heavy chain (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar). Here, we have replaced amino acid sequence Asp713-Ala736 of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II (Fig. 1A). The modified factor VIII cDNA was expressed in C127 cells, and the properties of the resulting hybrid protein were compared with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII, a B-domain deleted factor VIII which has been previously characterized (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Characterization of the conditioned medium of transfected cells expressing des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII revealed that the factor VIII-heparin cofactor hybrid had normal cofactor activity (data not shown). Also the amount of factor VIII antigen in the conditioned medium was similar for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (data not shown). Inspection of the procoagulant activity as measured in a one-stage clotting assay showed that limited amounts of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII sufficed to effectively reduce the clotting time of plasma deficient of factor VIII (Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II endows factor VIII with improved functional properties.To determine the molecular basis of the enhanced procoagulant activity of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, we have immunopurified and characterized this hybrid protein. First, the subunit composition of the purified material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Monoclonal antibody CLB-CAg 69 directed against amino acid sequence Lys1673-Arg1689 of the factor VIII light chain (30Leyte A. Mertens K. Distel B. Evers R.F. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Groenen-Van Dooren M.M.C.L. De Bruin J. Pannekoek H. Van Mourik J.A. Verbeet M. Ph Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 187-194Google Scholar), reacted with the 200- and 80-kDa species of both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII while monoclonal antibody MAS530 directed against the heavy chain of factor VIII reacted with the 200- and 120-kDa species of these proteins (Fig. 2). These data indicate that in addition to a small amount of single chain protein both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII consist predominantly of a heterodimer composed of a light chain of 80 kDa and a heavy chain of 120 kDa, which contains a residual portion of the B-domain. Monoclonal antibody CLB-CAg 9 did not react with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII, since amino acid sequence Asp712-Ala736, which constitutes the epitope of this monoclonal antibody (30Leyte A. Mertens K. Distel B. Evers R.F. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Groenen-Van Dooren M.M.C.L. De Bruin J. Pannekoek H. Van Mourik J.A. Verbeet M. Ph Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 187-194Google Scholar), has been replaced by amino acid sequence Ile51-Leu80 of heparin cofactor II (Fig. 2).Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that factor VIII-del(713-1637) lacks procoagulant activity in a one-stage clotting assay and is fully activated only in the presence of relatively high concentrations of thrombin (23Mertens K. Donath M.J.S.H. Van Leen R.W. De Keyzer-Nellen M.J.M. Verbeet M. Ph Klaasse Bos J.M. Leyte A. Van Mourik J.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 133-145Google Scholar). The increased procoagulant activity of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII in a one-stage clotting assay suggests that this molecule is more readily activated by thrombin than des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. To study this issue in more detail the sensitivity of both des-(868-1652)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII toward thrombin was determined. Activation of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII by thrombin was monitored by probing the ability of the activated factor VIII to function as a cofactor in the factor IXa-dependent conversion of factor X into Xa (27Donath M.J.S.H. De Laaf R.T.M. Biessels P.T.M. Lenting P.J. Van de Loo J-W. Van Mourik J.A. Voorberg J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 49-55Google Scholar). Addition of various amounts of thrombin allows for determination of the thrombin sensitivity of both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (Fig. 3). Inspection of the pattern obtained when 0.1 n thrombin was used for activation of both proteins revealed that des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII is more readily activated then des-(868-1562)-factor VIII at this particular concentration of thrombin (Fig. 3). A similar pattern is observed when 0.5 and 1.0 n thrombin were used to activate the two different proteins (Fig. 3). These results provide evidence for an increased thrombin sensitivity of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII compared with des-(868-1562)-factor VIII.Fig. 3Activation of factor VIII by thrombin. Purified des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII were incubated with various concentrations of thrombin and the activation of factor VIII was monitored by probing the ability of factor VIII as a cofactor for the factor IXa-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa. Under our experimental conditions the rate of factor Xa generation was found to be dependent on the amount of thrombin added to the reaction mixture. Representative examples of factor Xa generation curves for three different concentrations of thrombin are given (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 n thrombin) for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (•) and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (∘). The solid lines represent fits to Equation 1, which is given under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to define the increased thrombin sensitivity in a quantitative manner, we have determined the second order rate constant of activation by thrombin for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII using a previously established method (24Donath, M. J. S. H., 1995, Activation and Limited Proteolysis of Human Blood Coagulation Factor VIII. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Factor Xa generation curves obtained at different concentrations of thrombin were used to calculate the first order rate constant of activation for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. Secondary plots of the first order rate constants against the concentration of thrombin yielded a second order rate constant of activation for des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (12.0 ± 0.48 × 106−1 s−1) and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (1.77 ± 0.21 × 106−1 s−1) (Fig. 4). The data obtained show that des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII is approximately 7-fold more readily activated by thrombin than des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. Our results suggest that des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII may more efficiently compete for the limited amounts of amounts of thrombin generated at a site of vascular injury than des-(868-1562)-factor VIII. This property may render des-(868-1562)-factor VIII more effective in treatment of patients with hemophilia A than currently available factor VIII preparations. Our study implies that exchange of acidic regions of other substrates of thrombin may be utilized to selectively modulate the action of this serine protease under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.Fig. 4Second order rate constant of activation of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII by thrombin. The first order rate constant (k) of activation of des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII was determined at different concentrations of thrombin. For des-(868-1562)-factor VIII, k was determined in triplicate at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 n of thrombin. For des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII thrombin concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 n were analyzed in triplicate. From the slope of a plot of k against the concentration of thrombin, the apparent second order rate constant of activation by thrombin for both des-(868-1562)-factor VIII-HCII (•) and des-(868-1562)-factor VIII (∘) was calculated. Residual activation of factor VIII in the absence of thrombin is most likely explained by limited amounts of non-acetylated factor X in the acetylated factor X preparation, which may cause feedback activation of factor VIII.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have shown previously that efficient activation of blood coagulation factor VIII by thrombin is dependent on the presence of amino acid sequence Asp713-Arg740 of the factor VIII heavy chain (23Mertens K.

https://openalex.org/W2113674334,"A simple strategy has been devised to identify the gene encoding the RNA subunit of RNase P from the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The sequence obtained by amplification of genomic DNA with primers based on sequences common to two other vertebrates was confirmed by reverse transcription and amplification of RNA from a partially purified preparation of the holoenzyme. The 5′ and 3′ ends were determined by cyclizing the RNA, followed by reverse transcription and sequencing across the ligated RNA junction. The zebrafish sequence is 63% identical to that of Xenopus laevis nuclear RNase P RNA and 69% identical to the human RNase P RNA. A consensus secondary structure was constructed based on these nucleotide identities and on the many compensatory base changes in several regions among these three RNAs. The strategy used to obtain the zebrafish sequence should be useful in deriving analogous gene sequences from diverse classes of eukaryotes."

Here we show that within the neuronally expressed Oct-2.5 form, the inhibitory domain can strongly inhibit activation by transcription factor activation domains which are either composed predominantly of acidic residues or contain the HOB motif, whereas it has a weaker effect or no effect on proline-rich activation domains and on a glutamine-rich domain. In contrast, the isolated inhibitory domain of Oct-2 can efficiently repress all types of activation domains. This effect is observed however, only on TATA box-containing promoters and not on promoters containing an initiator motif. This widespread inhibition of different activation domains and its dependence on the nature of the basal promoter elements indicate that the inhibitory domain is likely to act by contacting a common downstream target of activation domains within the basal transcriptional complex bound at the TATA box rather than quenching specific activation domains by direct interaction. These effects are discussed in terms of the functional role of the inhibitory domain within Oct-2.5 and the mechanism by which it acts.

These effects are discussed in terms of the functional role of the inhibitory domain within Oct-2.5 and the mechanism by which it acts. The Oct-2 transcription factor was originally identified in B lymphocytes where it is involved in the activation of gene expression (1Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) and its activity is greatly reduced in B cells derived from mice in which the Oct-2 gene has been inactivated (4Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Ulmer C. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, Oct-2 has recently been shown to activate the CD36 gene in B cells (5Konig H. Pfisterer P. Cocoran L.M. Wirth T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1598-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although Oct-2 is absent in most other cell types (1Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 2Staudt L.M. Singh H. Sen R.

Interestingly, in these cells, Oct-2 acts predominantly as a repressor of gene expression inhibiting the activity of artificial promoters containing its binding site (9Stoykova A.S. Steiner S.

This effect occurs because the primary RNA transcript derived from the single gene encoding Oct-2 (1Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with the Oct-2.1, −2.2, −2.3, and −2.6 forms containing a strong C-terminal activation domain, which is absent in Oct-2.4 and −2.5. This alternative splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific manner so that the Oct-2.1 form, which contains the C-terminal activation domain predominates in B lymphocytes, whereas the Oct-2.4 and −2.5 forms, which lack this activation domain, predominate in neuronal cells (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, several groups including our own have identified an N-terminal region of Oct-2, which has an inhibitory effect on transcription (18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Friedl E.M. Matthias P. Eur. J.

In particular, we have shown that the inhibitory effect of Oct-2 is dependent upon a 40-amino acid region near the N terminus of the protein (amino acids 142-181) which is common to all forms of Oct-2 (18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Oct-2.1, −2.2, −2.3, and −2.6, the strong C-terminal activation domain overcomes the effect of the inhibitory domain so that these forms activate gene expression (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast when the C-terminal activation domain is absent, as in Oct-2.4 and −2.5, the inhibitory domain is able to act to repress transcription (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which this inhibitory domain acts, we previously linked it to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This construct was able to repress different promoters containing Gal4 DNA-binding sites (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This indicates that the inhibitory domain does not function by binding to DNA and blocking the binding of an activator since no activator proteins binding to Gal4 sites exist in mammalian cells. Similarly, since the isolated Oct-2 inhibitory domain in the absence of any DNA-binding domain does not repress transcription (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect does not depend upon the formation of a non-DNA-binding protein-protein complex between the inhibitory domain and an activating molecule. Apart from these two mechanisms, two other means by which inhibitory domains can repress transcription have been defined (for reviews see Refs. 22Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar and 23Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1995Google Scholar). These are quenching of a DNA-bound activator preventing it from activating transcription or direct interaction with the basal transcriptional complex to reduce its activity. To distinguish these possibilities, we have investigated the ability of Oct-2 to interfere with transcription when bound at different positions relative to the transcriptional start site and to inhibit activation of different basal promoter elements by a variety of different activation domains. The plasmids containing Gal4 sites at different positions and orientations relative to the SV40 promoter have been described previously (24Pengue G. Calabro V. Bartoli P.C. Pagliuca A. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid was constructed by cloning three octamer motifs (ATGCTAATGAGAT; Ref. 25Dent C.L. Latchman D.S.

IRL Press, Oxford United Kingdom1985: 143Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out with 2 × 106 cells on a 90-mm diameter plate transfected with 10 µg of reporter plasmids, 10 µg of the Oct-2 expression vectors, and 10 µg of the Gal4 plasmids, except in the case of Gal4/Fos or Gal4/VP16, where only 5 µg was used. These amounts of the Gal4/activation domain plasmids were shown to direct equivalent levels of protein production in transfected cells as assayed by DNA mobility shift on a Gal4 DNA-binding site (data not shown). Assays of CAT activity in the transfected cells were carried out as described by Gorman et al. (38Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford United Kingdom1985: 143Google Scholar), extracts having been previously equalized for protein content as described by Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). The percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to the acetylated form was determined by analysis on a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). In all cases, the values obtained were equalized for differences in plasmid uptake between samples based on the results of dot blot hybridization of an aliquot of the transfected cell extract with a DNA probe for the ampicillin resistance gene (40Abken H. Reifenrath B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a first step in distinguishing whether the inhibitory domain acted via quenching or as a direct repressor, we investigated the ability of a Gal4-inhibitory domain construct to repress a set of promoters in which the Gal4 sites were located in different orientations or different positions. Thus in many cases repressors that quench a specific activator have to bind to a site adjacent to the activator in order to exert their effect (see, for example, Ref. 41Gray S. Szymanski P. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In previous experiments (21Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) we had shown that the inhibitory domain could function when bound at different positions relative to the promoter, However, the constructs used in that study were prepared by cloning a large DNA fragment containing the Gal4 sites at different positions (42Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher F.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore maintained the relationship of the Gal4 sites with any adjacent activator binding site. We therefore repeated these experiments with constructs containing isolated Gal4 binding sites at different positions (Fig. 1a). In these experiments (Fig. 1b), the Gal4-inhibitory domain construct was able to repress all three SV40 promoter constructs, which contained the Gal4 binding sites in different orientations and at different positions relative to the transcriptional start site. These experiments are thus not consistent with a model in which the inhibitory domain acts by quenching an adjacent activator, although they do not distinguish whether it acts by quenching a distant activator or by interacting directly with the basal transcriptional complex. To distinguish these possibilities, we investigated the ability of the inhibitory domain to interfere with activation by different activation domains. In preliminary experiments, we tested the ability of each activation domain to activate a reporter construct containing three copies of the high affinity Oct-2 binding site ATGCTAATGAGAT (25Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) cloned upstream of five Gal4 binding sites and the EIB TATA box in the vector pG5B Cat (26Carey M. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 27Light J.D. Ro M. English M.A. Grossel M. Hansen U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11361-11365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This construct was chosen, since it has a very low basal activity in the absence of any activators. Moreover, this minimal basal activity is not affected by Oct-2 (Table I). Thus, any effects of Oct-2 that were observed in the presence of activators would represent effects on activator-mediated transcription. This construct was co-transfected into BHK-21 cells (35Macpherson I. Stoker M. Virology. 1962; 16: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), which lack endogenous Oct-2 (36Lillycrop K.A. Estridge J.K. Latchman D.S. Virology. 1993; 196: 888-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the empty expression vector pJ7 (43Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) and individual constructs containing different activation domains linked to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (see Fig. 2 for details of the reporter and activator plasmids). The level of Cat activity was then compared to that observed when the reporter was co-transfected with empty expression vector and a construct encoding only the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. In these experiments (Table I), all the activation domains clearly activated the reporter gene with the strongest effect being observed with the acidic activation domain of the HSV virion protein VP16. These effects were specific to the reporter plasmid-containing Gal4 sites with no activation or nonspecific repression (squelching) being observed on reporter plasmids lacking such sites (data not shown).Table IInhibition of different activation domains by Oct 2.5Activation domain fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domainTypeFold transactivationVector aloneOct-2.5None1 ± 01.1 ± 0.1C-terminal domain of VP16Acidic70 ± 1519 ± 2C-terminal domain of Gal4Acidic11 ± 34.5 ± 1.5N-terminal domain of EIAAcidic33 ± 216 ± 2C-terminal domain of NFκBAcidic52 ± 633 ± 4C-terminal domain of Sp1Glutamine-rich8 ± 18.5 ± 3.2N-terminal domain of AP2Proline-rich16.5 ± 011.5 ± 1.5C-terminal domain of CTF/NF1Proline-rich15 ± 010.5 ± 0.5N-terminal domain of c-FosHOB motif71 ± 117.5 ± 1C-terminal domain of Oct2Proline-rich25 ± 517.5 ± 3.5 Open table in a new tab This experiment was then repeated substituting an Oct-2.5 expression vector for the empty expression vector. As illustrated in Table I, the presence of Oct-2.5 had virtually no effect on the basal activity of the promoter observed in the absence of any activation. However, Oct-2.5 reduced the degree of trans-activation produced by all the activation domains with the exception of the glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1 (44Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition observed in the different cases did not appear to be related to the magnitude of the trans-activation observed in each case. However, when the percentage inhibition of trans-activation produced by Oct-2-5 in each case was determined (by comparing the fold transactivation observed in the presence or absence of Oct-2.5), an interesting pattern emerged (Fig. 3a). Thus, Oct-2.5 was particularly effective at inhibiting trans-activation by the acidic activation domains of the HSV virion protein VP16, the adenovirus EIA protein, the cellular NFκB protein, and of Gal4 itself and also strongly inhibited trans-activation by the HOB motif activation domain contained in amino acids 1-81 of the c-Fos oncoprotein (29Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, a weaker effect was observed on the proline-rich activation domains derived from CTF/NF1, AP-2 (28Seipel K. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the C terminus of Oct-2 itself (32Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas no inhibition was observed on the glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1 (44Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). In no case did we observe any effect of the activation domain plasmids on the level of Oct-2.5 in the transfected cells as assayed by DNA mobility shift assay (data not shown). Hence, the effects we observe are dependent upon the ability of Oct-2 to interfere with gene activation by the different activators. To investigate these effects further, we carried out similar experiments in the ND7 cell line, which is derived from dorsal root ganglion neurons (37Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Series B. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and expresses endogenous Oct-2 (12Kemp L.M. Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these experiments (Fig. 3b) inhibition of both the acidic activation domains and the HOB domain was observed as in BHK-21 cells indicating that overexpression of Oct-2.5 can achieve this effect even in a cell line expressing endogenous Oct-2. Similarly, inhibition of proline-rich activation domains was also observed in the ND7 cells. Interestingly, however, some inhibition was also observed in the case of the glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1, in contrast to the result in BHK-21 cells. These results suggest therefore that, when tested within Oct-2.5, the inhibitory domain can strongly inhibit acidic activation domains or the HOB domain and has a weaker effect on proline and glutamine-rich domains. The cell type-specific differences observed in different cell types may relate to our previous finding that the inhibitory domain is more active in ND7 cells compared to BHK-21 cells (21Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This greater activity might thus allow it to overcome any activation effects of other regions of Oct-2.5, which might otherwise mask its inherent ability to repress a glutamine-rich activation domain. Thus, although the Oct-2.5 molecule lacks the strong C-terminal activation domain present in other forms of Oct-2, it does contain an alternative C-terminal sequence, which has some similarity to that of Oct-1 and can trans-activate some promoters such as those encoding the small nuclear RNAs (45Tanaka M. Lai J-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To extend our observations, we therefore used the same experimental protocol to test the inhibitory effect in BHK cells of a construct (derived from Oct-2.2; Ref. 33Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G.

For comparison we also included a construct containing only the POU domain of Oct-2 but lacking the inhibitory domain. In these experiments (Fig. 4), the N-terminal region was able to strongly inhibit trans-activation by the acidic domains of VP16, EIA, NFκB, and Gal4 as well as by the HOB motif of c-Fos paralleling the ability of Oct-2.5 to do this. Interestingly, in the case of the acidic domains the effect of the N terminus was much stronger than that of Oct-2.5, resulting in almost total repression of trans-activation. This effect also resulted in the N terminus being able to significantly repress trans-activation in BHK-21 cells by the proline-rich activation domains of CTF/NF1 and AP2 as well as by the glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1. In all cases only very weak or no inhibition of activation was observed with the construct expressing the POU domain alone, indicating that the effects are dependent upon the N terminus of Oct-2. Hence, the N terminus is able to inhibit activation by a variety of activation domains of different classes, although some of these effects are masked within intact Oct-2.5. Interestingly, however, in these experiments the N-terminal region of Oct-2 was able to only partially inhibit its own proline-rich activation domain when the two regions are delivered to the DNA via separate DNA-binding domains. To investigate this effect further, we used a construct in which the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 had been linked in tandem to the N and C-terminal domains of Oct-2 so that both these domains were located on a single molecule. When this construct was co-transfected with a construct containing five Gal4 sites cloned at position −105 relative to the transcriptional start site of the thymidine kinase promoter (42Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher F.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720PubMed Google Scholar) strong activation of transcription was observed (Fig. 5). Hence, the C-terminal activation domain can function in the presence of the N-terminal region when both are linked in cis to Gal4. In contrast, much weaker activation was observed using target constructs in which the Gal4 sites had been removed to either −770 or +1000 relative to the transcriptional start site (42Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher F.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720PubMed Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the weak stimulation of transcription produced when the Oct-2 C-terminal activation domain is bound at an enhancer position (32Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the ability of the Oct-2 inhibitory domain to inhibit all three of these constructs (21Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the intact N-terminal region is thus able to inhibit its own C-terminal activation domain only weakly it is a more effective inhibitor overall than intact Oct-2.5 (compare Fig. 3, Fig. 4). We therefore investigated the effects of the different regions of Oct-2 on the inhibition of activation in more detail. In particular we tested the effects of a series of N- and C-terminal deletions of Oct-2.2 (32Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) on activation by the Gal4/VP16 fusion protein in BHK cells. All these constructs had previously been shown to direct similar levels of expression of the appropriate form of Oct-2 when transfected into different cell types including BHK-21 cells (18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 6, progressive deletion of the N terminus of Oct-2.2 leaving the C terminus intact resulted in a progressive reduction in the ability to inhibit transactivation by the acidic activation domain of VP16 until a construct lacking the first 161 amino acids of Oct-2.2 was unable to inhibit activation. Interestingly, however, progressive deletion of the C terminus of Oct-2.2 removing the activation domain resulted in an increase in the ability to inhibit trans-activation. Thus, constructs containing the entire N terminus but truncated at amino acids 370 or 357 at the C terminus showed a stronger ability to inhibit trans-activation than the intact Oct-2.2 construct. As expected the ability to inhibit was lost upon further C-terminal truncation to amino acid 344, since this truncation disrupts the POU domain and would therefore prevent DNA binding. These findings suggested that a construct containing the minimal repression domain defined in our previous studies would be likely to inhibit trans-activation in BHK cells in the absence of the C-terminal activation domain. As shown in Fig. 6, this is indeed the case with strong inhibition being produced by a construct encoding amino acids 154-376 and therefore containing only the inhibitory domain and the DNA-binding POU domain. In view of this fact that the strong inhibition produced by this minimal construct was much greater than that produced by intact Oct-2.2 or 2.5, we tested its effect upon activity by the other activation domains. As shown in Fig. 7, the minimal inhibitory domain was able to significantly repress all the activation domains tested including the glutamine rich activation domain of Sp1 and even had an effect on the C-terminal activation domain of Oct-2 itself. The target promoters used in all these experiments contained a TATA box downstream of the Oct-2 and activator binding sites. We therefore wished to test the ability of the Oct-2 inhibitory domain to repress a promoter which lacks a TATA box and in which the basal transcriptional complex is assembled at an initiator element (Inr), which overlaps the transcriptional start site (for review see Ref. 46Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To do this we used a construct (Ref. 34Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 8a) which contains an initiator motif as well as upstream binding sites for Gal4 and the tetracycline repressor. This construct was transfected with four different Gal4 linked activators (representing each of the four classes, i.e. acidic, proline-rich, glutamine-rich, and the HOB motif) and the Oct-2 inhibitory domain linked to the DNA-binding domain of the tetracycline repressor. As illustrated in Fig. 8b, the inhibitory domain was unable to inhibit activation of initiator-driven transcription by the VP16, CTF, or Fos activation domains, although it did have an effect on activation by the Sp1 motif. Moreover, the same lack of effect on activation by VP16, CTF, or Fos was observed on a similar construct containing both an initiator and the EIB TATA box used in all the other target promoters (Fig. 8c), indicating that the lack of effect on initiator driven transcription predominates when both motifs are present. As expected, the Oct-2 inhibitory domain linked to the tetracycline repressor DNA-binding domain was able to repress the action of activators using the equivalent reporter construct containing only the TATA box and no initiator element (data not shown). Hence, the inhibitory domain in this construct is functionally active but is unable to act when an initiator motif is present either alone or in the presence of the TATA box. Following the identification of activation domains in a number of different transcription factors, three major types of domain have been identified, which are, respectively, rich in acidic, glutamine, or proline residues (for reviews, see Refs. 23Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1995Google Scholar and 47Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Here we show that the N-terminal inhibitory domain of the Oct-2 transcription factor can inhibit activation by members of all these three classes as well as by the HOB activation domain of c-Fos (29Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) when delivered to DNA via the Oct-2 POU domain, in the absence of other Oct-2 sequences. Interestingly, one of the activation domains that was most weakly inhibited by the inhibitory domain was the C-terminal activation domain of Oct-2 itself. This is in accord with our previous findings that, in the Oct-2 isoforms that contain this domain (Oct-2.1, −2.2, −2.3, and −2.6), it can overcome the inhibitory effect of the N-terminal domain (18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This results in Oct-2 activating transcription in B lymphocytes where these forms predominate (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously, however, that in the neuronal forms Oct-2.4 and 2.5, which lack this C-terminal activation domain (16Wirth T. Priess A. Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Oeler B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the inhibitory domain predominates resulting in these forms inhibiting gene expression (18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, at least in the case of Oct-2.5, the alternative C-terminal sequences that are present modulate the activity of the inhibitory domain so that it is more selective in its trans inhibition of activation domains. Thus, within Oct-2.5 the inhibitory domain can strongly repress acidic activation domains and the HOB domain. In contrast, however, it has a weaker effect on several proline-rich domains and on a glutamine-rich domain. These differences may be of biological significance. Thus, in neuronal cells, Oct-2 is involved in repressing the HSV IE promoters (13Lillycrop K.A. Dent C.L. Wheatley S.C. Beech M.N. Ninkina N.N. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in a failure of lytic infection and leading to asymptomatic latent infections (for reviews, see Refs. 48Roizman B. Sears A.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 543-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar and 49Latchman D.S. J. Exp. Pathol. 1990; 71: 133-141Google Scholar). This is achieved by Oct-2 binding to the TAATGARAT (R = purine) motifs in the HSV IE promoters and both directly inhibiting transcription and preventing the binding of the complex of Oct-1 and the HSV virion protein VP16, which is essential for trans-activation of the IE genes during lytic infection (50O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 51Preston C.M. Frame M.C. Campbell M.E.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 425-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, each IE promoter contains several TAATGARAT motifs (52Bzik D.G. Preston C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Gelman I.H. Silverstein S. J. Virology. 1987; 61: 3167-3172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Oct-2.5 to inhibit acidic activation domains in general and that of VP16 in particular would ensure that IE gene expression was inhibited, even when one of the TAATGARAT motifs was bound by an activating Oct-1/VP16 complex provided at least one other TAATGARAT had bound Oct-2. Subsequently, however, the reactivation of latent HSV must be achieved by activating IE gene expression in the absence of virion proteins such as VP16. This is likely to be achieved by the activation of specific cellular transcription factors that bind to other sites in the IE promoters and activate transcription. Thus, for example, treatment of neuronal cells with cyclic AMP can reactivate latent virus (54Smith R.L. Pizer L.I. Johnson Jr., E.M. Wilcox C.L. Virology. 1992; 188: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and this is associated with the activation of the CREB transcription factor (55Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which binds to the HSV IE1 gene promoter and activates it (56Wheatley S.C. Dent C.L. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 12: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this situation, therefore, the relatively weak inhibition of non-acidic activation domains by Oct-2.5 could allow cellular factors containing such domains to stimulate IE gene transcription and reactivation even in the presence of DNA-bound Oct-2.5. Whatever the precise significance of the differential effect of Oct-2.5 on different activation domains, it is clear that the Oct-2 inhibitory domain itself can inhibit a wide range of different activation domains. This finding renders it unlikely that the inhibitory domain acts by quenching the activity of activation domains. Thus, in cases of this type of repression, the inhibitory factor interacts with the activation domain; hence, such factors normally inhibit only a single type of activation domain (see for example Refs. 41Gray S. Szymanski P. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 57Kakkis E. Riggs K.J. Gillespie W. Calame K. Nature. 1989; 339: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, and 58Johnston S.A. Salmeron Jr., J.M. Dincher S.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This conclusion is in accordance with our finding that the inhibitory domain linked to Gal4 can function when the Gal4 sites are located at various positions relative to the transcriptional start site (19Friedl E.M. Matthias P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) since quenching factors normally function only when their DNA-binding site is located adjacent to the binding site of the activator (41Gray S. Szymanski P. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the Oct-2 inhibitory domain acts as a direct inhibitor of transcription interacting with the basal transcriptional complex to reduce its assembly and/or activity. This would allow it to interfere with gene activation by different classes of activation domains, which all act to stimulate this complex. This possibility is also supported by our previous finding that Oct-2 can repress a simple promoter containing only an octamer motif and TATA box with no binding sites for upstream activating molecules (17Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the ability of the Oct-2 inhibitory domain to repress transcription is dependent upon the TATA box, since it was unable to prevent activation by several different activation domains when transcription was directed by an initiator motif rather than by a TATA box. This effect parallels the inability of the KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) inhibitory domain to block the activation of initiator mediated transcription, although, as in the case of the Oct-2 inhibitory domain, it did have some effect on activation of the initiator by the SP1 activation domain (34Pengue G. Lania L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the KRAB inhibitor domain was able to prevent activation of a promoter containing both an initiator motif and a TATA box. In contrast Oct-2 did not repress such a construct, although it repressed constructs containing the same EIB TATA box without the initiator when delivered via either the Gal4 or Tet repressor DNA-binding domains. It is therefore possible that, in the case of Oct-2, the initiator motif can actually prevent repression of TATA box-mediated transcription as well as being itself refractory to such repression. Whatever the reason for this difference between the Oct-2 and KRAB domains, the ability of the Oct-2 inhibitory domain to repress many different classes of activator and its dependence on basal promoter elements indicates that it is likely to act by interacting directly with the basal transcriptional complex bound at the TATA box. The target for such repression may be a specific component of such complexes, which is absent in complexes bound at the initiator. Such factors would include the TATA-binding protein-associated factors, which differ in the TFIID, complexes formed at the initiator and the TATA box (59Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Oct-2 could interact with a component common to both types of complex such as the TATA-binding protein component of TFIID (60Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) if such a component were present in the TATA box complex in a different configuration, which allows it to interact with Oct-2. We are currently investigating the ability of the Oct-2 inhibitory domain to interact with the components of the TATA box, basal transcriptional complex (61Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to determine whether one of these factors is the target which is inhibited by Oct-2. It is already clear, however, that this factor must directly inhibit a central component of the transcriptional complex bound at the TATA box, downstream of the target factors stimulated by different classes of activation domain.

Monospecific antibodies raised against four synthetic peptides from this region, PhK1 (362-386), PhK5 (342-366), PhK9 (322-346), and PhK13 (302-326), were found to have significant effects on the catalytic activities of phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex.

Phosphorylase kinase (ATP:phosphorylase phosphotransferase, EC) catalyzes the conversion of phosphorylase b to a and plays a key role in regulating glycogen breakdown in response to adrenergic and neuronal stimuli. The skeletal muscle isozyme is a multimeric enzyme with the subunit composition (αβγγ)4 and a molecular weight of 1.3 × 106 (reviewed in Ref. 1Pickett-Gies C.A. Walsh D.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986: 395Google Scholar). The α-, β-, and γ-subunits are regulatory subunits, whereas the γ-subunit is the catalytic subunit (2Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4185-4192Google Scholar). Interactions of the regulatory subunits with the γ-subunit serve to modulate the activity of the enzyme in response to the second messengers, cAMP and Ca2+. Phosphorylation of the α- and β-subunits by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and by autophosphorylation activates the enzyme at pH 6.8. The unphosphorylated α- and β-subunits are thought to inhibit the catalytic site from exhibiting maximum catalytic potential, since inhibition can be relieved by increasing pH to 8.2, by phosphorylation, by proteolysis, or by dissociation of these subunits from the holoenzyme complex. Ca2+ dependence is conferred upon the enzyme by the γ-subunit, which is identical to calmodulin (3Cohen P. Burchell A. Foulkes J.G. Cohen P.T.W. Vanaman T.C. Nairn A. FEBS Lett. 1978; 92: 287-293Google Scholar). Residues 19-276 of the γ-subunit represent the catalytic domain of the enzyme based on sequence homology with other protein kinases (2Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4185-4192Google Scholar). Two crystal structures of a constitutively active catalytic core of the γ-subunit (residues 1-298) have recently been solved to a resolution of 3.0 Å or better (4Owen D.J. Noble M.E.M. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Google Scholar). Overall, these two γ-subunit structures are very similar to the catalytic cores of other protein kinases. The C-terminal 110 amino acids of the γ-subunit (277-386) are thought to contain pseudosubstrate/autoinhibitory domains and subunit interaction domains based on this region's lack of sequence similarity to other protein kinases (2Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4185-4192Google Scholar) and studies involving limited proteolysis (5Harris W.R. Malencik D.A. Johnson C.M. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Byles C.A. Anderson S.R. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Fischer E.H. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11740-11745Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (6Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J.

By using a library of overlapping synthetic γ-subunit peptides, the regions corresponding to γ302-326 and γ342-366 have been identified as being regulatory subdomains that act in concert to mediate interactions between the γ-subunit and the catalytic domain of the γ-subunit (6Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Google Scholar, 9Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Google Scholar, 10Dasgupta M. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22283-22289Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to these two regions (termed PhK13 and PhK5, respectively) bind calmodulin with high affinity (9Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Google Scholar) and competitively inhibit phosphorylase kinase catalytic activity (6Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Google Scholar, 10Dasgupta M. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22283-22289Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments (6Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Google Scholar) and small-angle scattering studies (11Trewhella J. Blumenthal D.K. Rokop S.E. Seeger P.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9316-9324Google Scholar) have provided limited structural information regarding the interactions of PhK5 and PhK13 with the γ-subunit catalytic domain (6Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Google Scholar) and the γ-subunit (11Trewhella J. Blumenthal D.K. Rokop S.E. Seeger P.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9316-9324Google Scholar). However, detailed information regarding the structure of the γ-subunit regulatory domain is not presently available. It has also been proposed that the regulatory domain of the γ-subunit might interact directly with the α- and β-subunits (2Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4185-4192Google Scholar), but the sites of interaction on the γ-subunit for the α- and β-subunits have yet to be firmly established. The present investigation was undertaken to better define the potential regulatory functions of specific regions within the regulatory domain of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase. Antibodies were raised against each of four peptides, PhK1 (γ362-386), PhK5 (γ342-366), PhK9 (γ322-346), and PhK13 (γ302-326), that together span the C-terminal 85 amino acids of the γ-subunit (Fig. 1). These monospecific antibodies were then affinity-purified and assayed for their ability to activate or inhibit the catalytic activity of several different forms of phosphorylase kinase. The approach of using antipeptide antibodies as probes to assess the functional properties of putative regulatory domains within protein kinases has previously been used to characterize the calmodulin-binding domain of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (12Nunnally M.H.

The results of the studies presented here indicate that binding of monospecific antibodies to the regulatory domain of the γ-subunit can have profound effects on catalytic activity and provide important insights into structural features involved in regulatory interactions in the phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme complex. Phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme was prepared by the procedure of Cohen (18Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Google Scholar), and phosphorylase b was prepared using the procedure of Fischer and Krebs (19Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 55: 369-373Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using values of E1%280 nm of 12.4 (18Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Google Scholar) and 13.2 (20Kastenschmidt L.L.

The γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase was purified using reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. as described by Crabb and Heilmeyer (21Crabb J.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6346-6350Google Scholar), except that a Vydac C-4 analytical column (5 mm, 0.46 × 25 cm) was used instead of a Vydac C-18 column. The subunit elution pattern obtained using the C-4 column was similar to that reported for the C-18 column. The active γ·γ complex was prepared from HPLC-purified γ-subunit using the reactivation procedure described by Kee and Graves (22Kee S.M. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4732-4737Google Scholar). The reactivation buffer contained 50 m Tris, 50 m β-glycerophosphate, pH 8.0, 2 m dithiothreitol, 0.1 m CaCl2, 3 m calmodulin, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and HPLC-purified γ-subunit (diluted 10-fold into the reactivation buffer). Reactivation was carried out at 0°C for 18 h. high performance liquid chromatography 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Synthesis of peptides was done by standard solid-phase techniques using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry as described previously (9Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Google Scholar). Peptide purification was performed using reversed-phase HPLC, and each sequence was confirmed by amino acid analysis and protein sequence analysis. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptides PhK1 (γ362-386), PhK5 (γ342-366), PhK9 (γ322-346), and PhK13 (γ302-326), which span the C-terminal 85 residues of the γ-subunit (see Fig. 1). In the case of PhK1, PhK5, and PhK9, the peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde, and then each peptide was used to immunize two rabbits using the Ribi Adjuvant System (Hamilton, MT). Booster injections were given on days 14 and 28 and every month thereafter. Rabbits were bled each week (3 times a month) between immunizations. In the case of PhK13, the peptide was coupled to Imject maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) and used to immunize two rabbits. These rabbits were immunized and bled by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) according to their recommended schedule. Initial screening using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to select the rabbits giving the best responses and the bleeds with the highest titer against phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme. These antisera were used for the subsequent workup described below. Each antiserum was subjected to the following prepurification procedure to remove contaminating lipids and lipoproteins. To each milliliter of antiserum, 0.05 ml 5% (w:v) sodium dextran sulfate (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added, stirred, then allowed to sit on ice for 1 h. To this solution was added 0.09 ml of 11.1% (w/v) CaCl2/ml of antiserum. The solution was allowed to settle on ice for 1-2 h, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min. To further purify the antipeptide antibodies, the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation by slowly adding, while stirring, 0.667 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 7.3)/ml of antibody solution. The solution was allowed to stir for 1 h on ice and then was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 25 min. The precipitated pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of Milli-Q water and then dialyzed overnight against Milli-Q water at 4°C. The dialysate was then subjected to affinity purification using phosphorylase kinase immobilized to Sepharose 4B. Phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B at a density of 5 mg of protein/ml of gel to produce affinity columns for the isolation of each of the antipeptide antibodies. Dry CNBr-activated Sepharose (1.14 g; Sigma) was suspended in 1 m HCl to dissolve stabilizers and hydrate the gel. After about 1 min, the suspension was filtered, and to the moist gel was added 20 mg of phosphorylase kinase dissolved in 0.1 borate, 0.5 NaCl, pH 8.3. The gel and phosphorylase kinase were gently shaken for 24 h at 4°C, after which the suspension was mixed with 1 ethanolamine and shaken at room temperature for another 2 h to block unreacted sites on the gel. The gel was washed with 0.1 borate, 0.5 NaCl, pH 8.3, followed by 0.1 acetic acid, 0.5 NaCl, pH 4.0, and was then aliquoted into four 1-ml columns. The columns were stored in 50 m MOPS, 2 m EDTA, pH 7.0, at 4°C. Before use, the columns used for purification of anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 were equilibrated with buffer containing 50 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 µ leupeptin. The columns used for anti-PhK9 and anti-PhK13 were preequilibrated with the above buffer containing 200 µ CaCl2. Antipeptide antibodies were applied to the columns in the presence (anti-PhK9 and anti-PhK13) or absence (anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5) of 200 µ Ca2+. The columns were then washed with equilibration buffer until the A280 of the column effluent was less than 0.05. The anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 antibodies were eluted with 500 m MgCl2, and the anti-PhK9 and anti-PhK13 antibodies were eluted with 50 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 m dithiothreitol, 1 µ leupeptin, and 2 m EDTA. Eluates were desalted using Bio-Gel P6 DG (Bio-Rad) desalting columns and stored in phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C. Antibody concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a E1%280 nm value of 15 for IgG (23Fasman G.D. Practical Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar). Fab fragments were prepared from affinity-purified anti-PhK1 antibody according to the procedure of Gibson et al. (24Gibson A.L. Herron J.N. He X.-M. Patrick V.A. Mason M.L. Lin J.-N. Kranz D.M. Voss E.W.J. Edmundson A.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 3: 155-160Google Scholar) as briefly described here. A sample of affinity-purified antibody (0.5 mg) was dialyzed overnight at pH 7.5 against 50 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 NaCl, and 2 m EDTA. After dialysis, dithioerythritol was added to a final concentration of 1 m. A suspension of mercuripapain (Sigma) was prepared in the above buffer in the presence of 10 m dithioerythritol. The solutions of protease and antibody were mixed in a ratio of 1:33 (w:w) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of dehydroascorbic acid to a final concentration of 1 m, and the solution was allowed to sit for 15 min. The solution was filtered (0.22-µm filter, Pharmacia), and the Fab fragments were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex 200 prep grade (HiLoad 16/60) column. A sandwich ELISA method was used to determine the ability of anti-PhK1 Fab fragments to bind phosphorylase kinase and the γ·γ complex. The procedure used the reagents and protocol provided in the ELISAmate kit (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). Polystyrene microtiter plates (96-well flat-bottom, Corning) were first coated with the indicated concentrations of anti-PhK1 or anti-PhK1 Fab fragment for 1 h at room temperature. Either phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme (0.9 µg/ml) or γ·γ complex in 1% (w/w) bovine serum albumin was then added and allowed to bind for 1 h before the plate was emptied and rinsed with 1% bovine serum albumin. Antibody raised against a synthetic multiple antigen peptide corresponding to the N terminus of the γ-subunit, GKSHSGPLAADRT, was then added (0.7 µg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin) and allowed to bind for 1 h. The plate was then emptied and washed three times with 0.02% Tween 20 (v/v). Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.3 µg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin) was added and incubated for 1 h. The plate was then washed three times (0.02% Tween 20) before adding the color development reagents, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. The plate was read in kinetic mode on a UVmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 650 nm using SOFTmax (version 2.01) for data acquisition and analysis. A radioactive protein kinase assay was used to monitor antipeptide antibody interactions with phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex. Enzymatic activities of the holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex were determined by measuring the rate of 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into phosphorylase b or a synthetic peptide substrate (SDQEKRKQISVRGLG). The reaction mixture (50 µl) contained 50 m HEPES, 42 m Tris, 1 m dithiothreitol, pH 8.2 or 6.8 (as indicated), 10 m magnesium acetate, 200 µ CaCl2, 25 µ phosphorylase b or 250 µ peptide substrate (as indicated), 100 ng of phosphorylase kinase, and 1 m [γ-32P]ATP (300 cpm/pmol; DuPont NEN). The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 30°C before the reactions were started by the addition of ATP. Aliquots of 10 or 20 µl of each reaction were removed after 5 and 15 min and spotted on Whatman 3MM or P81 filter paper squares. Whatman 3MM paper squares were used for the protein substrate, and P81 filter paper squares were used for the synthetic peptide substrate. The paper squares were immediately placed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 4% sodium pyrophosphate (3MM paper) or 75 m H3PO4 (P81 paper). The papers were washed at least three times, rinsed in 95% ethanol, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter following the addition of Opti-fluor (Packard Instrument Co.) scintillation mixture. Assays containing antibodies or Fab fragments were performed as described above except that the enzyme was preincubated on ice (in a volume of 10 µl) with the indicated concentrations of antibody or Fab fragment for the indicated times before addition to the protein kinase reaction mixture. Phosphorylase kinase (2 mg/ml) was activated by incubation with 0.02 milliunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (Promega; units of activity are as defined by Promega) and 1 m ATP for 30 min in a volume of 100 µl in the presence of the pH 6.8 kinase assay buffer described above. The protein kinase-activated phosphorylase kinase was then preincubated with antibody and assayed as described above. Error bars associated with each data set represent standard errors of the mean calculated from duplicate or triplicate assay tubes, each of which was sampled at two time points. In some cases, the data represent means and standard errors from more than one experiment. Nonlinear least squares curve-fitting was performed using MacCurveFit (version 1.03) to estimate Km and Vmax values and to determine partial inhibition constants. The ability of each affinity-purified antipeptide antibody to alter the enzymatic activity of phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme (Fig. 2) and γ·γ complex (Fig. 3) at pH 8.2 was examined. Two of the antibodies, anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5, induced activation of both phosphorylase kinase and the γ·γ complex in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, anti-PhK1 antibody increased holoenzyme activity by approximately 1150% and the γ·γ complex activity by 250%. The degree of holoenzyme activation induced by anti-PhK5 antibody was approximately 70% of that seen with anti-PhK1 antibody and somewhat less (50%) for the γ·γ complex. The extent of holoenzyme and γ·γ complex activation induced by anti-PhK1 in the presence of 3 m EGTA was greater than that seen in the presence of Ca2+ with no antibody present. The extent of stimulation of holoenzyme and γ·γ complex activity by anti-PhK5 in the presence of 3 m EGTA was nearly equal to the Ca2+-stimulated activity in the absence of antibody. The concentration of anti-PhK1 required for activation was comparable for the holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex, in the presence or absence of Ca2+, with maximal activation occurring at an antibody concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (data not shown).Fig. 3Effect of affinity-purified antipeptide antibodies on γ·γ complex activity in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA. The γ·γ complex was incubated in the presence of antipeptide antibodies and assayed at pH 8.2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The horizontal dashed line represents the Ca2+-stimulated activity of the γ·γ complex in the absence of antibody. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the activation of phosphorylase kinase by anti-PhK1 required antibody with intact Fc regions, Fab fragments of anti-PhK1 were tested for their ability to activate the holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex. Other antipeptide antibodies were not investigated due to difficulties in purifying these other antibodies in sufficient quantities to conduct such studies. The anti-PhK1 Fab fragments were unable to activate either the holoenzyme or the γ·γ complex (Fig. 4). A sandwich ELISA was used to determine whether the inability of the Fab fragments to activate was due to the loss of binding capability. It was found that the anti-PhK1 Fab fragments were still able to bind holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex as tightly as the intact antibody (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Binding of anti-PhK1 antibody (filled symbols) and anti-PhK1 Fab fragments (open symbols) to phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex as determined by sandwich ELISA. Data obtained using anti-PhK1 antibody are represented by filled symbols, and anti-PhK1 Fab data are represented by open symbols. Data obtained using holoenzyme are depicted by square symbols, while those obtained using the γ·γ complex are represented by circles. Details of the sandwich ELISA are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of three independent assays (each with quadruplicate wells) ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The time dependence of antibody activation was assessed by measuring holoenzyme and γ·γ complex activity after overnight and 1-h incubations. Antibody-induced activation by anti-PhK5 occurred in a time-dependent manner with holoenzyme but not with the γ·γ complex (data not shown). Anti-PhK1 exhibited no difference between the overnight and 1-h incubations in the extent of activation of either holoenzyme or the γ·γ complex. To examine the possible mechanisms for antibody-induced activation, kinetic analyses were performed with anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 antibody using both the holoenzyme and the γ·γ complex in the presence and absence of Ca2+ at pH 6.8. The Km and Vmax values determined from these analyses are shown in Table I. In the presence of Ca2+, the effects of both anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 on holoenzyme activity were primarily attributable to changes in Vmax, with only modest or minimal effects on Km values for ATP or phosphorylase b. Because of the intrinsic difficulty in accurately determining Km values, it is difficult to know whether the 2-fold decrease in Km value for ATP seen with anti-PhK1 and the comparable effect of anti-PhK5 on the Km value for phosphorylase b are due to normal assay variability or whether these lower Km values reflect real but modest effects of these antibodies on enzyme-substrate interactions. The effects of anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 on holoenzyme Vmax values were much more robust, with anti-PhK1 increasing Vmax values 10-13-fold and anti-PhK5 increasing Vmax values 7-9-fold.TABLE ISummary of kinetic data for antibody activation and inhibition of holoenzyme and γ·γ complex activityPhosphorylase bATPKmVmaxKmVmaxµmµmol/min/mgµmµmol/min/mgPhosphorylase kinase holoenzyme in the presence of Ca2+ (1 m)Control64.0 ± 3.16 (53.2)2.23 ± 0.05 (2.01)0.25 ± 0.03 (0.33)1.37 ± 0.06 (1.55)Anti-PhK155.8 ± 8.11 (55.9)28.8 ± 1.96 (28.9)0.13 ± 0.01 (0.21)13.9 ± 0.04 (15.7)Anti-PhK532.7 ± 7.51 (38.6)14.8 ± 1.26 (15.9)0.26 ± 0.01 (0.25)12.7 ± 0.24 (12.6)Anti-PhK1365.9 ± 13.8 (53.3)1.34 ± 0.14 (1.20)0.31 ± 0.05 (0.48)0.79 ± 0.05 (0.96)Phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme in the absence of Ca2+ (3 m EGTA)Control69.0 ± 11.2 (49.7)0.49 ± 0.04 (0.61)0.19 ± 0.06 (0.17)0.39 ± 0.04 (0.38)Anti-PhK117.5 ± 10.1 (23.1)4.56 ± 0.77 (5.04)0.45 ± 0.05 (0.73)8.79 ± 0.46 (11.4)Anti-PhK528.9 ± 10.2 (24.2)1.57 ± 0.20 (1.50)0.42 ± 0.06 (0.50)2.70 ± 0.15 (2.94)γ·γ complex in the presence of Ca2+ (1 m)Control47.9 ± 9.57 (31.5)1.76 ± 0.15 (1.46)0.13 ± 0.02 (0.15)1.02 ± 0.03 (1.06)Anti-PhK112.5 ± 3.00 (17.0)3.81 ± 0.22 (4.13)0.10 ± 0.01 (0.09)3.00 ± 0.06 (2.94)Anti-PhK531.2 ± 11.2 (38.5)2.94 ± 0.38 (3.17)0.27 ± 0.05 (0.27)1.71 ± 0.11 (1.72)γ·γ complex in the absence of Ca2+ (3 m EGTA)Control59.5 ± 9.37 (72.4)0.41 ± 0.03 (0.45)0.21 ± 0.04 (0.27)0.37 ± 0.02 (0.41)Anti-PhK116.7 ± 5.25 (26.2)1.43 ± 0.12 (1.65)0.14 ± 0.01 (0.15)1.49 ± 0.03 (1.52)Anti-PhK585.2 ± 26.9 (96.9)2.06 ± 0.36 (2.16)0.11 ± 0.02 (0.12)0.75 ± 0.03 (0.78) Open table in a new tab Slightly different kinetic patterns were observed for holoenzyme activation when the Ca2+ concentration was lowered using EGTA, although the effect of antibody was still predominantly a Vmax effect. Assays of the holoenzyme with varying concentrations of phosphorylase b in the presence of 3 m EGTA resulted in a 9.3-fold increase in Vmax with anti-PhK1 antibody but an increase of only 3.2-fold with anti-PhK5 antibody (Table I). There were also 4-fold and 2.4-fold decreases in the Km value for phosphorylase b with anti-PhK1 antibody and anti-PhK5 antibody, respectively. Kinetic analyses using ATP as the varied substrate indicated there were no significant differences in Km values for ATP, but there were 22.5- and 7-fold increases in Vmax values with anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 antibodies, respectively. These observations indicate that in the absence of Ca2+, anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 both activate the holoenzyme through a mixed type mechanism, which is mostly due to an effect on Vmax, but with some rate-enhancing effects on the Km for phosphorylase b and no effect on the Km for ATP. The kinetic patterns observed for activation of the γ·γ complex by anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 were similar overall to those seen with the holoenzyme, with activation being predominantly a Vmax effect (Table I). Differences between holoenzyme activation and γ·γ complex activation were primarily seen in the extent of activation and the somewhat more complex pattern of γ·γ complex activation observed with anti-PhK1 in the presence of Ca2+. A 4-fold decrease in the Km value for phosphorylase b and a 2-fold increase in the Vmax was seen when the γ·γ complex was assayed with anti-PhK1 antibody in the presence of Ca2+, indicating a mixed type activation, which differs from the pure Vmax effect seen with the holoenzyme. A 1.7-fold increase in Vmax was seen with the anti-PhK5 antibody, with no significant change in Km for phosphorylase b. With regard to ATP, there was no significant change in Km value observed with anti-PhK1 and a 2-fold increase with anti-PhK5, whereas the Vmax value increased 3- and 1.7-fold with anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5, respectively. The effects of anti-PhK1 and anti-PhK5 on the Km and Vmax values of the γ·γ complex in the presence of EGTA were qualitatively the same as those seen in the presence of Ca2+, with Vmax effects always being observed and Km effects being seen to a variable degree.

Addition of ketone bodies to the perfusate decreased free [Mg2+] estimated from hbeta/alpha to 0.61 +/- 0.02 and 0.74 +/- 0.11 by [citrate]/[isocitrate] but the estimate from deltaalphabeta was unchanged at 0.46 +/- 0.04 mM.
