https://openalex.org/W4281483912,"Chronic non-healing wounds are a major complication of diabetes, which affects 1 in 10 people worldwide. Dying cells in the wound perpetuate the inflammation and contribute to dysregulated tissue repair1-3. Here we reveal that the membrane transporter SLC7A11 acts as a molecular brake on efferocytosis, the process by which dying cells are removed, and that inhibiting SLC7A11 function can accelerate wound healing. Transcriptomics of efferocytic dendritic cells in mouse identified upregulation of several SLC7 gene family members. In further analyses, pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A11, or deletion or knockdown of Slc7a11 using small interfering RNA enhanced efferocytosis in dendritic cells. Slc7a11 was highly expressed in dendritic cells in skin, and single-cell RNA sequencing of inflamed skin showed that Slc7a11 was upregulated in innate immune cells. In a mouse model of excisional skin wounding, inhibition or loss of SLC7A11 expression accelerated healing dynamics and reduced the apoptotic cell load in the wound. Mechanistic studies revealed a link between SLC7A11, glucose homeostasis and diabetes. SLC7A11-deficient dendritic cells were dependent on aerobic glycolysis using glucose derived from glycogen stores for increased efferocytosis; also, transcriptomics of efferocytic SLC7A11-deficient dendritic cells identified increased expression of genes linked to gluconeogenesis and diabetes. Further, Slc7a11 expression was higher in the wounds of diabetes-prone db/db mice, and targeting SLC7A11 accelerated their wound healing. The faster healing was also linked to the release of the TGFβ family member GDF15 from efferocytic dendritic cells. In sum, SLC7A11 is a negative regulator of efferocytosis, and removing this brake improves wound healing, with important implications for wound management in diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W4281488487,"Astrocytes respond to injury and disease in the central nervous system with reactive changes that influence the outcome of the disorder1-4. These changes include differentially expressed genes (DEGs) whose contextual diversity and regulation are poorly understood. Here we combined biological and informatic analyses, including RNA sequencing, protein detection, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and conditional gene deletion, to predict transcriptional regulators that differentially control more than 12,000 DEGs that are potentially associated with astrocyte reactivity across diverse central nervous system disorders in mice and humans. DEGs associated with astrocyte reactivity exhibited pronounced heterogeneity across disorders. Transcriptional regulators also exhibited disorder-specific differences, but a core group of 61 transcriptional regulators was identified as common across multiple disorders in both species. We show experimentally that DEG diversity is determined by combinatorial, context-specific interactions between transcriptional regulators. Notably, the same reactivity transcriptional regulators can regulate markedly different DEG cohorts in different disorders; changes in the access of transcriptional regulators to DNA-binding motifs differ markedly across disorders; and DEG changes can crucially require multiple reactivity transcriptional regulators. We show that, by modulating reactivity, transcriptional regulators can substantially alter disorder outcome, implicating them as therapeutic targets. We provide searchable resources of disorder-related reactive astrocyte DEGs and their predicted transcriptional regulators. Our findings show that transcriptional changes associated with astrocyte reactivity are highly heterogeneous and are customized from vast numbers of potential DEGs through context-specific combinatorial transcriptional-regulator interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4281397667,"The young circulatory milieu capable of delaying aging in individual tissues is of interest as rejuvenation strategies, but how it achieves cellular- and systemic-level effects has remained unclear. Here, we constructed a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across aged tissues/organs and their rejuvenation in heterochronic parabiosis (HP), a classical model to study systemic aging. In general, HP rejuvenated adult stem cells and their niches across tissues. In particular, we identified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as one of the most responsive cell types to young blood exposure, from which a continuum of cell state changes across the hematopoietic and immune system emanated, through the restoration of a youthful transcriptional regulatory program and cytokine-mediated cell-cell communications in HSPCs. Moreover, the reintroduction of the identified rejuvenating factors alleviated age-associated lymphopoiesis decline. Overall, we provide comprehensive frameworks to explore aging and rejuvenating trajectories at single-cell resolution and revealed cellular and molecular programs that instruct systemic revitalization by blood-borne factors."
https://openalex.org/W4281485880,"Mitochondria generate heat due to H+ leak (IH) across their inner membrane1. IH results from the action of long-chain fatty acids on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown fat2-6 and ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) in other tissues1,7-9, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. As evidence of pharmacological activators of IH through UCP1 and AAC is lacking, IH is induced by protonophores such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)10,11. Although protonophores show potential in combating obesity, diabetes and fatty liver in animal models12-14, their clinical potential for treating human disease is limited due to indiscriminately increasing H+ conductance across all biological membranes10,11 and adverse side effects15. Here we report the direct measurement of IH induced by DNP, FCCP and other common protonophores and find that it is dependent on AAC and UCP1. Using molecular structures of AAC, we perform a computational analysis to determine the binding sites for protonophores and long-chain fatty acids, and find that they overlap with the putative ADP/ATP-binding site. We also develop a mathematical model that proposes a mechanism of uncoupler-dependent IH through AAC. Thus, common protonophoric uncouplers are synthetic activators of IH through AAC and UCP1, paving the way for the development of new and more specific activators of these two central mediators of mitochondrial bioenergetics."
https://openalex.org/W4281483346,"Mitochondria are epicentres of eukaryotic metabolism and bioenergetics. Pioneering efforts in recent decades have established the core protein componentry of these organelles1 and have linked their dysfunction to more than 150 distinct disorders2,3. Still, hundreds of mitochondrial proteins lack clear functions4, and the underlying genetic basis for approximately 40% of mitochondrial disorders remains unresolved5. Here, to establish a more complete functional compendium of human mitochondrial proteins, we profiled more than 200 CRISPR-mediated HAP1 cell knockout lines using mass spectrometry-based multiomics analyses. This effort generated approximately 8.3 million distinct biomolecule measurements, providing a deep survey of the cellular responses to mitochondrial perturbations and laying a foundation for mechanistic investigations into protein function. Guided by these data, we discovered that PIGY upstream open reading frame (PYURF) is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase chaperone that supports both complex I assembly and coenzyme Q biosynthesis and is disrupted in a previously unresolved multisystemic mitochondrial disorder. We further linked the putative zinc transporter SLC30A9 to mitochondrial ribosomes and OxPhos integrity and established RAB5IF as the second gene harbouring pathogenic variants that cause cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia. Our data, which can be explored through the interactive online MITOMICS.app resource, suggest biological roles for many other orphan mitochondrial proteins that still lack robust functional characterization and define a rich cell signature of mitochondrial dysfunction that can support the genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases. A multiomics resource characterizing human mitochondrial proteins enables identification of biological functions and supports genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W4281552284,"A variety of ashes used as the binder in geopolymer concrete such as fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), rice husk ash (RHA), metakaolin (MK), palm oil fuel ash (POFA), and so on, among of them the FA was commonly used to produce geopolymer concrete. However, one of the drawbacks of using FA as a main binder in geopolymer concrete is that it needs heat curing to cure the concrete specimens, which lead to restriction of using geopolymer concrete in site projects; therefore, GGBS was used as a replacement for FA with different percentages to tackle this problem. In this study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), M5P-Tree (M5P), Linear Regression (LR), and Multi-logistic regression (MLR) models were used to develop the predictive models for predicting the compressive strength of blended ground granulated blast furnace slag and fly ash based-geopolymer concrete (GGBS/FA-GPC). A comprehensive dataset consists of 220 samples collected in several academic research studies and analyzed to develop the models. In the modeling process, for the first time, eleven effective variable parameters on the compressive strength of the GGBS/FA-GPC, including the Activated alkaline solution to binder ratio (l/b), FA content, SiO2/Al2O3 (Si/Al) of FA, GGBS content, SiO2/CaO (Si/Ca) of GGBS, fine (F) and coarse (C) aggregate content, sodium hydroxide (SH) content, sodium silicate (SS) content, (SS/SH) and molarity (M) were considered as the modeling input parameters. Various statistical assessments such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Scatter Index (SI), OBJ value, and the Coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the efficiency of the developed models. The results indicated that the ANN model better predicted the compressive strength of GGBS/FA-GPC mixtures compared to the other models. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the alkaline liquid to binder ratio, fly ash content, molarity, and sodium silicate content are the most affecting parameter for estimating the compressive strength of the GGBS/FA-GPC."
https://openalex.org/W4281477906,"Nerve injury leads to chronic pain and exaggerated sensitivity to gentle touch (allodynia) as well as a loss of sensation in the areas in which injured and non-injured nerves come together1-3. The mechanisms that disambiguate these mixed and paradoxical symptoms are unknown. Here we longitudinally and non-invasively imaged genetically labelled populations of fibres that sense noxious stimuli (nociceptors) and gentle touch (low-threshold afferents) peripherally in the skin for longer than 10 months after nerve injury, while simultaneously tracking pain-related behaviour in the same mice. Fully denervated areas of skin initially lost sensation, gradually recovered normal sensitivity and developed marked allodynia and aversion to gentle touch several months after injury. This reinnervation-induced neuropathic pain involved nociceptors that sprouted into denervated territories precisely reproducing the initial pattern of innervation, were guided by blood vessels and showed irregular terminal connectivity in the skin and lowered activation thresholds mimicking low-threshold afferents. By contrast, low-threshold afferents-which normally mediate touch sensation as well as allodynia in intact nerve territories after injury4-7-did not reinnervate, leading to an aberrant innervation of tactile end organs such as Meissner corpuscles with nociceptors alone. Genetic ablation of nociceptors fully abrogated reinnervation allodynia. Our results thus reveal the emergence of a form of chronic neuropathic pain that is driven by structural plasticity, abnormal terminal connectivity and malfunction of nociceptors during reinnervation, and provide a mechanistic framework for the paradoxical sensory manifestations that are observed clinically and can impose a heavy burden on patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281488642,"Real-world memories are formed in a particular context and are often not acquired or recalled in isolation1–5. Time is a key variable in the organization of memories, as events that are experienced close in time are more likely to be meaningfully associated, whereas those that are experienced with a longer interval are not1–4. How the brain segregates events that are temporally distinct is unclear. Here we show that a delayed (12–24 h) increase in the expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)—an immune receptor that is well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection6,7—after the formation of a contextual memory determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories. This delayed expression of CCR5 in mouse dorsal CA1 neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dorsal CA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, and therefore closes the temporal window for memory linking. Our findings also show that an age-related increase in the neuronal expression of CCR5 and its ligand CCL5 leads to impairments in memory linking in aged mice, which could be reversed with a Ccr5 knockout and a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that inhibits this receptor, a result with clinical implications. Altogether, the findings reported here provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that shape the temporal window for memory linking. A molecular mechanism involving CCR5 and CCL5 determines the temporal window in which a memory can be linked with subsequent memories, and in aged mice an increase in CCR5 is associated with defects in memory linking."
https://openalex.org/W4281488532,"T cell development in the thymus is essential for cellular immunity and depends on the organotypic thymic epithelial microenvironment. In comparison with other organs, the size and cellular composition of the thymus are unusually dynamic, as exemplified by rapid growth and high T cell output during early stages of development, followed by a gradual loss of functional thymic epithelial cells and diminished naive T cell production with age1-10. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered an unexpected heterogeneity of cell types in the thymic epithelium of young and aged adult mice11-18; however, the identities and developmental dynamics of putative pre- and postnatal epithelial progenitors have remained unresolved1,12,16,17,19-27. Here we combine scRNA-seq and a new CRISPR-Cas9-based cellular barcoding system in mice to determine qualitative and quantitative changes in the thymic epithelium over time. This dual approach enabled us to identify two principal progenitor populations: an early bipotent progenitor type biased towards cortical epithelium and a postnatal bipotent progenitor population biased towards medullary epithelium. We further demonstrate that continuous autocrine provision of Fgf7 leads to sustained expansion of thymic microenvironments without exhausting the epithelial progenitor pools, suggesting a strategy to modulate the extent of thymopoietic activity."

https://openalex.org/W4281487561,"Microbial communities and their associated bioactive compounds1-3 are often disrupted in conditions such as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)4. However, even in well-characterized environments (for example, the human gastrointestinal tract), more than one-third of microbial proteins are uncharacterized and often expected to be bioactive5-7. Here we systematically identified more than 340,000 protein families as potentially bioactive with respect to gut inflammation during IBD, about half of which have not to our knowledge been functionally characterized previously on the basis of homology or experiment. To validate prioritized microbial proteins, we used a combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to provide evidence of bioactivity for a subset of proteins that are involved in host and microbial cell-cell communication in the microbiome; for example, proteins associated with adherence or invasion processes, and extracellular von Willebrand-like factors. Predictions from high-throughput data were validated using targeted experiments that revealed the differential immunogenicity of prioritized Enterobacteriaceae pilins and the contribution of homologues of von Willebrand factors to the formation of Bacteroides biofilms in a manner dependent on mucin levels. This methodology, which we term MetaWIBELE (workflow to identify novel bioactive elements in the microbiome), is generalizable to other environmental communities and human phenotypes. The prioritized results provide thousands of candidate microbial proteins that are likely to interact with the host immune system in IBD, thus expanding our understanding of potentially bioactive gene products in chronic disease states and offering a rational compendium of possible therapeutic compounds and targets."
https://openalex.org/W4281476912,"The lineage and developmental trajectory of a cell are key determinants of cellular identity. In the vascular system, endothelial cells (ECs) of blood and lymphatic vessels differentiate and specialize to cater to the unique physiological demands of each organ1,2. Although lymphatic vessels were shown to derive from multiple cellular origins, lymphatic ECs (LECs) are not known to generate other cell types3,4. Here we use recurrent imaging and lineage-tracing of ECs in zebrafish anal fins, from early development to adulthood, to uncover a mechanism of specialized blood vessel formation through the transdifferentiation of LECs. Moreover, we demonstrate that deriving anal-fin vessels from lymphatic versus blood ECs results in functional differences in the adult organism, uncovering a link between cell ontogeny and functionality. We further use single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the different cellular populations and transition states involved in the transdifferentiation process. Finally, we show that, similar to normal development, the vasculature is rederived from lymphatics during anal-fin regeneration, demonstrating that LECs in adult fish retain both potency and plasticity for generating blood ECs. Overall, our research highlights an innate mechanism of blood vessel formation through LEC transdifferentiation, and provides in vivo evidence for a link between cell ontogeny and functionality in ECs."
https://openalex.org/W4281556208,"COVID-19 has so far affected more than 250 million individuals worldwide, causing more than 5 million deaths. Several risk factors for severe disease have been identified, most of which coincide with advanced age. In younger individuals, severe COVID-19 often occurs in the absence of obvious comorbidities. Guided by the finding of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells with some cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient, we decided to investigate whether CMV seropositivity is associated with severe or critical COVID-19. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) serostatus was investigated as control.National German COVID-19 bio-sample and data banks were used to retrospectively analyze the CMV and HSV serostatus of patients who experienced mild (n = 101), moderate (n = 130) or severe to critical (n = 80) disease by IgG serology. We then investigated the relationship between disease severity and herpesvirus serostatus via statistical models.Non-geriatric patients (< 60 years) with severe COVID-19 were found to have a very high prevalence of CMV-seropositivity, while CMV status distribution in individuals with mild disease was similar to the prevalence in the German population; interestingly, this was not detectable in older patients. Prediction models support the hypothesis that the CMV serostatus, unlike HSV, might be a strong biomarker in identifying younger individuals with a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, in particular in absence of other co-morbidities.We identified 'CMV-seropositivity' as a potential novel risk factor for severe COVID-19 in non-geriatric individuals in the studied cohorts. More mechanistic analyses as well as confirmation of similar findings in cohorts representing the currently most relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants should be performed shortly."
https://openalex.org/W4281400265,"Transcription factors specify the fate and connectivity of developing neurons. We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, Acj6 controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors."

https://openalex.org/W4281570038,"The appearance of a novel coronavirus in late 2019 radically changed the community of researchers working on coronaviruses since the 2002 SARS epidemic. In 2020, coronavirus-related publications grew by 20 times over the previous two years, with 130,000 more researchers publishing on related topics. The United States, the United Kingdom and China led dozens of nations working on coronavirus prior to the pandemic, but leadership consolidated among these three nations in 2020, which collectively accounted for 50% of all papers, garnering well more than 60% of citations. China took an early lead on COVID-19 research, but dropped rapidly in production and international participation through the year. Europe showed an opposite pattern, beginning slowly in publications but growing in contributions during the year. The share of internationally collaborative publications dropped from pre-pandemic rates; single-authored publications grew. For all nations, including China, the number of publications about COVID track closely with the outbreak of COVID-19 cases. Lower-income nations participate very little in COVID-19 research in 2020. Topic maps of internationally collaborative work show the rise of patient care and public health clusters-two topics that were largely absent from coronavirus research in the two years prior to 2020. Findings are consistent with global science as a self-organizing system operating on a reputation-based dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W4281552212,"Substantial inequalities exist in childhood vaccination coverage levels. To increase vaccine uptake, factors that predict vaccination coverage in children should be identified and addressed.Using data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and geospatial data sets, we fitted Bayesian multilevel binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to analyse independent predictors of three vaccination outcomes: receipt of the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine (containing diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Hemophilus influenzae type B and Hepatitis B vaccines) (PENTA1) (n = 6059) and receipt of the third dose having received the first (PENTA3/1) (n = 3937) in children aged 12-23 months, and receipt of measles vaccine (MV) (n = 11839) among children aged 12-35 months.Factors associated with vaccination were broadly similar for documented versus recall evidence of vaccination. Based on any evidence of vaccination, we found that health card/document ownership, receipt of vitamin A and maternal educational level were significantly associated with each outcome. Although the coverage of each vaccine dose was higher in urban than rural areas, urban residence was not significant in multivariable analyses that included travel time. Indicators relating to socio-economic status, as well as ethnic group, skilled birth attendance, lower travel time to the nearest health facility and problems seeking health care were significantly associated with both PENTA1 and MV. Maternal religion was related to PENTA1 and PENTA3/1 and maternal age related to MV and PENTA3/1; other significant variables were associated with one outcome each. Substantial residual community level variances in different strata were observed in the fitted models for each outcome.Our analysis has highlighted socio-demographic and health care access factors that affect not only beginning but completing the vaccination series in Nigeria. Other factors not measured by the DHS such as health service quality and community attitudes should also be investigated and addressed to tackle inequities in coverage."
https://openalex.org/W4281563914,"Hetian sheep is a breed of sheep unique to the Hetian area of Xinjiang whose wool is used for producing blankets. Individual differences and hair follicle density are the key factors affecting wool production. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the Hetian sheep having different wool densities to statistically analyze the wool traits and hair follicle parameters. Furthermore, the transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed on the skins with different wool densities. The results showed that wool quantity and total hair follicle density of the high wool density sheep was significantly higher than low wool density sheep. The sheepskin with high wool density was found to grow more and finer wool than sheepskin with low wool density. A total of 1,452 differentially expressed genes were screened from the two sets of samples, including 754 upregulated and 698 downregulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the TGF-β/BMP and MAPK signaling pathways related to hair growth. Eleven differentially expressed genes belonging to the KAPs and KIFs might affect the fineness of the wool. The key genes, like the TNF, MAP2K2, INHBA, FST, PTPN11, MAP3K7, KIT, and BMPR1A, were found to probably affect the growth and density of the wool. The qPCR verified eight genes related to the MAPK pathway whose gene expression trends were consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results. This study furnishes valuable resources for enhancing the quality and production of wool in the Hetian sheep."
https://openalex.org/W4281565068,"Each year, millions of premature deaths worldwide are caused by exposure to outdoor air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). Designing policies to reduce these deaths relies on air quality modeling for estimating changes in PM 2.5 concentrations from many scenarios at high spatial resolution. However, air quality modeling typically has substantial requirements for computation and expertise, which limits policy design, especially in countries where most PM 2.5 -related deaths occur. Lower requirement reduced-complexity models exist but are generally unavailable worldwide. Here, we adapt InMAP, a reduced-complexity model originally developed for the United States, to simulate annual-average primary and secondary PM 2.5 concentrations across a global-through-urban spatial domain: “Global InMAP”. Global InMAP uses a variable resolution grid, with horizontal grid cell widths ranging from 500 km in remote locations to 4km in urban locations. We evaluate Global InMAP performance against both measurements and a state-of-the-science chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. Against measurements, InMAP predicts total PM 2.5 concentrations with a normalized mean error of 62%, compared to 41% for GEOS-Chem. For the emission scenarios considered, Global InMAP reproduced GEOS-Chem pollutant concentrations with a normalized mean bias of 59%–121%, which is sufficient for initial policy assessment and scoping. Global InMAP can be run on a desktop computer; simulations here took 2.6–8.4 hours. This work presents a global, open-source, reduced-complexity air quality model to facilitate policy assessment worldwide, providing a screening tool for reducing air pollution-related deaths where they occur most."
https://openalex.org/W4281554319,"Target-D, a new person-centred e-health platform matching depression care to symptom severity prognosis (minimal/mild, moderate or severe) has demonstrated greater improvement in depressive symptoms than usual care plus attention control. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Target-D compared to usual care from a health sector and partial societal perspective across 3-month and 12-month follow-up.A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside the Target-D randomised controlled trial; which involved 1,868 participants attending 14 general practices in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Data on costs were collected using a resource use questionnaire administered concurrently with all other outcome measures at baseline, 3-month and 12-month follow-up. Intervention costs were assessed using financial records compiled during the trial. All costs were expressed in Australian dollars (A$) for the 2018-19 financial year. QALY outcomes were derived using the Assessment of Quality of Life-8D (AQoL-8D) questionnaire. On a per person basis, the Target-D intervention cost between $14 (minimal/mild prognostic group) and $676 (severe group). Health sector and societal costs were not significantly different between trial arms at both 3 and 12 months. Relative to a A$50,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, the probability of Target-D being cost-effective under a health sector perspective was 81% at 3 months and 96% at 12 months. From a societal perspective, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 30% at 3 months and 80% at 12 months.Target-D is likely to represent good value for money for health care decision makers. Further evaluation of QALY outcomes should accompany any routine roll-out to assess comparability of results to those observed in the trial. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000537459)."
https://openalex.org/W4281555338,"Brain microvascular endothelial cells, forming the anatomical site of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), are widely used as in vitro complements to in vivo BBB studies. Among the immortalized cells used as in vitro BBB models, the murine-derived bEnd.3 cells offer culturing consistency and low cost and are well characterized for functional and transport assays, but result in low transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Human-induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into brain microvascular endothelial cells (ihBMECs) have superior barrier properties, but the process of differentiation is time-consuming and can result in mixed endothelial-epithelial gene expression. Here we performed a side-by-side comparison of the ihBMECs and bEnd.3 cells for key paracellular diffusional transport characteristics. The TEER across the ihBMECs was 45- to 68-fold higher than the bEnd.3 monolayer. The ihBMECs had significantly lower tracer permeability than the bEnd.3 cells. Both, however, could discriminate between the paracellular permeabilities of two tracers: sodium fluorescein (MW: 376 Da) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran (MW: 70 kDa). FITC-dextran permeability was a strong inverse-correlate of TEER in the bEnd.3 cells, whereas sodium fluorescein permeability was a strong inverse-correlate of TEER in the ihBMECs. Both bEnd.3 cells and ihBMECs showed the typical cobblestone morphology with robust uptake of acetylated LDL and strong immuno-positivity for vWF. Both models showed strong claudin-5 expression, albeit with differences in expression location. We further confirmed the vascular endothelial- (CD31 and tube-like formation) and erythrophagocytic-phenotypes and the response to inflammatory stimuli of ihBMECs. Overall, both bEnd.3 cells and ihBMECs express key brain endothelial phenotypic markers, and despite differential TEER measurements, these in vitro models can discriminate between the passage of different molecular weight tracers. Our results highlight the need to corroborate TEER measurements with different molecular weight tracers and that the bEnd.3 cells may be suitable for large molecule transport studies despite their low TEER."
https://openalex.org/W4281566806,"Postpartum depression is an important public health concern. The prevalence of postpartum depression is estimated to be 18% worldwide. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of mothers at risk of postpartum depression in Sri Lanka and to investigate its associated risk factors.This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 975 mothers in Galle district, Sri Lanka. The prevalence of mothers at risk of postpartum depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression scale (EPDS) which has been validated for screening for mothers at risk of postpartum depression in Sri Lanka with a cut-off score 9 or more. Prevalence was estimated using a cut-off 9 or more, 10 or more, 11 or more and 12 or more to assess the difference in prevalence using unvalidated cut-offs for screening. Data from routine records on pregnancy, delivery and postnatal care was collected to investigate possible predictors of EPDS score 9 or more (risk of postpartum depression). Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify risk factors for EPDS score 9 or more (risk of postpartum depression).The prevalence of mothers with EPDS score 9 or more was found to be 9.4% (95%CI: 7.8-11.4); EPDS score 10 or more was 5.6% (95%CI: 4.4-7.3). EPDS score 9 or more (risk of postpartum depression) was associated with the following risk factors: Former history of mental illness (aOR 32.9, 95%CI: 7.9-136.2), high maternal age 30-39 (aOR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.8), BMI 25.0-29.9 (aOR 2.6, 95%CI: 1.5-4.5), hypertension (aOR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.2-10.9) and newborn death (aOR 28.9, 95%CI: 4.5-185.1). One in five women reported thoughts of self-harm.Around one in ten mothers in Sri Lanka experience symptoms of postpartum depression, highest risk among mothers who reported former history of mental illness and newborn death. The prevalence estimates were lower with a higher cut-off for screening and this highlights the importance of using the validated cut-off for screening in future studies on postpartum depression in Sri Lanka. Mothers at increased risk should be identified in antenatal care and are important targets of referral."

https://openalex.org/W4281558839,"Veterans who have recently left the military (i.e., transitioned) may be vulnerable to the development of psychiatric disorders, but little is known about gambling problems in this population. This study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of gambling problems, help-seeking amongst veterans with gambling problems, and relationships with trauma and posttraumatic psychopathology.Cross-sectional self-report survey data from 3,511 Australian Defence Force members who left the military within the past five years. Surveys included measures of gambling problems (PGSI); depressive symptoms (PHQ-9); posttraumatic stress disorder (PCL-5); help-seeking behaviours; military and non-military-related trauma.Prevalence rates for problem gambling (PGSI ≥ 5) were 4.6%, while an additional 8.8% were classified in terms of at-risk gambling (PGSI = 1-4). Time since leaving the military was not associated with gambling problems. Only 2.1% of veterans with problem gambling reported help-seeking for their gambling. While trauma exposure, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were all related to gambling problems at the bivariate level, only arousal and dysphoric-related affect were uniquely associated with gambling problems when adjusting for covariates.Gambling problems may be under-recognised relative to other psychiatric issues. Posttraumatic mental health problems, rather than trauma exposure per se, may explain the relationship between trauma and gambling problems.Some veterans are in a period of vulnerability during transition out of military service, and harms associated with gambling problems may be exacerbated during this period."
https://openalex.org/W4281560023,"The population dynamics of mosquitoes in temperate regions are not as well understood as those in tropical and subtropical regions, despite concerns that vector-borne diseases may be prevalent in future climates. Aedes albopictus, a vector mosquito in temperate regions, undergoes egg diapause while overwintering. To assess the prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases in the future, this study aimed to simulate and predict mosquito population dynamics under estimated future climatic conditions. In this study, we tailored the physiology-based climate-driven mosquito population (PCMP) model for temperate mosquitoes to incorporate egg diapauses for overwintering. We also investigated how the incorporation of the effect of rainfall on larval carrying capacity (into a model) changes the population dynamics of this species under future climate conditions. The PCMP model was constructed to simulate mosquito population dynamics, and the parameters of egg diapause and rainfall effects were estimated for each model to fit the observed data in Tokyo. We applied the global climate model data to the PCMP model and observed an increase in the mosquito population under future climate conditions. By applying the PCMP models (with or without the rainfall effect on the carrying capacity of the A. albopictus), our projections indicated that mosquito population dynamics in the future could experience changes in the patterns of their active season and population abundance. According to our results, the peak population number simulated using the highest CO2 emission scenario, while incorporating the rainfall effect on the carrying capacity, was approximately 1.35 times larger than that predicted using the model that did not consider the rainfall effect. This implies that the inclusion of rainfall effects on mosquito population dynamics has a major impact on the risk assessments of mosquito-borne diseases in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4281550401,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a critical determinant to assess the severity of chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus. It has a close association with complications, comorbidities, and medical aid. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of medical comorbidities and determine the relationship between comorbidities and HRQoL among type 2 diabetic patients of southern Bangladesh.This study was a cross-sectional study conducted through face to face interviews using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and by reviewing patient's health records with prior written consent. The study was conducted on 2,136 patients with type 2 diabetes attending five hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh, during the tenure of November 2018 to July 2019. Quality of life was measured using the widely-used index of EQ-5D that considers 243 different health states and uses a scale in which 0 indicates a health state equivalent to death and 1 indicates perfect health status. The five dimensions of the quality index included mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression.Patients with three comorbidities and with four or more comorbidities had a higher probability of reporting ""extreme problem"" or ""some problem"" in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D index compared with those without comorbidity (Odds ratio: mobility, 3.99 [2.72-5.87], 6.22 [3.80-10.19]; usual activity, 2.67 [1.76-4.06], 5.43 [3.28-8.98]; self-care, 2.60 [1.65-4.10], 3.95 [2.33-6.69]; pain or discomfort, 2.22 [1.48-3.33], 3.44 [1.83-6.45]; anxiety or depression, 1.75 [1.07-2.88], 2.45 [1.19-5.04]). The number of comorbidities had a negative impact on quality of life.Prevalent comorbidities were found to be the significant underlying cause of declined HRQoL. To raise diabetes awareness and for better disease management, the exposition of comorbidities in regards to HRQoL of people with diabetes should be considered for type 2 diabetes management schemas."
https://openalex.org/W4281568347,"Proper wound healing is vital for the survival of higher organisms. Responses to skin injury can lead to complications such as scar formation that can affect the quality of life. In this study, keratinocytes migration (scratch assay) and zebrafish tail regeneration experiments were used to evaluate the wound healing effect of a tocotrienol-based nanoemulsified (NE) system against ascorbic acid and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as positive and negative controls, respectively. MTT assay provided a concentration range of 0.35–8.75 μg/ml of nanoemulsion that produced cell viability more than 100%. After 24 hours of treatment, the wound closure of keratinocytes were found to be significantly faster by 73.76%, 63.37% and 35.56%, respectively when treated with 3.50 μg/ml and 1.75 μg/ml of NE compared to the blank. The lethal concentration at 50% (LC 50 value) obtained from acute and prolonged toxicity was almost similar, which was 4.6 mg/ml and 5.0 mg/ml, respectively. Growth of zebrafish tail regeneration treated with NE at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml was significantly faster than the untreated zebrafish, which regenerated to 40% on the fifth day, more than 60% on the tenth day of treatment and fully recovered at the twentieth day. In conclusion, these results showed the potential of the tocotrienols-based nanoemulsified system in enhancing wound healing through accelerated wound closure."
https://openalex.org/W4281569052,"Background In recent years, the potential of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the health field has been discussed widely. However, most MCDA methodologies have given little attention to the aggregation of different stakeholder individual perspectives. Objective To illustrate how a paraconsistent theory-based MCDA reusable framework, designed to aid hospital-based Health Technology Assessment (HTA), could be used to aggregate individual expert perspectives when valuing cancer treatments. Methods An MCDA methodological process was adopted based on paraconsistent theory and following ISPOR recommended steps in conducting an MCDA study. A proof-of-concept exercise focusing on identifying and assessing the global value of first-line treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was conducted to foster the development of the MCDA framework. Results On consultation with hospital-based HTA committee members, 11 perspectives were considered in an expert panel: medical oncology, oncologic surgery, radiotherapy, palliative care, pharmacist, health economist, epidemiologist, public health expert, health media expert, pharmaceutical industry, and patient advocate. The highest weights were assigned to the criteria “overall survival” (mean 0.22), “burden of disease” (mean 0.21) and “adverse events” (mean 0.20), and the lowest weights were given to “progression-free survival” and “cost of treatment” (mean 0.18 for both). FOLFIRI and mFlox scored the highest global value score of 0.75, followed by mFOLFOX6 with a global value score of 0.71. mIFL was ranked last with a global value score of 0.62. The paraconsistent analysis (para-analysis) of 6 first-line treatments for mCRC indicated that FOLFIRI and mFlox were the appropriate options for reimbursement in the context of this study. Conclusion The Paraconsistent Value Framework is proposed as a step beyond the current MCDA practices, in order to improve means of dealing with individual expert perspectives in hospital-based HTA of cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4281555178,"Although balloon dilation has shown promising results in the treatment of dilatory Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, the histological effects of ET balloon dilation (ETBD) is unknown because histological examination of the whole human cartilaginous ET is impossible. Animal studies are needed to elucidate the effect of ETBD so we evaluated the histological changes after ETBD in a rat model. The left ET of 20 Wistar rats was dilated with a balloon catheter and the right ET was used as a control. Five rats were sacrificed immediately after ETBD, at 1, 4 and 12 weeks after the procedure for histological examination. The epithelial cells, presence of epithelial hyperplasia, and the proportion of the goblet cells in the epithelium; the vascular structures and dimensions of the submucosa; and presence of cartilage fracture and the area of the ET lumen were evaluated and compared between the groups. Desquamation of nearly all epithelial cells and the fracture of tubal cartilages were observed immediately after ETBD. At 1-week post-ETBD, the ciliated epithelial cells started to recover with epithelial hyperplasia. The goblet cells recovered by 4 weeks post-ETBD and epithelial hyperplasia decreased but was still present at 12 weeks post-ETBD. The depth of the submucosa increased and neovascularization in this region was observed at 1-week post-ETBD and persisted up to 12 weeks post-ETBD. The lumen of the cartilaginous ET increased immediately after ETBD but decreased at 1-week post-ETBD. The cartilaginous ET lumen recovered to the normal value at 4 weeks post-ETBD. This study is the first to describe the serial histological changes to the cartilaginous ET after ETBD and helps our understanding of the histological changes that occur after an ETBD intervention for intractable ET dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4281555984,"Elevated levels of testosterone and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are both independently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship between sex hormones and FGF-23 is not well established. We explored the association between sex hormones and FGF-23 among middle-aged to older men and women in MESA. We studied 3,052 men and 2,868 postmenopausal women free of CVD at the time of enrollment with baseline serum sex hormones [total testosterone (T), free T, estradiol (E2) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)] and intact FGF-23. In sex-stratified analyses, we examined the cross-sectional associations between log-transformed sex hormones (per 1 SD) and log-transformed FGF-23 using multiple linear regression adjusted for socio-demographics, CVD risk factors, estimated glomerular filtration rate and mineral metabolites (25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone). The mean (SD) age of study participants was 64 (10) years. The median (IQR) of FGF-23 was similar in women and men [38 (30-46) vs 38 (31-47) pg/mL]. In adjusted analyses, among women, 1 SD increment in free T was associated with 3% higher FGF-23 while SHBG was associated with 2% lower FGF-23. In men, 1 SD increment in E2 was associated with 6% higher FGF-23 whereas total T/E2 ratio was associated with 7% lower FGF-23. In conclusion, this exploratory analysis found that a more androgenic sex hormone profile was directly associated with FGF-23 in women and inversely associated with FGF-23 in men. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether FGF-23 mediates the relationship between sex hormones and CVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W4281556561,"Purpose There is abundant evidence on the benefits of physical activity on cardiovascular health. However, there are only few data on the acute effects of physical exercise on the retina and choroid. Our aim was the in vivo examination of chorioretinal alterations following short intense physical activity by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Methods Twenty-one eyes of 21 healthy, young subjects (mean age 22.5 ± 4.1 years, 15 males and 6 females) were recruited. Macular scanning with a SD-OCT was performed before and following a vita maxima-type physical strain exercise on a rowing ergometer until complete fatigue. Follow-up OCT scans were performed 1, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes following the exercise. The OCT images were exported and analyzed using our custom-built OCTRIMA 3D software and the thickness of 7 retinal layers was calculated, along with semi-automated measurement of the choroidal thickness. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed followed by Dunnett post hoc test for the thickness change compared to baseline and the correlation between performance and thickness change has also been calculated. The level of significance was set at 0.001. Results We observed a significant thinning of the total retina 1 minute post-exercise (-7.3 ± 0.6 μm, p &lt; 0.001) which was followed by a significant thickening by 5 and 15 minutes (+3.6 ± 0.6 μm and +4.0 ± 0.6 μm, respectively, both p &lt;0.001). Post-exercise retinal thickness returned to baseline by 30 minutes. This trend was present throughout the most layers of the retina, with significant changes in the ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex, (-1.3 ± 0.1 μm, +0.6 ± 0.1 μm and +0.7 ± 0.1 μm, respectively, p &lt;0.001 for all), in the inner nuclear layer at 1 and 5 minutes (-0.8 ± 0.1 μm and +0.8 ± 0.1 μm, respectively, p &lt;0.001 for both), in the outer nuclear layer–photoreceptor inner segment complex at 5 minute (+2.3 ± 0.4 μm, p &lt;0.001 for all) and in the interdigitation zone–retinal pigment epithelium complex at 1 and 15 minutes (-3.3 ± 0.4 μm and +1.8 ± 0.4 μm, respectively, p &lt;0.001 for both). There was no significant change in choroidal thickness; however, we could detect a tendency towards thinning at 1, 15, and 30 minutes following exercise. The observed changes in thickness change did not correlate with performance. Similar trends were observed in both professional and amateur sportsmen (n = 15 and n = 6, respectively). The absolute changes in choroidal thickness did not show any correlation with the thickness changes of the intraretinal layers. Conclusions Our study implies that in young adults, intense physical exercise has an acute effect on the granular layers of the retina, resulting in thinning followed by rebound thickening before normalization. We could not identify any clear correlation with either choroidal changes or performance that might explain our observations, and hence the exact mechanism warrants further clarification. We believe that a combination of vascular and mechanic changes is behind the observed trends."
https://openalex.org/W4281565934,"We investigated the diagnostic utility of combined nerve and vascular ultrasound in thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) in a retrospective cohort study on two sites, involving 167 consecutive patients with the clinical symptoms suggestive of neurogenic and/or vascular TOS, and an age- and sex-matched control group. All patients and control subjects underwent nerve ultrasound of the supraclavicular brachial plexus to look for fibromuscular anomalies / compression of the brachial plexus in the scalenic region, and vascular ultrasound of the infraclavicular subclavian artery with the arm in neutral and abducted position, serving as an indicator for costoclavicular compression of the neurovascular bundle. Based on clinical symptoms, neurogenic TOS (81%) was the most frequent type of TOS, followed by combined neurogenic and arterial TOS (8%). The frequency of abnormal nerve and/or vascular ultrasound findings differed significantly from the control group (P<0.00001). The pooled sensitivity was 48% for nerve ultrasound, 85% for vascular ultrasound, and 94% when combined. Among the findings, the fibromuscular 'wedge-sickle sign', indicating compression of the lower trunk in the scalenic region by a congenital fibromuscular anomaly (e.g. Roos ligaments), showed the highest specificity (100%). A bony 'wedge-sickle sign' was also delineated, where lower trunk compression is caused by the neck of the 1st rib. As implied by the higher sensitivity of vascular ultrasound, the most common site of compression was the costoclavicular space, but multilevel compression was also frequently observed. In summary, combined nerve and vascular ultrasound is a sensitive and reliable method to support the diagnosis of TOS. It can also identify the site(s) of compression, with obvious therapeutic consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4281572089,"Objectives Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement is a safe and effective palliative treatment for malignant gastric outlet obstruction; however, the clinical outcomes of gastric and duodenal stenoses may differ. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of SEMS placement and the predictors of clinical outcomes, specifically in malignant duodenal obstruction (MDO). Methods Between September 2009 and March 2021, 79 patients with MDO who received SEMS placement in our hospital were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups according to the obstruction levels: above-papilla group (type 1), papilla involved group (type 2), and below-papilla group (type 3). The clinical outcomes and predictors of survival and restenosis were analyzed. Results The technical and clinical success rates were 97.5% and 80.5%, respectively. Among patients who had successful stent placement, stent restenosis occurred in 17 patients (22.1%). The overall median stent patency time was 103 days. The overall median survival time after stent placement was 116 days. There was no difference in the stent patency, or stent dysfunction and procedure-related adverse events among the three groups. A longer length of duodenal stenosis ≥ 4 cm was associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–3.49, p = 0.032) and post-stent chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.17–0.63, p = 0.001). Conclusion SEMS is a safe and effective treatment for MDO. Chemotherapy after SEMS implantation improve the survival for these patients and a longer length of stenosis predicts higher mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4281553702,"The purpose of this study was to examine how intramuscular adipose tissue (IntraMAT) can be characterized using physical and functional characteristics, muscle size, and/or adipose tissue in four different exercise frequency groups of middle-aged Japanese men. One thousand twenty-eight middle-aged men (age, 47.5 ± 8.1 years; height, 170.5 ± 5.8 cm; body mass, 67.0 ± 9.3 kg; body mass index, 21.9 ± 5.3 kg/m2) were allocated to four groups on the basis of their weekly exercise frequency: Group 1, no exercise, n = 334; Group 2, once a week, n = 271; Group 3, a few days a week, n = 269; and Group 4, every day, n = 154. Their body composition, blood pressure, and handgrip strength were assessed. A single-slice computerized tomography image at the level of the umbilicus was acquired and the CSAs of IntraMAT, muscle tissue, and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues (SCAT and VAT) were calculated. The %IntraMAT significantly correlated with physical characteristics, such as age, BMI, abdominal circumference, and muscle tissue CSA. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed, with the %IntraMAT as the dependent variable. Muscle tissue CSA and abdominal circumference were the common independent variables across groups to explain the variability of the %IntraMAT. It was also extracted %body fat and age for Group 2, age, handgrip strength, and BMI for Group 3, and smoking category for Group 4. These results suggested that muscle tissue size and abdominal circumference would be the strong predictors to explain %IntraMAT of the trunk muscle across four groups, and that age, %body fat, BMI, and SCAT, handgrip strength and smoking category were also good predictors for each group with different exercise frequency in middle-aged Japanese men."
https://openalex.org/W4281557529,"Oral health is increasingly seen as a public health challenge due to the remarkable prevalence of oral diseases worldwide, the impact on general health, and health consequences that can arise for individuals. Compared to other health services, oral health services are usually not fully covered by statutory health insurance, which is seen as one reason in decision-making on dental treatments. Nevertheless, patients' reasons for treatment decisions are not well understood although they can provide valuable insights. The objective of this study was to identify reasons of choice for dental treatments and to explore patients' view on cost coverage in Germany. We conducted four focus group interviews with a total of 27 participants. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data was analyzed performing conventional content analysis. As part of a qualitative analysis, subcategories and categories were formed from identified reasons using an inductive approach. Our study supports and expands research in exploring patients' decision-making on dental treatments. It highlights a variety of 53 reasons of choice for dental treatments from patients' perspective, split in two categories ""health care service"", and ""dentist & dental office"". First category includes reasons regarding dental care performance (subcategories: ""preconditions"", ""treatment"", ""costs"", and ""outcomes""). Second category demonstrates reasons regarding dentists, office structures and processes (subcategories: ""professional skills"", ""social skills"", ""office staff & equipment"", and ""office processes""). Reasons named ""most important"" by the participants are out-of-pocket payments, dentists' training, and a relationship of trust between patient and dentist. Although the participants use incentive measures to lower financial burden, several perceived challenges exist. Identified reasons for choosing dental treatments provide a basis for further studies to quantify the relevance of these reasons from patients' perspective. Based on this, the various reasons identified can be considered in future policies to improve patients' utilization behavior, which can range from improved information sources to increased incentive measures."

The study was aimed to identify and document ethnoveterinary medicinal plant species and traditional medicinal knowledge of the traditional health practitioners. A total of 105 informants were selected purposely and volunteer sampling approaches, and from these total informants, 15 key informants were identified based on their knowledge difference. Semi-structured interviews, field observation, and discussion were employed to collect information. Descriptive statistical method was employed to analyze the collected data. Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) values were calculated to determine the most common livestock ailment categories that occurred and identify potentially effective medicinal plant species in respective disease categories. T-test was applied to compare knowledge difference. The result showed that a higher average (p< 0.05) was recorded for key informants, illiterate and elder group; however, there is no significance difference (p = 0.53) between gender. A total of 33 ethnoveterinary medicinal plant species, which belong to 23 families and 31 genera were identified. Family Asteraceae and family Solanaceae were the dominant. From this total number of plant species (12.12%) were endemic for Ethiopia. The finding showed that shrubs accounted for 39.39% followed by herbs (36.36%) and trees (15.15%). The medicinal plant parts that were most commonly utilized were leaf (55.36%) followed by root (23.21%) and seed (8.93%) respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4281568990,"Introduction Caesarean sections (CS) feature prominently in obstetric care and have impacted positively on maternal / neonatal outcomes globally including Ghana. However, in spite of documented increasing CS rates in the country, there are no studies assessing the adequacy of post-CS pain control. This study assessed the adequacy of post-CS pain management as well as factors influencing this outcome. Additionally, post-CS analgesia prescription and serving habits of doctors and nurses were also described to help fill existing knowledge gaps. Methods Pain scores of 400 randomly selected and consenting post-CS women at a tertiary facility in Ghana were assessed at 6–12 hours post-CS at rest and with movement and at 24–36 hours post-CS with movement using a validated visual analog scale (VAS) from February 1, 2015 to April 8, 2015. Participant characteristics including age, marital status and duration of CS were obtained using pretested questionnaires and patient records review. Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies and proportions. Associations between background characteristics and the outcome variables of adequacy of pain control at 6–12 hours post-CS at rest and with movement and at 24–36 hours post-CS with movement were analysed using Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests and logistic regression methods. Adequate pain control was defined as VAS scores ≤5. Results At 6–12 hours post-CS (at rest), equal proportions of participants had adequate and inadequate pain control (50.1% vrs 49.9%). Over the same time period but with movement, pain control was deemed inadequate in 93% of respondents (369/396). Women who had one previous surgery [OR 0.47 95%CI 0.27, 0.82; p = 0.008] and those whose CS lasted longer than 45 mins [OR 0.39 95% CI 0.24, 0.62; p&lt;0.001] had lower odds of reporting adequate pain control. Women prescribed 12-hourly and 8-hourly doses of pethidine had only 23.5% (12/51) and 10.3% (3/29) served as prescribed respectively. At 24–36 hours post CS, adequate pain control was reported by 85.3% (326/382) of participants. Conclusions Pain management was deemed inadequate within the first 12 hours post-CS with potential implications for early mother-child interaction. Appreciable numbers of participants did not have their analgesics served as prescribed. Adjunct pain control measures should be explored and healthcare workers must be encouraged to pay more attention to patients’ pain relief needs."
https://openalex.org/W4281570773,"The Zygothrica genus group has been shown to be speciose, with a high number of cryptic species. DNA barcoding approaches have been a valuable tool to uncover cryptic diversity in this lineage, as recently suggested for the Neotropical Mycodrosophila projectans complex, which seems to comprise at least three different species. The aim of this study was to confirm the subdivision of the M . projectans complex while shedding some light on the patterns and processes related to its diversification. In this sense, the use of single and multi-locus datasets under phylogenetic, distance, coalescence, and diagnostic nucleotide approaches confirmed the presence of at least three species under the general morphotype previously described as M . projectans . Only a few subtle morphological differences were found for the three species in terms of aedeagus morphology and abdominal color patterns. Ecologically, sympatry and syntopy seem to be recurrent for these three cryptic species, which present widely overlapping niches, implying niche conservatism. This morphological and ecological similarity has persisted though cladogenesis within the complex, which dates back to the Miocene, providing an interesting example of morphological conservation despite ancient divergence. These results, in addition to contrasting patterns of past demographic fluctuations, allowed us to hypothesize patterns of allopatric or parapatric diversification with secondary contact in Southern Brazil. Nevertheless, genetic diversity was generally high within species, suggesting that migration may encompass an adaptive response to the restrictions imposed by the ephemerality of resources."

https://openalex.org/W4281550510,"Children are skilled reasoners who readily use causal, reliability, and base-rate (i.e., prior probability) information in their decisions. Though these abilities are typically studied in isolation, children often must consider multiple pieces of information to make an informed decision. Four experiments (N = 320) explored the development of children's ability to use reliability and base-rate information when making decisions about draw outcomes. Experiment 1 examined the age at which children can first compare and choose between probabilistically reliable machines. Three- and 4-year-old children saw machines that were probabilistically reliable at obtaining objects while sampling from uniform distributions (i.e., all target or non-target objects). Although 4-year-old children correctly used reliability in their decisions, 3-year-olds did not. In Experiment 2a, 4- to 6-year-olds were presented with the same probabilistically reliable machines, although they sampled from a mixture of target and non-target items. Here, children tended to choose the machine with the better proportion of targets, regardless of reliability. This was replicated in Experiment 2b. In Experiment 3, children were presented with one perfectly reliable machine and one probabilistically unreliable machine. Here, children continued to mostly choose the machine with the better proportion of targets. These results raise questions about base-rate overuse early in development and highlight the need for additional work on children's ability to use multiple pieces of information in decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4281551990,"The decision process of different remanufacturing schemes in an electronic control system has great fuzziness and uncertainty. Therefore, it is essential to use an appropriate method to show the characteristics of different schemes and support the users' decision. Based on the concepts of the artificial neural network theory and the improved comprehensive evaluation method, the decision-making system of the electronic control remanufacturing scheme was constructed in the present study. In the first step, a classification method of parts is proposed from the perspective of manufacturing enterprises. Moreover, an artificial neural network model is used to determine parts of remanufacturing value. Then the pricing strategy is divided according to the users' needs, and then a decision model is constructed. The combined subjective and objective methods are used to solve the compound weight of different equipment, and a set of improved fuzzy comprehensive decision methods is formed. Then the proposed model was applied to an electronic control transformation project as an example to evaluate the performance of different schemes. The evaluation results were consistent with the results of a third-party organization. It was concluded that the proposed scheme can be used as the theoretical basis to choose the best remanufacturing scheme to ensure the efficient operation of each part in an ECS."
https://openalex.org/W4281553326,"Introduction Universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a cornerstone of Eswatini’s national HIV strategy, and the number of people on ART in the country more than tripled between 2010 and 2019. Building on these achievements, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is scaling up differentiated service delivery, including less-intensive differentiated ART (DART) models for people doing well on treatment. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore client and health care worker (HCW) perceptions of DART in Eswatini. Methods The study included structured site assessments at 39 purposively selected health facilities (HF), key informant interviews with 20 HCW, a provider satisfaction survey with 172 HCW and a client satisfaction survey with 270 adults. Results All clients had been on ART for more than a year; 69% were on ART for ≥ 5 years. The most common DART models were Fast-Track (44%), Outreach (26%) and Community ART Groups (20%). HCW and clients appreciated DART, noting that the models often decrease provider workload and client wait time. Clients also reported that DART models helped them to adhere to ART, 96% said they were “very satisfied” with their current model, and 90% said they would recommend their model to others, highlighting convenience, efficiency and cost savings. The majority of HCW (52%) noted that implementation of DART reduced their workload, although some models, such as Outreach, were more labor-intensive. Each model had advantages and disadvantages; for example, clients concerned about stigma and inadvertent disclosure of HIV status were less interested in group models. Conclusions Clients in DART models were very satisfied with their care. HCW were also supportive of the new approach to HIV treatment delivery, noting its advantages to HF, HCW and to clients. Given the heterogeneous needs of people living with HIV, no single DART model will suit every client; a diverse portfolio of DART models is likely the best strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4281553809,"Vitamin E is typically supplied in the form of tocopheryl-acetate (T-Ac) since tocopherol (T) has stability issues. Tocopheryl-acetate, however, must be hydrolyzed in the intestines before it can be absorbed, a step that is purportedly rate-limiting for its bioavailability. The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of absorption of T-Ac and T in broilers. In addition, two test procedures were evaluated in which animals received the test substances for either 2 or 4 days only. Animals were adapted to diets without supplemental vitamin E (feedstuffs contributed 14±1 ppm natural vitamin E (RRR-tocopherol)) till the age of 25 d (individual housing) or 28 d (group housing). Subsequently, they were fed T-Ac at 80, 53, 36, 24, or 16 ppm or T at 80, 40, 20, 10, or 5 ppm for a period of 4 d (4-di) or 2 d (2-dg), after which serum and liver were collected for analysis of vitamin E. Measured feed vitamin E levels were used for the data analysis; the recovery of T-Ac was 85%, and that of T was 39%. Both test procedures (2 or 4 days) yielded good quality data. Based on linear regression analysis, the relative efficiency with which T-Ac raised tissue levels as compared to T was 0.24 (2-dg) to 0.37 (4-di), with liver and serum yielding similar results. Analysis using more complex dose response models imply that the hydrolysis of T-Ac was strongly dose-dependent and that it could be saturated at doses above approximately 50 ppm in animals only briefly fed T-Ac; for T there was no evidence of saturation. These data imply that T, provided that stable forms can be developed, has the potential to be much more efficient at providing vitamin E to the animal, and on top, can yield much higher tissue levels, than T-Ac."
https://openalex.org/W4281554699,"α-L-rhamnosidase catalyzes hydrolysis of the terminal α-L-rhamnose from various natural rhamnoglycosides, including naringin and hesperidin, and has various applications such as debittering of citrus juices in the food industry and flavonoid derhamnosylation in the pharmaceutical industry. However, its activity is lost at high temperatures, limiting its usage. To improve Lactobacillus acidophilus α-L-rhamnosidase stability, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) to identify a highly flexible region, as evaluated by its root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) value, and computational protein design (Rosetta) to increase rigidity and favorable interactions of residues in highly flexible regions. MD results show that five regions have the highest flexibilities and were selected for design by Rosetta. Twenty-one designed mutants with the best ΔΔG at each position and ΔΔG < 0 REU were simulated at high temperature. Eight designed mutants with ΔRMSF of highly flexible regions lower than -10.0% were further simulated at the optimum temperature of the wild type. N88Q, N202V, G207D, Q209M, N211T and Y213K mutants were predicted to be more stable and could maintain their native structures better than the wild type due to increased hydrogen bond interactions of designed residues and their neighboring residues. These designed mutants are promising enzymes with high potential for stability improvement."

In a collectivist setting such as Thailand amplification of relationships may be particularly marked, but may be associated with individual factors, including personal values and perceived control over the virus. Methods A national on-street survey in Thailand (April 2020, N = 1,000), collected data from five regions across the country (response rate 82.6%). Participants reported demographics, anxiety, perceived control, and personal values of security and universalism, and indicated changes, from negative to positive, across four relationship types (relationship partners, family, friendships and neighbourhood). Results While relationship changes were small overall, there was an improvement in close relations (partners, family members) but not amongst friends and neighbours. Respondents who were married without children recorded less enhancement of partnerships, friendships and neighbourhood relations. Those with less perceived control over the infection reported relationship decline, while single people reported fewer positive changes in their partnership or family relations. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated the prioritisation of security was associated with a decline in each of the relationships, while universalism was positively associated with change in the family, in friendships and neighbourly relations. Conclusions Personal values and marital status may impact on relationship functioning during a national health crisis. These issues should be considered by clinicians and health practitioners when trying to assist those struggling with interpersonal relations during a pandemic."

We aimed to investigate the life impact on family caregivers of PMV patients opting for a payment program and compared different care units.A total of 610 questionnaires were recalled. Statistical analyses were conducted by using the chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression model.The results indicated no associations between caregivers' stress levels and opting for a payment program. Participants in the non-IPP group spent less time with friends and family owing to caregiver responsibilities. The results of the family domain show that the RHC group (OR = 2.54) had worsened family relationships compared with the ICU group; however, there was less psychological stress in the RCC (OR = 0.54) and RCW (OR = 0.16) groups than in the ICU group. In the social domain, RHC interviewees experienced reduced friend and family interactivity (OR = 2.18) and community or religious activities (OR = 2.06) than the ICU group. The RCW group felt that leisure and work time had less effect (OR = 0.37 and 0.41) than the ICU group. Furthermore, RCW interviewees (OR = 0.43) were less influenced by the reduced family income than the ICU group in the economic domain.RHC family caregivers had the highest level of stress, whereas family caregivers in the RCW group had the lowest level of stress."

At this time, it will affect the overall distribution of the urban road network. Therefore, in order to ensure the normal operation of the city, evaluate the objective regularities of impact is of great significance and urgency to emergency decision-makers. The extent and scope of road damaged in the disaster-stricken area varies with time due to the impact of natural calamities. To reveal the regularities impact, this paper provides a two-stage analysis method based on the distribution path of the road network, offering basic data analysis and nonlinear fitting regression analysis on distribution costs, spatial accessibility and distribution efficiency. This study uses the degree of road network damage and the double randomness of road damaged to establish a transportation model for dynamic simulation analysis. The research results show that the delivery regularity of costs, spatial accessibility, and efficiency present the s-curve changes obviously. There are obvious inflection points when the damaged road percentage reaches about 10%-15% and 30%-40%. Therefore, the most suitable delivery route and time can be selected to maximize efficiency and reduce losses."

We contrast treatment of fictitious Black and White job applicants in the labor market for service-related job openings, specifically applicants with prior experience as a police officer, firefighter, or code enforcement officer. Results reveal that the White advantage in employer call-backs and requests for an interview receded during the protests and unrest following the killing of George Floyd, even to the point of producing a Black advantage."
