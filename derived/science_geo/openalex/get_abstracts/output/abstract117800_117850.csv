https://openalex.org/W1510592624,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is comprised of key regulatory proteins that control the cellular response to both proliferation and stress signals. In this study we investigated the factors controlling MAPK activation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and explored the impact of altering the pathways to kinase activation on cell survival following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Potent activation (10-20-fold) of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK2) occurred within 10 min of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, whereupon rapid inactivation ensued. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activated ERK2 in several cell types and also moderately activated (3-5-fold) both c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38/RK/CSBP. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the mRNA expression of MAPK-dependent genes c-<i>jun</i>, c-<i>fos</i>, and MAPK phosphatase-1. Suramin pretreatment completely inhibited H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stimulation of ERK2, highlighting a role for growth factor receptors in this activation. Further, ERK2 activation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was blocked by pretreatment with either <i>N</i>-acetyl-cysteine, <i>o</i>-phenanthroline, or mannitol, indicating that metal-catalyzed free radical formation mediates the initiation of signal transduction by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated activation of ERK2 was abolished in PC12 cells by inducible or constitutive expression of the dominant negative Ras-N-17 allele. Interestingly, PC12/Ras-N-17 cells were more sensitive than wild-type PC12 cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> toxicity. Moreover, NIH 3T3 cells expressing constitutively active MAPK kinase (MEK, the immediate upstream regulator of ERK) were more resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> toxicity, while those expressing kinase-defective MEK were more sensitive, than cells expressing wild-type MEK. Taken together, these studies provide insight into mechanisms of MAPK regulation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and suggest that ERK plays a critical role in cell survival following oxidant injury."

https://openalex.org/W2088481957,"MKP-1 (also known as CL100, 3CH134, Erp, and hVH-1) exemplifies a class of dual-specificity phosphatase able to reverse the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine and threonine residues. We now report the cloning of MKP-3, a novel protein phosphatase that also suppresses MAP kinase activation state. The deduced amino acid sequence of MKP-3 is 36% identical to MKP-1 and contains the characteristic extended active-site sequence motif VXVHCXXGXSRSXTXXXAYLM (where X is any amino acid) as well as two N-terminal CH2 domains displaying homology to the cell cycle regulator Cdc25 phosphatase. When expressed in COS-7 cells, MKP-3 blocks both the phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of ERK2 by mitogens. Northern analysis reveals a single mRNA species of 2.7 kilobases with an expression pattern distinct from other dual-specificity phosphatases. MKP-3 is expressed in lung, heart, brain, and kidney, but not significantly in skeletal muscle or testis. In situ hybridization studies of MKP-3 in brain reveal enrichment within the CA1, CA3, and CA4 layers of the hippocampus. Metrazole-stimulated seizure activity triggers rapid ("

Northern blot analysis of RNA from multiple rat and mouse tissues demonstrated high levels of expression of two distinct transcripts of approximately 2.0 and 1.6 kilobase pairs that were expressed only in teeth. In situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe showed that the tissue distribution of ameloblastin was limited to the ameloblast in rat incisors. Immunohistochemical staining of rat incisors using a polyclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein revealed a unique localization pattern. Ameloblastin was found to be expressed during the differentiation of inner enamel epithelium into ameloblasts, with intense localization in the Tomes' processes of secretory ameloblasts. In contrast to amelogenin, only modest amounts of ameloblastin were detected in enamel matrix. The ameloblastin gene encodes an open reading frame of 422 amino acids corresponding to a putative protein of 45 kDa. The predicted protein is acidic (pI = 5.54) and the most abundant amino acids are Pro (15.2%), Gly (9.9%), and Leu (9.9%). We have also mapped the ameloblastin gene, Ambn, to a locus on mouse chromosome 5 near other genes associated with mineralized tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2088195645,"Nitric oxide (NO)-related activity has been associated with an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent modification of the glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). However, the mechanism by which NO effects covalent attachment of nucleotide and its role in regulation of enzyme activity are controversial. Recent studies have shown that <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of GAPDH (Cys<sup>149</sup>) initiates subsequent modification by the pyridinium cofactor. Here we show that NADH rather than NAD<sup>+</sup> is the preferred substrate. Transnitrosation from active site <i>S</i>-nitrosothiol to the reduced nicotinamide ring system appears to facilitate protein thiolate attack on the enzyme-bound cofactor. This results in attachment of the intact NADH molecule. Moreover, we find that <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of GAPDH is responsible for reversible enzyme inhibition, whereas attachment of NADH accounts for irreversible enzyme inactivation. <i>S</i>-Nitrosylation may serve to protect GAPDH from oxidant inactivation in settings of cytokine overproduction and to regulate glycolysis. NADH attachment is more likely to be a pathophysiological event associated with inhibition of gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2044835236,"Stimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors enhances the enzymatic activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs have been classified in three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), stress-activated protein kinases or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (SAPKs/JNKs), and p38 kinase. Whereas the pathway linking cell surface receptors to ERKs has been partially elucidated, the mechanism of activation of JNKs is still poorly understood. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors can effectively induce JNK in NIH 3T3 cells (Coso, O. A., Chiariello, M., Kalinec, G., Kyriakis, J. M., Woodgett, J., and Gutkind, J. S.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5620-5624). In the present study, we have used the transient expression in COS-7 cells of m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) as a model system to study the signaling pathway linking G protein-coupled receptors to JNK. We show that stimulation of either muscarinic receptor subtype leads to JNK activation; however, this effect was not mimicked by expression of activated forms of αs, αi2, αq, or α13 G protein α subunits. In contrast, overexpression of Gβγ subunits potently induced JNK activity. Furthermore, we show that signaling from m1 and m2 mAChRs to JNK involves βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, acting on a Ras and Rac1-dependent pathway.

INTRODUCTIONStimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors causes a rapid elevation of the enzymatic activity of a family of closely related serine-threonine kinases, known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)( 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNK (or SAPK)c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (or stress-activated protein kinase).) (2Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The function of MAPKs is to convert extracellular stimuli to intracellular signals which, in turn, control the expression of genes that are essential for many cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation(3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). MAPKs have been classified in three subfamilies: extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), including ERK1 and ERK2, also known as p44mapk and p42mapk, respectively; stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also termed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs); and p38 kinase(2Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). ERKs phosphorylate and regulate the activity of certain enzymes, including phospholipase A2 and p90rsk, and nuclear proteins, such as the ternary complex factor p62TCF or Elk-1(4Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter represents a critical event in controlling the expression of several genes, including c-fos(5Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). JNKs phosphorylate the amino-terminal transactivating domain of c-Jun and ATF2(6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), thereby increasing their transcriptional activity. p38 is the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 gene, and its function is still unknown, although recently available information suggests that p38 might play a critical role in the inflammatory response(7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. Mc Donnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of activation of JNKs is still poorly understood. JNKs were shown to be activated by a variety of stimuli distinct from those that elevate the enzymatic activity of ERKs, including protein synthesis inhibitors, heat shock, changes in osmolarity, and ultraviolet irradiation(6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 8Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). JNKs can be also activated by agents acting on cell surface receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, or epidermal growth factor (8Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Furthermore, available evidence suggest that whereas Ras controls the activation of ERKs, members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42, regulate the activity of JNKs(9Coso O.A.

In the present study, we have used the transient expression in COS-7 cells of m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) as a model system to study the biochemical route connecting G protein-coupled receptors to an epitope-tagged JNK. We present evidence that signaling from m1 and m2 mAChRs to JNK involves βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, acting on a Ras- and Rac1-dependent pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and TransfectionCOS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum.

In each case, a critical glutamine residue in the G3 region of Gαs (codon 227), Gαi2 (codon 205), Gαq (codon 209), and Gα13 (codon 226) was replaced for leucine (QL mutants)(10Crespo P. Xu N.

An expression plasmid for a chimeric molecule between the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD8 fused to the COOH-terminal domain of βARK (pcDNA-CD8-βARK) has been described recently(11Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). The products of the kinase reactions were fractionated in SDS-12% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and radioactivity incorporated into GST-ATF2(96) was determined with the use of a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). Parallel immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.) using goat anti-mouse serum coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Cappel).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn order to study the mechanism controlling the activation of JNK by m1 and m2 G protein-coupled receptors, we coexpressed these receptors together with an epitope-tagged JNK (HA-JNK) in COS-7 cells. We observed that when cotransfected with the HA-JNK cDNA, both m1 and m2 were expressed at similar high levels (data not shown), and the epitope-tagged JNK was efficiently expressed and readily detectable upon immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody(9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). In cells expressing either muscarinic receptor, the cholinergic agonist carbachol induced an increase in JNK activity, as judged by its in vitro phosphorylating activity using GST-ATF2(96) as a substrate (Fig. 1). Whether mediated by m1 or m2 receptors, induction of GST-ATF2(96) phosphorylation showed a peak at approximately 15 min after stimulation, being of 2-4-fold higher than the control with a slow decrease at later times (Fig. 1). Thus, JNK is activated by either m1 or m2 G protein-coupled receptors when expressed in COS-7 cells. Whereas m1 receptors are typical of those coupled through G proteins of the Gq family to phospholipase C activation, m2 is known to couple through Gi to a number of effector pathways, including to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclases (12.Ashkenazi, A., Peralta, E. G., Winslow, J. W., Ramachandran, J., Capon, D. J. (1989) Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. (suppl.) 16-22Google Scholar). Interestingly, both m1 and m2 mAChRs appear to activate JNK irrespective of their G protein-coupling specificity.As an approach to investigate which G proteins mediate the activation of JNK, we took advantage of the observation that the expression of GTPase-deficient, mutationally activated forms of G protein α subunits can activate effector pathways by obviating the need for receptor stimulation(13Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Thus, we coexpressed the epitope-tagged JNK together with GTPase-deficient mutants for Gαs, Gαi2, Gαq, and Gα13, which are representative members for each of the four Gα subunit families (14Neer E. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Expression of each G protein α subunit, when transfected into COS-7 cells, could be demonstrated by immunoblotting with subtype-specific antibodies (data not shown; (11Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and (12.Ashkenazi, A., Peralta, E. G., Winslow, J. W., Ramachandran, J., Capon, D. J. (1989) Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. (suppl.) 16-22Google Scholar)). However, these activated mutants enhanced JNK activity only to a very limited extent, either when each Gα subunit was expressed alone (Fig. 2) (15Prasad M.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or in all possible combinations (data not shown). Thus, α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins might not mediate JNK activation by G protein-coupled receptors.Figure 2:Overexpression of βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins results in stimulation of JNK activity. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-JNK (1 μg/plate) together with pcDNA3 vector (control) or with an expression vector carrying cDNAs for the activated (QL) forms of the α subunits of Gs, Gi2, Gq, and G13, or expressing β1, γ2, or γ2∗ G protein subunits, alone or in combination, as indicated (2 μg/plate in each case). Kinase reactions and Western blot (WB) analysis were performed in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from the corresponding lysates, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Autoradiograms correspond to representative experiments.32P-Labeled products as well as specific bands detected by the anti-HA antibody are indicated with an arrow. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four to five independent experiments, expressed as -fold increase with respect to vector-transfected cells (control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When activated, receptors linked to G proteins catalyze the replacement of GDP by GTP-bound to the α subunit and induce the dissociation of α-GTP from βγ dimers. Although the α subunits were thought to be solely responsible for coupling receptors to second-messenger-generating systems, recent work has established a critical role for βγ dimers in signal transduction(10Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 14Neer E. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of mutationally activated G protein α subunits to elevate JNK activity prompted us to explore whether βγ dimers participate in signaling to JNK. We observed that, when cotransfected, β1γ2 subunits induce a remarkable increase in the phosphorylating activity of the epitope-tagged JNK, although expression of the HA-JNK was similar for each transfected cell population (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when β2γ2 subunits were expressed (data not shown). In contrast, JNK was poorly activated when coexpressed with β1 or γ2 alone or when cotransfected with β1 and an altered form of the γ2 subunit, designated γ2∗, that lacks an isoprenylation signal and fails to associate to the plasma membrane (10Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We conclude that membrane-bound βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, but not Gα subunits, can effectively stimulate JNK activity in COS-7 cells.We next explored a role for βγ complexes in JNK stimulation by mAChRs. To approach this question, we employed a chimeric molecule combining the extracellular and transmembrane domain of CD8 fused to the carboxyl-terminal domain of βARK, which includes the βγ-binding region(11Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This chimeric molecule expresses the CD8 antigen at the cell surface, localizing the βARK carboxyl-terminal domain to the inner face of the plasma membrane. The CD8-βARK chimera is expected to bind and sequester free βγ complexes when dissociated from Gα subunits upon receptor stimulation, thus blocking βγ-dependent pathways(11Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, coexpression of CD8-βARK with the m1 or m2 mAChRs nearly abolished the activation of JNK in response to carbachol, while CD8 alone had no demonstrable effect. In contrast, JNK activation by stress-inducing agents such as anisomycin (9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar) was unaffected by CD8-βARK, demonstrating the specificity of this approach (Fig. 3). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that signaling from m1 and m2 mAChRs to JNK is mediated by βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins.Figure 3:Effect of a βγ scavenging protein in JNK activation. pcDNA3-HA-JNK was cotransfected with expression plasmids for m1 or m2 mAChRs (1 μg/plate), and β1 and γ2 subunits (2 μg per plate), together with vector alone (vector) or plasmids expressing the CD8 receptor or a chimeric molecule CD8-βARK, as indicated. Cells were stimulated with carbachol (10 μM) or anisomycin (10 μg/ml) for 15 min or left untreated. Quantitation of JNK activity present in anti-HA immunoprecipitates was performed as in Fig. 1. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, expressed as -fold increase with respect to unstimulated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have recently shown that the Rho-related small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 are integral components of signaling pathways linking certain cell surface receptors to JNK(9Coso O.A.

Thus, we set out to investigate whether these small GTPases mediate JNK activation by G protein-coupled receptors, using as a tool the expression of dominant-negative mutants for Ras, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. None of these dominant-inhibitory small GTP-binding proteins affected the JNK activation in response to anisomycin (Fig. 4). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4, coexpression of N17Ras and N17Rac1 prevented JNK activation by either mAChRs, or when induced by βγ complexes, N17Cdc42 diminished JNK stimulation by m1 mAChRs, and the dominant-negative form of RhoA did not display any significant effect. Similarly, we have recently shown that JNK activation by EGF in COS-7 cells is also blocked by N17Ras, N17Rac1, and N17Cdc42(9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings support a role for Ras and Rac1 or Cdc42 in linking both tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors to the JNK pathway.Figure 4:Effect of dominant-negative mutants for Ras, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 on JNK activation. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-JNK and expression plasmids for m1 and m2 receptors (1 μg/plate) or for β1 and γ2 G protein subunits (2 μg/plate), together with either pcDNA3 (vector) without insert or carrying cDNAs for N17Ras, N19RhoA, N17Rac1, or N17Cdc42 (1 μg/plate), and cells were left untreated or stimulated with carbachol (10 μM) or anisomycin (10 μg/ml) for 15 min, as indicated. Cell lysates were processed as in Fig. 1. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four to five independent experiments, expressed as percent of activation with respect to the corresponding vector cotransfected control (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although Ras controls the activity of ERKs, recent available evidence suggests that Rac1 and/or Cdc42 regulate JNK activation(9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct small GTP-binding proteins appear to link cell surface receptors with independent signaling pathways leading to the activation of each member of the MAPK superfamily. In this study, we present evidence supporting a role for βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins in communicating G protein-coupled receptors with the JNK pathway, acting on a Ras- and Rac1-dependent biochemical route. Furthermore, we and others have previously shown that βγ complexes link this class of cell surface receptors to ERKs, in this case acting through Ras(10Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 16van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, taking these findings together we can postulate that βγ heterodimers provide a link between heterotrimeric G proteins and small GTP-binding proteins.The molecular basis for this interaction is still poorly defined(16van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, it is strikingly similar to that of the pathway linking the G protein-coupled pheromone receptors to MAPK-related enzymes in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. In this case, extracellular ligands (α or a factors) activate pheromone receptors which, in turn, induce the dissociation of a heterotrimeric G protein into α (GPA1) and βγ (Ste4, Ste18) subunits (see (17Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Inouye C.J. Thorner J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 363-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) for review). Free βγ dimers then activate a serine-threonine kinase (Ste20), initiating activity from a linear cascade of kinases, including sequentially Ste11, Ste7, and the yeast MAPK homologues Fus3 and Kss1. Extensive search for molecules linking yeast βγ complexes to Ste20 has led to the recent discovery that Cdc42 participates in Ste20 activation(18Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and that Ste4 might directly bind and activate Cdc24, a nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42(19Zhao Z. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Available data suggest that additional proteins might also be involved, including a protein designated Ste5, which plays a role as a platform or scaffold recruiting Ste11, Ste7, Kss1/Fus3(20Whiteway M.S. Wu C. Leeuv T. Clark K. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Science. 1995; 269: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and another small GTP-binding protein, the Ras homologue Rsr1(21Zheng Y. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 626-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The latter also appears to play an important role by binding Cdc24 and, probably, by positioning this guanine nucleotide exchange factor within the cell, thus allowing its interaction with Cdc42 and its targets(21Zheng Y. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 626-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These observations represent an interesting example of convergence between Ras-like (Rsr1) and Rho-like (Cdc42) biochemical routes and might also provide a clue regarding the pathway connecting mammalian βγ to JNK. Based upon these observations in yeast and our present findings, we can hypothesize that upon receptor stimulation βγ dimers might recruit a yet to be identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and/or Cdc42 and that Ras functioning may be necessary for the effective activation of these GTP-binding proteins and the consequent stimulation of JNK. We conclude that our present study might represent a biologically relevant example of a signal transduction pathway extraordinarily conserved from yeast to mammals and might provide an attractive model to elucidate the nature of those molecules linking heterotrimeric G proteins to small GTP-binding proteins. INTRODUCTIONStimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors causes a rapid elevation of the enzymatic activity of a family of closely related serine-threonine kinases, known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)( 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNK (or SAPK)c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (or stress-activated protein kinase).) (2Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The function of MAPKs is to convert extracellular stimuli to intracellular signals which, in turn, control the expression of genes that are essential for many cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation(3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). MAPKs have been classified in three subfamilies: extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), including ERK1 and ERK2, also known as p44mapk and p42mapk, respectively; stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also termed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs); and p38 kinase(2Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). ERKs phosphorylate and regulate the activity of certain enzymes, including phospholipase A2 and p90rsk, and nuclear proteins, such as the ternary complex factor p62TCF or Elk-1(4Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter represents a critical event in controlling the expression of several genes, including c-fos(5Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). JNKs phosphorylate the amino-terminal transactivating domain of c-Jun and ATF2(6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), thereby increasing their transcriptional activity. p38 is the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 gene, and its function is still unknown, although recently available information suggests that p38 might play a critical role in the inflammatory response(7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. Mc Donnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar).Recent findings have helped to unveil the pathway linking cell surface receptors to ERKs(3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of activation of JNKs is still poorly understood. JNKs were shown to be activated by a variety of stimuli distinct from those that elevate the enzymatic activity of ERKs, including protein synthesis inhibitors, heat shock, changes in osmolarity, and ultraviolet irradiation(6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 8Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). JNKs can be also activated by agents acting on cell surface receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, or epidermal growth factor (8Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Furthermore, available evidence suggest that whereas Ras controls the activation of ERKs, members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42, regulate the activity of JNKs(9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar).Recently, we have shown that stimulation of certain G protein-coupled receptors expressed in NIH 3T3 cells can effectively induce JNK activity, however, following a time course clearly distinct from that of ERK activation(1Coso O.A.

In the present study, we have used the transient expression in COS-7 cells of m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) as a model system to study the biochemical route connecting G protein-coupled receptors to an epitope-tagged JNK. We present evidence that signaling from m1 and m2 mAChRs to JNK involves βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, acting on a Ras- and Rac1-dependent pathway."

Here, we report purification of the latter factor, its identification as the α isoform of protein kinase C (PKCα), and characterization of its regulation of PLD activity.Stimulation of PLD by purified PKCα or recombinant PKCα (rPKCα) occurred in the absence of any nucleotide and required activators such as Ca2+ or phorbol ester. This action was synergistic with stimulation of PLD evoked by either Arf or RhoA. Dephosphorylation of rPKCα with protein phosphatase 1 or 2A resulted in a loss of its kinase activity, but had little effect on its ability to stimulate PLD either alone or in conjunction with Arf. Staurosporine inhibited the kinase activity of PKCα without affecting activation of PLD. Finally, gel filtration of PKCα that had been cleaved with trypsin demonstrated that stimulatory activity for PLD coeluted with the regulatory domain of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2099700886,"Alzheimer's disease amyloid consists of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) derived from the larger precursor amyloid precursor protein (APP). Non-amyloidogenic APP processing involves regulated cleavage within the Aβ domain followed by secretion of the ectodomain (APPs). APPs secretion can be stimulated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors coupled to phospholipases and kinases. To determine whether other receptor classes can regulate APP processing, we examined the relation between serotonin receptors and APPs secretion. Serotonin increased APPs release 3-4-fold in 3T3 cells stably overexpressing 5-HT2aR or 5-HT2cR. The increase was dose-dependent and was blocked by serotoninergic antagonists. Phorbol esters also increased APPs secretion, but neither kinase inhibitors nor down-regulation of PKC blocked the serotonin-induced increase in APPs secretion. Thus PKC is not necessary to stimulate APPs secretion. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors blocked the 5-HT2aR-mediated increase in APPs secretion, suggesting a role of PLA2 in coupling 5-HT2aR to APP processing. In contrast, coupling of 5-HT2cR to APPs secretion involved both PKC and PLA2. Serotonin also stimulated the release of the APLP2 ectodomain, suggesting that additional members of the APP multigene family are processed via similar regulated pathways. Inasmuch as generation of APPs precludes the formation of amyloidogenic derivatives, serotonin receptors provide a novel pharmacological target to reduce these derivatives in Alzheimer's disease.

Inasmuch as generation of APPs precludes the formation of amyloidogenic derivatives, serotonin receptors provide a novel pharmacological target to reduce these derivatives in Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: APPamyloid precursor proteinAPPssecreted APP ectodomainPKCprotein kinase CDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPIphosphatidylinositolPMAphorbol myristate acetatePLA2phospholipase A2.) is an ubiquitous membrane-spanning glycoprotein (Kang et al., 1987; Weidemann et al., 1989) that is present at high levels in brain cells. It is the biological precursor of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), the principal proteinaceous component of amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (for review, see Selkoe(1994)). APP or its derivatives may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease because several familial forms of the disease are linked to APP mutations within or close to the β-amyloid domain. In cell culture, these mutations cause misprocessing of APP and related increases in the formation of Aβ (Cai et al., 1993; Citron et al., 1992, 1994) or the generation of longer than normal Aβ molecules (Suzuki et al., 1994). Moreover, the overexpression of APP in transgenic mice causes formation of brain amyloid plaques (Games et al., 1995) that resemble those in Alzheimer's disease. amyloid precursor protein secreted APP ectodomain protein kinase C Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphatidylinositol phorbol myristate acetate phospholipase A2. APP is a secretory glycoprotein. The secreted APP ectodomain (APPs) has neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities in selected experimental systems. It promotes neurite outgrowth and branching in PC-12 cells (Milward et al., 1992), mediates cell adhesion in cultured fibroblasts (Saitoh et al., 1989), and it can protect primary neuronal cultures from excitotoxic damage (Barger et al., 1995; Mattson et al., 1993). Furthermore, moderate overexpression of human APP in mouse brain can increase synaptic density (Mucke et al. 1994), and it protects neurons in vivo from neurotoxic events caused by overexpression of the HIV-1 surface protein pg120 (Mucke et al., 1995b) or by excitotoxic damage (Mucke et al., 1995a). In selected experimental systems, APPs activates cellular signaling pathways, including p21ras microtubule-associated protein kinases (Greenberg et al., 1994), and cGMP-mediated signaling in primary hippocampal neurons (Barger et al., 1995). Secretory APP processing involves either proteolytic cleavage within the Aβ domain (Esch et al., 1990; Sisodia et al., 1990) or, alternatively, cleavage at both the N and C termini of Aβ followed by rapid secretion of Aβ (Haass et al., 1992; Shoji et al., 1992). Thus, APP can be processed by at least two alternative secretory pathways to yield either APPs and p3, a derivative of the cell-associated C terminus produced by APPs secretion (Haass et al., 1993), or Aβ and a C-terminally truncated form of APPs (Seubert et al., 1993). Secretory APP processing and the formation of APPs can be readily accelerated by an unusual mechanism coupled to a variety of extra- and intracellular signals. These include muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Buxbaum et al., 1992; Nitsch et al., 1992; Wolf et al., 1995), metabotropic glutamate receptors (Lee et al., 1995), protein kinase C (PKC) (Caporaso et al., 1992; Slack et al., 1993), tyrosine kinases (Slack et al., 1995), and arachidonic acid (Emmerling et al., 1993). In rat brain tissue slices, the regulation of APP processing appears to be a function of neuronal activity: APPs secretion is stimulated by electrical depolarization in a frequency-dependent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive fashion (Nitsch et al., 1993), and by muscarinic receptor agonists (Farber et al., 1995). The rate of Aβ formation appears to be inversely coupled to the rate of APPs secretion: in several cell culture systems, stimulated APPs secretion was accompanied by reductions in secreted Aβ (Buxbaum et al., 1993; Gabuzda et al., 1993; Hung et al., 1993; Wolf et al., 1995), suggesting that stimulated secretory processing of APP into secreted APPs is associated with reduced formation of potentially amyloidogenic derivatives. The physiological relevance of regulated APPs secretion is unknown, but may be related to the functions of APPs as a paracrine neurotrophic factor or a signaling molecule that is secreted in an activity-dependent manner in response to neuronal activation by neurotransmitters. In Alzheimer's disease brains, neurotransmission is impaired. In particular, cortical serotoninergic, glutamatergic, and peptidergic systems as well as the subcortical cholinergic projection systems are heavily damaged, indicating deafferentation of multiple cortical and hippocampal target regions. Inasmuch as neuronal activation may be involved in regulating APP processing, impaired neuronal signaling may cause alterations in APP processing pathways (for review, see Nitsch and Growdon(1994)). In the series of experiments reported here, we examined the effects of serotoninergic receptors on APP processing using 3T3 fibroblast lines that stably overexpress 5-HT2a and 5-HT2c receptor subtypes. Wild-type 3T3 cells lack endogenous expression of serotonin receptors, and they provide the necessary cell biological background to assure appropriate signaling functions of transfected receptor subtypes (Julius et al., 1988; Stam et al., 1992). Furthermore, 3T3 cells process APP via regulated cleavage and secretion (Slack et al., 1993). They thus provide a valid model system to study the effects of specific transfected serotonin receptor subtypes on signaling as well as on APPs secretion. Mouse 3T3 fibroblast lines stably overexpressing 5-HT2aR or 5-HT2cR (Julius et al., 1988) were generously provided by David Julius. Transfected lines were maintained in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated dishes and grown to 75% confluence in serum-containing (10% fetal calf serum) DMEM/F-12 medium, in the absence of G418. 24 h before an experiment, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM/F-12. Functional integrity of transfected receptors was assured by measuring receptor-mediated breakdown of metabolically labeled phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Sandmann et al., 1991). Serotonin (Sigma) was prepared freshly before each experiment and was used at 100 pM to 100 μM. The serotonin receptor antagonists ketanserin tartrate (20 μM), mianserin HCl (50 μM), and ritanserin (20 μM) were purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Dexnorfenfluramine was obtained from Servier (Paris, France) and was used at 10 nM to 1 mM. Staurosporine (1 μM), chelerythrine chloride (1 μM), and melittin (2.5-5 μg/ml) were purchased from Calbiochem. Phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma) was used at 1 μM for both stimulation and 24-h down-regulation protocols. Manoalide (3.2-10 μM), 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (20-50 μM), and oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (0.1-1 μM) were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Thapsigargin was purchased from Research Biochemicals International and was used at 20 nM. For PI turnover assays, cells were labeled metabolically overnight with 1.25 μCi/dish of myo-[2-3H]inositol (20.5 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) in inositol-deficient and serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and treated for 10 min with 10 mM lithium chloride. Drugs were added in the presence of 10 mM lithium for 5-60 min at 37°C. To determine the amount of water-soluble inositol phosphates formed, cells were lysed with ice-cold methanol, and lipids were removed by chloroform/methanol/water (2:2:1; v:v) extraction. Water-soluble inositol phosphates were separated from free inositol by ion exchange chromatography, using AG 1-X8 columns (Bio-Rad) and 1 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid as eluent. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium and were incubated at 37°C in the presence or absence of test substances freshly dissolved in DMEM/F-12. After discrete time intervals of 5-60 min, conditioned media were collected, cooled to 4°C, and centrifuged, and supernatant fluids were desalted by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) columns, with water as eluent. Desalted proteins were dried by vacuum centrifugation, reconstituted in water followed by 2 × Laemmli gel loading buffer, and boiled for 3 min. Cell protein was extracted with 2% SDS in Tris-buffered saline and was quantitated by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Equal volumes of reconstituted secretory protein solutions normalized to total cell protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Waters) membranes, and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Carnation) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 80. Membranes were probed with antibodies directed against various domains of APP and APLP2. Specifically, the monoclonal antibody 22C11, as well as the polyclonal antisera R1736, anti-C8 and D2-1 were used. Secondary antibodies were visualized on preflashed x-ray films (Kodak) by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Immunoreactive bands were quantitated by laser scanning densitometry with an LKB ultroscan densitometer set to 40-μm vertical interval size and 2.4-mm horizontal slit width. Areas under the optical density curves were expressed as arbitrary units and normalized to areas generated by immunoreactive proteins secreted under control conditions determined on the same blot. Measurements were performed in the linear range of the ECL reaction as determined from serial dilution curves of secreted proteins. Control and stimulated conditions were always handled in parallel, processed identically, and run in parallel lanes on the same blot. All experiments were done in triplicate dishes and were repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance, using treatments as the independent variable. In 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with cDNA expression constructs encoding either 5-HT2aR or 5-HT2cR, serotonin caused rapid and dose-dependent increases in PI turnover (Fig. 1). Serotonin increased PI turnover to 29-fold (range 7.8-53, n = 4) compared to that observed basally in cells overexpressing 5-HT2aR (Fig. 1A) and to 7.9-fold (range 4.1-9.9, n = 4) basal levels in cells overexpressing 5-HT2cR (Fig. 1B). The EC50 of the inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in response to serotonin was 30 nM in the 5-HT2aR-expressing cells and 2 nM in the 5-HT2cR-expressing cells. Serotonin also caused APPs secretion to increase in both cell lines (Fig. 2). The maximal stimulation of APPs secretion was 4.5-fold (range 2.3-10.8, n = 9) basal levels in cells expressing 5-HT2aR and 3-fold (range 1.6-3.9) in cells expressing 5-HT2cR. The EC50 of 5-HT-mediated APPs secretion was 200 nM in cells expressing 5-HT2aR (Fig. 2A) and 120 nM in the 5-HT2cR-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). Time course analyses showed that the 5-HT-mediated stimulation of APPs secretion was rapid, with significant increases in both cell lines occurring as soon as 5 min following the application of 5-HT (Fig. 2, C and D). The increase in APPs secretion caused by 5-HT2aR stimulation was blocked by the serotoninergic antagonists ketanserin, mianserin, and ritanserin (Fig. 3), and the 5-HT2cR-mediated increase was blocked by mianserin (Fig. 3), indicating that the effects on APP processing in both cell lines were specifically mediated by activation of the overexpressed 5-HT2 receptor subtypes. Direct stimulation of PKC by the phorbol ester PMA mimicked the 5-HT-induced increase in APPs secretion (Fig. 4A and 5A). In both cell lines, however, the kinase inhibitors staurosporine and chelerythrine chloride failed to block the response to 5-HT (Fig. 4A and 5A). Moreover, down-regulation of PKC in these cells by chronic (24 h) pretreatment with PMA also failed to block the ability of 5-HT to stimulate APPs secretion (Fig. 4A and 5A). The PMA response, however, was completely blocked by prior chronic pretreatment with PMA (Fig. 4A and 5A). In 5-HT2aR-expressing cells, the 5-HT-mediated increase in APPs secretion was effectively blocked by the PLA2-inhibitors manoalide (ML), dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA), and oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (OPC) (Fig. 4B), indicating that PLA2 may be also involved in the cellular signaling cascade that couples 5-HT2aR activation to APPs secretion. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that activation of PLA2 by melittin mimicked the 5-HT-mediated increase in APPs secretion (Fig. 4B), while the calcium-releasing agent thapsigargin failed to change APPs secretion from these cells (Fig. 4B). Down-regulation of PKC by prior chronic preincubation with PMA (Fig. 4C) failed to block either the inhibition of APPs secretion by PLA2 inhibitors or its stimulation by melittin, indicating that the signaling mediated by PLA2 is independent of cellular PKC activity. In the 5-HT2cR-expressing cells, the PLA2 inhibitor dimethyleicosadienoic acid only partly blocked 5-HT2cR-induced APPs secretion, and melittin was less effective in stimulating this secretion than in the 5-HT2aR-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). When PKC was down-regulated by prior chronic preincubation with PMA, all PLA2 inhibitors effectively blocked the 5-HT2cR-mediated increase in APPs secretion (Fig. 5C), suggesting that PKC and PLA2 are both involved in coupling of 5-HT2cR activation to APPs secretion. The serotoninergic agonist dexnorfenfluramine (DNF) stimulated PI breakdown in 3T3 cells expressing 5-HT2cR, indicating that it is a potent agonist of these receptors (Fig. 6A). DNF dose-dependently stimulated APPs secretion in the 5-HT2cR expressing cells (Fig. 6B), and this effect was inhibited by the serotonin receptor antagonists ketanserin, mianserin, and ritanserin (Fig. 6C). In related experiments with cells that stably overexpress 5-HT2aR, serotonin also increased PI turnover as well as the secretion of APPs, indicating that DNF is a nonselective agonist of both 5-HT2aR and 5-HT2cR (data not shown). In contrast to the responses of stably transfected cells lines, the untransfected parent cell line failed to exhibit changes in APPs secretion when exposed to serotonin (100 pM to 100 μM).Figure 2:APPs secretion is increased by 5-HT receptor stimulation in 3T3 cells overexpressing 5-HT2aR or 5-HT2cR.

This observation, in combination with the finding that the antiserum anti-C8 raised against the C terminus did not detect any protein in the culture medium (data not shown), suggests that secreted APPs was derived by conventional α-secretase processing. The anti-serum D2-1, raised against full-length APLP2 expressed in a baculovirus system (Slunt et al., 1994), detected a secreted APLP2 derivative of the expected molecular mass in the conditioned culture media from cells overexpressing 5-HT2cR (Fig. 8). Both serotonin and dexnorfenfluramine substantially increased this APLP2s secretion.Figure 8:Western blots of secreted APPs and APLP2s with the specific antisera R1736 and D2-1. APPs, secreted APPs detected by the APP-specific antiserum R1736 directed against the 16 N-terminal residues of the Aβ domain (absent in APLP2).

This finding, coupled with previous observations that stimulating muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes m1 and m3 (Buxbaum et al., 1992; Nitsch et al., 1992; Wolf et al., 1995) or metabotropic glutamate receptors (Lee et al., 1995) can increase APPs secretion, suggests that the regulation of APP processing may be a function of various cell surface receptor types, linked to a number of common second messenger systems. Stimulation of 3T3 cells overexpressing 5-HT2aR or 5-HT2cR caused rapid and dose-dependent increases in phosphatidylinositol breakdown, as indicated by the accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates in the presence of lithium after metabolic labeling of phosphatidylinositol. These results confirm that both receptor subtypes are coupled to PI turnover signaling and assure that the stably transfected cell lines express functionally intact surface receptor proteins. Two additional lines of evidence demonstrated that stimulated APPs secretion was mediated by the activation of serotoninergic cell surface receptors: 5-HT failed to change APPs secretion from the untransfected parent 3T3 fibroblast line, and the increase in APPs secretion from the stably transfected cells was blocked by 5-HT receptor antagonists. In agreement with previous reports (Caporaso et al., 1992; Slack et al., 1993), direct activation of PKC with the phorbol ester PMA increased APPs secretion in the cell lines used in this study. In contrast to our previous observations with 293 cells overexpressing m1 and m3 acetylcholine receptors (Nitsch et al., 1992), however, inhibition of PKC by the kinase inhibitors staurosporine or chelerythrine chloride failed to block 5-HT-mediated increases in APPs secretion from 3T3 fibroblasts. Moreover, down-regulation of PKC by prior chronic pretreatment with PMA also failed to block the 5-HT-induced increase in APPs secretion (Fig. 4A). These data imply that activation of PKC can be sufficient to increase APPs secretion, but that this activation is not necessary for the 5-HT2R-mediated increase. The concentrations of 5-HT necessary to elicit maximal acceleration of PI breakdown, as well as the EC50 of this effect, were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than these for stimulated APPs secretion. This is compatible with the possibility that APP processing is also coupled to other cellular signaling pathways besides PI turnover and PKC activation. To test whether PLA2 is involved in 5-HT-mediated APPs secretion, we examined the ability of drugs that inhibit this enzyme, and we also used melittin, a PLA2-activating peptide. Stimulation of 5-HT2aR-expressing cells with 5-HT in the presence of the PLA2 inhibitors manoalide, dimethyleicosadienoic acid, or oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine failed to affect basal APPs secretion, but all three drugs inhibited 5-HT-induced secretion. These results demonstrate that 5-HT2aR activation can accelerate APPs secretion by coupling to PLA2. A role of PLA2 in the regulation of APPs processing was also suggested by the finding that melittin accelerated APPs secretion. Moreover, this effect was not blocked by down-regulation of PKC by chronic exposure to PMA, and manoalide, dimethyleicosadienoic acid, or oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine blocked 5-HT-induced increases in APPs secretion after down-regulation of PKC. Hence, 5-HT2aR-coupled and PLA2-mediated acceleration of APPs secretion can occur independently of PKC. These data are consistent with the previous observation that PLA2 can partially mediate the increase in APPs secretion induced by muscarinic stimulation (Emmerling et al., 1993). Cellular signaling mechanisms that couple 5-HT2cR to APP processing were more complex than in the cells overexpressing 5-HT2aR. As with 5-HT2aR activation, cells expressing 5-HT2cR responded with increased APPs secretion to 5-HT after down-regulation of PKC, and the kinase inhibitors staurosporine and chelerythrine chloride failed to inhibit this increase. In contrast to the findings in 5-HT2aR cells, however, the PLA2 inhibitors failed to block consistently the 5-HT-mediated increase in APPs secretion in 5-HT2cR cells. The combination of PKC down-regulation and PLA2 inhibition did effectively inhibit the ability of 5-HT to stimulate APPs secretion. It is therefore possible that the coupling of 5-HT2cR to APPs secretion requires both PKC and PLA2 activities. Treatment of the 5-HT2R-expressing cells with thapsigargin, which discharges Ca2+ from internal stores by inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane failed to affect APPs secretion in the 3T3 cells used. Perhaps the previously reported effects of Ca2+ on APPs secretion (Buxbaum et al., 1994) are cell type-specific. APP is a member of the multigene family of APP-like proteins (APLP). APLP2 is homologous to APP in the extreme C-terminal region, and has various homologous regions in the ectodomain (Slunt et al., 1994; von der Kammer et al., 1994; Wasco et al., 1992, 1993). However the Aβ domain is not preserved; thus no amyloidogenic derivatives can be generated from APLP2. Because of its similarities to APP, APLP2 is detected by nonselective antibodies (Slunt et al., 1994), including the monoclonal antibody 22C11 that was raised initially against an APP fusion protein (Weidemann et al., 1989). To differentiate between APPs and APLPs, we used the antiserum R1736 (Haass et al., 1992) directed against the 16 N-terminal residues of the Aβ domain. R1736 detected the same receptor-mediated increase in secreted APPs as 22C11 (Fig. 8). The APLP2-specific antiserum D2-1 (Slunt et al., 1994) detected secreted APLP2 derivatives (APLP2s) with the expected molecular masses in the cell culture supernatants obtained from 3T3 cells overexpressing 5-HT2aR or 5-HT2cR. Stimulation of these cell lines with 5-HT substantially increased APLP2 s secretion (Fig. 8). These data suggest that APP and APLP2 are processed by similar receptor-regulated proteolytic pathways, and they imply the possibility that APLP2 may compete with APP for enzymes involved in signal transduction and proteolytic processing. Levels of APLP2 may thus influence the metabolism of APP. The cellular mechanism of receptor-regulated APPs and APLP2s secretion is unclear. As in previously reported experiments, 5-HT2R-mediated increases in APPs secretion occurred in the absence protein synthesis confirming that pre-existing protein is processed in response to receptor activation. It is possible that secretory vesicle formation, trafficking, or proteolytic cleavage events are accelerated by surface receptor-coupled signaling. The first possibility is underscored by the recent finding that PKC stimulates vesicle budding from the trans-Golgi network and thus accelerates the formation of APP-containing secretory vesicles in a reconstituted cell-free system (Xu et al., 1995). The physiological relevance of regulated APPs secretion is unclear. We speculate that having APP processing under neurotransmitter control may allow neuronal activity to control the formation of a secretory derivative (Farber et al., 1995; Nitsch et al., 1993) with possible paracrine neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities. Regulated cleavage of a membrane precursor followed by secretion of the ectodomain has been described for a variety of transmembrane proteins, including transforming growth factor-α (Bosenberg et al., 1992; Pandiella et al., 1991), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor (Brakebusch et al., 1992), and it was proposed that regulated secretion is involved in switching transforming growth factor-α's activity from that of a juxtacrine to a paracrine growth factor (Pandiella and Massague, 1991). Growth factor-like activities of APPs have been observed in several cell culture models. In particular, a neurotrophin-like stimulation of neurite outgrowth and branching was observed in PC-12 cells (Milward et al., 1992). Conversely, antisense constructs directed against APP transcripts inhibit neurite outgrowth in primary neurons (Allinquant et al., 1995). A biologically active domain that may promote trophic activities of APP in vivo was mapped to the N terminus of APPs (Roch et al., 1994). APPs also protects primary neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxic damage (Mattson et al., 1993), presumably by suppressing potentially toxic increases in intracellular calcium (Barger et al., 1995). Thus, it is possible that secreted APPs has trophic functions in brain that are unrelated to APP's role as an amyloid precursor. Regulated APPs secretion can be mediated by cholinergic (Buxbaum et al., 1992; Nitsch et al., 1992; Wolf et al., 1995) and glutamatergic (Lee et al., 1995) agonists, and electrical activity of brain cells activated APPs secretion from freshly prepared tissue slices. Hence, receptor-coupled APP processing may normally occur throughout the brain at muscarinic, glutamatergic, and, now, serotoninergic synapses. In most (Buxbaum et al., 1993; Gabuzda et al., 1993; Hung et al., 1993; Wolf et al., 1995), but not all (Dyrks et al., 1994) cell types, receptor-mediated activation of APPs secretion is associated with decreased generation of Aβ. We were unable to measure Aβ secreted from the 3T3 fibroblasts within the short time intervals used for receptor stimulation in this study. Because cultured fibroblasts secrete very little amounts of Aβ, time periods of more than 24 h are necessary to detect measurable levels with current immunoadsorbent assays. Thus it remains to be investigated whether serotonin receptor-induced stimulation of APPs secretion is associated with changes in the rate of Aβ secretion. In Alzheimer's disease brain, amyloid deposits are present throughout the brain cortex, and they are not co-localized with any specific neurotransmitter system. Similarly, many neurotransmitter systems, including the cholinergic, serotoninergic, glutamatergic, and peptidergic systems, are heavily damaged in Alzheimer's disease brains, and this damage is associated with significant losses in cortical synapses (Terry et al., 1991). Inasmuch as these pathological alterations and the resulting deafferentation of target cells are associated with amyloidogenic APP processing, they may be involved in promoting the amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease brain. Identifying cell surface receptors, such as 5-HT2aR and 5-HT2cR, whose stimulation increases APPs secretion, could constitute a useful novel pharmacological strategy for manipulating of APP processing in brain, for promoting the potential functions of APPs as a paracrine neurotrophic/neuroprotective factor, and for concomitantly reducing the formation of amyloidogenic derivatives. A possible candidate compound may be dexfenfluramine, a widely used anti-obesity drug which is metabolized to dexnorfenfluramine in vivo. Brain levels of dexnorfenfluramine in subjects taking therapeutic doses of dexfenfluramine (30 mg/day) are probably in the order of 1-3 μM. ( 2B. Sandage, personal communication.) In our transfected cell lines, this concentration of dexnorfenfluramine was sufficient to promote both APPs secretion and PI turnover (Fig. 6). Clinical studies with highly selective receptor agonists are needed to determine whether this approach can modify the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease.

Briefly, LPS was suspended in 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, and incubated in labeling reagent for 30 min at room temperature with frequent sonication. Labeled LPS was promptly separated from unreacted BODIPY by gel filtration on a NAP 25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Preliminary experiments in which trace 3H LPS was added to the derivatization showed that >95% of the added LPS was recovered. The derivatized LPS retained the ability to stimulate PMN in an LBP-dependent fashion (not shown). The BODIPY concentration in the derivatized products was determined by measurement of optical density at 503 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 74,000 cm-1M-1, and labeling stoichiometry was found to be approximately 1 LPS:0.2 BODIPY. All of the BODIPY appeared covalently attached to the LPS, because chromatography on Mono Q and reversed phase columns showed a single peak of fluorescence that eluted precisely with the LPS (not shown). We found in addition that the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS increased about 50-fold upon addition of detergent (see Fig. 1), while free BODIPY showed no changes in fluorescence upon addition of SDS (not shown). This observation further supports the conclusion that BODIPY is covalently linked to micellar LPS. The excitation spectrum of BODIPY-LPS with or without 2% SDS was measured with an SLM-SPF500c spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL), and maximum excitation was observed at 485 nm. The emission spectrum was recorded with this excitation wavelength. To measure time-dependent changes in fluorescence that occur upon binding of BODIPY-LPS to sCD14, BODIPY-LPS, LBP, sCD14, and antibodies were diluted in PD (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+) (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and quickly mixed in a submicrocuvette (Starna Cells Inc., Atascadero, CA). In selected studies, the PD was replaced with PBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.9 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+). Fluorescence emission at 518 nm was digitally recorded over time with excitation at 485 nm. For measurement of the rate of BODIPY-LPS transfer, only the first 20-s period was used. In this time, less than 2% of complete transfer had occurred, insuring that an initial rate was observed, and linear regression yielded R2> 0.99, confirming linearity of the data. Fluorescence intensity was converted to molecules of LPS transferred using a BODIPY-LPS/SDS standard curve relating fluorescence to the concentration of BODIPY-LPS. These standards were prepared daily, and the diluent contained 2% SDS to allow maximal fluorescence. Since the fluorescence of the BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complex was only 0.41 times as great as BODIPY-LPS in SDS (see below), the standard curve was calibrated accordingly. To obtain a preparation of BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complexes that contained no free BODIPY-LPS, 16.7 nM LBP, 66 nM BODIPY-LPS, and 1 mg/ml human serum albumin were mixed in PD with or without 910 nM sCD14 (a 15-fold molar excess) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Any remaining BODIPY-LPS micelles were then removed by ultrafiltration with a Microcon 100 centrifuge filter (Amicon Corp, Beverly, MA). BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complexes appear in the ultrafiltrate, while LPS micelles and LBP are retained(6Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the filtrate was then measured with or without 2% SDS. The initial rate of LPS transfer was analyzed with the Lineweaver-Burk linear transform. Least squares linear curve fitting was done with the Excel spreadsheet program (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). BODIPY is an efficient, photostable fluorescent probe whose emission spectrum depends on the local concentration of fluorophore. For example, vesicles containing 50 mol % of BODIPY-ceramide have an emission maximum at 620 nm, but dilution of the BODIPY-ceramide to 2 mol % with phosphatidylcholine shifts the emission maximum to ~515 nm. The ratio of fluorescence intensity at 515-620 nm changes from 0.01 to 10 upon dilution in this way(10Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The emission spectrum of BODIPY-LPS in PD (Fig. 1A) showed a broad peak at 620 nm, indicative of a high local concentration of fluorophore. This observation indicates that the BODIPY in our preparations is aggregated, most likely because it is coupled to LPS, and the BODIPY-LPS exists in micelles or aggregates. Assuming that BODIPY-LPS behaves similarly to BODIPY-ceramide, the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 620 and 515 nm suggests that our BODIPY-LPS preparation contained ~20 mol % BODIPY. This estimate is consistent with our measurement of 0.2 mol of BODIPY/mol of LPS (see “Materials and Methods”). Dissolution of BODIPY-LPS micelles with SDS led to a pronounced change in the emission spectrum with a strong maximum at 518 nm (Fig. 1B). This observation further confirms the attachment of BODIPY to LPS and indicates that fluorescent properties report the aggregation state of BODIPY-LPS. Since the emission at 518 nm rises up to 50-fold upon disaggregation of BODIPY-LPS, we have used fluorescence intensity at this wavelength as a measure of disaggregation. LBP is known to bind immobilized LPS and stably coat the surface of LPS-coated plastic plates(11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gazzano-Santoro H. Meszaros K. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Lim E.D. Aberle S. Kasler H. Parent J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LPS-coated erythrocytes or whole Gram-negative bacteria(13Wright S.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Ramos R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170 (1241): 1241Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To determine if binding of LBP changes the aggregation state of LPS in solution, BODIPY-LPS aggregates were mixed with increasing concentrations of LBP, and fluorescence emission at 518 nm was measured. LBP caused a reproducible, dose-dependent increase in fluorescence, but even a molar excess of LBP caused fluorescence to rise only 2-fold (Fig. 2). This slight change in fluorescence may be caused by the interaction of LBP with BODIPY-LPS that remains aggregated in micelles. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that fluorescence enhancement is 75% of maximal upon addition of only 0.2 mol of LBP/mol of LPS. It is also consistent with our finding that radioactive LPS could not be found associated with monomeric LBP in native gels (5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and with recent work showing that LBP and LPS may form very large complexes in solution(14Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 15Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The fluorescence increase caused by LBP might also result from a small fraction of the BODIPY-LPS becoming associated with soluble, monomeric LBP, and our data cannot determine whether LBP exerts its effects on fluorescence by binding to BODIPY-LPS micelles or by disassociating a small proportion of BODIPY-LPS from micelles. In either case, it is clear that LBP does not cause substantial disaggregation of LPS. We have previously shown that sCD14 binds one to two molecules of LPS and that LPS•sCD14 complexes exist as monomers(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of BODIPY-LPS should thus rise upon binding to sCD14. Indeed, the addition of sCD14 to BODIPY-LPS, in the presence of low amounts of LBP to facilitate binding (see below), caused a strong rise in fluorescence (Fig. 3, line A), which reached a plateau at about 10 min. The maximal fluorescence reached at plateau was dependent on the concentration of sCD14. Substoichiometric amounts of sCD14 caused a concentration-dependent, linear increase in fluorescence that reached a maximum at approximately 1 CD14 added per BODIPY-LPS molecule (Fig. 4). This finding indicates that BODIPY-LPS binds sCD14 and suggests that the stoichiometry of this interaction is approximately one LPS per sCD14, consistent with our previous findings(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Parallel measurements, however, showed that addition of SDS to BODIPY-LPS caused a fluorescence increase even greater than that observed with saturating amounts of sCD14. Two phenomena, individually or in combination, could contribute to this observation: the fluorescence increase upon binding sCD14 could be less than that caused by dissolution in SDS micelles, or a portion of BODIPY-LPS may have failed to bind to sCD14 and remained as aggregates. Experiments described below show that the fluorescence efficiency of BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complexes is less than that of BODIPY-LPS in SDS micelles.Figure 4:Fluorescence at plateau of BODIPY-LPS depends on the concentration of sCD14. 330 nM BODIPY-LPS, 16.7 nM LBP, and increasing concentrations of sCD14 were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 4 min prior to measuring fluorescence emmision at 518 nm (open square, right axis). Fluorescence measurements for BODIPY-LPS and sCD14 mixtures without LBP are shown with open circles, right axis. The concentration of BODIPY-LPS in BODIPY-LPS/sCD14 complexes was calculated from the fluorescence measurement as described under “Materials and Methods” and is shown on the left axis. The fluorescence of 330 nM BODIPY-LPS rose to 1.3 with 2% SDS. The data are the mean of two fluorescence measurements ± S.D. of a representative experiment repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain a preparation of BODIPY-LPS•/complexes that did not contain any free BODIPY-LPS micelles, 200 ng/ml BODIPY-LPS was incubated with 1 μg/ml LBP and a 15-fold molar excess of sCD14 (50 μg/ml) for longer than 300 s to achieve maximal transfer. In the presence of sCD14 and LBP, the fluorescence intensity at 518 nm rose 10.5-fold (from 0.031 to 0.322). The addition of SDS to this mixture caused the fluorescence to rise a further 2-fold, confirming that sCD14 had not fully increased the fluorescence efficiency. The mixture was then passed through an ultrafiltration membrane with a 100-kDa size cutoff (see “Materials and Methods”). Previous studies showed that both sCD14 and LPS•sCD14 complexes pass through the membrane, but neither LPS micelles alone nor LBP pass this filter(6Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We verified that less than 2.5% of BODIPY-LPS alone passed through the filter (not shown). The ultrafiltrate showed strong fluorescence at 518 nm with an emission spectrum identical to that of BODIPY-LPS in SDS (not shown). This observation confirms that BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complexes are formed and that they show the fluorescence properties of disaggregated fluorophore. The addition of SDS directly to the ultrafiltered complexes caused the fluorescence to rise. After correction for background, the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complexes was 41.3 ± 2.3% (n = 3) of BODIPY-LPS in 2% SDS. This observation indicates that BODIPY-LPS in complex with sCD14 shows lower fluorescence efficiency than BODIPY-LPS in SDS, and we have used this finding to calculate the concentration of BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 complexes. On the day of each experiment, we measured the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS alone and in the presence of 2% SDS. A curve relating fluorescence to BODIPY-LPS•sCD14 concentration was then plotted with 0% as the fluorescence value of BODIPY-LPS alone and 100% as the value of BODIPY-LPS measured in SDS × 0.41. We have used this method to determine the amount of BODIPY-LPS bound to sCD14 in the presence of excess BODIPY-LPS (Fig. 4, left y axis). At several sCD14 concentrations, a constant proportion of 1 BODIPY-LPS appeared bound per sCD14. We have previously shown by gel electrophoresis that LBP facilitates the movement of LPS from micelles to sCD14 and that each LBP molecule may transfer hundreds of LPS molecules to hundreds of sCD14 molecules(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). To measure the initial rate of this transfer, we have measured the rise in fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS upon binding to sCD14. The fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS alone was stable for over 15 min of continuous illumination in a cuvette (data not shown). The addition of a 7-fold molar excess of sCD14 alone did not cause a measurable change in fluorescence over 1000 s (Fig. 3, line C), indicating that spontaneous movement of BODIPY-LPS to sCD14 was negligible in this interval. The addition of 0.05 mol of LBP/mol of BODIPY-LPS similarly had a negligible effect on the fluorescence of the BODIPY-LPS (Fig. 3, line B). However, the addition of LBP and sCD14 together caused a rapid rise in fluorescence with first order kinetics, and we calculate that over 95% of the BODIPY-LPS was bound to sCD14 at the plateau (Fig. 3, line A). Since the LBP was present at 20-fold substoichiometric levels, its function appears to be catalytic. To verify that the movement of BODIPY-LPS into sCD14 was caused by LBP rather than a contaminant or buffer constituent, anti-LBP IgG was added to the reaction. Rabbit IgG had little effect on movement of BODIPY-LPS to sCD14, but anti-LBP completely blocked transfer (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effect of antibody could be seen at an antibody concentration as low as 1 μg/ml. To verify that the LPS binding site on sCD14 is required for the LBP-catalyzed rise in fluorescence, we employed a mutant sCD14 in which residues 57-64 of the LPS binding site are deleted (sCD14Δ57-64). This mutant sCD14 shows strongly decreased ability to bind LPS in gel assays or to mediate cellular responses to LPS(9Juan T.S. Hailman E. Kelley M.J. Busse L.A. Davy E. Empig C.J. Narhi L.O. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5219-5224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and we found that sCD14Δ57-64 showed a strongly decreased ability to enhance fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 6).Figure 6:sCD14Δ57-64 fails to enhance the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS. 13.2 nM BODIPY-LPS and 0.67 nM LBP were mixed with either 5 μg/ml full-length sCD14 (line A) or sCD14Δ57-64(line B), and fluorescence at 518 nm was recorded over time at 30°C. Control mixtures were as shown on the graph. The figure is representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the above studies, sCD14 was present in stoichiometric excess of LBP. In blood, however, approximately equal levels of LBP and sCD14 are present, and Tobias et al.(15Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have suggested that under these conditions the LPS will remain with LBP and will not be transferred to sCD14. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the interaction of BODIPY-LPS with equimolar LBP and sCD14 (Fig. 7). LBP alone, at a concentration stoichiometric to LPS (line B), caused some enhancement of the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS. When stoichiometric sCD14 was added to the mixture of LBP and BODIPY-LPS the fluorescence increased very rapidly (line D), suggesting rapid transfer to sCD14. The level of fluorescence obtained was similar to that seen with substoichiometric LBP (line E). This result suggests that BODIPY-LPS is substantially transferred to sCD14 even in the presence of stoichiometric levels of LBP. The initial rate for transfer of BODIPY-LPS to sCD14 was obtained over a range of concentrations of both sCD14 and BODIPY-LPS (Fig. 8). The transfer reaction was first order with respect to concentration of both sCD14 and BODIPY-LPS (not shown). Measurement performed in buffer PD (without added divalents) yielded a Km (apparent) for LPS of 88.8 ± 11 ng/ml (n = 2) with 1 μg/ml sCD14 and 133.8 ± 1.6 ng/ml (n = 2) with 5 μg/ml sCD14. The Km (apparent) for sCD14 was 1.7 ± 0.5 μg/ml (n = 2) with 30 ng/ml LPS and 1.5 ± 0.8 μg/ml (n = 2) with 60 ng/ml LPS. To determine if these values are sensitive to the concentration of divalent cations, additional measurements were made in PBS (a buffer with physiologic concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+). This addition caused very slight changes; we observed a Km (apparent) for LPS of 91.1 ± 13.0 ng/ml (n = 2) with 1 μg/ml sCD14 and 165.0 ± 42 ng/ml (n = 2) with 5 μg/ml sCD14. The Km (apparent) for CD14 was 0.91 ± 0.5 (n = 2) with 30 ng/ml LPS and 1.58 ± 1.47 (n = 2) with 60 ng/ml LPS. The turnover number for LBP was 59.3 ± 16 mol of LPS min-1 LBP-1 with 5 μg/ml sCD14, and an intercept replot of Fig. 8A (not shown) yielded an extrapolated maximum turnover number of 149 ± 22 mol of LPS min-1 LBP-1. Here we describe a sensitive method for measuring the movement of labeled LPS from micelles to sCD14. The method depends on a spectral shift in a fluorophore upon dilution and is similar in principal to a method recently described by Tobias et al.(15Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Dilution of our BODIPY-LPS yields up to a 50-fold rise in fluorescence. Like Tobias et al., we confirm the finding of Hailman et al.(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) that LBP catalyzes transfer of LPS from micelles to sCD14 and that sCD14 binds approximately one LPS molecule. We further show that the transfer exhibits first order kinetics, and we have defined the catalytic constants for the transfer reaction. We find that the Km for sCD14 is 1-2 μg/ml, values within the range of concentrations of sCD14 in human plasma. The Km for LPS (~100 ng/ml), on the other hand, is substantially higher than the LPS levels normally observed in sepsis, and LBP may thus normally operate with levels of this substrate well below its Km. With saturating levels of LPS and sCD14, the turnover number for LBP is approximately 150 mol of LPS min-1 LBP-1. As with bisubstrate enzymes(16Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1979: 216-224Google Scholar), two general models may explain the interaction of the catalyst, LBP, with the substrates, sCD14 and LPS micelles. In a “ping pong” or “binary complex” model, LBP interacts with an LPS micelle in a first bimolecular reaction. LBP then disassociates from the micelle with one molecule of LPS and binds to sCD14 in a second bimolecular reaction (Fig. 9A). Alternatively, in a “ternary complex” model, LBP interacts simultaneously with both an LPS micelle and sCD14 during transfer of an LPS monomer to the sCD14 (Fig. 9B). We have drawn this as an ordered ternary complex reaction with LBP binding to LPS micelles before sCD14 since LBP is known to bind LPS aggregates without sCD14(11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gazzano-Santoro H. Meszaros K. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Lim E.D. Aberle S. Kasler H. Parent J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but sCD14 does not bind LBP without LPS(13Wright S.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Ramos R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170 (1241): 1241Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that LBP utilizes principally the ternary complex intermediate to transfer LPS to sCD14. 1) The binary complex model predicts parallel lines in the double reciprocal plots of Fig. 8(16Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1979: 216-224Google Scholar). These plots, however, clearly intersect, suggesting a ternary complex mechanism. A secondary plot of Fig. 8A, shown in the inset, confirms a monotonic change in slope with CD14 concentration. 2) A ternary complex of aggregated LPS, LBP, and sCD14 clearly does form. Erythrocytes coated with LPS•LBP complexes bind to CD14 on the surface of macrophages (13Wright S.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Ramos R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170 (1241): 1241Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar), complexes of LBP and LPS are removed from plasma upon chromatography on immobilized CD14(17Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Inflam. 1995; 45: 115-125PubMed Google Scholar), and complexes of labeled LBP and LPS bind to CD14-bearing cells in a CD14-dependent manner(14Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The binary complex model requires that LBP disassociate from LPS micelles to yield an LBP•LPS complex that shuttles LPS through the aqueous medium. This intermediate, however, has not been demonstrated under physiologic conditions. We have failed to observe monomeric LPS•LBP complexes in native gels of mixtures of LPS and LBP(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Moreover, LBP binds with high affinity to LPS-coated surfaces(11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gazzano-Santoro H. Meszaros K. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Lim E.D. Aberle S. Kasler H. Parent J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that disassociation is energetically unfavorable. The ternary complex model obviates the need for this unfavorable reaction. While Tobias et al.(15Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have observed monomeric LBP complexed with one to two LPS molecules under certain conditions, these studies were done in the presence of EDTA, an agent known to destabilize LPS. We have observed that EDTA caused a marked enhancement of the fluorescence of LBP•BODIPY-LPS complexes (not shown), suggesting that it could promote disaggregation. Our studies were done in the absence of EDTA to avoid that artificial disaggregation. Additional studies documented that the addition of physiologic concentration Ca2+ and Mg2+ did not significantly affect reaction kinetics. 4) Shuttling of LPS in a complex with LBP is required for the binary complex mechanism but is inconsistent with other data on the action of LBP. LBP is known to mediate the three transfer reactions in Fig. 10. If LPS•LBP complexes were the intermediate in these reactions, the addition of sCD14 would not affect the rate of transfer of LPS to HDL; sCD14 could not generate LPS•LBP complexes in excess of the LPS•LBP complexes needed to make LPS•sCD14. We have observed, however, that the addition of sCD14 dramatically enhances movement of LPS from micelles to HDL(6Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This finding is inconsistent with the binary complex model of LBP action but is consistent with a model in which transfer of LPS monomers to sCD14 is catalyzed through specific interactions of LBP with both the LPS micelles and sCD14. We wish to emphasize that our data do not rule out the possibility of some LPS being shuttled by LBP in a binary complex reaction. They merely suggest that a ternary complex mechanism is likely to be favored under physiological conditions.Figure 10:Three transfer reactions facilitated by LBP. LBP catalyzes movement of LPS monomer from LPS aggregates to sCD14(5Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our conclusion that LBP transfers LPS via an ordered, ternary complex reaction model differs from that of Tobias et al.(15Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), who favor the binary reaction model of Fig. 9A. These authors did not address the possibility of the ternary complex reaction of Fig. 9B. They argued that, since LBP binds to LPS with high apparent affinity, transfer to sCD14 would be energetically unfavorable. Our results indicate that, even with equimolar LBP and sCD14, transfer of LPS to sCD14 is favored (Fig. 7). How could LBP transfer LPS to sCD14 if its affinity for LPS is greater than that of CD14? We suggest that the high affinity of LBP is for the LPS aggregate, not the LPS monomer. A key feature of the ternary complex reaction model is that LBP may transfer an LPS monomer from an aggregate without the energetically unfavorable step of disassociating from the aggregate. One LBP molecule may thus transfer successive LPS monomers from a single aggregate (see curved arrow in Fig. 9B). This formulation is consistent with all known observations on the action of LBP. While our results strongly suggest an ordered ternary complex mechanism for LBP-mediated transfer of LPS from micelles to sCD14, they do not describe the reaction mechanism for the other two reactions catalyzed by LBP: transfer of LPS from micelles to HDL particles and transfer of LPS monomers from sCD14 to HDL particles (see Fig. 10). Experiments to describe these reactions are currently under way. We gratefully acknowledge the gift of recombinant LBP and sCD14 from Drs H. Lichenstein and T. S-C. Juan. We want to thank Drs E. Hailman, T. Park, and M. M. Wurfel for help and suggestions and Dr. P. A. Detmers for critical reading of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W1980522216,"We describe here an inhibitor of in vitro fibril formation, hexadecyl-N-methylpiperidinium (HMP) bromide, which is selective for the Alzheimer's disease peptide Abeta. At 10 microM, its IC50 for inhibiting Abeta aggregation at pH 5.8, HMP bromide does not inhibit fibril formation by other amyloidogenic polypeptides nor does it affect the folding stability of the beta-sheet-rich immunoglobulin VL domain REI. In addition, small structural modifications of HMP bromide reduce or eliminate its ability to inhibit pH 5.8 aggregation of Abeta. These indications of specificity, plus the ability of the molecule to inhibit A beta aggregation at concentrations almost an order of magnitude below its critical micelle concentration, suggest a mechanism of inhibition other than micellar solubilization of Abeta. HMP bromide is required in approximately a 1:1 stoichiometry for effective inhibition at pH 5.8. Although stoichiometric amounts of HMP bromide with respect to total Abeta inhibit Abeta fibril formation at pH 7.4, the molecule is incapable, at lower concentrations, of blocking the seeding of fibril formation by small amounts of added Abeta fibrils. The results suggest the existence of a binding surface on A beta capable of binding amphipathic molecules such as HMP bromide and which, when occupied, precludes assembly of A beta into amyloid fibrils. Molecules that bind to this site with high specificity may prove to be useful therapeutic agents for preventing or retarding the cerebral amyloid plaque formation implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology."

The factors controlling endomitosis are accessible to analysis in our megakaryocytic cell line, MegT, generated by targeted expression of temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T antigen to megakaryocytes of transgenic mice. We aimed to define whether endomitosis consists of a continuous phase of DNA synthesis (S) or of S phases interrupted by gaps. Analysis of the cell cycle in MegT cells revealed that, upon inactivation of large T antigen, the cells shifted from a mitotic cell cycle to an endomitotic cell cycle consisting of S/Gap phases. The level of the G1/S cyclin, cyclin A, as well as of the G1 phase cyclin, cyclin D3, were elevated at the onset of DNA synthesis, either in MegT cells undergoing a mitotic cell cycle or during endomitosis. In contrast, the level of the mitotic cyclin, cyclin B1, cycled in cells displaying a mitotic cell cycle while not detectable during endomitosis. Comparable levels of the mitotic kinase protein, Cdc2, were detected during the mitotic cell cycle or during endomitosis; however, cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase activity was largely abolished in the polyploid cells. Fibroblasts immortalized with the same heat-labile oncogene do not display reduced levels of cyclin B1 upon shifting to high temperature nor do they become polyploid, indicating that reduced levels of cyclin B1 is a property of megakaryocytes and not of the T-antigen mutant.

We conclude that cellular programming during endoreduplication in megakaryocytes is associated with reduced levels of cyclin B1. The development of hematopoietic cells consists of few stages: the commitment of pluripotent stem cells to differentiate rather than to remain in the resting G0 phase or to proliferate, lineage restriction and maturation of these committed cells, and synthesis of cell-specific gene products. Although the mechanisms by which cells withdraw from the stem cell pool are presently unknown, it was suggested that the initial steps may be stochastic (Suda et al., 1983). Thereafter, growth factors support progenitor cells to develop along particular differentiation pathways (Metcalf, 1989). In the megakaryocytic lineage, endomitosis involving DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis, as well as platelet production, are stimulated by thrombopoietin, recently isolated (Kaushansky et al., 1994; Wendling et al., 1994; Kuter et al., 1994; de Sauvage et al., 1994; Chang et al., 1995). The regulation of the cell cycle and of endomitosis in this cell type has not been explored yet. The major events common to all eukaryotic cell cycles are the replication of chromosomes during S phase and their segregation during mitosis. The dependences of S phase and mitosis on each other ensure orderly progression through the cell cycle (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989). However, in some developmental situations, chromosome replication and segregation can be uncoupled. For example, a G1/S cycle takes place without any intervening mitosis in cells during the early development of the Drosophila embryo (Smith and Orr-Weaver, 1991), as may also be the case in ploidizing megakaryocytes. However, in most cells, the dependence of S phase upon mitosis (M) and of M on S phase are strictly observed. The regulation points of the cell cycle are the G1/S and G2/M transitions, for which the kinase activity of Cdk2 or Cdc2, respectively, is crucial. These kinases are controlled through association with regulatory subunits known as cyclins (Nasmyth, 1990; Evans et al., 1983; Westendorf et al., 1990; Pines and Hunter, 1990). The G2/M transition is dependent on the activity of the Cdc2 kinase, activation of which requires association of Cdc2 with B-type cyclins and dephosphorylation on tyrosine (Draetta et al., 1989; King et al., 1994). Regulators of the G1/S transition include the cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase (or its homologue Cdc28 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) associated to cyclin A (Pines and Hunter, 1990; Bartlett and Nurse, 1990). In clams, these two different cyclins, A and B, show a similar periodicity in their synthesis and degradation, but in mammalian cells the levels of cyclin A rise near the beginning of S phase and the levels of cyclin B peak at the entry to mitosis (Evans et al., 1983; Westendorf et al., 1990; Pines and Hunter, 1990). The regulation of the G1 phase was studied first in S. cerevisiae, where it was found that cyclins, cln1, cln2, and cln3 (CLN genes), control progression through G1, by modulating the activity of Cdc28 kinase (Hadwiger et al., 1989; Wittenberg et al., 1990). Subsequently, equivalents to these G1 cyclins have been identified, cyclins D1, D2, and D3 (reviewed by Reed, 1991). Past studies of megakaryocyte development, endomitosis, and maturation have been hampered because of the rarity of megakaryocytes in bone marrow and because of the lack of a pure megakaryocytic cell line that can enter and complete a normal maturation cycle. Different leukemia cell lines derived from hematopoietic progenitors have been used in studying the biochemistry as well as gene regulation of the megakaryocytic lineage. Some human erythroleukemic cell lines exhibit myeloid, erythroid, as well as megakaryocytic markers (Martin and Papayannopoulou, 1982; Tabilio et al., 1983; Ravid et al., 1993a), while other cell lines (Greenberg et al., 1988; Sledge et al., 1986; Adachi et al., 1991) are enriched with megakaryocytic markers, but require exposure to a substance such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in order to ploidize. This later agent, being pluripotent, may induce changes in cyclin expression unrelated to megakaryocyte ploidy, as demonstrated on a nonmegakaryocytic cell line HL60 (Akiyma et al., 1993). We have recently generated a megakaryocytic cell line, MegT, by targeted expression of the temperature-sensitive form of large T antigen in megakaryocytes of transgenic mice, via the platelet factor four tissue-specific promoter (Ravid et al., 1993b). MegT cells which become polyploid upon inactivation of the oncogene were used to determine the role of different cyclins in promoting endomitosis. Our data suggest that once large T antigen is degraded, the cells undergo endomitosis while containing low levels of cyclin B1 and low activity of the mitotic kinase. MegT cells (clone 37C1) were grown in a liquid culture, all as described before (Ravid et al., 1993b). To induce ploidy, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into a 75-cm2 culture flask and incubated in 5% CO2 at 39.5°C for 4-5 days (Ravid et al., 1993b). Cells were counted by hemocytometer, and cell viability was followed by staining with Trypan Blue. For synchronization experiments, cells were cultured for 24 h at the indicated temperature after which the cells were shifted to a medium containing 0.1% horse serum. Forty eight hours later, fresh medium containing 20% horse serum was added to the cells. The attached cells as well as the detached cells were collected separately at different time points and subjected to various analyses. Immortal human fibroblasts transformed by heat-labile (tsA58) T antigen (generous gift of Dr. Harvey Ozer) were cultured as described elsewhere (Hubbard-Smith et al., 1992). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were performed essentially as described before (Xiong et al., 1992). To this end, MegT cells adhering to the culture dish and nonadhering cells were collected separately by trypsinization or by spinning down cells (380 × g, 5 min) in the medium, respectively. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMPFmitosis promoting factorkbkilobase(s).) (136 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2.6 mM KCl, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) by centrifugation and lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Lysates, each containing 100 μg of protein in 400 μl of lysis buffer, were precleared by incubation with normal mouse IgG and 40 μl of Zysorbin (fixed and killed Staphylococcus aureus protein A, Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 1 h at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Antibody was added to the clarified lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added at a volume of 40 μl and incubated at 4°C for an additional hour. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) (Laemmli and Favre, 1973). Protein assays were done as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mitosis promoting factor kilobase(s). For Western blotting, 10 μg of lysed proteins were separated on 7.5% or 12% SDS-PAGE (Laemmli and Favre, 1973) and electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was washed in TBS (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and blocked for 1 h with TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk. The blot was washed four times for 5 min with TBST and incubated for 1 h at 4°C in the presence of 10 ml of TBST supplemented with one of the following primary antibodies raised against human proteins: rabbit polyclonal antibodies to cyclin A (diluted 1:2000) (a gift of Dr. Tony Hunter at Salk Institute), anti-cyclin B1 monoclonal antibody (GNS-1 diluted to 0.2 μg/ml), anti-Cdc2 monoclonal antibody (A17 diluted to 0.5 μg/ml), anti-SV40 large T antigen monoclonal antibody (PAb 101 diluted to 1 μg/ml) (all from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), rat antibody to human cyclin D3 (diluted to 0.2 μg/ml) (Oncoge Science, Uniondale, NY). All these antibodies cross-react with the corresponding mouse proteins, as tested by the manufacturers. The blot was washed four times, each time for 10 min, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled appropriate secondary antibody (1:1500 to 1:3000 dilution in TBST (Amersham). The blot was washed four times, each for 10 min, with TBST and the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham) was used for detection of proteins, as instructed by the manufacturer. Kinase assays were done essentially as described before (Koff et al., 1991). Immunoprecipitates containing the GNS-1 antibody (see above), which do not block the binding of Cdc2 to cyclin B, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were washed in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 2.5 μg of histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), 30 μM ATP (Sigma). After a 20-min incubation at 25°C, an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added. The sample was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. 20 μl of the sample was loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE (Laemmli and Favre, 1973). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. MegT cells were seeded in a 25-cm flask at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/5 ml of medium (Ravid et al., 1993b). The cells were either cultured at 34°C or at 39.5°C, as indicated. Cells were efficiently synchronized by serum starvation, as described above, and, at different time points after addition of serum, they were subjected to pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine (15 μCi/5 ml) (DuPont NEN) for 1 h. At the end of the pulse labeling, the medium was collected, and the cells in suspension were spun down (380 × g, 5 min) and washed twice with PBS. The adhering cells also were washed with PBS. The adhering cells were extracted on the dish, and the nonadhering cells were extracted in a tube, both with 1.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Trichloroacetic acid was discarded, and the cells were washed with an additional 2 ml of trichloroacetic acid. Cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 N NaOH which was then collected to a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Fisher Scientific) and counted in a scintillation counter. Cells were scraped off the plate with PBS or collected in medium, when in suspension, and pelleted for 5 min at 380 × g. Cells washed with PBS were resuspended in propidium iodide (0.05 μg/ml in 0.1% sodium citrate, pH 7.4) essentially as described before (Ravid et al., 1993b). Uniform nuclear staining was achieved over 16 h at 4°C. Just before flow cytometry analysis, the cells were treated with ribonuclease at a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml, for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were filtered through a 100-μm mesh, diluted with propidium iodide solution to a concentration of 106 cells/ml, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis on a FACScan system (Becton Dickinson). Data were collected and analyzed by CellFit program (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). RNA isolation and Northern blot analyses were performed as described before (Ravid et al., 1993b). The blots were probed with different human cDNAs encoding different cyclins, each recognizing the corresponding mouse cDNA (a gift of Dr. Emma Lees, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center), or with mouse cDNA generated by the polymerase chain reaction using DNA primers based on published sequences (Chapman and Wolgemuth, 1992). The blots were washed under low stringency for 60 min at 59°C with 2 × SSC (Ravid et al., 1993b). Blots subjected to repeated hybridizations were first stripped by immersing the blot for 10 min in a preboiled solution of 0.1% SDS (w/v in H2O). Probing with actin cDNA was performed last to confirm equal loading of RNA in each lane. Proliferating MegT cells were synchronized by serum deprivation, and RNA was prepared from cells harvested at different time points of the cell cycle. The RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis using different cyclin cDNAs as probes. As shown in Fig. 1, MegT cells expressed cyclins A, B1, D1, and D3 mRNAs, but to a lesser extent B2 mRNA, and not D2 mRNA. It should be pointed out that the B2 and D2 cDNAs used as probes detected the corresponding mRNA from mouse total bone marrow, confirming that the probes used were capable of recognizing the murine messages (not shown). Indeed, as described for other systems, B-type and D-type cyclins are differentially expressed in different tissues (Chapman and Wolgemuth, 1992, 1993; Matsushime et al., 1991). We noted that once MegT cells were shifted to the temperature which is not permissive for stability of large T antigen, a fraction of the cells remained adhering to the dish while the other fraction detached from the dish. The nonadhering cells, representing 34 + 9% (n = 6) of the cells at 4 days postculturing, appeared as round and larger cells. At the permissive temperature (34°C), all cells remained adhering to the culture dish (Fig. 2). In the current study, we performed separate ploidy analyses on the detached and adhering cells cultured at the same nonpermissive temperature as compared to MegT cells cultured at 34°C. Under the later conditions, all cells were adhering to the dish and consisted of 2N (diploid) and 4N cells (Fig. 3). At the nonpermissive temperature, the fraction of cells attached to the plate also consisted of 2N and 4N cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the majority of the detached cells were 4N and 8N cells (Fig. 3C). In a previous study, we found that the megakaryocyte-promoting factor, thrombopoietin (Kuter et al., 1994), did not have a significant effect on the ploidy state of MegT cells. ( 2K. Ravid, D. Kuter, and R. Rosenberg, unpublished data.) Recently, these cells were also analyzed for their ability to express c-mpl, the receptor for thrombopoietin (Wendling et al., 1994). We found that the level of expression of c-mpl in MegT cells was low, revealed only by the polymerase chain reaction, but not by Northern blot analysis (not shown). This indicated that signaling pathways critical for reaching a ploidy state higher than 8-16N are not active in these cells. Of most interest was the observation that the level of large T antigen, as revealed by Western blot analysis, was notably reduced in the cells in suspension (polyploid cells) but not in the adhering cells (mostly diploid cells) cultured at the same nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 4A). We then determined the level of components of the mitosis promoting factor (MPF), being cyclin B and Cdc2, in both fractions of cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the level of cyclin B1 protein, but not of Cdc2, was significantly reduced in the polyploid cells. Northern blot analysis indicated, however, that the level of cyclin B1 mRNA was not changed significantly in polyploid cells (Fig. 4B). In order to establish whether a reduced level of cyclin B is a property of a T-antigen mutant cell line or rather a property of polyploid megakaryocytes, we determined the level of T antigen and of cyclin B in immortal fibroblasts (AR5) transformed by origin-defective SV40 encoding a heat-labile T antigen (Hubbard-Smith et al., 1992). At high temperature, these cells display a reduced growth rate, but no hyperploidy (Resnick-Silverman et al., 1991). Western blot analyses (Fig. 5) indicated that, although T antigen was degraded in AR5 cells incubated at high temperature, the level of cyclin B was not altered. Pulse labeling with radiolabeled thymidine was used to determine the profile of DNA synthesis in MegT cells, synchronized by serum deprivation and cultured at the nonpermissive temperature. Upon release from synchronization, at successive time points, the adhering and nonadhering cells were labeled for 1 h with [3H]thymidine and collected separately. During 40 h in culture, two cycles of DNA synthesis were observed in MegT cells adhering to the dish, each spanning about 18 h. The value of [3H]thymidine incorporation at the first peak of DNA synthesis was lower than the peak value during the second cycle, and the cell number doubled at the end of the second cycle, all as expected during a mitotic cell cycle (Fig. 6A). In contrast, each cycle of DNA synthesis in the detached cells was completed within 10 h with a short gap between the S phases (Fig. 6B). The cell number remained constant at the end of both cycles, as expected during endoreduplication. The second peak of DNA synthesis reached a value for [3H]thymidine incorporation lower than the one expected in case all cells would have undergone endoreduplication. It should be pointed out, however, that also in the case of primary bone marrow megakaryocytes only a fraction of the cells continues endomitosis for several cycles to reach a high ploidy state (Rovolic, 1974). Immunoprecipitation of equal amounts of proteins prepared from the mitotic and endoreduplicating MegT cells revealed that the activity of the mitosis promoting factor (MPF), consisting of cyclin B-dependent Cdc2 kinase, was high during mitosis in the replicating MegT cells while hardly detectable in the polyploid cells (inset in Fig. 6). We also sought to determine the level of G1 phase, G1/S, and M phase cyclins at the onset and offset of DNA synthesis in synchronized MegT cells cultured at the nonpermissive temperature. As shown in Fig. 7A, Western blot analyses revealed that during the mitotic cell cycle the level of the G1/S cyclin, cyclin A, was slightly higher at the onset of DNA synthesis while elevation of cyclin B1 level started at S phase, as expected before entry to mitosis. During the endomitotic cell cycle (Fig. 7B), the levels of cyclin A and of the protein Cdc2 were significantly high, but cyclin B1 was barely detectable. As to the large T antigen, it was readily detectable during the mitotic cell cycle, but, undetectable in the polyploid cells. These results further suggested that turning off the oncogene was a prerequisite for shifting from a mitotic cell cycle to endomitosis. It should be also pointed out that, during the mitotic cell cycle, the level of cyclin A cycled moderately, while it did not seem to cycle during the endomitotic cell cycle. It is possible that we were unable to detect a rapid transient decrease in cyclin A during the short G phase of the endomitotic cell cycle. The level of the G1 phase protein, cyclin D3, for which a high level of mRNA was detected (Fig. 1) was also determined. Cyclin D3 level was high at time points corresponding to the G1 phase (Fig. 6) during the mitotic cell cycle while moderate changes were observed in the level of this cyclin during endomitosis (Fig. 8). Endomitosis, involving DNA replication in the absence of mitosis, can occur in three types of cells: those in which the endoreplicated chromosomes are not synapsed or visible, those in which cyclic condensation of the chromosomes is observed, and, in some cases, those in which multinucleate cells have been referred to as polyploid also. In the case of the megakaryocytic lineage, the endoreduplicated DNA is all concentrated in one nucleus (Metcalf, 1989). However, it is not certain yet if polyploid megakaryocytes enter only prophase involving chromosome condensation or prophase as well as metaphase, involving chromosome condensation and spindle formation but skip anaphase, or whether the cells skip all stages in the G2 and M phases to directly enter a G1 phase. While electron microscopic analyses of different stages of mitosis in megakaryocytes are underway, we sought to investigate the cyclin composition of megakaryocytes undergoing endomitosis. In a previous study, we generated several clones of megakaryocytic cell lines by targeted expression of the temperature-sensitive form of large T antigen in transgenic mice, via the tissue-specific platelet factor four (PF4) promoter (Ravid et al., 1993b). These cell lines express several megakaryocytic markers, such as the glycoprotein GPIIb, and acetylcholine esterase, and at the permissive temperature adhere to the dish and contain high levels of large T antigen (Ravid et al., 1993b). In the current study, we have chosen to investigate a clone which allowed us to perform analyses of the mitotic and endomitotic cell cycle at the same nonpermissive temperature. When MegT cells (clone 37C1) were cultured at the nonpermissive temperature, only a fraction of the cells (about 30%) had undetectable levels of large T antigen and solely those cells appeared as round cells in suspension with high ploidy nuclei. Because of the leaky nature of this conditional oncogene, large T antigen may not have been completely destroyed in the rest of the cells which remained adhering to the dish. Nevertheless, this feature was taken as an experimental advantage, since it allowed us to compare levels of different cyclins in diploid and polyploid megakaryocytes cultured at the same elevated temperature. Our results indicated that cells expressing high levels of large T antigen were unable to initiate endoreduplication. In a recently published study, additional transgenic mice carrying the temperature-sensitive large T antigen under the control of the PF4 promoter have been generated (Robinson et al., 1994). Upon aging, some of these mice developed megakaryocytic leukemias displaying aberrations in megakaryocyte morphology and low platelet counts. Transgenic mice in which megakaryocytes reached high ploidy level seemed to express minute amounts of the oncogene (Robinson et al., 1994). We aimed to define whether the megakaryocytic cell cycle during endomitosis consists of a continuous S phase or of Gap/S phases and to determine which cyclins are involved in this process. Pulse-labeling of MegT cells with [3H]thymidine revealed that during endomitosis DNA synthesis was not continuous, but, rather, interrupted by a short gap. The level of the G1 phase cyclin, cyclin D3, cycled during the mitotic cell cycle in MegT cells and rose at the gap phase during endomitosis. This latter result further suggested the existence of a G1 phase during endomitosis in megakaryocytes. During this process of endoreduplication, the whole cell cycle was quite short, spanning about 10 h, in correlation with a previous study in rat primary bone marrow megakaryocytes (Odell et al., 1968). Further cyclin analyses in MegT cells revealed no significant differences in the level of cyclin A and in the level of Cdc2 protein during a mitotic or endomitotic cell cycle. However, while the cyclin B1 level rose at the onset of mitosis in continuously doubling MegT cells, it was hardly detectable in the polyploid cells. In accordance, the activity of cyclin B1-dependent kinase was low. Interestingly, the reduced level of cyclin B1 could not be attributed to low level transcription, as the level of cyclin B1 mRNA was not reduced in polyploid cells. The mechanism of cyclin degradation, a highly selective process, is not well understood. The amino-terminal sequences have been shown to play a critical role in targeting cyclins to the ubiquitin degradation pathway (Hershko et al., 1991), the activation of which occurs at the onset of anaphase. It is plausible then that cyclin B1 is either not stable or not translated in polyploid megakaryocytes. We confirmed that a reduced level of cyclin B1 is a property of polyploid megakaryocytes, rather than a property of our particular T-antigen cell line, by analyzing immortal fibroblasts transformed with the temperature-sensitive T antigen. At the nonpermissive temperature, these latter cells are not polyploid (Resnick-Silverman et al., 1991) and display a reduced level of T antigen, but not of cyclin B1. In accordance with these results is our observation that primary megakaryocytes derived from mouse bone marrow lack cyclin B1, as revealed by lack of staining (via immunohistochemistry) with cyclin B1 antibody (not shown). Although two types of cyclin B were described in mammalian cells, B1 and B2 (Chapman and Wolgemuth, 1993), it is not clear yet which of these cyclins plays a role in different stages of mitosis in eukaryotic cells and if they are able to substitute for each other. While the level of cyclin B1 protein was reduced during endomitosis in MegT cells, we were unable to determine the level of cyclin B2 protein because of the lack of an antibody that recognizes mouse cyclin B2. It should be pointed out, however, that cyclin B1 mRNA is the predominant one in MegT cells (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, we do not exclude the possibility that small amounts of B2 mRNA may lead to a significant amount of B2 protein in MegT cells. In many systems tested, the lack of cyclin B1 alone is sufficient to drive endoreduplication. Endoreduplication in some Drosophila cell types is indeed associated with a lack of cyclin B1 (Lehner and O'Farrell, 1990). Also, the metaphase II arrest in mouse oocytes is controlled through destruction of cyclin B1 (Kubiak et al., 1993). Initiation of endoreduplication in different systems depends on the availability of Cdc2 kinase and cyclin B, both composing an active M phase promoting factor (MPF). Thus, certain treatments, such as inhibitors of protein kinases in mammalian cells or high levels of the protein encoded by rum1, which inhibits the mitotic kinase in fission yeast, block M phase and induce repeats of S phase (Usui et al., 1991; Moreno and Nurse, 1994). In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the NIMA protein kinase is required in addition to MPF for the M phase (O'Connell et al., 1994). Overexpression of this kinase in different systems, including human cells, resulted in chromatin condensation without other aspects of mitosis (O'Connell et al., 1994). Although functional homologues of NIMA in mammalian cells have not been described yet, some kinases have been reported to have homology to the catalytic domain of NIMA (Schultz and Nigg, 1993). These studies suggest that not all steps of mitosis are regulated by the MPF kinase. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces cerevisiae temperature sensitivity cut8-563 mutation causes chromosome overcondensation and short spindle formation in the absence of cytokinesis, thus leading to the identification of a gene (cek1+1) encoding a novel protein kinase which complements the mutation that blocks anaphase (Samejima and Yanagida, 1994). The model proposed by O'Connell et al.(1994) involves condensation of chromatin by a NIMA homologue while other mitotic events down to anaphase are regulated by MPF. Anaphase is regulated by inactivation of MPF and may be regulated also by other kinases such as cek1+1 analogues. If so, our model of polyploid MegT cells with significantly reduced levels of cyclin B1 may be used for studying the roles of different mitosis-related kinases in endomitosis.

It displays eight transmembrane segments arranged like a covalent assembly of a Shaker-type voltage-dependent K+ channel (without S4 transmembrane segments) with an inward rectifier K+ channel. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, YORK does not pass inward currents; it conducts only K+-selective outward currents. However, the mechanism responsible for this strict outward rectification is unusual. Like inward rectifiers, its activation potential threshold closely follows the K+ equilibrium potential. Unlike inward rectifiers, the rectification is not due to a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block. The blocking element is probably intrinsic to the YORK protein itself. YORK activity is decreased at acidic internal pH, with a pKa of 6.5.Pharmacological and regulation properties were analyzed. Ba2+ ions and quinine block YORK currents through high and low affinity sites, while tetraethylammonium displays only one affinity for blocking. Activation of protein kinase C indirectly produces an increase of the current, while protein kinase A activation has no effect. YORK is a newly cloned K+ channel from yeast.

Mutation and DNA-protein binding analyses indicated that a complex interaction between adjacent Sp1- and ets-like recognition motifs with their cognate binding factors is required for the function of the TGM3 promoter. As these TGM3 sequences can confer promoter/enhancer activity to reporter genes at a level comparable to the powerful SV40 promoter, they may be useful for gene therapy in keratinocytes.

The involvement of TGases in cell envelope formation is supported by three types of observations. First, a large body of in vivo studies have documented that the TGases and the cell envelope structural proteins are co-expressed (reviewed in (1Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

The ability of the three epidermally expressed TGases to cross-link the same substrates, although with different efficiencies(44Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N.

Hence, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms that control and modulate the expression of these TGase genes in the epidermis. TGM1, TGM2, and TGM3 genes have distinctly different patterns of expression. TGM2 is expressed in a variety of tissues (18Chung S.-I. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Its expression is initiated well after the transcription of the genes encoding the earlier differentiation markers, such as the keratin proteins K1 and K10, have been repressed (17Kim S-Y.

Although TGase 3 mRNA represents less than 2% of the TGase transcripts, the activated TGase 3 accounts for up to 75% of the total TGase activity in mammalian epidermis(17Kim S-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In submerged cultures of undifferentiated normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) the abundance of TGase 3 mRNA is greatly diminished compared to the foreskin epidermis. In contrast, TGase 1 and TGase 2 mRNA levels are increased. Induction of NHEK cell differentiation with Ca2 leads to an increase in the TGase 1 and TGase 3 mRNA expression, whereas TGase 2 mRNA is down-regulated(28Lichti U. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 82-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To date, very little is known about the recognition elements and the protein factors that regulate the transcription of these three TGase genes. In a recently published study on TGM 2 gene(56Lu S. Saydak M. Gentile V. Stein J. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9748-9756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), about 1.6 kb of the 5′-upstream region conferred low levels of constitutive activity that could not be modulated by retinoids, so that the sequences which control the high level and the retinoic acid inducibility of TGM2 transcription must be located elsewhere. In the case of the TGM1 gene, 0.82 kb of upstream sequences were found to induce expression in epithelial cells in the presence of TPA, which could be suppressed by retinoids or protein kinase C(57Yamada K. Yaminishi K. Kakizuka A. Kibe Y. Doi H. Yasuno H. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 34: 827-836PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments indicated that c-jun and c-fos transcription factors were involved, presumably through an AP-1 site in this region, but none of the regulatory sequences have been defined functionally. In the case of the TGM3 gene, no data are available on the factors which control its expression. The aim of this study has been to explore the mechanisms which regulate the expression of the human TGM3 gene. As an initial step, we have defined sequences in the vicinity of the mRNA start site which provide high promoter activity and which restrict expression to epithelial cells in vitro. Our data indicate that this epithelial-specific activity is provided by cooperative interactions between Sp1 and ets transcription factors. All recombinant DNA technology was done according to standard procedures(58Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991Google Scholar, 59Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Previously, we have isolated a genomic clone gTGM3-6 which extends about 3 kb above the functional transcriptional start site of the human TGM3 gene(30Kim I.-G. Lee S.-C. Lee J.-H. Yang J.-M. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermat. 1994; 103: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In order to identify sequences which confer TGM3 promoter/enhance function, recombinant plasmids were constructed by subcloning various portions of these sequences into the HindIII/XbaI sites of the reporter vector pCAT-Basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene but does not contain any regulatory elements. For generation of the TGM3 fragments, the following forward primers (5′ to 3′ notation) were used in a polymerase chain reaction with gTGM3-6 as template (HindIII and XbaI sites are shown in lower case letters): −3050: aagcttGCCCTACTGCTGGTCAG; −821: aagcttCAGTGAGGGTCAGTG; −280: aagcttCCTACAATCCAGGA; −130: aagcttACAGGCACTACAGG; −126: aagcttCAGGCACTACAGGAATG; −116: aagcttAGGAATGACCTGGTGCC; −106: aagcttGGTGCCTCGCCCACT; and −91: aagcttCATTAGAATTCTAAT. All utilized at the 3′-end the reverse primer +10 to −7: tctagaCTCTGGGAATGGCACGG. The polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified, digested, and subcloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pCAT-Basic vector. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts was verified by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing with a Sequenase kit 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Two other commercial vectors were used for comparisons with the eight pCAT-Basic constructs. These were the pCAT-Promoter and pCAT-Control vectors (Promega), which are the same as the pCAT-Basic vector except that in the former the CAT gene is driven by the powerful SV40 promoter, and the latter contains SV40 early promoter and enhancer sequences. In addition, we used a second heterologous promoter derived from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Sequences between −50 and +50 of the thymidine kinase gene from the pBLCAT2 vector (60Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) were used to construct a ptk-Promoter vector. TGM3 gene sequences between −126 and −73, derived from synthetic oligonucleotides, were inserted in front of this minimal promoter. The sequence of the resulting construct ptk-TGM3 was verified by sequencing. Cryopreserved NHEK were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and grown in calf skin collagen (Sigma) coated dishes in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics) at 0.05 mM Ca2, supplemented with 60 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract. Third passage NHEK cells were used for transfection experiments, and preparation of nuclear extracts. A431, Cos-7, HeLa, MCF-7, HepG2, and NIH-3T3 cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and were grown and maintained following the recommended procedures. HaCaT cells were a gift from Dr. Norbert E. Fusening, and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-AS) were a gift from Dr. Carol Thiele and were grown in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfections were performed in duplicate using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies) for NHEK, HeLa, A431, HepG2, and MCF-7 cells, or DOTAP (Boehringer Meinheim) for all other cells lines following the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, 2-3 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well culture plates 16-20 h before transfection. Transfections were done when cultures reached 60-70% confluency. Transfection efficiencies were always monitored by use of a thymidine kinase β-galactosidase construct (tk-β-gal) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For Lipofectin transfections, cell cultures were washed once at 37°C with phosphate-buffered saline, and then were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with either Keratinocyte-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for NHEK cells, or Opti-MEMI media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for HeLa, A431, and HepG2 cells. For each well, 1.5 μg of reporter plasmids and 0.5 μg of tk-β-gal was mixed with 6 μg of Lipofectin, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The lipid/DNA mixture was then added into each well and incubated for 16-18 h in the case of NHEK and A431 cells, or 3-4 h in the case of HeLa and HepG2 cells. At the end of the transfection period the medium was replaced with the medium in which the cells normally grow, and for NHEK cells the concentration of the Ca2 in the KGM medium was adjusted to 1.2 mM. Cells were harvested 50-60 h post-transfection. For DOTAP transfections, the plasmids (1.5 μg of reporter constructs and 0.5 μg of tk-β-gal) were mixed with 14 μg of DOTAP in HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.3) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The transfections were carried out in the medium of each cell type for 16-18 h. The media were then replaced and cells cultured for another 50-60 h. Some NHEK cultures were co-transfected with the TGM3 −126/+10 sequences with the pECE vector or this vector containing mouse ets-2 cDNA (gift of Dr. Richard Maki, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation). Similar co-transfection experiments used the human pRSV-Sp1 cDNA or the RSV-vector alone (gift of Dr. Robert Tjian, University of California, Berkeley). Cellular extracts were prepared through at least three freeze-thaw cycles as described(61Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.-P. Guerin S.

Cellular extracts of untransfected cells and of cells transfected with the pCAT-Basic vector alone without the TGM3 inserted sequences were used as negative controls, while the pCAT-Promo"

It is conventionally accepted that perforin acts by perforating the target cell membrane; however, the site and mode of action of granzyme B are unknown. We have addressed this issue using Western blotting, proteolytic assays, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to demonstrate that purified human granzyme B can be taken up in large amounts and bound within nuclei. By contrast, perforin and nongranzyme serine proteases did not undergo nuclear uptake. Both unglycosylated human granzyme B (26 kDa) and that bearing high mannose glycosylation (32 kDa) were internalized and bound within nuclei, but forms greater than 32 kDa with complex carbohydrate addition were excluded. The uptake of granzymes was not dependent on net charge, as nuclei absorbed similar quantities of granzyme B at neutral pH and through a range of basic pHs but did not take up other very basic serine proteases such as the mouse mast cell protease 5. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated nuclear and nucleolar accumulation of fluoresceinated granzyme B by isolated nuclei. Measurement of the kinetics of nuclear import using an in vitro nuclear transport assay indicated maximal levels of nuclear accumulation of granzyme about 2.5-fold above those in the cytoplasm and nucleolar accumulation a further 3-4-fold higher. Nuclear and nucleolar accumulation were exceedingly rapid, reaching half-maximal levels within 3.3 and 7.5 min, respectively, implying that nuclear accumulation probably occurs prior to transport to the nucleolus.

https://openalex.org/W2000394884,"Previous studies have shown that porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) secrete two insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP), IGFBP-2 and −4, and that these IGFBPs modulate IGF-I-stimulated SMC proliferation and migration. In this study we demonstrate that porcine SMCs express IGFBP-5 mRNA and synthesize and secrete the protein. In this cell type, the biosynthesis of IGFBP-5 is up-regulated by IGF-I. This increase in IGFBP-5 synthesis is accompanied by an increase in the steady-state mRNA levels. The induction of IGFBP-5 mRNA by IGF-I is time- and dose-dependent and requires de novo protein synthesis. IGF-II and insulin also increase IGFBP-5 mRNA levels at high doses. An IGF-I analog with normal affinity for the IGF-I receptor but reduced affinity for IGFBPs evokes a similar increase. Another analog that binds to IGFBPs but not to the receptor has no effect, indicating that this effect of IGF-I is mediated through the IGF-I receptor. The IGF-I-induced IGFBP-5 gene expression is cell type-specific because IGF-I had no such effect in other cell types examined. Nuclear run-on assays revealed that IGF-I increased transcription rate of the IGFBP-5 gene, while IGF-I did not change the IGFBP-5 mRNA stability. Furthermore, the IGFBP-5 promoter was 3.5-fold more active in directing expression of the luciferase reporter gene in IGF-I-treated aortic SMCs as compared to control cells, whereas the luciferase activity remained the same in control- and IGF-I-treated fibroblasts.

Based on the coimmunoprecipitation of GP Ib-IX with actin-binding protein from detergent lysates, binding of purified GP Ib-IX to purified actin-binding protein, and association of expressed GP Ib-IX with actin-binding protein in transfected cells, it has been concluded that the association of GP Ib-IX with the cytoskeleton is mediated by actin-binding protein(16.Fox J.E.B.

The function of several types of adhesion receptors including integrins, selectins, and members of the immunoglobulin-like family of receptors, appears to be affected by the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor(23.Hayashi Y.

Although it is well established that GP Ib-IX associates with the cytoskeleton, the importance of the cytoplasmic domain of this receptor in regulating ligand binding or ligand-induced transmembrane signaling has not been investigated. In the present study, we expressed full-length and truncated forms of the GP Ib-IX complex in cultured cells. The results show that either all or part of the amino acid sequence Trp-570 to Ser-590 in the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα is necessary for mediating association of the entire GP Ib-IX complex with the cytoskeleton. Although GP Ib-IX complex lacking this cytoplasmic region of GP Ibα did not associate with the cytoskeleton, it was incorporated into a complex with the other subunits and was inserted into the membrane of cultured cells. The truncation of the cytoplasmic domain that ablated the interaction of the receptor with the cytoskeleton had no detectable effect on the binding of adhesive ligand. However, cells expressing truncated receptor showed a very different morphology following adhesion to immobilized von Willebrand factor than did cells expressing full-length receptor. These results show that the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα is absolutely required for attachment of the GP Ib-IX complex to the cytoskeleton and suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα plays an important role in regulating von Willebrand factor-induced transmembrane signaling.

Cells that expressed high levels of GP Ib-IX were selected by several rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). A fragment of DNA containing the SV40 enhancer, adenovirus major late promoter, and the entire coding sequence and 3'-untranslated region of GP Ibα was introduced into the KS-Bluescript II vector (Statagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as the template for introducing stop codons at five different locations in the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα utilizing Stratagene's Double Take™ double-stranded mutagenesis system. The mutagenic primers that were used included 5'-AGAGGGGACGGtAAGTGACAGTG-3' (m545), 5'-CCTTCGAGGTTaGCTTCCCAC-3' (m559), 5'-CTCTTCCTGTGaGTACGGCCTAA-3' (m570), 5'-CCCTCAGCTCTGAGTtAGGGTCGTGGTCAG-3' (m591), and 5'-GTGAGCATTAGGTAaTCTGGCCACAGCCTC-3' (m605) (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA). The mutations of interest were verified by sequence analysis. Cells were harvested with EDTA, lysed in a Triton X-100 containing buffer, and the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions isolated by centrifugation as described previously(21.López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on one-dimensional 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) as described previously (16.Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11970-11977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GP Ibα was detected on Western blots (32.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using 10 μg/ml monoclonal antibody IOP42b (AMAC, Inc., Westbrook, ME) or polyclonal antibodies against the GP Ib-IX complex (number 3584(33.Meyer S. Kresbach G. Häring P. Schumpp-Vonach B. Clemetson K.J. Hadváry P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), courtesy of Dr. Beat Steiner, Basel, Switzerland). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using Amersham's ECL system (Amersham Int., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Cells were harvested with EDTA, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated AN51 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), a monoclonal antibody to GP Ibα, or SZ1 (Amac Inc. Westbrook, ME), a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope on the GP Ib-IX complex(5.Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were rocked in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min, and then washed twice with PBS. Samples were then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS and flow cytometric analysis performed on a modified FACS 440 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) cell sorter equipped with CICERO electronics and CPU (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) and with a single argon laser (Coherent, Mountain View, CA). All experiments were performed using the 488-nm laser line set at 400 milliwatts, with triggering and thresholding done on forward light scatter. Forward and side light scatter emission were detected through 488/10 nm band-pass filters, and fluorescence emission was collected through a 530/30 nm band-pass filter. In most cases, the 5% of cells with the highest level of fluorescence intensity were isolated in a three-drop sort packet directly into medium. Transfected CHO cells (5 × 105/sample) were harvested by treatment with EDTA for 10 min, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml von Willebrand factor (a gift of Dr. Joel Moake, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml botrocetin (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland) for 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. Samples were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed twice again in PBS. To detect von Willebrand factor binding samples were then incubated with polyclonal anti-factor VIII/von Willebrand factor antibody (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) (1:1000 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For Scatchard analysis, von Willebrand factor was labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase method and various concentrations incubated with transfected cells as described previously (30.Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Samples were rocked at room temperature for 1 h, aliquots sedimented through sucrose cushions, and the amount of 125I-labeled von Willebrand factor associated with the sedimented cells measured. Preliminary experiments used excess unlabeled von Willebrand factor to determine nonspecific binding. In subsequent experiments nonspecific binding was determined by measuring 125I-labeled von Willebrand factor that bound to cells which had not been transfected with GP Ib-IX and subtracting the counts from those of the corresponding transfected samples. The two methods of determining nonspecific binding gave comparable results; the experiments in the present study were performed using the latter method for determining nonspecific binding. Transfected cells were mixed with 5 μg/ml botrocetin and plated on Lab-Tek tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) which had been coated with 10 μg/ml von Willebrand factor and saturated with 3% bovine serum albumin. After 2 h at 37°C, cells were fixed, lysed, labeled with polyclonal antibodies that had been raised against the GP Ib-IX complex (33.Meyer S. Kresbach G. Häring P. Schumpp-Vonach B. Clemetson K.J. Hadváry P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) as described previously(21.López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was performed on an inverted microscope (DIAPHOT-TMD, Nikon, Japan). The approach that was used to determine whether the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib-IX regulates the function of the receptor was to express full-length and truncated forms of the complex in cultured cells. Because previous work with synthetic peptides had shown that peptides based on sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the GP Ibα subunit could bind to actin-binding protein in vitro(22.Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we focused on truncations in the cytoplasmic domain of the GP Ibα subunit of the complex. Stop codons were introduced into the cDNA for GP Ibα by site-directed mutagenesis at Gln-545, Ser-559, Trp-570, Gln-591, or Tyr-605. Fig. 1 illustrates the resulting truncated forms of GP Ibα: m545, m559, m570, m591, and m605. Truncated forms of GP Ibα were expressed in CHO cells or melanoma cells along with full-length GP Ibα and GP IX. We have shown previously that full-length GP Ibα associates with the other components of the GP Ib-IX complex and is inserted into the membrane of these cultured cells(21.López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, analysis of the cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 2) and examination by immunofluorescence (data not shown) revealed that each of the truncated forms of GP Ibα was also inserted into the membranes of these cells. In order to be able to compare the function of the various forms of GP Ib-IX, cells were sorted by FACS analysis until populations of cells expressing comparable amounts of the various forms of GP Ib-IX in their membranes were obtained (Fig. 2).Figure 2Expression of truncated forms of GP Ib-IX on the surface of transfected CHO cells. CHO cells (5 × 105/sample) transfected with GP Ib-IX constructs encoding either full-length GP Ibα (panel A) or truncated forms (panels B-F) were labeled with 5 μg/ml FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody AN51 (against GP Ibα) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Solid lines represent the samples indicated, while broken lines represent a negative control (CHO cells transfected only with GP Ibα and GP IX constructs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the truncated forms of GP Ibα could associate with the cytoskeleton, transfected CHO cells were lysed with Triton X-100 and the insoluble cytoskeletal proteins isolated by centrifugation as described previously(21.López J.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GP Ibα was detected on Western blots. As shown in Fig. 3, full-length GP Ibα was recovered with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal pellet, as was GP Ibα in which the carboxyl-terminal 6 (m605) or 20 (m591) amino acids were missing. In contrast, GP Ibα lacking 41 (m570), 52 (m559), or 66 (m545) amino acids was present primarily in the detergent-soluble fraction and therefore not associated with the cytoskeleton. Transfected cells were also analyzed by dual-label immunofluorescence to determine whether expressed GP Ib-IX colocalized with the cells' endogenous actin-binding protein. The results provided further evidence that truncated GP Ibα lacking 41 or more carboxyl-terminal amino acids did not associate with actin-binding protein while GP Ibα lacking 20 COOH-terminal amino acids or less did (data not shown). To determine whether the COOH-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα was necessary for association of the other components of the GP Ib-IX complex with the cytoskeletal fraction, detergent-insoluble and -soluble fractions from CHO cells expressing GP Ib-IX that contained either full-length GP Ibα or the truncated m559 form (lacking 52 amino acids) were analyzed on Western blots using polyclonal antibodies that recognizes all three subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex. Fig. 4 shows that release of GP Ibα from the detergent-insoluble fraction was accompanied by release of the other two components of the GP Ib-IX complex. Although these results do not exclude the possibility that GP Ibα or GP IX may play a role in mediating the interaction of the GP Ib-IX complex with the cytoskeleton in the intact cell, they show that the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα is absolutely required for this interaction. To determine whether the truncation of GP Ibα that prevented its association with the cytoskeleton had an effect on its incorporation into the GP Ib-IX complex, detergent-insoluble and -soluble fractions from cells expressing full-length or truncated forms of GP Ibα were analyzed on SDS gels in the presence and absence of reducing agent; like full-length GP Ibα in the cytoskeletal fractions, truncated forms of GP Ibα in the detergent-soluble fractions migrated higher in the absence of reducing agent than in the presence (data not shown) indicating that the truncated form of GP Ibα that was unable to associate with the cytoskeleton was still disulfide-linked to the β-subunit of GP Ib. Since GP IX associates with GP Ibα, not GP Ibα(35.Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assume that it also remained a part of the glycoprotein complex when the GP Ibα cytoplasmic domain was truncated. FACS analysis with SZ1, a complex specific antibody(5.Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), provided further evidence that truncated GP Ib-X was present in the membrane in the form of a complex (data not shown). Although purified GP Ib or fragments derived from this protein can bind von Willebrand factor in in vitro assays(36.Andrews R.K. Booth W.J. Gorman J.J. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8317-8326Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37.Murata M. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that association of the cytoplasmic domain of this receptor with the cytoskeleton might modulate the ability of the intact protein to bind ligand in an intact cell system(38.Fox J.E.B. Verstraete M. Vermylen J. Lijnen R. Arnout J. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. International Society on Haemostasis and Thrombosis and Leuven University Press, Leuven, Belgium1987: 175-225Google Scholar). To determine whether the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα regulates the ability of GP Ib-IX to bind its adhesive ligand, CHO cells expressing GP Ib-IX that contained the entire cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα (Fig. 5, panel A) or those expressing GP Ib-IX in which its COOH-terminal 52 amino acids were missing (m559) (Fig. 5, panel B) were incubated with von Willebrand factor and examined by flow cytometry. In platelets, GP Ibα cannot bind von Willebrand factor unless a modulator, such as ristocetin or botrocetin, is present(39.Kao K.J. Pizzo S.V. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40.Brinkhous K.M. Read M.S. Blood. 1980; 55: 517-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with platelets, binding of von Willebrand factor to the GP Ib-IX complex in transfected cells also requires the presence of ristocetin (21.López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or botrocetin (compare the solid and dotted lines in Fig. 5). Comparison of the botrocetin-dependent binding to cells expressing full-length or truncated GP Ib-IX showed that von Willebrand factor was able to bind to both forms of the receptor (Fig. 5). To determine whether the binding affinity of von Willebrand factor to the GP Ib-IX receptor was affected by truncation of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain, melanoma cells transfected with GP Ib-IX containing either full-length GP Ibα (Fig. 6, panel A) or m545 (Fig. 6, panel B) were incubated with 125I-labeled von Willebrand factor and the binding of von Willebrand factor measured. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring binding of 125I-labeled von Willebrand factor to non-GP Ib-IX-expressing cells. Preliminary experiments using excess unlabeled von Willebrand factor to determine nonspecific binding gave comparable results (data not shown). The specific binding could be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the von Willebrand factor binding site on GP Ibα (data not shown). Binding of von Willebrand factor to cells expressing both full-length GP Ibα or m545 was saturable (Fig. 6, upper panels). While the binding capacity for cells expressing m545 was slightly higher than that of cells expressing normal GP Ibα, this was due to a higher number of receptors on the surface of the m545 cells. The Scatchard analysis of the binding curves detected a single class of binding sites (Fig. 6, A and B, lower panels). The affinity of von Willebrand factor for receptor was virtually identical for normal GP Ibα and m545. These results demonstrate that even when the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα is truncated and the GP Ib-IX complex is not associated with the cytoskeleton, the complex is still capable of binding ligand with the same affinity as full-length cytoskeleton-associated receptor. To determine whether the association of GP Ib-IX with the cytoskeleton is important in directing ligand-induced transmembrane signaling, the way in which transfected cells spread following GP Ib-IX-induced adhesion to von Willebrand factor-coated slides was studied. Cells expressing either full-length GP Ib-IX or the m559 truncation were seeded on von Willebrand factor-coated chamber slides and incubated at 37°C for 2 h in the presence or absence of botrocetin. The cells were examined by phase microscopy; in each chamber 300 cells were examined and the number of cells that were adherent and spreading recorded (Table 1). The cells were subsequently fixed, stained for GP Ib-IX, and the morphology of the adherent cells determined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 7). Nontransfected cells failed to adhere to von Willebrand factor-coated slides whether botrocetin was present or not (data not shown). In the absence of botrocetin, only a few of the transfected cells adhered to the slides; the few that did adhere remained round and failed to spread (Table 1; Fig. 7, panels A and C). In contrast, if botrocetin was present transfected cells adhered to the von Willebrand factor-coated slides (Table 1); adhesion occurred whether the GP Ib-IX complex contained a truncated cytoplasmic domain or not. In both cases adhesion resulted in transmembrane signaling as shown by the fact that the adherent cells extended pseudopodia and spread over the von Willebrand-factor coated surface (Table 1 and Fig. 7, panels B and D). However, examination of the morphology of the spreading cells revealed marked differences in the cells expressing full-le"

In contrast to wild-type Ha-Ras, which binds to membranes and induces meiosis when microinjected into oocytes, a nonpalmitoylated but farnesylated and methylated mutant mislocalizes to the cytosol and fails to promote maturation. This lack of responsiveness correlates with the inability of the mutant to induce phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and maturation promoting factor, which are both strongly activated by wild-type Ha-Ras. Costimulation of oocytes with insulin increases their responsiveness to Ras and partially rescues the biological activity of the palmitoylation-resistant mutant. However, 25-50 times higher doses of mutant were required to elicit responses equivalent to wild-type Ha-Ras. These results suggest that palmitoylation and membrane association of Ha-Ras is necessary for efficient activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in vivo and are consistent with a biochemical function for Ras as a membrane targeting signal for downstream effectors in this pathway. Ras proteins serve as critical relays in signal transduction pathways that control growth and differentiation and must undergo posttranslational modifications before they become functional.

INTRODUCTIONThe small guanosine nucleotide binding proteins of the ras gene superfamily act as molecular switches in the transduction of many extracellular signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus and are involved in a variety of cellular processes from mitosis and differentiation to apoptosis(1.Hersowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 2.Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Moreover, activating mutations in ras genes have been implicated in malignant transformation in mammals(3.Lowry D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Ras proteins are synthesized as cytosolic precursors and must undergo posttranslational modifications at their C termini before they become biologically functional. These modifications include farnesylation at a cysteine residue located four residues from the C terminus, followed by removal of the C-terminal tripeptide and methylation of the newly exposed C terminus(4.Schafer W.R. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 30: 206-237Google Scholar). There is general agreement that farnesylation of Ras is indispensable for its biological functions in vivo. Yeast cells in which farnesylation of Ras is suppressed by pharmacological agents or by mutation are not viable(5.Deschenes R.J. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6.Schafer W.R. Trueblood C.E. Yang C.-C. Mayer M.P. Rosenberg S. Poulter C.D. Kim S.-H Rine J.

A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Likewise, oncogenic mammalian Ras proteins that are not farnesylated are completely nontransforming(8.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 9.Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. Bourne J.R. Solski P.A. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Since prenylated Ras proteins are predominantly localized to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, whereas the nonprenylated forms are cytosolic, prenylation of Ras has been implicated in membrane targeting where it interacts with other components of the signal transduction pathway(4.Schafer W.R. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 30: 206-237Google Scholar, 10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J.

Science. 1994; 264: 1413-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Some Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, N-Ras, Ras2) are further lipidated by palmitoylation at one or two cysteines near the farnesylated C terminus (7.Bhattacharya S. Chen L. Broach J.R. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Although this modification appears to be required for high affinity binding of prenylated Ras to the plasma membrane, its biological significance remains unclear. Interestingly palmitoylation is dynamic(16.Magee A.I. Gutierrez L. McKay I.A. Marshall C.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of regulation by reversible membrane-to-cytosol translocations as has been documented in the case of the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins(17.Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In yeast, the biological significance of Ras2 palmitoylation has been explored in detail(7.Bhattacharya S. Chen L. Broach J.R. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Yeast Ras2 mutants, which are farnesylated but not palmitoylated, are not localized to the plasma membrane, and a single copy of a palmitoylation-defective RAS2 gene confers cell viability(7.Bhattacharya S. Chen L. Broach J.R. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although such mutants showed no marked growth phenotype, they fail to induce a transient increase in intracellular cAMP in response to glucose addition, suggesting that nonpalmitoylated Ras2 is unable to activate adenylate cyclase, its main downstream effector in the glucose signaling pathway in yeast. In mammalian systems, earlier studies using cell lines overexpressing oncogenic Ras revealed that mutation of the palmitoylation sites of Ha-Ras caused a loss of membrane localization(8.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). However, the mislocalized protein retains the ability to cause cell transformation as long as it is farnesylated(8.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Analogous observations have been made for the polybasic domain in the hypervariable region of the K-Ras protein, which led to the interpretation that plasma membrane localization is not essential for the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras(10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). This view has been challenged recently by similar transfection studies where oncogenic K-Ras was expressed at near-physiological levels in NIH-3T3 cells. The study revealed that the polybasic domain of K-Ras confers targeting to the plasma membrane and is absolutely required for cell transformation(18.Jackson J.H. Li J.W. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12730-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The discrepancies were believed to result from different susceptibilities of particular cell clones to transformation (18.Jackson J.H. Li J.W. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12730-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).In order to clarify the functional significance of Ha-Ras palmitoylation and membrane targeting for the activation of signal transduction cascades and biological responses in vivo, we have used Xenopus laevis oocytes as an experimental system. Oocytes are naturally arrested at the G2-M boundary of the first meiotic cell division. When microinjected with oncogenic Ha-Ras protein, oocytes resume meiotic maturation (19.Birchmeier C. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 615-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in a process that is accompanied by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMPFmaturation promoting factorWT Ha-Rasnononcogenic human Ha-Ras (Gly-12) with wild-type C terminusHa-Ras 181/4Snononcogenic human Ha-Ras (Gly-12) with cysteine residues 181 and 184 mutated to serineFPPfarnesyl pyrophosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdown. cascade(20.Hattori S.

Here we describe a detailed dose-response study comparing biological properties of palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated forms of Ha-Ras in Xenopus oocytes. Our results suggest an important role of Ha-Ras palmitoylation for signaling functions in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRas ProteinsRecombinant baculovirus vectors expressing Glu-Glu-tagged wild-type (WT) human Ha-Ras and a mutant in which both palmitoylation sites (cysteine residues 181 and 184) have been mutated to serine (181/4S) have been obtained as a generous gift from E. Porfiri and J. F. Hancock (Onyx Pharmaceuticals). Non-lipidated proteins were affinity-purified from the aqueous phase of Triton X-114-partitioned Sf9 cell lysates using anti Glu-Glu mAb (kindly supplied by E. Porfiri) immobilized on protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) according to the published procedure(26.Porfiri E. Evans T. Bollag G. Clark R. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ras protein concentrations were determined by [3H]GTP binding using nitrocellulose filter binding assays as described previously (27.McGeady P. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26347-26351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or by incorporation of [3H]FPP catalyzed by recombinant protein farnesyltransferase(28.Chen W.J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, Ha-Ras samples (10-30 pmol) were incubated for 3 h at 30°C with 5 pmol of recombinant protein farnesyltransferase in 30 μl of buffer containing 30 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ZnCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 30 μM [3H]FPP (DuPont NEN, 400 mCi/mmol). Reactions were terminated by boiling samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gels (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The amount of [3H]farnesyl incorporated into Ras proteins was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of excised Ha-Ras bands(30.Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar).Purified Ha-Ras proteins were loaded with GTPγS by incubation in buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10-30 μM Ras, and 250 μM GTPγS (Sigma) for 20 min at 30°C. Nucleotide exchange was stopped on ice by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 25 mM, and free nucleotides were removed by repeated cycles of ultrafiltration in a Centricon-10 device (Amicon) as described previously(31.Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A.F. Schaber M.D. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Ras proteins were finally concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml and stored at −80°C in small aliquots in Ras buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol).Oocyte MicroinjectionOocytes were isolated from X. laevis females (purchased from Nasco or Xenopus I) that did not receive priming with gonadotropin. Ovaries were surgically removed from animals anesthetized with 0.25% MS-222 (Sigma), and oocytes were defoliculated by treatment with type I collagenase (Sigma). Stage VI oocytes were cultured in Barth medium (30.Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar) at 18-20°C and allowed to recover overnight before microinjection. In experiments where oocytes were costimulated with Ha-Ras and suboptimal doses of insulin, the sensitivity of oocytes to insulin was determined during this overnight period, and an insulin concentration was chosen for costimulation experiments that did not induce significant maturation after overnight incubation (typically 0.25-5 μM).Ras proteins were diluted in Ras buffer, and 50 nl was microinjected into the cytoplasm. Oocytes were kept in Barth medium and scored for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) by the appearance of a white spot on the animal hemisphere. For biochemical analysis, 5-10 oocytes/group were randomly harvested and homogenized in 20 μl/oocyte of ice-cold lysis buffer (60 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The crude lysates were either processed immediately or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Metabolic LabelingFarnesylation of Ha-Ras in oocytes was analyzed by coinjecting 1 pmol of Ras with 1 pmol of [3H]FPP (15 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 2.5 or 24 h, groups of oocytes were homogenized in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and Ras was immunoprecipitated from cleared extracts using anti-Glu-Glu antibody following established procedures(30.Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography on preflashed films (Kodak XAR) after treating the gels with 2,5-diphenyloxazole (Sigma)(32.Magee A.I. Wootton J. De Bony J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Methylation was analyzed by incubating oocytes injected with 1 pmol of Ras in Barth medium supplemented with 0.4 mCi/ml of [methyl-3H]methionine (DuPont NEN, 70 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 5 h or overnight, groups of oocytes were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Ras was immunoprecipitated from cleared extracts and loaded onto 15% polyacrylamide gels, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized as described above. To assess palmitoylation in vivo, oocytes microinjected with 1 pmol of Ha-Ras were cultured in “cold” medium for 4 h before healthy oocytes were transferred to Barth medium containing 2 mCi/ml of [3H]palmitic acid (DuPont NEN, 60 Ci/mmol). 30 min after transfer, groups of oocytes were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated, and radioactivity was detected as described above.Triton X-114 Partitioning and Oocyte FractionationCrude oocyte lysate (10 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of 1% Triton X-114 in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and the mixture was allowed to sit on ice for 10 min with occasional mixing. After removing insoluble debris by centrifugation, the cleared lysates were phase-separated into aqueous and detergent phases as described previously(33.Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Both phases were adjusted to 1% Triton X-114 and 100 μl final volume, and of each sample was subjected to immunoblotting analysis as described below. Oocytes were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane components using standard procedures(30.Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was extracted with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and equal portions of cytosolic and membrane fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting.Immunoblotting StudiesProteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, Amersham Corp.) for 2 h at 100 V using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk or 2% bovine serum albumin (phosphotyrosine blots) in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20) and probed for 2 h with antibody against phosphotyrosine (PY 20) at 2 μg/ml, anti-Ras mAb at 0.25 μg/ml, anti-MAPK (anti-ERK2) mAb at 100 ng/ml (all from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or anti-Glu-Glu mAb (gift from E. Porfiri) at 100 ng/ml diluted in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive bands were revealed with peroxidase-labeled sheep antibody against mouse IgG using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.).Kinase AssaysKinase activities were measured in cleared extracts after removing insoluble debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. MAPK activity was measured using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate(34.Ahn N.G. Weiel J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of oocyte extracts (0.25 oocyte equivalent) were incubated for 20 min at 30°C in a final volume of 30 μl containing 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 9 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, 0.3-0.6 Ci/mmol), 1 mM Na3VO4, 30 μM Calmidazolium (Sigma), and 2 μM heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 0.34 mg/ml myelin basic protein. Assays were stopped by spotting 25 μl of the reaction mixture onto P-81 cellulose phosphate paper (Life Technologies, Inc.). After washing 5 times with 150 mM phosphoric acid and once with ethanol, the papers were dried, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The activity of MPF was measured by incubating oocyte extracts with 1 mg/ml of histones (Sigma type III-S from calf thymus) as substrate in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM mercaptoethanol, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol), and 2 μM heat stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. After incubation for 15 min at 30°C, reactions were terminated by the addition of one-quarter volume of 5 × SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed, dried, and developed by autoradiography. Histone phosphorylation was quantified after excision of the H1 histone band from the gel followed by scintillation counting.RESULTSLike progesterone, the physiological stimulus for oocyte maturation, oncogenic Ha-Ras (Val-12), has been shown to activate the MAPK cascade (21.Pomerance M. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Pierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16155-16160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 122: 645-652Google Scholar) and to induce maturation in Xenopus oocytes(19.Birchmeier C. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 615-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To analyze the significance of Ha-Ras palmitoylation for biological activity and activation of downstream effectors in vivo, GTPγS-bound forms of WT Ha-Ras and the mutant 181/4S in which the palmitoylated cysteines have been substituted with serine were microinjected into oocytes. Epitope-tagged, nononcogenic (Gly-12) WT Ha-Ras and its 181/4S mutant were purified in the nonprocessed form from Sf9 cells and were activated by loading with GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue. In vitro farnesylation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis resulted in complete conversion of WT and mutant Ras proteins into the processed, faster migrating form(10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 27.McGeady P. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26347-26351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and approximately 1 mol of [3H]farnesyl/mol of Ras (estimated by [3H]GTP binding) was incorporated into both proteins (data not shown). Thus, the C-terminal prenylation sequence, which is indispensable for farnesylation and subsequent processing steps, is functional in these Ras preparations.Fig. 1 shows that mutation of cysteines 181 and 184 prevents palmitoylation and membrane localization but does not affect farnesylation, C-terminal proteolysis, and methylation of Ha-Ras in Xenopus oocytes. [3H]FPP, the farnesyl donor for Ha-Ras prenylation in Xenopus oocytes(35.Kim R. Rine J. Kim S.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5945-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), is readily incorporated into microinjected Ha-Ras proteins (Fig. 1A), indicating that WT and mutant Ha-Ras are comparably good substrates for the protein farnesyltransferase present in Xenopus oocytes. Similarly, WT Ha-Ras and 181/4S incorporate alkali-labile [methyl-3H]methionine with comparable kinetics (Fig. 1B), indicating that both proteins are equally proteolyzed and carboxymethylated in oocytes. Farnesylation is also accompanied by an increase in electrophoretic mobility and hydrophobicity, which can be monitored by Triton X-114 phase-partitioning(10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 33.Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of phase-partitioned oocytes microinjected with WT Ha-Ras or 181/4S shows that both proteins undergo farnesylation with comparable kinetics (Fig. 1C). Both proteins show a time-dependent shift from the hydrophilic, slower migrating, microinjected form to the more hydrophobic, faster migrating form with a half-life of about 2.5-5 h. After 7.5 h, farnesylation is essentially complete, and WT Ha-Ras and 181/4S are stable under these conditions for at least 24 h. Thus, as in the case of ras-transfected COS cells(10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), mutation of the Ha-Ras palmitoylation sites does not noticeably affect the other processing steps in Xenopus oocytes. When oocytes microinjected with WT Ha-Ras or 181/4S were labeled with [3H]palmitate, WT but not mutant Ha-Ras incorporated palmitate (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the same cysteine residues of Ha-Ras are palmitoylated in Xenopus oocytes as those identified in COS cells(10.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Thus, the processing enzymes present in Xenopus oocytes are functionally comparable with their mammalian counterparts. Analysis of the cellular localization of WT Ha-Ras or 181/4S by oocyte fractionation shows that 7.5 h after microinjection, about 80% of WT Ha-Ras is associated with the membrane compartment, whereas 181/4S remains entirely cytosolic (Fig. 1E). This pattern did not change significantly for the subsequent 24-h incubation period (not shown), suggesting that the cellular distribution has reached steady state.A typical time-course of oocyte maturation following microinjection of 1 pmol of WT Ha-Ras or palmitoylation-site mutant 181/4S is shown in Fig. 2. While WT Ha-Ras induces near 100% maturation after a 24-h incubation period, no significant GVBD was detected in oocytes injected with 181/4S after 48 h. This lack of biologic activity of 181/4S could not be overcome by larger doses (up to 2.5 pmol) and extended culture periods (up to 72 h) in several experiments using oocytes from different frogs.Figure 2Kinetics of oocyte maturation induced by WT Ha-Ras and the 181/4S mutant. Stage VI oocytes were either treated with progesterone (10 μM) as a positive control or microinjected with 1 pmol of WT Ha-Ras, nonpalmitoylated mutant 181/4S, or buffer alone and incubated in Barth medium at 18-20°C. After the indicated time periods, oocytes were monitored for GVBD.

Thus, we investigated whether the inability of Ha-Ras 181/4S to induce oocyte maturation was associated with a lack of activation of components of the MAPK cascade. Fig. 3 shows that MAPK activity in extracts from oocytes injected with WT Ha-Ras is increased by 4-8-fold and reaches levels comparable with those measured in progesterone-treated oocytes. In marked contrast, MAPK activity in oocytes injected with 181/4S remained at control levels. MAPK activation was also evident in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots revealing a prominent band of ~42 kDa in WT-injected or progesterone-treated oocyte extracts, which is absent in 181/4S- or buffer-injected cells (Fig. 3B). This tyrosine phosphorylation was paralleled by the characteristic electrophoretic mobility shift of MAPK in anti-ERK2 immunoblots (Fig. 3C). Oncogenic Ha-Ras has also been shown to induce activation of MPF(23.Barrett C.B. Schroetke R.M. Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell.

Striated and smooth muscle α-tropomyosins differ by the regions encoded by exons 2 and 9. Unacetylated smooth tropomyosin expressed in Escherichia coli binds actin with high affinity, whereas unacetylated striated tropomyosin requires troponin, found only in striated muscle, for strong actin binding. The residues encoded by exon 9 cause these differences (Cho, Y.-J., and Hitchcock-DeGregori, S. E.(1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 10153-10157). We mapped the functional domains encoded by the α-tropomyosin exon 9a (striated muscle-specific) and 9d (constitutively expressed), by measuring actin binding and regulation of the actomyosin MgATPase by tropomyosin exon 9 chimeras and truncation mutants expressed in E. coli. We have shown that: 1) the carboxyl-terminal nine residues define the actin affinity of unacetylated tropomyosin; 2) in the presence of Ca2+, the entire exon 9a is required for troponin to promote fully high affinity actin binding; 3) the first 18 residues encoded by exon 9a are critical for the interaction of troponin with tropomyosin on the thin filament, even in the absence of Ca2+. The results give new insight into the structural requirements of tropomyosin for thin filament assembly and regulatory function.

The results give new insight into the structural requirements of tropomyosin for thin filament assembly and regulatory function. Tropomyosin (TM) ( 1The abbreviations used are: TMtropomyosinTntroponinDTTdithiothreitol.) is an actin binding protein, first discovered in skeletal muscle(1Bailey K. Biochem. J. 1948; 43: 2791-2792Google Scholar), and now known to be present in virtually all eukaryotic cells. Tropomyosins are a family of highly conserved, coiled-coil proteins in which diversity is primarily accomplished through the use of alternative promoters and alternative RNA splicing of the transcripts of a small number of genes (three to four in vertebrates; reviewed in (2Lees-Miller J. Helfman D. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). tropomyosin troponin dithiothreitol. Tropomyosins are expressed in developmental and tissue-specific patterns. Certain isoforms are found in more than one cell type and tissue, although they may have different localizations within cells (e.g.(3Lin J.J.-C. Hegmann T.E. Lin J.L.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). Other TM isoforms are specific, notably those expressed in striated and smooth muscles (striated and β, smooth) and the specific brain α-TM isoforms ((4Ruiz-Opazo N. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4755-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (5Lees-Miller J.P. Goodwin L.O. Helfman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1729-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); reviewed in (2Lees-Miller J. Helfman D. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). These isoforms contain uniquely-expressed exons that presumably encode domains of the protein involved in isoform-specific function. The functions of TM are best understood from the extensive in vitro biochemical and biophysical analysis since the protein's discovery. Two fundamental functions that define TMs are cooperative binding to F-actin (6Yang Y.Z. Korn E.D. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7137-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cooperative inhibition or activation of the actomyosin MgATPase(7Bremel R.D. Murray J.M. Weber A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1973; 37: 267-275Crossref Google Scholar). Tropomyosin isoforms differ in these assays (reviewed in (8Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)), and their activities are influenced by other cytoskeletal proteins that interact directly or indirectly with TM (caldesmon, troponin (Tn), and myosin). The cellular function of TM is best understood in striated muscles where, through interaction with Tn, it regulates contraction in a Ca2+-dependent manner (reviewed in (9Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 10Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar)). Biochemical and structural studies by numerous investigators have led to the following model of the thin filament. Tropomyosin molecules are aligned end-to-end (NH2 terminus to COOH terminus) in the grooves of the helical actin filament(12O'Brien E.J. Bennett P.M. Hanson J. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1971; 261: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Milligan R.A. Whittaker M. Safer D. Nature. 1990; 348: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Troponin is bound to TM along the COOH-terminal third of the molecule (14Flicker P.F. Phillips G.N. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Troponin I, TnC, and the COOH terminus of TnT are positioned near Cys-190 of TM. The elongated NH2 terminus of TnT extends toward the COOH terminus of TM to the beginning of the next TM along the actin filament. Troponin greatly increases the affinity of TM for actin in the presence of Ca2+, with a further increase upon removal of Ca2+(16Wegner A. Walsh T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on binding studies with TM and Tn peptides, Mak and Smillie (17Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) proposed that the Tn-TM interaction in the region of Cys-190 is Ca2+-sensitive (stronger in the absence of Ca2+), whereas that at the COOH terminus and the overlap region is Ca2+-independent (strong both in the presence and absence of Ca2+). Substantial evidence has since supported this model. The Ca2+-independent TnT binding site on TM includes the COOH-terminal 27 amino acids encoded by the striated muscle-specific exon 9a, implying a specific role in Tn-dependent regulatory function. Exon 9a is uniquely expressed in the striated isoform whereas the COOH-terminal coding exon of most other α-TM isoforms, is exon 9d (18Wieczorek D.F. Smith C.W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar; reviewed in (2Lees-Miller J. Helfman D. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). The functional differences between these 284 residue α-TMs are primarily attributable to the exon 9-encoded COOH terminus(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unacetylated striated α-TM expressed in Escherichia coli binds poorly to F-actin because the NH2-terminal Met is unacetylated (20Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol.

Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) whereas TMs encoded by cDNAs containing exon 9d (smooth and TM2, a non-muscle isoform) bind well(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, Tn greatly increases the affinity of the unacetylated striated TM for actin but has little effect on unacetylated smooth TM or TM2(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar differences have been reported between unacetylated smooth and striated β-TMs(23Bartegi A. Ferraz C. Fattoum A. Sri-Widada J. Heitz F. Kassab R. Liautard J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Novy R.E. Liu L.-F. Lin C.-S. Helfman D.M. Lin J.J.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present work we have defined the functional domains encoded by α-TM exons 9a and 9d (two of the four COOH-terminal α-TM exons) by making a series of TM chimeras and truncation mutants. Unacetylated TMs expressed in E. coli offer a powerful system for looking at gain or loss of TM functions: actin affinity and Ca2+-independent interaction with Tn on the actin filament. We have shown that: 1) the actin affinity of unacetylated TM is defined by the COOH-terminal nine amino acids; 2) the entire striated-specific exon 9a is required for Tn to promote fully high affinity binding of TM to actin in the presence of Ca2+; and 3) the first 18 residues encoded by exon 9a are critical for the interaction of Tn with TM on the thin filament, even in the absence of Ca2+. The results, together with previous work from our laboratory and others, indicate that the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of TM are primary functional determinants. The results are discussed in terms of the structural requirements of TM for regulatory function with Tn. Portions of this work have been reported in a preliminary form (25Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 401aGoogle Scholar). General recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the supplier. Rat striated (pUC18/TM9a) and rat smooth (pBR322/SMTM) muscle α-TM cDNA clones were the gift of B. Nadal-Ginard(4Ruiz-Opazo N. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4755-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coding regions differ only in exons 2 and 9 corresponding to codons 39-80 and codons 258-284, respectively, with codon number 1 defined as the ATG immediately following the NcoI cleavage site. To facilitate a subsequent cloning step, both striated and smooth cDNAs were subcloned into pUC119, destroying the vector's SmaI site (Fig. 1A). In order to accomplish this, TM9a cDNA was digested with EcoRI. The 1212-base pair fragment was isolated from an agarose gel, after which the 5′ overhang was filled in using Klenow. This blunt fragment was ligated to the SmaI site of pUC119 resulting in the vector, pUC119/TM9a. The smooth tropomyosin cDNA was digested with PstI. The 1078-base pair fragment was isolated from an agarose gel, after which the 3′ overhangs were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase. This blunt fragment was ligated to the SmaI site of pUC119 resulting in the vector, pUC119/SMTM. The NcoI-SmaI fragment from pUC119/TM9a containing TM codons 1-237 was ligated to the NcoI-SmaI fragment from pUC119/SMTM containing TM codons 238-284. The resulting chimera is pUC119/TM9d. To construct TMs which contain chimeric ninth exons (TM9a/9d, TM9d/9a), pUC119/TM9a and pUC119/TM9d were digested with AvaII (Fig. 1B). The fragments containing TM codons 1-275 were further digested with EcoRI, and the fragments containing TM codons 276-284 were further digested with BamHI. The fragments containing TM codons 1-275 and TM codons 276-284 of pUC119/TM9a and pUC119/TM9d were exchanged and then ligated with pUC119 which had been linearized with EcoRI and BamHI. The result is pUC119/TM9a/9d and pUC119/TM9d/9a. Truncation mutants were constructed by deleting the cDNA coding for the carboxyl-terminal 9 residues of TM (Fig. 1C). This was accomplished by filling in the 5′ overhang of the AvaII fragment isolated from pUC119/TM9a using Klenow and ligating it to a linker (TGATAAGGATCCTTATCA) containing termination codons (underlined) followed by a BamHI site (in italics). After digestion with NcoI and BamHI, the fragment was ligated to the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET11d expression vector (27Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) resulting in pET11d/TM9a/. pUC119/TM9d was treated in the same manner resulting in pET11d/TM9d/. The NcoI-BamHI fragments of pUC119/TM9a, pUC119/TM9d, pUC119/TM9d/9a, and pUC119/TM9a/9d were ligated to the NcoI and BamHI sites of the expression vector, pET11d. The cDNAs for all six TM variants in pET11d were expressed in E. coli (BL21{DE3}pLysS for TM9a or BL21{DE3} for the other TM variants)(27Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The TMs were purified from 2 liters of cells (yield = 20-30 mg/liter) as described previously (20Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except the (NH4)2SO4 fractionation was 35-70% saturation instead of 35-60%. Actin was purified from acetone powder of pectoral muscle of White Leghorn chickens according to (28Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Mandala S. Sachs G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12573-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except actin was polymerized by addition of KCl and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 and 0.7 mM, respectively, and incubated at 37°C for 10 min before cooling slowly to room temperature. Troponin was purified from pectoral muscle pulp of White Leghorn chickens obtained from Dr. J. Fagan (Rutgers University, NJ) using the procedure of Potter (29Potter J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) except, alternate Triton X-100 extractions included the following protease inhibitors: 2 mM E64, 1 mg/ml leupeptin; 2 mM 4-amidinophenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 M benzamidine. Also, the (NH4)2SO4 crude Tn pellet was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) then purified using ion exchange (DE52) column chromatography with a 0-0.6 M NaCl gradient. Chicken pectoral muscle myosin was isolated using the method of Margossian and Lowey(30Margossian S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Recombinant striated α-TM (TM9a) was purified to the point of heat denaturation as described by Fanning et al.(31Fanning A. Wolenski J. Mooseker M. Izant J. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 29: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This method is based on the procedure of Hitchcock-DeGregori and Heald (20Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with two major modifications: 1) the clarified cell extract was subjected to three isoelectric precipitations prior to (NH4)2SO4 fractionation (45-65% saturation instead of 35-70%) and 2) the boiling step was performed in low ionic strength buffer (50 mM instead of 1 M). A sample of the heat stable supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA containing 100 mM NaCl and assayed for the ability to bind actin in the same buffer. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to measure the folding of TM as a function of temperature in 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT(32Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The TM exon 9 variants showed multiple transitions with virtually the same degree of folding at 20°C(33Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The sequence of the COOH-terminal 27 residues has a small effect on the overall thermal stability of TM: the first 18 residues of exon 9a are associated with a slight increase in stability (2°C) whereas the last nine result in a slight decrease (Table 1). These small differences can be understood in terms of changes in the hydrophobicity of the a and d residues of the heptad repeat that forms the interface between the two α-helices of the coiled coil. It has not been possible to relate actin affinity to the thermal stability of these or other recombinant TMs.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Protein concentration was determined by measuring the difference absorption spectrum at 295 nm in 6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 12.5 (where all the tyrosines are ionized), versus 6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6, in a reference beam spectrophotometer(34Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The concentration was calculated assuming a value ϵ295(Tyr) = 2480 M-1 cm-1(35Lehrer S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and 8 Tyr/mol (TM9d, TM9d/, TM9d/9a) or 12 Tyr/mol (TM9a, TM9a/, TM9a/9d). The concentration of the TM used for the standard curve for densitometry was determined using a micro-biuret assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1953; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and confirmed using the above spectrophotometric assay. The concentration of actin, myosin, and Tn was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients (1% at 280 nm) 11.0, 5.3, and 4.5, respectively. Binding of TM to actin was measured by cosedimentation as described(37Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the centrifugation was for 25 min at 60,000 rpm in a Beckman model TL-100 ultracentrifuge in a TLA-100 rotor. Tropomyosin and Tn (2 μM) were cosedimented with actin (5 μM) at 25°C in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM CaCl2 or 0.2 mM EGTA. The pellets and supernatants were analyzed electrophoretically on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels(38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein was visualized using Coomassie Blue and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics model 300A computing densitometer(21Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of free TM in the supernatant was determined using a standard curve prepared with known amounts of recombinant smooth α-TM. Bovine serum albumin was included in the sample buffer as an internal loading standard to correct for variations in sample loading. Apparent binding constants (Kapp) and Hill coefficients (αH) were determined using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) to fit the data to the equation: v=n[TM ]αH⋅KappαH/1+[TM ]αH⋅KappαH(Eq. 1) The actomyosin MgATPase was measured as a function of TM concentration using 2.4 μM actin, 0.6 μM myosin, 0-0.6 μM TM, 1 μM Tn in 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MgATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM EGTA, or 0.2 mM CaCl2. Assays, with a final volume of 75 μl, were carried out in 96-well microtiter dishes at 28°C in a thermoequilibrated Molecular Devices ThermoMax microtiter plate reader. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MgATP to a final concentration of 5 mM and terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 13.4% SDS, 0.12 M EDTA after 15 min. The amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined colorimetrically according to White (39White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the plates were read in a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microtiter plate reader with a 650-nm filter. Time courses had been carried out previously to show that phosphate liberation was linear. The assays were single point determinations. Specific activity is expressed as micromole of Pi/mg of myosin/min. The isoform-specific differences in actin affinity and interaction with Tn of recombinant, unacetylated 284 residue α-TMs can be primarily attributed to differences in residues 258-287, encoded by exon 9(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To investigate the regions encoded by exons 9a and 9d (18; reviewed in (2Lees-Miller J. Helfman D. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)) that give rise to the isoform-specific function, we made a series of chimeras and deletion mutants, illustrated in Fig. 2A, in which the last nine residues have been exchanged or deleted. The sequences of the variants are identical except for the residues encoded by the two ninth exons, shown in Fig. 2B. The deletion mutant TM9a/ is similar to carboxypeptidase-digested TM in which the last 11 residues are removed enzymatically. These six variants were expressed in E. coli as unacetylated TMs which offer the opportunity to study gain or loss of TM-specific functions: high affinity actin binding, the ability of Tn to increase the affinity of TM for actin, and Ca2+ regulation of the actomyosin ATPase with Tn. The actin affinity of the TM exon 9 variants was measured by cosedimentation (Fig. 3, Table 2; 21, 37). TM9a (striated α-TM) expressed in E. coli bound poorly to actin, as previously reported, due to the unacetylated NH2 terminus(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, TM9d (α-TM2, a non-muscle isoform) bound well, as do other TMs containing this COOH-terminal sequence(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Novy R.E. Liu L.-F. Lin C.-S. Helfman D.M. Lin J.J.-C. Biochim. Biophys.

TM9a/9d, a chimera containing the last nine residues encoded by exon 9d, bound to actin with the same affinity as TM9d whereas TM9d/9a, with the last nine residues encoded by exon 9a, bound as weakly as did TM9a. The actin affinity of the TMs lacking the COOH-terminal nine residues (TM9a/ and TM9d/) was too low to measure using this assay. These results clearly show that the last nine residues encoded by exon 9 define the actin affinity of unacetylated recombinant α-TM.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fanning et al.(31Fanning A. Wolenski J. Mooseker M. Izant J. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 29: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that unacetylated striated α-TM purified using a modified method (see “Materials and Methods”) binds actin strongly in the presence of 100 mM KCl. However, we found that unacetylated striated α-TM purified by the Fanning method (31Fanning A. Wolenski J. Mooseker M. Izant J. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 29: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) bound poorly to actin in 100 mM NaCl (Ka < 1 × 105M-1) whereas the same protein purified using the Hitchcock-DeGregori method (20Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bound with measurable affinity (Ka~1 × 106M-1), suggesting that the modified purification method adversely affects TM function. Also, acetylated muscle TM repurified using the Hitchcock-DeGregori method (20Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bound actin with high affinity, indicating that this method does not alter the TM itself. These results confirm that the weaker actin affinity of striated α-TM purified from E. coli is a consequence of the lack of NH2-terminal acetylation and not the purification method(20Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with muscle (acetylated) TM, Tn increases the affinity of unacetylated striated α-TM (TM9a) for actin whereas it has little effect on the affinity of smooth TM or TM9d for actin(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 4A and Table 2 show that the complete exon 9a is required for Tn to result in the maximal increase in actin affinity in the presence of Ca2+. Troponin increased the affinity of TM9a about 100-fold, whereas the increases were 4-fold for TM9a/9d and about 5-10-fold for TM9d/9a, both greater than TM9d (1.5-fold). In the presence of Tn and Ca2+ the TM variants containing the first 18 residues encoded by exon 9a (TM9a, TM9a/9d) bound to actin with lower cooperativity than TM9d (Fig. 4A, Table 2). We infer that both regions encoded by the striated muscle-specific exon 9a are critical for Tn-TM interaction with the actin filament in the presence of Ca2+. The results are consistent with the Mak and Smillie model (17Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) that the COOH terminus is the binding site of Tn on TM in the activated (+Ca2+) state (the Ca2+-independent site). Neither truncation mutant, TM9a/ or TM9d/, bound in the conditions of this assay, implying that a full-length TM is required. With Tn in the absence of Ca2+, the affinity of all TM exon 9 variants was greater, with the exception of TM9d/ (Fig. 4B, Table 2). The increase in affinity was in the order of 10-fold, consistent with our previous measurements(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although certain variants bound too tightly to measure accurately in the conditions of these experiments. TM9a/, whose affinity was too weak to measure in the presence Ca2+, bound well in the absence of Ca2+, as previously reported for carboxypeptidase-treated unacetylated TMs(42Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most interesting, however, is that TM9d/ did not bind to actin, even in the absence of Ca2+ while TM9a/ did. Since the Cys-190 region, which includes the Ca2+-sensitive binding site of Tn on TM (17Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) is identical in all exon 9 variants studied, we expected that Tn-TM interaction in the absence of Ca2+ would be the same in TM9a/ and TM9d/. Clearly, the binding of Tn only to the Cys-190 region of TM is insufficient to assemble Tn-TM on the actin filament, even in the absence of Ca2+. The results suggest that the first 18 residues of exon 9a are important for the increased affinity of Tn-TM for actin in the absence as well as in the presence of Ca2+. The binding constants for TM9a and TM9d reported here are higher than those previously published(19Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The present TMs have been expressed using a different expression system with higher yields and better purity. We have experienced similar measurements of increased affinity in other recombinant TMs. ( 2Y. An and S. E. Hitchcock-DeGregori, unpublished results.) The regulatory function of the TM exon 9 variants was evaluated by measuring their ability to confer calcium-dependent regulation of the actomyosin MgATPase with Tn. All TM variants that bound to actin with Tn inhibited the actomyosin ATPase in a Ca2+-sensitive manner with similar effectiveness (Fig. 5). In contrast, TM9d/, which did not bind to actin in the conditions"

No AChE activity is present in the undifferentiated stem cells, and mRNA protection analyses do not detect AChE mRNA. Commitment to a neuronal differentiation pathway results in increased levels of AChE mRNA, production of a tetrameric form of the enzyme, and secretion of AChE into the culture medium.

No change in the rate of transcription of the Ache gene was detected during the course of differentiation, suggesting that the gene is actively transcribed at very early stages of development. Results suggest that stabilization of a labile mRNA governs the increase in AChE mRNA and gene product.

SPM did not affect discoidal rHDL size or surface charge. Esterification of cholesterol by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) was inhibited in the SPM-containing discoidal rHDL. When the discoidal rHDL of POPC/SPM/UC/apoA-I molar ratio 99.6/0.0/10.2/1.0 were incubated with low density lipoproteins (LDL) and LCAT, SPM transferred spontaneously from the LDL to the rHDL (t½ = 0.8 h) and spherical particles with a POPC/SPM/UC/CE/apoA-I molar ratio of 24.6/4.9/3.6/24.9/1.0 were formed. Depleting the spherical rHDL of SPM head groups by incubation with sphingomyelinase increased the negative charge on the surface, but did not change their size. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated transfers of cholesteryl esters and triglyceride between spherical rHDL and Intralipid were not affected by SPM head group depletion.

For many years SPM was thought only to maintain the structural integrity of membranes, but recent studies have shown that it is also involved in a wide range of metabolic events(1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The SPM molecule comprises a phosphocholine head group and a ceramide backbone with a sphingosine base and an amide-linked acyl chain. The ceramide backbone of SPM plays a regulatory role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis(1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Ceramide also modulates protein phosphorylation and has been implicated as a tumor-suppressor lipid (3Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of SPM on lipoprotein metabolism is poorly understood. It has been reported that the concentration of SPM in the artery wall increases with aging and that it comprises 70-80% of the phospholipids in atherosclerotic lesions(4Barenholz Y. Gatt S. Hawthorn J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 129-177Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SPM may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. The additional finding that the SPM in atherosclerotic lesions is derived from plasma lipoproteins (4Barenholz Y. Gatt S. Hawthorn J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 129-177Google Scholar) emphasizes the importance of understanding how this molecule influences lipoprotein metabolism. sphingomyelin high density lipoprotein(s) low density lipoprotein(s) reconstituted high density lipoproteins phosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine unesterified cholesterol cholesteryl ester(s) apolipoprotein lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase cholesteryl ester transfer protein Tris-buffered saline triglyceride 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; TMA-DPH 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluene sulfonate 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene guanidine hydrochloride. At present little is known about the origin of SPM in lipoproteins. SPM reportedly transfers from cell membranes to pre-β-migrating high density lipoproteins (HDL)(5Kawano M. Miida T. Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5025-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). SPM is also present in discoidal, nascent HDL which are secreted from the rat liver(6Winkler K.E. Marsh J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 979-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the SPM, which enters the plasma compartment as a component of pre-β-migrating HDL and nascent HDL, is subsequently incorporated into mature, spherical HDL. Similarly, little is known of the origins of SPM in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins. It has been reported that the lipoproteins in peripheral lymph are enriched in SPM relative to their plasma counterparts(7Reichl D. Sterchi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that SPM from cell membranes may be incorporated into lipoproteins before they enter the plasma compartment. Given that there are strong Van der Waals interactions between SPM and unesterified cholesterol (UC) (8Kan C.-C. Ruan Z.-s. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7759-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9McIntosh T.J. Simon S.A. Needham D. Huang C.-h. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and that the concentrations of UC and SPM in membranes and lipoproteins change in a coordinated manner (10Pörn M.I. Ares M.P.S. Slotte J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it follows that SPM may participate in the regulation of cholesterol transport and the maintenance of cell cholesterol homeostasis. Evidence for this comes from studies which show that SPM regulates the uptake and intracellular processing of LDL(11Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1741-1752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The additional finding that SPM-containing lipid/apolipoprotein complexes are excellent acceptors of cellular cholesterol (13Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) suggests that SPM may also be involved in the initial step of the reverse cholesterol transport process. Further support for the involvement of SPM in reverse cholesterol transport comes from the observation that [3H]cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts to HDL increases if the cells have been incubated with sphingomyelinase(10Pörn M.I. Ares M.P.S. Slotte J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to better understand the influence of SPM on HDL metabolism. In order to overcome the problems of interpretation which may occur due to the heterogeneity of native HDL, the study has been carried out with well characterized preparations of discoidal and spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL)(14Rye K.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that SPM influences both the structure and function of rHDL. Plasma samples for the isolation of LDL, HDL and apoA-I were donated by the Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital. LDL and HDL were isolated in the 1.019 < d < 1.055 and 1.07 < d < 1.21 g/ml density range, respectively(16Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I was prepared by delipidating HDL (17Osborne Jr., J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128A: 213-222Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and anion exchange chromatography of the resulting apoHDL on Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotechnology AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (18Weisweiler P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). UC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), egg yolk SPM, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma. Discoidal rHDL were prepared by the cholate dialysis method(19Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Discs containing SPM were prepared by drying POPC, SPM, and UC onto the walls of glass test tubes, then proceeding as previously described(19Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the discoidal rHDL were used as substrates for the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) reaction, [3H]UC (48 Ci/mmol) (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added to the lipids before drying. The resulting particles contained approximately 48,000 cpm/nmol UC. Lipid-free apoA-I was not present in the discoidal rHDL preparations as judged by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Spherical rHDL were prepared by incubating discoidal rHDL with LDL and LCAT as described previously(20Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Before use, all of the rHDL preparations were dialyzed extensively against 0.01 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) EDTA-Na2, and 0.006% (w/v) NaN3. LCAT was isolated from 2 liters of human plasma (Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital) by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and citric acid followed by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.25 g/ml(21Mahadevan V. Soloff L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The d > 1.25 g/ml fraction was applied to an XK 50/60 column containing phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (high substitution) (Pharmacia) which had been preequilibrated with 3 M NaCl. LCAT was eluted from the column with Milli Q water at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), and applied to a preequilibrated XK 26/40 column packed with DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia). LCAT was eluted from the column with 20 mM Tris, 160 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min, and the active fractions were pooled. These steps were carried out at room temperature on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The purified LCAT appeared as a single band following electrophoresis on a 20% homogeneous SDS-gel and staining with Coomassie Blue. Activity was assessed as described by Piran and Morin (22Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 1040-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [3H]UC-labeled POPC/UC/apoA-I discoidal rHDL as a substrate. The assay was linear if less than 30% of the [3H]UC was esterified. The preparation used in this study generated 227 nmol of cholesteryl esters (CE)/ml LCAT/h. CETP was prepared as described previously(23Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transfer activity was assessed as the transfer of [3H]CE from [3H]CE-HDL3 to LDL(24Tollefson J.H. Lui A. Albers J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E894-E902PubMed Google Scholar, 25Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear if less than 30% of the [3H]CE transferred from HDL3 to LDL. Activity is expressed in units, with 1 unit being the transfer activity of 1 ml of a preparation of pooled, human lipoprotein-deficient plasma. The preparation of CETP used for this study had 6 units of activity/ml. Unless stated otherwise, all incubations were carried out in stoppered plastic tubes in a shaking water bath maintained at 37°C. Nonincubated controls were stored at 4°C. Details of individual incubations are described in the legend to the figures. Incubations with sphingomyelinase from Bacillus cereus (Boehringer Mannheim) were carried out for 1 h at 37°C using 1.4 units of sphingomyelinase/mg apoA-I(26Subbaiah P. Lui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20156-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As EDTA-Na2 inhibits sphingomyelinase(26Subbaiah P. Lui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20156-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rHDL were dialyzed against TBS without EDTA-Na2 before incubation. When the incubations were complete the rHDL were dialyzed extensively against TBS with EDTA-Na2. The rHDL were isolated from incubation mixtures by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm in the 1.07 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range using a TLA-100.4 rotor or in the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range using a TLA-100.2 rotor. Two 16-h spins at the lower density and one 16-h spin at the higher density were performed. These procedures were carried out at 4°C in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. The rHDL were dialyzed extensively against TBS before use. Agarose-gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously(15Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobilities were calculated by dividing electrophoretic velocity (migration distance (μm/time (s)) by the electrophoretic potential (voltage (V)/length of gel (cm))(27Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mobilities were corrected for pI-dependent retardation as follows(27Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mobilitycorrected=Mobilityagarose−0.1361.211(Eq. 1) Nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis on 3/35% gels (Gradipore, Sydney, Australia) was carried out as described previously (28Rye K.-A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer fitted with a thermostatted cell holder and polarizers. Sample temperatures were controlled by a Lauda RM6T recirculating water bath (Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) and monitored with a digital temperature probe (Baker Medical Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia). Packing of rHDL phospholipid head groups and acyl chains was monitored by labeling with 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluene sulfonate (TMA-DPH) and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), respectively(29Lentz B.R. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4521-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 30Prendergast F.G. Haugland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Polarity of rHDL lipid-water interfacial regions was assessed with 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene (PRODAN)(31Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In all cases the molar ratio of phospholipid/probe was 500/1, and the phospholipid concentration was 0.5 mM. The labeling procedures and spectroscopic conditions are described in detail elsewhere(15Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unfolding of apoA-I was assessed from the wavelength of maximum fluorescence of samples following incubation at 25°C for 0, 2, 5, 7, and 24 h with 0-8 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Data from the 24-h time points were used for the calculations described below. All calculations are based on the assumption that the unfolding of apoA-I is represented by a two-state process such that, at a given time, the only species present at significant concentrations are either completely folded or completely unfolded(32Pace N.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The central, linear regions of the unfolding curves were used for the calculations. For a given concentration of GdnHCl, the fraction of unfolded apoA-I was calculated as fu=yf−yyf−yu(Eq. 2) where yf, yu, and y represent the respective wavelengths of maximum fluorescence in the folded, unfolded, and transition states. The equilibrium constant (K) for unfolding was calculated as K=fu1−fu(Eq. 3) and the free energy change was calculated as ΔG=−RTlnK(Eq. 4) where R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/degree/mol) and T is the absolute temperature (198.15 K). The concentration of GdnHCl at the midpoint of the denaturation curve was calculated from plots of ΔG versus the concentration of GdnHCl using values of ΔG between −1.5 and +1.5 kcal/mol. ΔGH2O ΔG=ΔGH2O−ΔnRTln(1+ka)(Eq. 5) where Δn is the difference in the number of binding sites between the folded and unfolded states, k is the equilibrium constant for binding at each site (0.6), and a, the activity of GdnHCl, is calculated from the molarity (M) of GdnHCl as follows a=0.6761(M)−0.1468(M )2+0.02475(M )3−0.00132(M )4(Eq. 6) All assays were carried out on a Cobas Fara Centrifugal Analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Zurich, Switzerland). Boehringer Mannheim kits were used for phospholipid, UC, and total cholesterol assays. Esterified cholesterol concentrations were calculated as the difference between the total and UC concentrations. The concentration of apoA-I was measured by an immunoturbidometric assay(33Hopkins G.J. Barter P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SPM concentrations were determined as described by Bradley et al.(34Bradley C.A. Salhany K.E. Entman S.S. Aleshire S.L. Parl F.F. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Student's t test for paired samples was used to determine whether differences between values were significant. Discoidal rHDL containing apoA-I, UC, and varying amounts of POPC and SPM were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting particles had SPM/apoA-I molar ratios of 0/1, 13.6/1, and 26.3/1. The corresponding POPC/apoA-I molar ratios were 99.6/1, 86.0/1, and 72.5/1 (Table 1). SPM had little effect on rHDL size, with all the preparations containing a major population of particles 10.0 nm in diameter (Fig. 1). The discs with SPM/apo A-I molar ratios of 0/1 and 13.6/1 also contained minor populations of larger particles. The larger particles were less apparent in the rHDL which had an SPM/apo A-I molar ratio of 26.3/1.Table 1 Open table in a new tab When these discoidal rHDL preparations were incubated with LDL and LCAT, the resulting spherical rHDL all had SPM/apoA-I molar ratios of approximately 5/1 (result not shown). This was consistent with SPM transferring spontaneously between LDL and rHDL. The kinetics of the transfer of SPM from LDL to rHDL was investigated by incubating discoidal rHDL with a POPC/SPM/UC/apoA-I molar ratio of 99.6/0.0/10.2/1.0 in the presence of LDL and LCAT for 0-24 h. The rHDL were then isolated by ultracentrifugation and the molar ratio of SPM/apoA-I was determined (Fig. 2). The SPM/apoA-I molar ratio increased rapidly during the first hour of incubation. Equilibrium was achieved between 6 and 12 h, with a t½ for the transfer of 0.8 h. After 24 h of incubation, the POPC/SPM/UC/CE/apoA-I molar ratio of the spherical rHDL was 24.6/4.9/3.6/24.9/1.0. In molar terms, SPM accounted for 17% of the phospholipid in the spherical rHDL (Table 1). When the spherical rHDL were depleted of SPM head groups by incubation with sphingomyelinase, the concentrations of the other constituents and the size of the particles did not change (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This was not the case for the SPM-containing discoidal rHDL, which were converted quantitatively to larger and smaller particles by incubation with sphingomyelinase (result not shown). These larger and smaller particles were not further characterized. Various spectroscopic techniques were used to assess the effect of SPM on rHDL structure. The discoidal and spherical rHDL had comparable wavelengths of maximum fluorescence (Table 1). This is consistent with the environment of apoA-I Trp residues not being affected by (i) the shape of the rHDL, (ii) the presence of SPM in discoidal rHDL, or (iii) removal of SPM head groups from spherical rHDL by incubation with sphingomyelinase. The wavelengths of maximum fluorescence for the apoA-I in the rHDL were blue-shifted relative to lipid-free apoA-I. In other words, the apoA-I Trp residues in the rHDL are in a more hydrophobic environment than those in lipid-free apoA-I. This is in agreement with what has been reported elsewhere(23Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L.H. Krul E.S. Kézdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The local rotational motions of the rHDL apoA-I Trp residues were determined by steady state fluorescence polarization (Table 1). Although the discoidal rHDL polarization values decreased as the SPM content of the particles increased, the differences were not statistically significant. This is consistent with SPM having little effect on the local rotational motions of the apoA-I Trp residues in discoidal rHDL. The polarization of the spherical rHDL which contained SPM was comparable to that of the discoidal rHDL, suggesting that particle shape does not affect the rotation of apoA-I Trp residues. However, the polarization decreased when the spherical rHDL were depleted of SPM head groups (p < 0.01). This is consistent with the SPM head group restricting the rotation of apoA-I Trp residues in spherical rHDL. In all cases the polarization of lipid-associated apoA-I was significantly lower than that of lipid-free apoA-I (p < 0.001). In other words, lipid association enhances local rotational motions of apoA-I Trp residues. This confirms what has been reported previously(23Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L.H. Krul E.S. Kézdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of SPM on rHDL surface charge was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretic mobilities of the discoidal rHDL were intermediate between lipid free apoA-I and native HDL and were not affected by SPM (Table 1). This demonstrates that the SPM molecule does not influence the surface charge of discoidal rHDL. The spherical rHDL with intact SPM migrated slightly slower than native HDL, but more rapidly than discoidal rHDL. After incubation with sphingomyelinase, their electrophoretic mobility increased and was indistinguishable from that of native HDL. This is consistent with the SPM head group decreasing the negative charge on the spherical rHDL surface. The influence of SPM on phospholipid acyl chain packing order was assessed from the polarization of DPH-labeled spherical and discoidal rHDL (Fig. 3A). The SPM molecule increased discoidal rHDL acyl chain packing order as evidenced by the increase in polarization values with increasing SPM/apoA-I molar ratios. The polarization of the spherical rHDL which had been incubated with sphingomyelinase (open circles) was slightly lower than that of the spherical rHDL which had been incubated with TBS (closed circles). This is consistent with the SPM head group having a minor ordering effect on spherical rHDL phospholipid acyl chains. The additional finding that spherical rHDL have higher polarization values than discoidal rHDL demonstrates that phospholipid acyl chains are more ordered in spheres than in discs. This is in agreement with what has been reported by Jonas et al.(35Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L.H. Krul E.S. Kézdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid head group packing order was assessed from the polarization of TMA-DPH-labeled discoidal and spherical rHDL (Fig. 3B). The order of the discoidal rHDL phospholipid head groups increased as the SPM/apoA-I molar ratio increased from 0/1 (closed squares) to 13.6/1 (open squares) to 26.3/1 (diamonds). The values for the spherical rHDL with (closed circles) and without (open circles) SPM head groups were comparable. The additional finding that spherical rHDL have more ordered phospholipid head groups than discoidal rHDL confirms what has been reported elsewhere(35Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L.H. Krul E.S. Kézdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rHDL were also labeled with PRODAN, a polarity sensitive fluorescent probe (Fig. 3C). The wavelength of maximum fluorescence of the discoidal rHDL increased rapidly at temperatures above 25°C. The increase was greatest for the discs without SPM (SPM/apoA-I molar ratio = 0/1) (closed squares), intermediate when the SPM/apoA-I molar ratio was 13.6/1 (open squares) and least when the SPM/apoA-I molar ratio was 26.3/1 (diamonds). In other words, SPM inhibits the hydration of discoidal rHDL lipid-water interfacial regions. The wavelength of maximum fluorescence of PRODAN in the spherical rHDL was comparable after incubation in the presence (open circles) and absence (closed circles) of sphingomyelinase. This demonstrates that SPM head groups do not influence the hydration of the spherical rHDL lipid-water interface. As the increase in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence of the spherical rHDL was small, it seems that the lipid-water interface of these particles is resistant to hydration. The influence of SPM on the unfolding of apoA-I was assessed by incubating aliquots of discoidal and spherical rHDL for varying times with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. The wavelength of maximum fluorescence of apoA-I was determined at 0, 2, 5, 7, and 24 h. For clarity, only the values for 0 (squares), 2 (closed circles), and 24 h (open circles) are shown (Fig. 4). Panels A, B, and C, respectively, show the results for discoidal rHDL with SPM/apoA-I molar ratios of 0/1, 13.6/1, and 26.3/1. The results for spherical rHDL with SPM/apoA-I molar ratios of 0/1 and 4.9/1 are in Panels D and E, respectively. The unfolding of lipid-free apoA-I is shown in Panel F. Lipid-free apoA-I unfolded rapidly and completely, as evidenced by the comparable wavelengths of maximum fluorescence at 0, 2, and 24 h (Fig. 4F). The wavelengths of maximum fluorescence for the discoidal and spherical rHDL (Fig. 4, A-E) were blue-s"

INTRODUCTIONReplication in eukaryotic cells is a precisely regulated event, which occurs only once in the S phase of the cell cycle to maintain the integrity of the genome. DNA replication proceeds in two stages: initiation of the replication fork and elongation of the new strands. Little is known so far about cellular factors that regulate the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication.By using mutants that fail to maintain minichromosomes with autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: ARSautonomously replicating sequenceFCSfetal calf serumPIpropidium iodidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigen.) several genes termed MCM have been isolated in budding yeast(1Main G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.-K. Genetics. 1984; 106: 365-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in MCM affect the function of each ARS in an ARS-specific manner. This unique phenotype indicates that MCM gene products are involved in the initiation of DNA replication at ARSs rather than in the elongation step(2Gibson S.I. Surosky R.T. Sinha P. Maine G.T. Tye B.-K. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 47: 341-354Google Scholar). Among them, MCM2, MCM3, and MCM5 (identical to CDC46), together with the fission yeast cdc21, share striking homology and compose a protein family implicated in the initiation of DNA replication (3Yan H.

Science. 1995; 268: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).CDC46/MCM5, MCM2, and MCM3 proteins show unique behavior during the cell cycle; they are localized in the nucleus during G1 phase but disappear from this site at the beginning of the S phase, to reappear at the end of the M phase(9Hennessy K.M.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2149-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This behavior is reminiscent of that of the putative replication licensing factor, which was first proposed from results with an in vitro replication system with Xenopus egg extracts(11Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In this latter model, the licensing factor can enter the nucleus during nuclear membrane breakdown in mitosis. It is excluded, however, by an intact nuclear membrane and allows DNA to replicate only once in the S phase by evoking the initiation step and afterward being immediately inactivated.Recently, a number of mammalian homologues of the MCM family have been identified, including MCM2, MCM3, CDC46/MCM5, and cdc21(7Thommes P.

A 2.4-kilobase cDNA was then isolated, which encodes a protein of 719 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 81.3 kDa. hCDC47 protein has 49% amino acid identity with the budding yeast CDC47 protein. Details of these studies will be published elsewhere.2Cell Culture and SynchronizationHuman normal diploid fibroblast cell line WI38 (obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cervical cancer-derived lines, HeLa, SiHa, and C33A, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% FCS.For synchronization, exponentially growing WI38 cells were starved of serum for 48 h prior to addition of fresh medium with 10% FCS. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by means of a double thymidine/hydroxyurea block. HeLa cells at log phase were incubated with 2.5 mM thymidine for 22 h, released for 10 h, and then treated with 1.5 mM hydroxyurea for a further 16 h. The cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium with 5% FCS to reenter the cell cycle.Cell Cycle Analysis with Flow CytometryCells were harvested by trypsinization, and the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (PI) using a CycleTest kit (Becton-Dickinson) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (1 × 104) were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson), and the percentages in each phase were calculated with the SOBR model in the CELFIT program.RNA Extraction and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA isolation, Northern blot hybridization, and probe labeling were performed as described previously(23Fujita M. Shiku H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar). The 630-base pair fragment corresponding to the 3′-end of the hCDC47 cDNA, whose sequence is relatively distinct among hMCMs, was used as a probe. This gave a clear single band corresponding to a length of approximately 2.8 kilobases with various human cell lines. ( 3M. Fujita and M. Ishibashi, unpublished observations.) Probed membranes were analyzed with a Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji, Japan).Production of AntibodiesA His-tagged fusion protein containing amino acids 562-719 of hCDC47 was produced by inserting the 630-base pair fragment into pQE31 (Qiagen) and introducing it into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. After induction with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mM), the overexpressed 20-kDa fusion protein was isolated as inclusion bodies, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), excised from the gel, and eluted into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% SDS. A rabbit was injected with approximately 200 μg of the purified protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and subsequently with the protein in incomplete adjuvant.For affinity purification of anti-hCDC47 antibodies, the glutathione S-transferase-fused hCDC47 protein produced in E. coli was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The antiserum was applied to the glutathione S-transferase-hCDC47 Sepharose column, washed, and eluted.Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the oligopeptide VVCIDEFDKMSDMDRTA derived from hMCM3 protein were generated by the procedure described by Hu et al.(12Hu B. Burkhart R. Schulte D. Musahl C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5289-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) except that bovine serum albumin-peptide conjugate-coupled Sepharose 4B was used for purification. Antibodies obtained after two immunizations preferentially reacted against authentic 105-kDa hMCM3 protein but did not cross-react with other hMCM members by immunoblotting.3ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation was performed by standard procedures(24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells growing in 60-mm plates were metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi of [35S]Met and 0.2 mCi of [35S]Cys ([35S]labeling mix, Amersham) for 3 h and lysed for 20 min on ice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Wako Chemical, Japan), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 200 μM sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were precleared with 50 μl of preimmune serum and Pansorbin (Calbiochem). Separate aliquots were then mixed with either the preimmune serum or the anti-hCDC47 antiserum and rocked for 1 h. The mixtures were further incubated for 1 h after the addition of 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (RepliGen), and then the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer.Immunoblotting AnalysisImmunoblotting was performed as described previously(23Fujita M. Shiku H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar). The protein blots were incubated with appropriate first antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, rabbit anti-hCDC47 antiserum at 1:2000 dilution or purified antibodies at 1 μg/ml, rabbit anti-hMCM3 peptide antibodies at 2 μg/ml, and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mouse monoclonal antibody at 20 μg/ml (PC10, Boehringer Mannheim). The blots were then probed with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed) and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham). The intensity of signals visualized on films was measured with a CS-930 chromatoscanner (Shimadzu, Japan).Partial Proteolytic Mapping of hCDC47Uncapped RNAs were prepared from linearized plasmid DNA carrying a hCDC47 cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met. In vitro translated hCDC47 or immunoprecipitates from [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cell extracts with anti-hCDC47 antibodies were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The 83-kDa doublet bands corresponding to hCDC47 were located by autoradiography, excised, placed in sample wells of a SDS gel, and overlaid with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (25 or 250 ng). Digestion proceeded in the stacking gel during electrophoresis(25Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence AnalysisAll staining procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells grown in culture chambers (Lab-Tek Chamber Slide, Nunc) were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. The samples were incubated with either anti-hCDC47 antiserum or the preimmune serum at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS with 10% normal goat serum (Zymed) for 1 h. In some experiments, the purified antibodies were used at 8 μg/ml. After washing three times with PBS, the samples were reacted with 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (affinity purified, Zymed) for 1 h, followed by treatment with 500 μg/ml RNase and 10 μg/ml PI for 30 min. The samples were mounted and analyzed by conventional microscopy or confocal laser microscopy (LSM-GB2000, Olympus, Japan).Differential Extraction of hCDC47 ProteinCells cultured in 60-mm plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice with ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and sodium orthovanadate. The cell lysates were collected and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the Nonidet P-40-extractable fraction. The nuclear pellet fraction was washed once with hypotonic lysis buffer and directly added to SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Alternatively, the pellet was incubated in hypotonic lysis buffer adjusted to the appropriate NaCl concentration on ice for 20 min.RESULTShCDC47 mRNA Is Expressed at the Late G1 to S PhaseNormal diploid human fibroblast line WI38 cells were arrested by serum depletion for 48 h, induced to start the cell cycle by adding serum, and harvested sequentially at the indicated times. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 80% of the cells were arrested in G0 by serum deprivation, and 20 h after the stimulation, about half of the cells began to enter the S phase (Fig. 1A). In parallel, RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis, demonstrating that the hCDC47 mRNA level started to increase at 12 h and reached to peak at 16 h, just before the onset of the S phase, when it was five times higher than that in the quiescent state (Fig. 1B).The Level of hCDC47 Protein Does Not Vary Greatly during the Cell CycleRabbit antiserum was raised against bacterially produced His-tagged hCDC47, which reacted against the immunized protein and glutathione S-transferase-fused hCDC47 protein but not His-tagged or glutathione S-transferase-fused unrelated proteins by immunoblot assay (data not shown). This antiserum, but not a preimmune serum, recognized a protein migrating at approximately 83 kDa on SDS-PAGE by immunoprecipitation from a 35S-labeled extract of WI38 (Fig. 2A). Some weak additional bands were also observed after immunoprecipitation with the anti-hCDC47 antiserum. With immunoblot analysis, the antiserum also detected an 83-kDa protein in lysates prepared from two tumor cell lines as well as WI38 (Fig. 2B). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies gave essentially the same results as that with the antiserum (data not shown). The 83-kDa protein immunoprecipitated from the [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cell extract with the anti-hCDC47 antibodies was subjected to V8 protease peptide mapping, and its digestion pattern was compared with the one of in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled hCDC47 (Fig. 2C). The molecular size of the in vitro translated hCDC47 estimated by SDS-PAGE had good concordance with that of the cellular protein detected with the anti-hCDC47 antibodies, and the two maps after partial proteolysis were virtually identical. Together, these findings led us to conclude that the 83-kDa protein detected by our polyclonal antiserum is the hCDC47 protein. Both the cellular and in vitro translated hCDC47 protein often resolved into a doublet. However, the underlying mechanism is obscure at present; we could not discriminate these two bands with regard to cell cycle dependence or detergent extractability (see below).Figure 2:Characterization of anti-hCDC47 rabbit antiserum. A, immunoprecipitation from a 35S-labeled extract of WI38 cells with a preimmune rabbit serum (lane 1) or anti-hCDC47 antiserum (lane 2).

In vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled hCDC47 (lane 1) or the immunoprecipitate obtained from a [35S]Met-labeled HeLa cell extract with anti-hCDC47 antibodies (lane 2) was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The 83-kDa doublet bands were excised and subjected to partial digestion with V8 protease (lanes 3 and 4, 25 ng; lanes 5 and 6, 250 ng). Lanes 3 and 5 were loaded with in vitro translated hCDC47, and lanes 4 and 6 were loaded with immunoprecipitated hCDC47 from HeLa cells. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left. The arrow head indicates hCDC47.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the antiserum, we examined whether the total protein levels of hCDC47 changed during the cell cycle along with the mRNA levels in synchronized WI38 cells. hCDC47 protein was clearly identified even in the quiescent WI38 cells starved of serum for 48 h, and, when the cells entered S phase, only a slight increase in the amount of the protein was observed (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Levels of hCDC47 protein in the cell cycle after release from serum starvation. WI38 cells were treated as described in Fig. 1.

After the immunostaining, the cells were further treated with RNase and counterstained with PI to identify the nuclei. As shown in Fig. 4, the antiserum gave essentially nuclear staining in WI38 cells, although there was some variation in the signal intensity among the cells. In contrast, no specific staining was observed with the preimmune serum. Similar nuclear staining was also observed in G1/S- or late S/G2-enriched HeLa cells with anti-hCDC47 antibodies (Fig. 6B, see below).Figure 4:Localization of hCDC47 in human cells. Asynchronous WI38 cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and reacted with either the anti-hCDC47 antiserum or the preimmune serum followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. After the immunostaining, the samples were further treated with RNase and counterstained with PI to identify the nuclei. The samples were then analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We were, therefore, interested in whether this was also the case for hCDC47. Asynchronously growing WI38 cells were first extracted with hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and then the pellets were successively extracted with the same buffer containing NaCl at the indicated concentrations. The amount of hCDC47 protein in each sample was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5). The supernatant fraction of the Nonidet P-40 extraction contained three-fourths of the total hCDC47 protein amount, and most of the remaining protein in the pellet fraction was extractable with 0.5 M NaCl, demonstrating that hCDC47 protein also has two forms like mMCM3, a form extractable by Nonidet P-40 and the nucleus-bound form.Figure 5:Differential extraction of hCDC47 protein. WI38 cells were extracted with hypotonic Nonidet P-40 buffer to obtain the Nonidet P-40-extractable fraction (NP-40/sup). The remaining pellet fraction (NP-40/pellet) was extracted with Nonidet P-40 buffer adjusted to the indicated NaCl concentration. The amounts of hCDC47 protein in each sample were determined by immunoblot analysis with the anti-hCDC47 antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dissociation of Nucleus-bound hCDC47 Protein during S PhaseTo gain insight into the behavior of hCDC47 protein during DNA replication, we chose to use HeLa cells because synchronized populations can thereby be easily obtained. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a thymidine-hydroxyurea double block and then released. Analysis of the DNA content of these cells by flow cytometry showed that near 100% of the cells were arrested in G1/S, while 4 h after release 80-90% were in mid S phase, and at 8 h they had reached late S/G2 phase (Fig. 6A). In the S/G2-enriched population, mitotic cells were less than 10% as determined by microscopy for formaldehyde-fixed and PI-stained cells (data not shown). When the localization of hCDC47 protein was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy of the G1/S or late S/G2-enriched HeLa cells, nuclei were predominantly stained in both populations (Fig. 6B).Nonidet P-40-extracted supernatant and remaining pellet fractions were prepared from these three populations and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The extraction efficiency was confirmed to be virtually equal (data not shown). Examination of the levels of hCDC47 protein in these samples by immunoblotting with the anti-hCDC47 antiserum demonstrated no great variation through the S phase in the supernatant fraction, which contained three-fourths of the total hCDC47 protein in the G1/S population. In contrast, the levels of hCDC47 protein in the pellet fraction decreased remarkably along with progression through the S phase (Fig. 7). In the late S/G2-enriched population, the amount of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 was one-fifth that in the G1/S population. With parallel immunoblotting, the levels of hMCM3 protein in the pellet fraction were found to be coincidentally decreased with that of hCDC47 during the S phase (Fig. 7).Figure 7:Dissociation of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 protein during the S phase in HeLa cells. G1/S, mid S, and late S/G2-enriched HeLa cell populations, prepared as in Fig. 6A, were extracted with hypotonic Nonidet P-40 buffer to obtain the Nonidet P-40-extractable fraction (NP-40/sup) and the remaining pellet fraction (NP-40/pellet). Each fraction was immunoblotted with anti-hCDC47 antibodies, anti-hMCM3 antibodies, or anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody. The loaded amount of the Nonidet P-40-extractable fraction (equivalent to approximately 1 × 105 cells/lane) was set at one-third that of the Nonidet P-40/pellet fraction (approximately 3 × 105 cells/lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PCNA, the auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase δ required for DNA replication(26Prelich G.

https://openalex.org/W2078600190,"The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 can be induced to differentiate toward neutrophils and subsequently die via apoptosis in vitro. In this paper, we investigated the roles of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Accompanying the RA-induced differentiation, activities of src family PTKs Lyn and Fgr became detected and reached a plateau 2 days after the stimulation. The immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) showed that the proteins of 56 and 53 kDa were predominantly tyrosine-phosphorylated at day 2. Adsorption and immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate by specific antibodies evidenced that these phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are Lyn and Fgr PTKs. The degree of both activities and tyrosine phosphorylation of these PTKs was reduced to be minimal at day 5 when the HL-60 cells start to die by apoptosis. The inhibitors of PTKs, herbimycin A and genistein, were demonstrated to cause premature cell death of HL-60 cells in the presence of RA. The death was the consequence of an apoptotic process. The RA-treated HL-60 cells, when incubated with specific c-lyn or c-fgr antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, also underwent premature death at day 2. These data implicate that Lyn and Fgr PTKs prevent programmed cell death to promote granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.

The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, upon stimulation with RA in vitro, undergoes differentiation toward neutrophils at day 3 to day 4 and dies via apoptosis at day 6 to day 8(5.Martin J. Bradley J.G. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 79: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Neutrophil is the first cell to accumulate at the site of inflammation and plays a critical role in inducing various inflammatory events. As soon as neutrophils complete their roles at the inflammatory site, they die via apoptosis and are removed by macrophages to limit tissue injury since they release harmful molecules such as proteolytic enzymes(6.Grigg J.M. Savill J.S. Saraff C. Haslett C. Silverman M. Lancet. 1991; 338: 720-722Abstract PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7.Afford S.C. Pongracz J. Stockley R.A. Crocker J. Burnett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21612-21616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, molecular analysis for the events occurring after stimulation of HL-60 cells with RA will provide useful information on both the differentiation and the apoptosis of neutrophils. Apoptosis requires active and coordinated regulation of specific molecules. Bcl-2 is a potent suppressor of death and the balances between Bcl-2 and a death-inducing signal determine the occurrence of apoptosis(8.Nunez G. Merino R. Grillot D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 582-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that expression of Bcl-2 decreased markedly during RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells (9.Delia D. Aiello A. Soligo D. Fontanella E. Melani C. Pezzella F. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Blood. 1992; 79: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2261-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA binds to specific nuclear receptors (RARs) and the RA•RAR complex is thought to regulate the transcription of target genes(11.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (6313) Google Scholar, 12.Collins S.J. Robertson K.A. Mueller M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the intracellular events that lead to differentiation and apoptosis of the responsive cells subsequent to RA•RAR interaction(13.Porfiri E. Hoffbrand A.V. Wickremasinghe R.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play crucial roles in the intracellular signal transduction for growth and differentiation of the cells(14.Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 897-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that PTKs play essential roles in TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells(15.Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Koyama Y. Morikawa M. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Kajiyama K. Uehara Y. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar), and that Ras and GTPase-activating protein complex function downstream of PTKs during the differentiation(18.Katagiri K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. Katagiri T. Blood. 1994; 84: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our previous paper described the induction of src family PTKs, lyn and fgr mRNA during RA-induced granulocytic differentiation(15.Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Koyama Y. Morikawa M. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated the role of PTKs in the differentiation. In the current study, during RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, both Fgr and Lyn PTKs were demonstrated to be superinduced and tyrosine-phosphorylated. In the presence of RA, treatment with specific c-lyn or c-fgr antisense oligodeoxynucleotides as well as that with herbimycin A or genistein, led to premature death of the HL-60 cells. Thus, Lyn and Fgr PTKs are assumed to exert as anti-apoptotic agents to promote granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were suspended with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For differentiation experiments, growing cells were subcultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml, and inducers were added to the medium at the following concentrations: 1 μM for retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma). Herbimycin A (0.1 and 0.2 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and genistein (10 μg/ml) (Funakoshi Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were also added to the medium. After incubation of HL-60 cells with these drugs for the indicated time, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn, anti-Lyn, anti-Fgr, anti-Hck antibodies and monoclonal anti-Vav antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Btk and anti-Fes antibodies were kindly donated by Drs. S. Tsukada (Osaka University) and Y. Hanazono (University of Tokyo), respectively. These antibodies were used in the immunoprecipitation as described below. 125I-Labeled monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20 (ICN Radiochemicals), peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig F(ab′)2 fragments (Amersham), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig F(ab′)2 fragments (Amersham) were used in the immunoblotting as described below.

The supernatant was precleared by incubation with an excess amount of protein G-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cleared lysate was incubated with various kinds of antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4B. The immunoprecipitates were washed with the lysis buffer extensively. The 10 μl of the cell lysate (106 cells) or the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The transfer of the proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Pharmacia) and the blotting with 125I-PY-20 or peroxidase-conjugated antibody were carried out as described(19.Katagiri T. Urakawa K. Yamanashi Y. Semba K. Takahashi T. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Kano K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) system (Amersham) was applied to detection. The immunoprecipitates described above were then incubated at 30°C for 10 min with 40 μl of kinase buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2) containing 1 μM ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq). The 32P-labeled samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The gels were treated with 1 M KOH at 55°C for 2 h to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated protein molecules, dried, and subjected to Fuji RX film at −80°C. The granulocytic differentiation was evaluated on Giemsa-Wright stained cytospin preparation. Fragmentation of DNA was assayed as described previously(20.Oritani K. Kaisho T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Blood. 1992; 80: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells (5 × 106) were treated with drugs and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 50 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). After 4 h at 37°C, DNA was extracted with an equal volume of Tris buffer-saturated phenol and with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. DNA was treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml; Sigma) for 5 h and then with proteinase K (120 μg) for 5 h. DNA was separated (5 μg of DNA per lane) by horizontal electrophoresis (2 V/cm) in 1% agarose gel with running buffer containing 90 mM Tris-HCl, 90 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. We synthesized antisense PSNs complementary to positions 142-162 of human c-fgr sequence (CCTGGAATGGGCTGTGTGTTC) and 292-312 of human c-lyn sequence (GGAAATATGGGATGTATAAAA)(21.Nishizawa M. Semba K. Yoshida M. Yamamoto T. Sasaki M. Toyoshima K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22.Yamanashi Y. Fukushige S. Semba K. Miyajima K. Matsubara K. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Sense PSNs corresponding to each position were prepared as controls. The antisense PSN sequences did not have significant homology with any other sequences in the data base. All experiments using antisense PSNs were repeated three times, and the results obtained were essentially the same. The antisense and sense PSNs were synthesized on a synthesizer (model 392; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA), precipitated with ethanol, and taken up in media containing 20 mM Hepes. Sense (S) or antisense (AS) c-lyn or S or AS c-fgr PSNs were added to the culture medium for HL-60 cells at the concentration of 20 μM. After 4 days of PSN treatment, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 20 μM S or AS PSNs, and 1 μM of RA was added to the cultures. In our previous reports(15.Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Koyama Y. Morikawa M. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated mRNA expressions and functions of some members of src family PTKs in monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. In this study, we examined expressions of 9 src-related cytoplasmic PTKs during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells in comparison with monocytic one. By in vitro immune complex kinase assay using specific antibodies, Fgr and Lyn src family PTKs were found to be induced abundantly within 12 h after RA stimulation, peak at day 2 (Fig. 1), and then decrease to the minimum 5 days after the stimulation (data not shown). While the activities of Hck and Fyn src family PTKs were specifically detected in TPA-treated cells (Fig. 1), Btk was expressed abundantly in nontreated HL-60 cells and remained unchanged after stimulation with TPA or RA (Fig. 1). Syk was expressed in either RA- or TPA-treated cells (Fig. 1). Both Src and Yes were expressed weakly without change in their level upon stimulation, and Lck was not detected during the differentiation (data not shown). Both mRNAs and proteins of the Lyn and Fgr PTKs were also detected abundantly 2 days after RA treatment ((15.Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Koyama Y. Morikawa M. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar), Fig. 2). However, we could not determine whether the PTKs were activated or not since the degrees of their expressions were very low in untreated HL-60 cells. By using immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20), tyrosine phosphorylation of protein molecules were investigated during RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected within 12 h after the stimulation, reached a plateau at day 2, and declined thereafter to the minimum at day 5 (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the protein molecules of molecular mass 53 to 56 kDa were markedly tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of that of the 95-kDa protein was relatively weak. To identify the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn (p53lyn and p56lyn) and Fgr (p56fgr) because the kinetics of expressions of both PTKs were similar to those of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 53- to 56-kDa proteins; that is, expressions of both Lyn and Fgr were predominantly induced at day 2 after RA stimulation and declined thereafter (Figure 1, Figure 2). As shown in Fig. 3, left, Lyn and Fgr PTKs were highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in RA-treated cells, but not in TPA-treated cells. Absorption with anti-Lyn and anti-Fgr antibody plus protein G-Sepharose 4B demonstrated that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 53 to 56 kDa were Lyn and Fgr PTKs (Fig. 3, right). These data suggest the involvement of these PTKs in the signaling generated by RA•RAR interaction in HL-60 cells. We next investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a proto-oncogene product Vav (p95vav) as a candidate molecule for the 95-kDa protein phosphorylated upon RA stimulation (Fig. 4). The Vav is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells (23.Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of the cells with antigen or mitogen(24.Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Vav was markedly (10-fold) tyrosine-phosphorylated at 48 h after stimulation with RA, while the amount of Vav was not changed during that time.Figure 4Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav in RA-treated HL-60 cells. Upper, the RIPA lysates from RA- or TPA-treated HL-60 cells (2.5 × 106 cells) for 48 h were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Vav or mouse IgG (mIg) as a control and protein G-Sepharose. These immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF filter, and immunoblotted with 125I-labeled PY-20. The autoradiograph was exposed for 12 h at −80°C with an intensifier screen. Lower, the same whole lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF filter and then immunoblotted with anti-Vav antibody. The bands detected by the ECL assay system (Amersham) showed that an almost equal amount of Vav protein exists in each lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have reported that herbimycin A prevented TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells and suggested an important role of tyrosine kinases in the differentiation(16.Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Kajiyama K. Uehara Y. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. Cell Immunol. 1992; 140: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To know the role of tyrosine kinases in the RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, we investigated the effects of herbimycin A on the differentiation. By using a method of Giemsa-Wright staining of the cells, we observed that RA treatment of HL-60 cells induced terminal differentiation into granulocytic cells at day 3, and, subsequently, they died by apoptosis at day 7 (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, herbimycin A in combination with RA inhibited cell growth and caused cell death of HL-60 cells at 48 h after stimulation (Fig. 5, A and B). The cells treated with RA plus herbimycin A revealed fragments of nuclei and highly condensed chromatin, which are the most striking feature of apoptosis (Fig. 5A). Genistein, an another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also induced an apoptotic cell death of HL-60 cells when used together with RA (Fig. 5A). Morphological change in HL-60 cells characteristic of granulocytic differentiation was never observed before apoptotic death of the cells. While, neither herbimycin A alone nor herbimycin A plus TPA did cause apoptosis of HL-60 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Apoptosis is in many cases associated with a characteristic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by intrinsic endonuclease(s). Apoptotic cell death of HL-60 cells treated with herbimycin A plus RA was further confirmed by detecting the ladder pattern of DNA cleavage in these cells (Fig. 5B), whereas DNA remained unfragmented in preparations obtained from HL-60 cells treated with RA, herbimycin A, or TPA plus herbimycin A for 48 h (Fig. 5B). As tyrosine kinases were demonstrated to be involved in the apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by RA (Fig. 5), we focused on the two tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Fgr, and prepared antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PSNs) specific for them according to the method as described under “Materials and Methods.” We first examined the effects of antisense PSNs on the expression of Lyn and Fgr PTKs in HL-60 cells by an immunoblotting. Although both PTKs were detectable in untreated HL-60 cells after RA stimulation, they were strongly suppressed when the cells were cultured in the presence of lyn or fgr antisense PSNs (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the cells treated with each sense PSN expressed levels of Lyn and Fgr PTKs similar to those in untreated cells after RA stimulation (Fig. 6A). In addition, these antisense PSNs did not affect the expression of Btk PTK in HL-60 cells (Fig. 6A). When the antisense PSN-treated HL-60 cells were stimulated with RA for 48 h, more than 80% of the cells were dead with immature characteristics (Fig. 6B). However, sense PSN-treated HL-60 cells were demonstrated to have no sign for cell death. The cell death appeared to be characteristics of apoptosis under microscopic observation (data not shown). The regulation system of apoptosis is highly organized, and the balances between inducers and repressors determine the occurrence of apoptosis. In the current study, two cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Fgr, were demonstrated to be members of the repressors for apoptosis of neutrophils. Both Lyn and Fgr PTKs were shown to be induced and tyrosine-phosphorylated during differentiation of HL-60 cells toward neutrophils. After completion of the differentiation, the expressions of these PTKs were reduced to be minimal and the cells die via apoptosis. Using antisense oligonucleotides specific for Lyn or Fgr PTK, it was demonstrated that inhibition of expression of either PTK upon RA stimulation leads to premature cell death via apoptosis. Consistent with the results, herbimycin A in combination with RA was exhibited to cause premature cell death of the HL-60 cells. These data imply that Lyn and Fgr PTKs exert an antiapoptotic effect to promote differentiation of HL-60 cells toward neutrophils. Antiapoptotic function of PTKs in neutrophils was also suggested by Yousefi et al.(25.Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation prevents apoptosis of human peripheral blood neutrophils. In our study, at least two possibilities exist to explain antiapoptotic roles of Lyn and Fgr PTKs in the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells; one is their functioning in independent signal transduction pathways which converge to join each other at the terminal, and the other is their direct interaction or ordered functions on the same pathway which is required for antiapoptotic function. As yet, we have no evidence for supporting the one. In neutrophils, Lyn has been demonstrated to be activated and associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase accompanying the stimulation with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)(26.Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It was shown that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) activated Lyn and Syk (p72syk), both of which were then recruited into G-CSF receptor signaling complex in human peripheral neutrophils(27.Corey S.J. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Geahlen R.L. Tkatch L.S. Tweardy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). While the evidence has been reported that Fgr also function in human neutrophils, a chemotactic agonist induces translocation of Fgr from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane and that Fgr is associated to FcγIIR on neutrophils(28.Hamada F. Aoki M. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, Berton et al.(29.Berton G. Fumagalli L. Laudanna C. Sorio C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrated that agonists of β2 integrin activation such as tumor necrosis factor, TPA, and fMet-Leu-Phe enhance the kinase activity of Fgr in human neutrophils. These data suggest that Fgr PTK plays a crucial role in the expression of function by peripheral neutrophils at the inflammatory site. Our data on the antiapoptotic role of Lyn and Fgr PTK in the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells will add a new insight into the function of these PTKs in the neutrophils. Further studies on the analyses of HL-60 transfectants expressing active Lyn or Fgr or both PTKs will provide more information on the roles of these PTKs in the apoptosis and differentiation of human neutrophils. Identification of the molecules interacting with these PTKs in RA-stimulated HL-60 cells will also give information on the function of these PTKs in neutrophils. These studies are now in progress in our laboratory. While our study is in progress, Manfredini et al.(30.Manfredini R. Grande A. Tagliafico E. Barbieri D. Zucchini P. Citro G. Zupi G. Franceschi C. Torelli U. Ferrari S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the HL-60 cells which had been induced to differentiate into granulocytes underwent premature death when incubated with antisense oligonucleotide specific for c-fes gene which encodes a Fes PTK (p92c-fes). In our system, accompanying the differentiation of HL-60 cells toward neutrophils, expression of Fes PTK is increased without detectable levels of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes PTK (data not shown). To get a clue to understanding the relation of Lyn, Fgr, and Fes PTK in the antiapoptotic signaling pathway, we tried to investigate the possible co-immunoprecipitation with each other during RA-induced differentiation. However, no association with each other was observed. Several genes have been identified that participate as either inducers or repressors of programmed cell death. Among these, Bcl-2 and Bax are homologous proteins that have opposing effects on cell life and death. Bcl-2 serves to prolong cell survival while Bax acts as an accelerator of apoptosis(31.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar, 32.Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Previous papers reported that Bcl-2 decreased during RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes which subsequently undergo apoptosis and that HL-60 cells which hyperexpressed Bcl-2 showed little evidence for apoptosis(9.Delia D. Aiello A. Soligo D. Fontanella E. Melani C. Pezzella F. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Blood. 1992; 79: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2261-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, we also observed the prompt decrease in expression of Bcl-2 protein by HL-60 cells after RA stimulation (data not shown). Expression of Bax protein was shown to be reduced far more slowly accompanying the differentiation (data not shown). Thus, the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax was markedly reduced at an early phase of the differentiation. Therefore, some molecules, for which we propose Lyn and Fgr PTK, should protect cells from apoptosis instead of Bcl-2 to promote differentiation toward neutrophils. Recently, various proteins such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bad, and Bag-1 were cloned as molecules associated with Bcl-2 or Bax and demonstrated to be involved in programmed cell death(33.Boise L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar, 34.Takayama S. Sato T.

Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms of the antiapoptotic function of Lyn and Fgr PTK should be considered by taking the balances of the above Bcl-2-related molecules into account. In addition to Lyn and Fgr PTKs, we identified preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as p95vav (Vav). Vav is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells and has the guanine nucleotide releasing factor activity for Ras which is regulated by tyrosine kinase(36.Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we could not find activation of Ras during RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells while the activation of Ras was observed accompanying TPA-induced differentiation(18.Katagiri K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. Katagiri T. Blood. 1994; 84: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav upon RA stimulation is higher than that upon TPA stimulation, Vav might have functions other than working as a guanine nucleotide releasing factor for Ras. In this term, study on the differentiation of HL-60 cells will provide useful information on physiological function of Vav. As RA induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation in some promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, RA has been utilized as a differentiation therapy for treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia(3.Huang M. Ye Y. Chen S. Chai J. Lu J. Zhoa L. Gu L. Wang Z. Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Castaigne S. Chomienne C. Daniel M.T. Ballerini P. Berger R. Fenaux P. Degos L. Blood. 1990; 76: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparently resulted in remission of the patients without causing marrow aplasia(3.Huang M. Ye Y. Chen S. Chai J. Lu J. Zhoa L. Gu L. Wang Z. Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Castaigne S. Chomienne C. Daniel M.T. Ballerini P. Berger R. Fenaux P. Degos L. Blood. 1990; 76: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, RA in combination with a small amount of herbimycin A was found to be a potent agent to induce apoptosis of promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Although its validity and toxicity should be scrutinized using experimental animals, careful treatment with the combination of the agents will improve the remedial value exhibited by RA alone. For more specifically refined treatment, further studies on the molecular mechanisms of antiapoptotic functions of tyrosine kinases should be required."
https://openalex.org/W1574146385,"The direct evidence of dramatic conformational changes of the DnaB hexamer, induced by nucleotide binding, and the presence of multiple conformational states of the enzyme have been obtained by using analytical sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity studies, and the rigorous fluorescence titration technique. Equilibrium sedimentation measurements show that in the presence of the ATP nonhydrolyzable analog, AMP-PNP, the DnaB helicase fully preserves its hexameric structure. However, in the presence of the saturating concentration of AMP-PNP, the sedimentation coefficient of the hexamer is s20,ω = 11.9 ± 0.2 compared to the sedimentation coefficient s20,ω = 10.5 ± 0.2 of the free DnaB helicase hexamer. This large sedimentation coefficient change indicates dramatic global conformational transitions of the hexamer, encompassing all six subunits, upon binding the ATP analog. In the presence of ADP, the sedimentation coefficient is s20,ω = 11.4 ± 0.2, indicating that the conformation of the ADP form of the hexamer is different from the ATP form. The sedimentation coefficient of the ternary complex DnaB-(AMP-PNP)-dϵA(pϵA)19, s20,ω = 12.4, suggests that the DnaB helicase undergoes further conformational changes upon binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The large global structural changes correlate with the functional activities of the enzyme. In the absence of the ATP analog, the hexamer exists in a “closed” conformation which has extremely low affinity toward ssDNA. Upon binding the ATP analog, the DnaB hexamer transforms into a “tense” state which binds ssDNA with an affinity of ~4 orders of magnitude higher than in the absence of the nucleotide. In the presence of ADP, the DnaB hexamer assumes a “relaxed” conformation. The functional difference between these two conformations is reflected in the much weaker allosteric effect of ADP on the ssDNA binding with the affinity constant ~3 orders of magnitude weaker than in the presence of the ATP analog (tense state).

DnaB is the essential DNA replication protein in Escherichia coli, originally identified based on its requirement for in vitro ϕX174 phage replication (Wickner et al., 1973; McMacken et al., 1977). DnaB protein is the primary E. coli replicative helicase, i.e. the factor responsible for unwinding the DNA duplex in front of the replication fork. It is the only helicase required to reconstitute DNA replication in vitro from the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) (Kornberg and Baker, 1992; LeBowitz and McMacken, 1986; Baker et al., 1987). The enzyme is involved in both the initiation and elongation stages of DNA replication (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers, 1990; Kornberg and Baker, 1992; Marians, 1992). The native DnaB helicase forms a hexamer composed of six identical subunits (Reha-Krantz and Hurwitz, 1978; Bujalowski et al., 1994). Analytical sedimentation studies have shown that the DnaB helicase exists as a stable hexamer over a large protein concentration range with magnesium ions playing a crucial structural role in stabilizing the hexameric structure of the helicase. Hydrodynamic data indicate that six protomers aggregate with cyclic symmetry in which the protomer-protomer contacts are limited to only two neighboring subunits (Bujalowski et al., 1994). Physiological functions of the DnaB helicase are related to the ability of the protein to interact with ss- and dsDNA ( 1The abbreviations used are: sssingle-strandeddsdouble-strandedAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateATPγSadenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.) under the control of ATP binding and hydrolysis (Arai and Kornberg, 1981a, 1981b; LeBowitz and McMacken, 1986). Studies of nucleotide binding to the DnaB helicase have established that the hexamer has six nucleotide binding sites, presumably one on each protomer (Arai and Kornberg, 1981b; Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993, 1994a, 1994b). The binding process is biphasic, resulting from the negative cooperative interactions limited to neighboring subunits (Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993, 1994a, 1994b). single-stranded double-stranded 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Interactions of the DnaB helicase with ssDNA and the structure of the formed complexes have only recently been quantitatively studied (Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995). On the basis of thermodynamically rigorous fluorescence titrations, we have established that in the presence of the ATP nonhydrolyzable analog, AMP-PNP, stoichiometry of the DnaB hexamer complex with the polymer ssDNA (site size) is 20 ± 3 nucleotides. Binding studies performed with ssDNA oligomers have shown that the hexamer has only a single, strong ssDNA binding site. Moreover, photo-cross-linking experiments indicate that only a limited set of subunits, most probably only one, is engaged in the complex with the nucleic acid. These results indicate that long-range allosteric interactions occur on the level of the quaternary structure of the hexameric enzyme, leading to the selection of a limited set of subunits as a binding site for ssDNA. Such interactions require significant conformational changes of the hexamer, beyond the nearest neighboring protomers. In this communication, we present the first direct evidence that, in the presence of the ATP nonhydrolyzable analog, AMP-PNP, the DnaB helicase undergoes global conformational transitions which encompass all six subunits of the hexamer. The sedimentation coefficient of the hexamer increases by ~14% when compared to the free hexamer. Binding of ADP to the DnaB helicase causes similar, albeit smaller, global conformational changes. Thus, the nucleotide binding and the ATP/ADP switch, which takes place after every ATP hydrolysis step, are accompanied by significant conformational changes of the entire DnaB hexamer. We report the first quantitative analysis of the allosteric effect of nucleotide cofactors on the DnaB helicase-ssDNA complex formation. The E. coli DnaB protein was purified, as described previously (Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993; 1994a). Poly(dA) and dA(pA)19 were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX) and converted into their fluorescent derivative (etheno-A) by modification with chloroacetaldehyde (Bujalowski et al., 1994). Buffer T2 is 50 mM Tris adjusted to pH 8.1 with HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. All steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using the SLM 48000S spectrofluorometer, as described previously (Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993, 1994a, 1994b; Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995). Equilibrium sedimentation and sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Spinco Model E analytical centrifuge, and the analysis of the sedimentation runs was performed, as we described previously (Bujalowski et al., 1994). The total concentration at radial position r is defined by (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980) cr=cbexp{[(1−ν¯ρ)ω2M(r2−rb2)]/2RT}+b(Eq. 1) where cb, t;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;ngr;, and M are the concentration (absorption) at the bottom of the cell, partial specific volume, and molecular weight of the protein, respectively, ρ is the density of the solution, ω is the angular velocity, and b is the base line error term. Equilibrium sedimentation profiles were fitted to with M and b as fitting parameters. The reported values of the sedimentation coefficients were corrected to the standard conditions, s20,ω, for solvent density and viscosity (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). McGhee and von Hippel(1974) derived two explicit equations for noncooperative and cooperative binding of a large ligand to a one-dimensional, homogeneous lattice, with overlapping potential binding sites. Previously, we obtained a single generalized equation for the McGhee-von Hippel model which can be applied to both cooperative and noncooperative binding (Bujalowski et al., 1989). The Scatchard form of the generalized equation is described by νPF=K(1−nν){[2ω(1−nν)][(2ω−1)(1−nν)+ν+R]}(n−1){[1−(n+1)ν+R]2(1−nν)}2(Eq. 2) where K is the intrinsic binding constant, n is the number of nucleotides covered by the protein in the complex (site size), ω is the parameter characterizing cooperativity, and R = {[1 - (n + 1)v]2+ 4ωv(1 - nv)}0.5. Binding of the DnaB helicase to the polymer ssDNA has been analyzed using. Fluorescence titrations of poly(dϵA) with the DnaB helicase (λex = 325 nm, λem = 410 nm) in buffer T2 (pH 8.1, 10°C) containing 50 mM NaCl, in the presence of 1 mM AMP-PNP, 1 mM ADP, and in the absence of nucleotide cofactors, are shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the high affinity of the helicase toward ssDNA is observed only in the presence of AMP-PNP. In the absence of any nucleotide cofactors, the affinity is very low, and only an upper limit of the intrinsic binding constant can be estimated. In the presence of ADP, the intrinsic affinity is higher, but still very low, when compared to the affinity manifested in the presence of AMP-PNP. The solid lines in Fig. 1 are computer fits using the McGhee-von Hippel model, as described by the generalized (see “Experimental Procedures”). The obtained intrinsic binding constants are 1.2 ± 0.2 × 105M-1, 5.9 ± 0.3 × 102M-1, and ~6 × 101M-1 for binding in the presence of AMP-PNP, ADP, and in the absence of nucleotide cofactors, respectively. Analytical ultracentrifuge experiments provide direct information about the global conformational properties of a protein which are reflected in the hydrodynamic properties of the macromolecule (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). Sedimentation velocity profiles of the DnaB helicase in buffer T2 (pH 8.1, 20°C) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 × 10-4M AMP-PNP (monitored at 292 nm) are shown in Fig. 2a. At this concentration of the ATP analog, all six ATP binding sites of the DnaB hexamer are saturated with the nucleotide (Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993, 1994a, 1994b). There is a single, well-defined moving boundary throughout the sedimentation process which has a sedimentation coefficient of s20,ω = 11.9 ± 0.2. It should be pointed out that in our studies the error in the measurement of the sedimentation coefficients, for each particular system, is a standard deviation determined from 8 to 12 independent sedimentation velocity experiments using two different protein concentrations. The obtained value of s20,ω of the DnaB-(AMP-PNP) complex is ~14% higher than the sedimentation coefficient of s20,ω = 10.5 ± 0.2 of the free DnaB hexamer (Bujalowski et al., 1994). The magnitude of this increase of the sedimentation coefficient can be realized by recalling that a simple dimerization of two hexamers into a dodecamer would lead to an ~58% increase of its sedimentation coefficient (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). To exclude the possibility that the nucleotide binding affects the oligomeric state of the DnaB hexamer, we performed sedimentation equilibrium measurements of the DnaB helicase in the presence of saturating concentrations of AMP-PNP. A set of DnaB protein concentration profiles (recorded at two different wavelengths, 285 and 292 nm) as a function of the square of the radius at sedimentation equilibrium, in buffer T2 (pH 8.1, 10°C) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 × 10-4M AMP-PNP, are shown in Fig. 2b. The solid lines are nonlinear least-squares fits to a single exponential function (). The excellent agreement between the theoretical lines and the experimentally obtained concentration profiles indicates that there is a single species in the solution. The analysis of the concentration profiles provides the molecular weights of 303,000 ± 10,000 and 301,000 ± 10,000 for scans recorded at 285 and 292 nm, respectively. Comparison between the obtained data and the known molecular weight of the DnaB hexamer (313,590) shows that the DnaB helicase fully preserves its hexameric structure in the presence of AMP-PNP (Bujalowski et al., 1994). Therefore, since the six bound molecules of AMP-PNP per hexamer constitute only ~1% of the molecular weight of the protein, a large increase of the sedimentation coefficient in the presence of AMP-PNP indicates dramatic conformational changes of the entire hexamer induced by the binding of the ATP analog (see “Discussion”). The thermodynamic studies of the binding of the DnaB helicase to ssDNA indicate that ADP also induces conformational transitions in the enzyme; however, this leads to a modest increase of the binding affinity toward the ssDNA (Fig. 1). Analogous sedimentation velocity experiments (data not shown) of the DnaB hexamer in the presence of the saturating concentration of ADP (5 × 10-4M) show that the sedimentation coefficient of the helicase is s20,ω = 11.4 ± 0.2, a value significantly higher than the sedimentation coefficient of the free enzyme. However, this value is lower when compared to s20,ω = 11.9 ± 0.2 obtained in the presence of the ATP analog, AMP-PNP, and suggests conformational differences between these two complexes (see “Discussion) It is very interesting to determine how the binding of the ssDNA affects the conformational transitions of the DnaB hexamer induced by nucleotide binding. Because the etheno- derivatives of the nucleic acids have significant absorption above 310 nm, where there is practically no contribution of the protein spectrum, this allows us to monitor only one component, the nucleic acid, during the sedimentation process. Sedimentation velocity profiles of the mixture of the DnaB helicase and dϵA(pϵA)19 in the 1.25:1 molar excess of the enzyme over the nucleic acid are shown in Fig. 3. Recall, the 20-mer exactly spans the site size of the DnaB helicase-ssDNA complex (Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995). Because the [DnaB] and [dϵA(pϵA)19] are ≫1/K20, all the nucleic acid should be complexed with the helicase (Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995). As a result, only a single, well-defined boundary of the complex is observed throughout the entire sedimentation process and has a sedimentation coefficient of s20,ω = 12.4 ± 0.2. This value is ~17% higher than the sedimentation coefficient of the free DnaB hexamer and ~3 and ~9% higher than the sedimentation coefficient of the DnaB helicase, when saturated with the ATP analog or ADP. This suggests that the binding of ssDNA, most probably, introduces additional conformational changes in the ternary complex, DnaB-(AMP-PNP)-dϵA(pϵA)19 (see “Discussion) Helicases are the essential enzymes which catalyze the vectorial unwinding of the dsDNA to provide a single-stranded intermediate in the reaction which is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Hill and Tsuchiya, 1981; Lohman, 1993). The plausible model of this process, supported by the binding studies of nucleic acids in the presence of nucleotide cofactors, is that the enzyme cycles in a vectorial fashion through a number of conformational states controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis in which its affinity for ss- and dsDNA dramatically changes (Wong and Lohman, 1993). Yet, evidence of the physical existence of different conformations or intramolecular transitions within the oligomeric structure of the hexameric enzyme, induced by nucleotide binding, so far has not been obtained. Hydrodynamic properties, including the sedimentation coefficient, are directly sensitive to the global conformational properties of the macromolecules (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). Using analytical sedimentation velocity experiments and the rigorous fluorescence titration technique, we present direct evidence that the E. coli primary replicative helicase DnaB protein undergoes dramatic conformational transitions induced by binding of the ATP nonhydrolyzable analog, AMP-PNP, and ADP. The sedimentation coefficient of the free DnaB hexamer increases from s20,ω = 10.5 to s20,ω = 11.9 for the hexamer in the presence of 5 × 10-4M AMP-PNP and to s20,ω = 11.4 in the presence of 5 × 10-4M ADP. At these concentrations of AMP-PNP and ADP, all six binding sites are saturated with the nucleotide (Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993). The very large increase of the sedimentation coefficient does not result from the dimerization of the DnaB hexamer induced by nucleotide binding. Equilibrium sedimentation measurements show that, in the presence of the saturating concentration of AMP-PNP, the hexameric structure of the enzyme is fully preserved (Fig. 2b). In the absence of oligomerization, the sedimentation coefficient of the protein can change as a result of changes of its partial specific volume or frictional coefficient, or both. Partial specific volume of the ATP molecule is t;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;ngr; = 0.44 ml/g compared with t;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;ngr; = 0.732 ml/g of the DnaB protein (Howlett and Schachman, 1977; Bujalowski et al., 1994). However, the six bound nucleotide molecules constitute only ~1% of the molecular weight of the hexamer and the trivial effect of a lower t;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;ngr; of the bound nucleotides on the measured s20,ω, would amount to ~0.004; thus, it is negligible. Moreover, the additional data suggest that the global conformational changes are predominantly induced by the binding of only the first three nucleotide molecules to the three high affinity binding sites of the hexamer. ( 2M. J. Jezewska and W. Bujalowski, manuscript in preparation.) Therefore, regardless of the nature of the observed conformational transitions, the large increase of the sedimentation coefficient indicates large global structural changes of the DnaB hexamer, which are induced by ATP analog binding, and these structural transitions lead to intrinsic changes of the partial specific volume of the hexamer and/or its frictional coefficient. Although the exact nature of the conformational transition induced by nucleotide binding is still unknown, it should be mentioned that dynamic light scattering data indicate that the diffusion coefficient of the hexamer is increased in the presence of the saturating concentration of AMP-PNP, indicating that the frictional coefficient of the hexamer is decreased, in agreement with the sedimentation data reported here.2 Binding of ADP to the DnaB helicase also induces global conformational changes in the protein hexamer. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,ω = 11.4, is increased by ~9% when compared to the free DnaB hexamer; however, this value is smaller than the 11.9 obtained in the presence of AMP-PNP. The difference is larger than the error of the determination of s20,ω (± 0.2) estimated using multiple scans at different protein concentrations (see above). Thus, the sedimentation data suggest that the conformation of the hexamer-ADP complex differs from that of the free DnaB protein and is also different from the DnaB helicase-(AMP-PNP) complex. As a result, the affinity of the hexamer toward ssDNA drops by ~3 orders of magnitude when compared to the affinity of the DnaB-(AMP-PNP) complex (see above). The difference between the effect of AMP-PNP and ADP does not result from the weaker binding of ADP to the helicase. As we determined previously, using a series of fluorescent nucleotide analogs, the ADP and ADP analogs bind with higher affinity to the DnaB helicase than the ATP analogs (Bujalowski and Klonowska, 1993, 1994a, 1994b). Thus, the allosteric effect of AMP-PNP on the DnaB global conformation, which leads to the dramatically increased affinity of the helicase to ssDNA as opposed to the dramatic drop in the affinity in the presence of ADP, must result from the specific interactions of γ-phosphate in the nucleotide binding site. The sedimentation coefficient of the DnaB-(AMP-PNP)-dϵA(pϵA)19 ternary complex, s20,ω = 12.4 ± 0.2, indicates that conformational changes induced by AMP-PNP binding are preserved in the ternary complex. It should noted that the increase of the sedimentation coefficient of the ternary complex exceeds the value expected from the combined trivial effects of the different partial specific volume of the nucleic acid and the higher molecular weight of the DnaB hexamer-20-mer complex. The bound 20-mer constitutes only an additional ~2% of the molecular weight of the complex. The trivial effect of the lower partial specific volume of the nucleic acid molecule (t;ex2html_html_special_mark_amp;ngr; = 0.531 ml/g, Pearce et al.(1975)) and the increased molecular weight of the complex would contribute ~0.008 and ~0.2 to the measured sedimentation coefficient, respectively (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). Moreover, binding of the shorter 10-mer ssDNA fragment (data not shown) causes the same increase of the sedimentation coefficient of the hexamer (s20,ω = 12.5 ± 0.2) as the 20-mer, although it has 10 less nucleotide residues than the 20-mer and constitutes only ~1% of the molecular weight of the hexamer. If the trivial effects were mainly responsible for the observed increase of s20,ω of the ternary complex, then the effect of the 10-mer should be half of the one observed for the 20-mer, but this is not what is experimentally observed. Thus, the increased value of s20,ω of the ternary complex suggests that, most probably, the DnaB helicase undergoes further conformational changes upon binding ssDNA, although the obtained hydrodynamic data indicate that the major conformational transition of the helicase is induced by AMP-PNP or ADP binding. Hydrodynamic studies reported in this work provide the first direct evidence of the dramatic global conformational changes of the DnaB helicase hexamer, induced by nucleotide binding, and the existence of the multiple, structural states of the enzyme. Moreover, the different conformations correlate well with the functional properties of the enzyme, i.e. its interactions with DNA, as determined by thermodynamic studies. In the absence of the nucleotide cofactors, the DnaB hexamer, built of six chemically identical subunits, has a very low affinity toward ssDNA. In this “closed” state, all subunits of the hexamer are equivalent and capable of initiating binding of ATP and ADP (see above, Bujalowski and Klonowska (1993)). Upon binding the ATP analog, the global rearrangement of the protomers within the hexamer is induced, resulting in a “tense” state with a high affinity for ssDNA. The transition leads to the selection of only a limited set of subunits, most probably only one, as a binding site for ssDNA (Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995). The large increase of the sedimentation coefficient suggests a more compact structure of the hexamer in a tense state. Although ADP also induces similar large global changes in the structure of the DnaB hexamer, this state of the enzyme is different from the one induced by ATP. A smaller value of s20,ω suggests a less compact structure of the hexamer in this “relaxed” state as compared to the tense state. The mechanism of the dsDNA unwinding by the replicative helicase and the mechanism of the enzyme translocation on the nucleic acid lattice is still unknown. In general, after breaking hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the duplex DNA in the replication fork, the enzyme must be released from the formed ss nucleic acid and move, in an unidirectional translocation event, toward dsDNA (Hill and Tsuchiya, 1981). Our recent results show the existence of only a single, strong binding site and a very low stoichiometry of the DnaB-ssDNA complex. These results are not compatible with the models of hexameric helicase translocation along the nucleic acid lattice in which all six protomers and/or multiple binding sites are involved in ssDNA binding (Bujalowski and Jezewska, 1995). The existence of different conformational states of the hexameric helicase described in this work strongly suggests that the mechanism of translocation and nucleic acid unwinding might rely on global, not local, conformational changes in the hexamer which are induced by the ATP/ADP switch and/or nucleic acid binding. Such conformational transitions were postulated as necessary elements of the helicase mechanism by Hill and Tsuchiya(1981). Thus, because the transition from the tense to the relaxed state of the helicase must accompany each ATP hydrolysis step, when the ATP/ADP switch takes place in the nucleotide binding site, this transition is most probably responsible for the partial release of the ssDNA from the nucleic acid binding site (Arai and Kornberg, 1981b). After the release of ADP, the global rearrangement of the protomers within the entire DnaB hexamer, from a closed conformation to a tense one upon rebinding ATP, would allow the enzyme to translocate and encompass the subsequent fragment of dsDNA, within the active site of the helicase.

In this regard, Shc and IRS-1 contain domains that are distinct from SH2 domains, referred to as the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) or phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domains, which bind phosphotyrosine in the context of an NPX-Tyr(P) motif. To further clarify the role of the Shc PTB/PI domain, we identified a mutation in this domain that abrogated binding of Shc to the IR in vitro. Interestingly, this mutation completely abolished Shc phosphorylation by the IR in vivo whereas mutation of the arginine in the FLVRES motif of the Shc SH2 domain did not affect Shc phosphorylation by insulin.

https://openalex.org/W1978956506,"Interaction of hepatocyte growth factor with its high affinity receptor c-met initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to epithelial motility. An 11-amino acid sequence from the c-met receptor has been found to cause cell transformation in transfected fibroblasts (Ponzetto, C., Bardelli, A., Zhen, Z., Maina, F., Dalla, Z. P., Giordano, S., Graziani, A., Panayotou, G., and Comoglio, P. M.(1994) Cell 77, 261-271). We inserted this sequence into a mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptor (F5) to determine if this region of c-met can initiate cell motility and which signaling pathways it activates. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor/c-met hybrid (F5 met) initiated PDGF-dependent chemotaxis in renal epithelial cells (8.0 ± 2.3 versus 70.5 ± 4.8 cells/mm2), while the parental construct, F5, did not. Addition of PDGF to cells expressing F5 met caused activation of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (control 2.0 ± 0.8, +PDGF 17.1 ± 5.1, n = 3, p < 0.05) and phospholipase C (control 478.5 ± 67 dpm/well, +PDGF 1049.3 ± 93, n = 4, p = 0.003), while neither pathway was activated in cells expressing F5. The chemotactic response of F5 met was inhibited by both the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the phospholipase C inhibitor U-71322. Selective activation of the PI 3-kinase utilizing a PDGF receptor mutant (F3) containing the native high affinity PI 3-kinase binding site also resulted in PDGF stimulated chemotaxis, although less than that generated by the c-met sequence.These findings demonstrate that the 11-amino acid sequence from c-met initiates epithelial motility via coincident activation of the PI 3-kinase and phospholipase C and that selective activation of the PI 3-kinase can initiate a partial chemotactic response.

No other domain outside of the tyrosine kinase region of c-met is predicted to bind any known signaling proteins, making it possible that this 11-amino acid domain is a site for competitive interaction of many, if not all, of the receptor's signaling proteins.

These experiments demonstrate that c-met-mediated activation of the PI 3-K is required for the full chemotactic response, but they do not address whether the PI 3-K alone is sufficient to initiate chemotaxis. In this report, we used an altered platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which is unable to bind to PI 3-K, RasGAP, Syp/PTP, or PLCγ (9Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) as a vehicle to introduce and study the role of the 11-amino acid c-met sequence in the motility response of epithelial cells. Use of a PDGFR mutant in our inner medullary collecting duct cells (which do not express endogenous PDGFR) makes it possible to study selective tyrosine phosphorylation of this met sequence in the setting of normal epithelial signaling machinery. In addition, a second PDGFR mutant with the native high affinity PI 3-K binding site (Y740MDM … Y751VPM) intact but with Tyr → Phe substitutions of the tyrosines critical for association with RasGAP, Syp/PTP and PLCγ (F3) were utilized to examine more selective activation of the PI 3-K in epithelial chemotaxis. mIMCD-3 cells are a murine renal tubular epithelial cell line that expresses the c-met receptor and exhibits striking chemotaxis to a gradient of HGF(4Derman M. Cunha M. Barros E. Nigam S. Cantley L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rauchman M. Nigam S. Delpire E. Gullans S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 34: F416-F424Google Scholar, 11Cantley L.G. Barros E.J.G. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar). Screening of these cells by Northern analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and Western blots revealed no evidence of the PDGFR. In addition, mIMCD-3 cells did not demonstrate a mitogenic (data not shown) nor chemotactic response to PDGF (see Fig. 2). NIH 3T3 cells were used as a control for expression of the native PDGFR. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum using standard techniques. PDGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and HGF (a gift from Dr. George Vande Woude) were used in concentrations from 1 to 100 ng/ml for dose-response curves (not shown) with maximal effects on chemotaxis detected at 10 ng/ml in NIH 3T3 cells for PDGF and 40 ng/ml in mIMCD-3 cells for HGF. In addition, recombinant HGF (Institute of Immunology Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was tested with equivalent results. Wortmannin was obtained from Sigma; U-71322 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); and diacylglycerol was from Boehringer Manheim. Two PDGFR mutants (F5, in which the tyrosine residues at 740, 751, 771, 1009, and 1021 have been replaced by phenylalanines, and F3, in which the residues at 740 and 751 remain tyrosines) were provided to us as a gift by Dr. Andrius Kazlauskas(9Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The kinase insert region of the F5 PDGFR was then modified to encode novel SalI and AatII restriction sites and allow insertion of the 33-nucleotide cDNA sequence encoding the 11-amino acid motif YVHVNATYVNV from the c-met receptor (designated F5 met) (Fig. 1). The identity of each construct was confirmed by sequencing. Each of the constructs was then cloned into pCMV expression vectors and transfected into mIMCD-3 cells using the lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and independent clones were selected on G418 (400 mcg/ml). Confluent plates of cells were serum starved for 24 h, stimulated with either vehicle control, PDGF, or HGF for 5 min followed by phosphate-buffered saline wash, lysis in ice-cold lysis buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). Expression of full-length PDGFR was detected by blotting with an anti-PDGFR antibody known to detect the F5 mutant receptor (a generous gift of Dr. Andrius Kazlauskas) or anti-phosphotyrosine (ICN Biomedicals Inc, Costa Mesa, CA). Appropriate Western blots were performed using anti-PDGFR or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of equal sample size as determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Chemotaxis was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay with 24 individual blind wells as described previously (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD)(4Derman M. Cunha M. Barros E. Nigam S. Cantley L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stoker M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Serum-free medium containing either vehicle control, PDGF, or HGF was added to the bottom chamber and then covered with a polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, CA) coated with rat tail collagen type I (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA). 2.5 × 104 cells were added to the upper compartment. After 4 h of incubation at 37°C, filters were removed, the cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Miami, FL), and the upper surface was wiped with a cotton applicator to remove nonchemotaxing cells. Cells that had passed through the pores were then counted in five nonoverlapping 10× fields, and the mean value of cells/mm2 was calculated. Although total numbers of migrating cells varied moderately between experiments, the ratio of control to stimulated chemotaxis remained consistent. In some experiments, the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin was added to both upper and lower chambers. In other experiments, the PLC inhibitor U-71322 was similarly employed. Immunoprecipitation of the PI 3-kinase was performed as described previously(11Cantley L.G. Barros E.J.G. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following 24 h of serum deprivation, confluent cells were stimulated with ligand and lysed as above. Aliquots of supernatant containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4°C with monoclonal antibody directed against phosphotyrosine using protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in kinase buffer (62.5 mM ATP, 6.25 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM Hepes, 0.25 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids), 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, pH 7.0). Lipids were then extracted and separated on oxalate-coated thin-layer chromatography plates (EM Separations), and autoradiography was performed. The labeled lipids migrating as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) were then cut out and counted in a β scintillation counter for quantification of amount of PI3P generated. 24-well plates of either F5 or F5 met cells were incubated with inositol-free medium and 5 μCi/ml [3H] inositol for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice in PBS, followed by a 20-min incubation with inositol-free media. PDGF or vehicle control was added to appropriate wells for 2 min. Cells were lysed with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, and samples were extracted with water-saturated ether, dried in a vacuum concentrator, and separated by HPLC by the method of Auger et al.(13Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Results were averaged, and statistical relevance was determined by the Student's t test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. G418-resistant clones from transfections with the F5 and F5 met constructs were simultaneously screened for expression of the PDGFR and chemotaxis in response to a PDGF gradient. None of the F5 clones tested exhibited PDGF-dependent chemotaxis (Fig. 2), regardless of the level of expression of the full-length F5 protein. One clone, F516, which had the highest level of PDGFR expression, was then utilized as a control for further experiments. Evaluation of the F516 mIMCD-3 cell clone revealed no chemotaxis in response to PDGF (control, 6.3 ± 4.0 cells/mm2, n = 4; PDGF, 2.7 ± 1.2 cells/mm2, n = 4; p = not significant), despite a full chemotactic response to HGF (154 ± 17.3, p < 0.001). In contrast, we identified eight F5 met clones that demonstrated chemotaxis in response to PDGF and found that all eight clones expressed the PDGFR. Additionally, no clone exhibited PDGF-dependent chemotaxis, which did not express the receptor. Among these clones, the amount of chemotaxis correlated well with the level of expression of the PDGFR (Fig. 3). Interestingly, clones F5 met29 and F5 met41 subsequently failed to chemotax to PDGF and were found to no longer express the PDGFR by Western analysis. One clone, F5 met23, which stably expressed the mutant PDGFR, was used for further experiments and displayed consistent ability to chemotax toward PDGF (control, 4.6 ± 3.5 cells/mm2, n = 9; PDGF, 78.6 ± 12.7 cells/mm2, n = 11; p < 0.001). Following demonstration that the F516 and F5 met23 clones exhibited similar levels of receptor protein expression and PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4), we examined the ability of these clones to associate with the active form of the PI 3-K (Fig. 5). Antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of F5 met23 cells revealed a marked increase in receptor association with the active form of the PI 3-K following stimulation with PDGF, whereas parental mIMCD-3 and F5 cells revealed essentially no change in PI 3-K activity in the stimulated immunoprecipitates.Figure 5:PDGF stimulated PI 3-K activity in IMCD cells expressing the PDGFR mutants. Cells were stimulated with PDGF or vehicle control, immunoprecipitated with an antibody to phosphotyrosine, and then incubated with phosphatidylinositol (PI) substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (top panel), and the PI3P was cut out and counted in a β scintillation counter and expressed in disintegrations/min/g of protein immunoprecipitated (bottom panel). Results are the mean of three separate experiments. ∗, p < 0.05 in comparison with unstimulated control;∗∗, p < 0.025 in comparison with unstimulated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The importance of the association of the mutant PDGFR with the PI 3-K in the initiation of chemotaxis was confirmed by incubation of the cells with the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin. In these experiments, 10 nM wortmannin was found to markedly inhibit PDGF-dependent chemotaxis in F5 met cells (+PDGF, 179.1 ± 42.1 versus +PDGF + 10 nM wortmannin, 70 ± 10.3, n = 9, p = 0.023). In vitro study of inositol phosphate production in F5 met23 cells revealed a doubling of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production following PDGF stimulation (control 478.5 ± 67 dpm/well, +PDGF 1049.3 ± 93, n = 4,p = 0.003) (Fig. 6). There was no increase noted in F516 (control 860.8 ± 124 dpm/well, +PDGF 887.3 ± 104, n = 4,p = not significant). These results demonstrate that the 11-amino acid c-met sequence activates PLC in a ligand-dependent manner. A PLC inhibitor, U-73122 was then tested for its effect on F5 met chemotaxis(14Bleasdale J.E. Fisher S.K. Neuroprotocols. 1993; 3: 125-133Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). U-73122 had no effect on the activity of the PI 3-K (control 126.9 ± 37 dpm PI3P/μg; 1 μM U-73122, 144.8 ± 46 dpm/μg, n = 3; p = not significant) and did not inhibit chemotaxis initiated by the protein kinase C activator diacylglycerol (diacylglycerol 142.5 ± 42.4 cells/mm2, n = 12; diacylglycerol + U-73122, 131.7 ± 9.6, n = 9; p = not significant). However, at concentrations as low as 10 nM, there was a 70% inhibition of PDGF dependent chemotaxis, supporting a major role for PLC in c-met mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 7). To examine the effect of selective activation of the PI 3-K on cell motility, we also transfected mIMCD-3 cells with a mutant PDGF receptor which has Tyr → Phe substitutions at binding sites for PLC, Syp(PTP), and RasGAP but with the high affinity binding site for PI3-K intact (F3). Four G418-resistant F3 clones were identified that expressed the receptor and demonstrated PDGF-dependent chemotaxis (Table 1). Again, all clones that expressed the receptor at high levels were found to chemotax to PDGF, and no clones demonstrated chemotaxis in the absence of receptor expression. As expected, the high affinity native PDGFR PI 3-K binding site in the F31 cells mediated a marked increase in PI 3-K association following stimulation with PDGF (control 2.12 ± 0.34 dpm PI3P/g, +10 ng/ml PDGF 76.69 ± 17.55 dpm PI3P/g (n = 6, p = 0.002) Fig. 5). Despite this 4-fold greater association of the F3 receptor with the PI 3-K than observed with F5 met, chemotactic rates to a gradient of PDGF were less for the F31 cells as compared with the F5 met23 cells in all experiments (Table 1, Fig. 2). Thus selective activation of the PI 3-K can initiate a partial chemotactic response.Table 1 Open table in a new tab The potent chemotactic effect of HGF on epithelial cells makes the study of its receptor, c-met, a particularly relevant system for determining the signaling cascade involved in the epithelial motility response. The use of a hybrid F5-c-met receptor (F5 met) allowed us to selectively examine the role of an 11-amino acid region of c-met in epithelial cell motility and signal transduction. We initially determined that all three of the transfected receptor constructs were successfully expressed in mIMCD-3 cells and underwent PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. The F5 mutant PDGFR, which does not bind PI 3-K, PLCγ, PTP, or RasGAP but is still capable of associating with src (via Y579IYV) and possibly GRB-2 (via Y716SNA) (15Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not initiate epithelial chemotaxis in response to PDGF. However, expression of the F5 met hybrid receptor did initiate chemotaxis in a ligand-dependent manner, demonstrating that phosphorylation of the inserted c-met sequence Y1349VHVNATYVNV activated those signaling pathways necessary for epithelial cell motility. Based on our observation that the PI 3-K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 could partially block HGF/c-met-mediated epithelial chemotaxis(4Derman M. Cunha M. Barros E. Nigam S. Cantley L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar), as well as data from Kundra and co-workers (16Kundra V. Escobedo J. Kazlauskas A. Kim H. Rhee S. Williams L. Zetter B. Nature. 1994; 367: 464-476Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar) that demonstrated that PDGF constructs excluding PLC activation exhibited diminished chemotactic responses(16Kundra V. Escobedo J. Kazlauskas A. Kim H. Rhee S. Williams L. Zetter B. Nature. 1994; 367: 464-476Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of the 11-amino acid c-met sequence to activate these two candidate signaling pathways in epithelial cells. Indeed, both the PI 3-K and PLC were activated in a ligand-dependent manner by the F5 met hybrid receptor, but not by the parental F5 construct. The importance of these two pathways in chemotaxis was then examined using inhibitors of PI 3-K and PLC as well as a receptor construct, which selectively activates PI 3-K. Both wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-K, and U-73122, an inhibitor of PLC, caused marked reductions of F5 met-stimulated chemotaxis. Thus, the PI 3-K and PLC are activated in vivo by the 11-amino acid sequence from c-met and contribute to the chemotactic response initiated by this receptor. In addition, the F3 PDGFR in which the native high affinity PI 3-K binding site (Y740 MDM … Y751VPM) has been selectively restored (but which still lacks PLC, RasGAP, and PTP binding sites) also caused epithelial chemotaxis in response to PDGF. It should be noted that one study has described the small adaptor molecule Nck as competing for binding to the Y751VPM sequence of F3 as well(17Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The above data demonstrate a critical role for both the PI 3-K and PLC in epithelial cell migration and are the first to show that selective activation of PI 3-K is sufficient to initiate chemotaxis. Our findings are complemented by data from several laboratories. Wennstrom et al.(18Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson W.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar) examined the ruffling response in porcine aortic endothelial cells transfected with a mutant PDGFR, which selectively excluded binding of the PI 3-K (Tyr → Phe substitutions at 740 and 751)(18Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson W.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). This construct, the opposite of our F3 PDGFR, failed to mediate ruffling in response to PDGF, implicating a requirement for PI 3-K in membrane ruffling. Likewise, Kundra et al.(16Kundra V. Escobedo J. Kazlauskas A. Kim H. Rhee S. Williams L. Zetter B. Nature. 1994; 367: 464-476Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar) examined the same Y740F/Y751F mutation in chemotactic assays of a canine kidney epithelial cell line(16Kundra V. Escobedo J. Kazlauskas A. Kim H. Rhee S. Williams L. Zetter B. Nature. 1994; 367: 464-476Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Again, the chemotactic response was obliterated by an inability to activate the PI 3-K, as well as a mutant excluding activation of PLC. Here, we demonstrate that selective activation of PI 3-K initiates a chemotactic response, while coactivation of PI 3-K and PLC produces a marked increase in this response. Other signaling pathways important in cell movement involve the small GTP binding proteins Ras, Rac and Rho. In a recent study by Ridley et al.(19Ridley A. Comoglio P. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), microinjection of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with constituitively active Ras reproduced HGF-mediated ruffling but did not initiate cell scattering(19Ridley A. Comoglio P. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it may be that isolated activation of ras is sufficient to generate actin filament rearrangements but not actual cell movement. In agreement with this, our F5 PDGFR clones did not mediate PDGF-dependent chemotaxis, even though ras activation may occur via GRB2/hSos1 nucleotide exchange factor association at Y716SNA in the F5 receptor(20Arvidsson A. Rupp E. Nanberg E. Downward J. Ronnstrand L. Wennstrom S. Schlessinger J. Heldin C. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since both the F5 met and F3 receptors are capable of Grb2/hSos1/Ras activation, we cannot rule out a contributory or co-stimulatory effect of Ras activation on chemotaxis in these experiments. The c-met receptor mediates diverse phenotypic changes in several cell types including cell motility and tubule formation. An 11-amino acid sequence from this receptor, when phosphorylated in a ligand dependent manner, activates both PLC and the PI 3-K, triggering the intracellular events necessary for epithelial chemotaxis.

https://openalex.org/W2057719674,"Abstract We have isolated cDNA clones encoding novel proteins belonging to the cadherin family. These novel proteins are encoded by two distinct mRNA species generated by alternative splicing from a single gene, and based on preferential expression in the pituitary gland and brain, we named it PB-cadherin. One mRNA species encodes long type PB-cadherin composed of 803 amino acid residues with a longer cytoplasmic domain, whereas the other species encodes short type PB-cadherin composed of 694 amino acid residues with a shorter cytoplasmic domain. Both long and short type PB-cadherin contain five repeats of a cadherin motif in the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic domain, and the deduced amino acid sequences have a 30% homology to those of E-, N-, and P-cadherins. Although the primary structure of N-terminal amino acids is identical between long and short type PB-cadherin, the following structures in the cytoplasmic regions are completely different. The long type PB-cadherin but not the short type contains the putative catenin-binding domain. When these two distinct forms of PB-cadherins were stably expressed in L cells, L cells expressing long type PB-cadherin or short type PB-cadherin both acquired a Ca-dependent cell adhesion property, thereby indicating that both types of PB-cadherin are responsible for Ca-dependent cell adhesion. Persistent expression of PB-cadherin mRNA was found in the brain of rat embryos at least from embryonic day 15 to the postnatal period. In situ localization of PB-cadherin mRNA in the adult rat brain indicated that PB-cadherin mRNA is expressed in the inner granular layer of the olfactory bulb, Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the pineal gland. PB-cadherin may play an important role in morphogenesis and tissue formation in neural and non-neural cells for the development and maintenance of the brain and neuroendocrine organs by regulating cell-cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2119323806,"Replication forks formed in the absence of the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme produce shorter leading and lagging strands than when τ is present. We show that one reason for this is that in the absence of τ, but in the presence of the γ-complex, leading-strand synthesis is no longer highly processive. In the absence of τ, the size of the leading strand becomes proportional to the concentration of β and inversely proportional to the concentration of the γ-complex. In addition, the β in the leading-strand complex is no longer resistant to challenge by either anti-β antibodies or poly(dA):oligo(dT). Thus, τ is required to cement a processive leading-strand complex, presumably by preventing removal of β catalyzed by the γ-complex.

The replication fork of Escherichia coli is extraordinarily processive. Two replication forks form at oriC and synthesize roughly 2.2 megabase pairs of DNA before they meet again in the terminus region. The enzymatic machinery at the replication fork accomplishes this task while supporting two distinct modes of DNA synthesis.

Using rolling circle DNA replication supported by a tailed form II DNA template (TFII) and the ϕX-type primosomal proteins (PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG), the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), and either bona fide Pol III HE or HE reconstituted from purified subunits, we have reconstituted the coordinated leading- and lagging-strand synthesis of the E. coli replication fork(9Wu C.A.

These replication forks were shown to have processivities of at least 0.5 megabase, yet they also made Okazaki fragments whose average length was about 1.8 kb(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that the required protein elements for establishing processivity and triggering lagging-strand polymerase cycling were present. The mechanism for inducing polymerase release on the lagging strand is yet to be established firmly. We have proposed that protein-protein interactions between a primase synthesizing the primer for the next Okazaki fragment and the lagging-strand polymerase initiates termination of synthesis and keys recycling of the polymerase to the new primer(11Zechner E.L.

Stukenberg et al.(15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have made similar arguments for the E. coli fork. Challenge experiments have shown that both the polymerase and helicase on the leading-strand side of the fork are processive(16Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies have demonstrated that a protein-protein interaction between the τ subunit of the Pol III HE and DnaB is required to mediate rapid replication fork movement. ( 2Kim, S., Dallmann, H. G., McHenry, C. S., and Marians, K. J., Cell, in press.) We show here that τ contributes in yet another way to processivity on the leading strand by protecting β in the leading-strand polymerase complex from being removed by the action of the γ-complex.

TFII DNA template was prepared as described by Mok and Marians (16Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [3H]TTP. Rolling circle reaction mixtures (12 μl final volume) containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mM MgOAc, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 5 μM ATP, 80 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.1 μM SSB, 0.42 nM TFII, 3.2 nM DnaB, 56 nM DnaC, 680 nM DnaG (present only in the experiment shown in Fig. 1), 28 nM DnaT, 2.5 nM PriA, 2.5 nM PriB, 2.5 nM PriC, and HE subunits and subassemblies (formed by mixing purified subunits at equimolar ratios) at 28 nM unless indicated otherwise, were incubated at 30°C for 2 min. ATP was then added to 1 mM along with GTP, CTP, and UTP each to 200 μM and the dNTPs to 40 μM, and the incubation continued for 1.5 min. [α-32P]dATP (to 2000-4000 cpm/pmol) was then added and the incubation continued for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 40 mM. Total DNA synthesis was determined by acid-precipitating an aliquot of the reaction mixture, and the DNA products were analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reaction mixture (120 μl) containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mM MgOAc, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, 80 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μM each of CTP, UTP, and GTP, 40 μM dNTPs, 0.83 nM TFII, 82 nM β, 41 nM γ-complex, and 1.1 μM SSB, was incubated at 30°C for 10 min. This mixture was then filtered at room temperature through a 5-ml Bio-Gel A-150m column formed in a Falcon 5-ml pipette equilibrated and developed with a buffer containing 62.5 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 15 mM MgOAc, 12.5 mM dithiothreitol, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mM KCl, 6.25 μM ATP, and 50 μM each of dCTP and dGTP. Fractions (200 μl) were collected, and excluded material was located by identifying the presence of the [3H]TFII. Poly(dA):oligo(dT) was prepared by annealing 7 μM poly(dA) with 8.6 μM oligo(dT)20 in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-OAc (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 20 mM MgCl2 at 75°C for 2 min followed by slow cooling (2 h) to room temperature. A mixture (2 μl) of the preprimosomal proteins (the primosomal proteins in the absence of primase), SSB, core, and γ-complex, either in the presence or absence of τ, was added to 20 μl of the peak fraction of the β-TFII DNA complex to give their standard reaction concentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to 1 mM, GTP, CTP, and UTP each to 200 μM, and dATP and dTTP each to 40 μM, and incubated at 30°C for 1.5 min. [α-32P]dATP and poly(dA):oligo(dT)20 (to a final concentration of 120 nM 3′-ends), as indicated, were then added, and the reaction continued for 10 min at 30°C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 40 mM and processed and analyzed as described above. Standard rolling circle reaction mixtures were assembled either in the presence or absence of τ. The effect of the anti-β antibody on initiation was assessed by including it in the reaction mixture from the start, before the ATP concentration was raised and before the dNTPs and other NTPs were added. The effect of the antibody on elongation was determined by adding the antibody along with the [α-32P]dATP, 1.5 min after the reactions had been initiated. Reactions were processed and analyzed as described above. In the course of our studies on the roles of the subunits of the Pol III HE at the replication fork, we noted that replication forks formed in the absence of τ synthesized shorter leading and lagging strands than those reconstituted with τ (Fig. 1). We found that τ played a central role in ensuring the generation of a processive replication fork. A protein-protein interaction between τ and the replication fork helicase DnaB was required to mediate rapid fork movement2 and, as described here, in the absence of τ, the leading-strand side of the fork becomes nonprocessive. The processivity of the E. coli replication fork in vitro is reflected in its high rate of speed(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inaccessibility of β on the leading strand to challenge(16Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. J. Biol Chem. 1982; 257: 12310-12315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the insensitivity of the length of the leading strand to the concentration of β(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forks that lacked τ and free γ-complex were still processive.2 We examined whether this held true in the presence of added γ-complex as well. The length of the leading strand synthesized by τ-less replication forks was dependent on the concentration of the β subunit (Fig. 2). This is strikingly different from the situation in the presence of τ where, although overall DNA synthesis is dependent on β, the size of the leading strand is independent of the β concentration(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the leading-strand β-core complex needing to form only once for synthesis of a long continuous DNA product. This observation suggested that multiple βs were required in the absence of τ in order to synthesize the leading strand. That is, β was being cycled in and out of the leading-strand complex. The only group of proteins available in these reactions that could affect β loading onto 3′-ends was the γ-complex. It followed that it was the γ-complex that was removing β from the leading-strand complex as well. If this were true, then the size of the leading strand synthesized in the absence of τ should also be affected by the concentration of the γ-complex. This proved to be the case. In the presence of τ, the concentration of the γ-complex had no effect on leading-strand synthesis (Fig. 3A), whereas in the absence of τ, the size of the leading strand synthesized decreased progressively as the concentration of γ-complex increased (Fig. 3B). At the highest concentrations of γ-complex tested, DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited. These observations suggested that, in the absence of τ, β was being cycled on and off the leading strand by the action of the γ-complex. We used two types of challenges in order to test the processivity of replication forks formed in the absence of τ: anti-β antibody and poly(dA):oligo(dT)20. The former is, of course, specific for β, whereas the latter serves to capture β, core, and probably DnaB, all of which are normally processive on the leading strand(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replication forks capable of synthesizing leading strands were formed using a β-TFII DNA complex, the preprimosomal proteins (the primosomal proteins minus DnaG), SSB, core, and the γ-complex either in the presence or absence of τ. After 1.5 min, the poly(dA):oligo(dT)20 challenge was added. Forks formed in the presence of τ were completely resistant to the challenge (Fig. 4). On the other hand, those formed in the absence of τ were sensitive, as evidenced by the sharply reduced size of the leading-strand product (Fig. 4). This demonstrated that, in the absence of τ, at least one of the normally processive enzymatic components on the leading strand was now acting distributively. The data described above suggested that this component was β. To assess this, we repeated the challenge experiment using anti-β antibody. β becomes inaccessible to anti-β antibody once it forms an initiation complex with core(24Engstrom J. Wong A. Maurer R. Genetics. 1985; 113: 449-515Google Scholar). We used this observation previously to show that the β on the leading strand was processive, i.e. it was insensitive to the presence of the antibody (16Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We repeated those experiments here using standard rolling circle replication reactions reconstituted in either the absence or presence of τ (Fig. 5). In each case, replication was inhibited if the anti-β antibody was added before initiation. However, if the anti-β antibody was added 1.5 min after initiation, only replication forks formed in the presence of τ were resistant, those formed in its absence were inhibited almost completely. These data show that τ-less replication forks are nonprocessive because the β in the leading-strand complex has now become vulnerable to disassembly catalyzed by the γ-complex. During DNA replication, the processivity of the replication fork arises from two contributing sources: the DNA helicase and the leading-strand polymerase. We have recently shown that rapid fork movement requires a physical connection between the polymerase and the helicase that is mediated by a τ-DnaB protein-protein interaction.2 In the absence of this interaction, the polymerase follows behind the helicase at a rate equal to the slow (ca. 40 nt/s) unwinding rate of the helicase alone, whereas upon establishing a τ-DnaB contact, DnaB becomes a more effective helicase, increasing its translocation rate by more than ten-fold. We show here that τ also contributes directly to the processivity of the leading-strand polymerase by preventing the γ-complex-catalyzed removal of β from the leading strand. In the absence of τ, the length of the leading strand was dependent on the concentration of β and inversely proportional to the concentration of the γ-complex. In the presence of τ, the concentrations of these subunits had no effect on leading-strand synthesis(9Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that at a τ-less replication fork, β, and probably core, were being reused to synthesize the leading strand in short bursts. The distributive nature of the τ-less replication fork was demonstrated directly in challenge experiments. Thus, not only is τ essential for maintaining a high rate of fork movement,2 it is also essential for maintaining the leading-strand β-core complex in a form that is resistant to the action of the γ-complex. This suggests that, at least on the leading strand, τ may contact β, perhaps covering a face of the protein that is essential for interaction with the γ-complex. This is consistent with the genetic finding that mutations in dnaX (encoding both τ and γ) can be suppressed by mutations in dnaN (encoding β)(24Engstrom J. Wong A. Maurer R. Genetics. 1985; 113: 449-515Google Scholar). Our recent studies show that the C-terminal domain of α binds both τ and β, thus placing them in proximity and presumably permitting direct protection.3 Alternatively, τ contacting core (probably via α) causes a rearrangement of the β-core complex. It is not clear when, at a τ-less replication fork, β becomes available for attack by the γ-complex. In the absence of both τ and the γ-complex, the leading-strand β-core assembly is processive for at least 20 kb, following along on the DNA behind the slow moving helicase.2 It has also been shown that the combination of β and core will synthesize full-length product in a single binding event on poly(dA):oligo(dT)(5Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the τ-less leading-strand polymerase moves fitfully behind the helicase, occasionally stalling, and occasionally jumping ahead, and it is while the polymerase is stalled that β can be targeted by the γ-complex for recycling. On the other hand, in the absence of τ, β may be bound less tightly to the pol III core, occasionally dissociating and diffusing away unidirectionally. Reassociation with the core would be rapid because of the constraints imposed by diffusion in two-dimensional space along the DNA fiber. It may be that β is removed by γ-complex while diffusing on the DNA. In solution, τ dimerizes the core to give Pol III′(25McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this structure is similar at the fork, then the core-β complex on the lagging strand should be affected by τ in a similar fashion as the core-β complex on the leading strand. Thus, the lagging-strand polymerase should be refractory to recycling. Yet, this is clearly not the case. The lagging-strand core has been shown to cycle from the just-completed Okazaki fragment to the next primer terminus(12Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Hughes Jr., A.J. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4064-4073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely, then, that mechanisms exist on the lagging strand that override the protective effect of τ. These mechanisms could take one of many forms. Conformational rearrangements could occur upon termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis, by whatever mechanism, that expose the lagging-strand core-β to disassembly by the γ-complex. On the other hand, it may be that the protective effect of τ is specific to the leading-strand polymerase. Stukenberg et al.(15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) demonstrated that β would dissociate from core when the polymerase collided with the 5′-end of a DNA strand bound to a template, a situation similar to the lagging-strand polymerase colliding with the 5′-triphosphate end of the primer on the previous Okazaki fragment. These experiments were conducted using Pol III∗ and β on gapped duplex bacteriophage RF DNA. τ was present, yet disassembly of the core-β complex occurred. Thus, τ does not prevent recycling. This suggests that, in solution, and when a dimeric HE subassembly binds a primer end, the polymerase bound to the primer cannot sense, a priori, whether it should be a leading- or a lagging-strand polymerase. Functional asymmetry that defines the leading- and lagging-strand polymerase may arise from a protein-protein interaction that is established between a properly oriented τ and DnaB. Establishment of this contact literally cements the replication fork together, activating the helicase and ensuring rapid fork movement, as well as causing a rearrangement that makes β refractory to the action of the γ-complex."
https://openalex.org/W2070442975,"The GA-binding protein (GABP), a heterodimeric transcription factor with widespread tissue distribution, has been found to be a strong positive regulator of several ribosomal protein (rp)-encoding genes. In such genes, e.g. the mouse rpL30 gene, the GABP-binding sites are located 40-80 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start point. Potential GABP-binding sites are present in the promoters of numerous other rp genes, not only in upstream regions, but also in the immediate vicinity of the transcriptional start point. The mouse rpS16 gene is an example of the latter type. We demonstrate here that GABP binds to the rpS16 initiation region, and in so doing down-regulates rpS16 transcription both in vivo and in vitro. Supplementation of cell-free extracts with GABP inhibits transcription on rpS16 templates while concomitantly stimulating transcription on rpL30 templates. The repressive and stimulatory effects, which were proportional to the amount of GABP added, required both the GABP α subunit and either a β1 or β2 subunit. Mutations of the rpS16 GABP-binding sites that abolish binding increased rpS16 promoter activity in vivo and in vitro, whereas mutations that strengthen GABP binding caused a reduction in promoter activity. The binding of GABP to the rpS16 initiation region does not significantly affect the positioning of the transcriptional start points.

Subsequently, a search for CGGAAR motifs in the proximal promoter regions of other mammalian rp genes revealed many potential GABP-binding sites(7Genuario R.R. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). While most of these sites are located upstream of the transcriptional-start point, as they are in rpL30 and rpL32, in five genes (mouse rpS16 and rpL7, human rpS6 and rpS14 and chicken rpS15) they are situated in the immediate vicinity of the transcriptional start point. It was previously observed that mutations in this region of the rpS16 promoter can influence the efficiency and precision of transcription both in vivo(10Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and in vitro(11Chung S. Perry R.P. Gene (Amst). 1991; 100: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, these mutations were not suitable for assessing the role of GABP in promoter function because they also disrupted the integrity of the polypyrimidine/purine initiator, which is a common feature of all vertebrate rp genes. We were therefore interested in determining whether GABP binds to the rpS16 initiation region and if so, how it influences the efficiency and precision of transcription. Here we show that GABP binds to the initiation region of rpS16 by virtue of interactions with a weak (nonconsensus) binding motif that overlaps the start points and a stronger motif that is immediately downstream of the start points (Fig. 1). By constructing various mutated versions of these motifs and studying their effects on both GABP binding and rpS16 promoter function in vitro and in vivo, we further demonstrate that occupation of the binding site by either tetrameric or dimeric GABP causes a significant reduction in rpS16 promoter activity, apparently by interfering with the formation of the transcriptional initiation complex. Consistent with these observations, we found that supplementation of in vitro transcription reactions with GABP represses rpS16 transcription while concomitantly stimulating transcription of rpL30. Thus, it would appear that GABP can have a dual role as repressor or activator of ribosomal protein gene transcription. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a repressive role for GABP in transcriptional regulation. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells by the method of Shapiro et al.(12Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli expression vectors for GABP subunits and anti-GABP antibodies were generously provided by Catherine Thompson and Steve McKnight. Individual GABP subunits were expressed in E. coli and purified as described in Thompson et al.(1Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with one modification: GABPβ1 was additionally purified on a FPLC Superose 12 column. GABP subunits were stored in 20% glycerol, 12.5 mM Hepes-K+ (pH 7.9), 0.2 mM EDTA, and 50 mM KCl. GABP subunits were judged to be >90% pure based on Coomassie Blue staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. GABP binding was determined by EMSA in 25-μl volumes that contained 20 mM Hepes-K+ (pH 7.9), 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1-0.5 ng of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC). Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 15 min with native GABP as indicated or recombinant GABP subunits (approximately 3 ng each). The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE). Antibody supershift experiments were carried out as described previously(7Genuario R.R. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of GABP•DNA complexes was determined essentially as described in Thompson et al.(1Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2) were maintained in spinner culture at a density of approximately 5 × 105/ml in spinner-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and antibiotics. S194 mouse plasmacytoma cells (ATCC TIB19) were maintained in suspension culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and antibiotics. Approximately 3 × 107 S194 cells were transfected with 10 μg of wild-type or mutant rpS16 plasmid and 5 μg of rpL30 plasmid by the DEAE-dextran procedure(13Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1985; 41: 885-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 40 to 48 h after transfection. For isolation of cytoplasmic RNA, cell pellets were washed with phosphate buffered saline and suspended in 500 μl of a solution containing 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were immediately removed by a 5-min centrifugation at 2,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Supernatants were recovered, and SDS and EDTA were added to 0.5% and 5 mM, respectively. Proteinase K (10 μg) was then added, and after a 15-min incubation at 37°C, the reactants were extracted twice with phenol-chloroform; the RNA was then precipitated with ethanol. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an immobolin-P filter using a semidry blotter. After transfer, the filter was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (TBS)) containing 5% dry milk for 1 h. It was then incubated for 1 h in TBS containing a 1/500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against either the GABPα or GABPβ1 subunit. The filter was washed extensively with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) and then incubated with a 1/5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The filter was then processed using an ECL Western blotting analysis system according to the manufacturer. Probes for DNase I footprinting were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers 5′ and 3′ to the GABP binding sites. Either the sense or antisense primer was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase prior to PCR. An equimolar amount of GABPα and GABPβ1 subunits were incubated with the 32P-labeled DNA fragment under conditions described for EMSA except reactions were scaled-up 5-fold. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to 5 mM each and protein-bound DNA and free DNA were partially digested with DNase I. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE. Free DNA and protein-bound DNA were identified, recovered by electroelution, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. Dideoxy sequencing markers generated with the same oligonucleotide primers used for PCR were run in parallel as markers. GABP was purified from the S100 fraction of HeLa cells, which is a side product of nuclear extract preparation(12Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). S100 (approximately 1 g) derived from 50 liters of HeLa cells was pooled and loaded onto a 100-ml phosphocellulose (P11) column equilibrated in buffer D (10% glycerol (v/v), 20 mM Hepes-K+ (pH 7.9), 0.2 mM EDTA) containing 0.1 M NaCl. The P11 column was washed with three column volumes of buffer D containing 0.1 M NaCl and bound protein was eluted by sequential elution with buffer D containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl. Column fractions were monitored for GABP binding by EMSA using an rpS16 initiator oligonucleotide probe (−11 to +13). GABP was recovered in the P11 flow-through and 0.1 M NaCl wash, which were pooled and applied to a 50-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer D containing 0.1 M NaCl. The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer D containing 0.1 M NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in buffer D. Fractions containing the bulk of GABP, eluting at approximately 0.8 M NaCl, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D containing 0.1 NaCl. This fraction was then subjected to two rounds of DNA affinity chromatography (14Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) using a catenated oligonucleotide containing rpS16 sequences −11 to +18. The purity of GABP was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with silver. Using this procedure, we recovered approximately 20 μg of highly purified GABP. Supercoiled plasmids (3 μg) were transcribed in 100-μl reactions containing 20 mM Hepes-K+ (pH 7.9), 6 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 8 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1.2% polyethylene glycol (20,000), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 6 mM rNTPs, and 20 μl of nuclear extract (5-8 μg/ml) at 28°C for 1 h. When reactions were supplemented with GABP, reaction conditions were adjusted accordingly. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (10 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.2% SDS, 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA), extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. All experiments were performed with three different preparations of nuclear extract to verify reproducibility. In vitro synthesized RNA or 50 μg of cytoplasmic RNA was suspended in 25 μl of hybridization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing approximately 0.5 ng (20,000 cpm) of a 5′-end-labeled primer (5′-CTCCATTTTAGCTTCCTTAGCTCC-3′) complementary to cat vector sequences, heated to 65°C for 10 min, and then allowed to cool to 42°C. The annealed primer was extended by the addition of an equal volume of elongation mix (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 4 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mM dNTPs) containing 0.5 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42°C for 1 h. The extended products (86 and 224 nucleotides, respectively, for rpS16 and rpL30 templates) were recovered by ethanol precipitation and analyzed on a 5% sequencing gel. Gels were dried and analyzed with a Fuji PhosphorImager and by autoradiography. For quantitation of the transfection data, the rpS16 signals were normalized to the corresponding signal from a cotransfected rpL30 construct in order to correct for variations in transfection efficiency and RNA yield. The normalization equation was “Wild-type” constructs rpS16 c-CAT (−179 to +29) (15Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5323-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and rpL30 g-CAT (−205 to +167) (16Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Both of these constructs utilize the cat expression vector p106 and contain all the elements required for maximal promoter activity. Individual rpS16 mutants were generated by PCR as described in Genuario et al.(7Genuario R.R. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). Each site-directed mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All plasmids were purified by two rounds of CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation. The following oligonucleotides were used for binding assays in this study. Mutations are shown in lower case. rpS16(−11 to +18) wild type, (5′-AATTCCCCGCGCTTCCCTTTTCCGGTCGCGGCG-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAAGGGAAAAGGCCAGCGCCGCTTAA-5′); rpS16 cm8, (5′-CCCCGCGCTTCCCTTTTCgGGTCGCGGCGCTGCGGTGTGGAGCT-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAAGGGAAAAGcCCAGCGCCGCGACGCCACACC-5′); rpS16 cm9, (5′-CCCCGCGCTTCCgTTTTCCGGTCGCGGCGCTGCGGTGT-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAAGGcAAAAGGCCAGCGCCGCGACGCCACACC-5′); rpS16 cm10, (5′-CCCCGCGCTTCCCTTTCCGGTCGCGGCGCTGCGGTGT-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAAGGGAAAGGCCAGCGCCGCGACGCCACACC-5′); rpS16 cm11, (5′-AATTCCCCGCGCTTCCgTTTTCgGGTCGCGG-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAAGGcAAAAGcCCAGCGCCTTAA-5′); rpS16 cm12, (5′-AATTCCCCGCGCTcCCCTTTTCCGGTCGCGG-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAgGGGAAAAGGCCAGCGCCTTAA-5′); rpS16 cm13, (5′-AATTCCCCGCGCTcCCCTTTTCgGGTCGCGG-3′) and (3′-GGGGCGCGAgGGGAAAAGcCCAGCGCCTTAA-5′); rpL30(−70 to −37) wild type, (5′-AATTGCTTCTCTTCCGCTTCCGGTCCCACAATCCTCTG-3′) and (3′-CGAAGAGAAGGCGAAGGCCAGGGTGTTAGGAGACTTAA-5′). Several pieces of evidence demonstrated that GABP binds to the rpS16 promoter. First, recombinant GABP subunits were used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a DNA probe containing the rpS16 −11 to +18 DNA sequence. As shown in Fig. 2A, recombinant GABP subunits bind to the rpS16 probe and form protein-DNA complexes that are identical to those formed on an rpL30 DNA segment that binds GABP as a dimer (GABP(αβ)) and tetramer (GABP(αβ)2) at two contiguous GABP binding sites (see Fig. 1)(7Genuario R.R. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). Second, affinity chromatography on rpS16 initiator-specific DNA columns was used to purify GABP. The purified protein formed two distinct protein-DNA complexes: a faster-migrating complex (L) that shifted to a slower-migrating complex (U) with increasing amounts of protein (Fig. 2B). The mobilities of these complexes were indistinguishable from those formed with recombinant GABP subunits when the purified and recombinant proteins were analyzed simultaneously on the same gel. Third, two polypeptides with molecular masses of 55 and 45 kDa, similar to that of GABPα and GABPβ1, were highly enriched in the DNA affinity-purified material (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis demonstrated that these polypeptides are similar in both size and immunological reactivity to GABPα (Fig. 2D) and GABPβ1 (Fig. 2E). As seen in Fig. 2E, four discrete species of affinity-purified protein reacted with the GABPβ-specific antiserum. Most likely, these represent the variant GABPβ isoforms characterized by other investigators(8de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Finally, the complexes formed with the purified native protein were specifically supershifted by antibodies raised against either recombinant GABPα or GABPβ subunits (Fig. 3). These results provide compelling evidence that the rpS16 promoter contains two GABP sites and can bind GABP as both a dimer and a tetramer.Figure 3:Electrophoretic mobility of rpS16-protein complexes is supershifted by GABP-specific antibodies.

The positions of the tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric complexes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNase I footprinting with recombinant GABP subunits was used to further characterize the binding of GABP to the rpS16 initiator region. Analysis of a tetramer of GABP bound to the rpS16 DNA probe (GABP(αβ)2; see Fig. 2A) revealed that only the site centered at +6 was protected from digestion (Fig. 4A). The lack of protection of the site centered at −2 suggested that the protein-DNA interaction in this region is relatively weak and unstable. To determine if this weak interaction is due to the presence of a nonconsensus G at +2, we changed the G to a C to match the consensus GABP motif (GGGAAG to CGGAAG), and characterized the footprint of the mutant construct. The footprint of this mutant (cm9; see Fig. 8) was much broader than that observed with the wild-type construct and encompassed both GABP sites (Fig. 4B), thus confirming that the G at +2 does indeed weaken the binding of GABP. These data indicate that the rpS16 promoter contains a weak (+2 to −4) and a relatively strong (+9 to +4) GABP-binding site, which together permit the formation of tetrameric complexes at the transcriptional start site. The dimeric complexes are exclusively located at the stronger site, as indicated by additional footprint analysis (data not shown) and mutational studies (see below).Figure 8:Effect of mutations on GABP binding. Upper panel, rGABP was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing wild-type sites or sites with point mutations. The reactants were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE. Complexes corresponding to tetramers ((αβ)2), dimers (αβ), and monomers (α) are indicated. Lower panel, summary of GABP site mutants used in the study. For the ease of comparison, the sequence of the rpS16 antisense strand is shown. The large and small arrows represent the major and minor rpS16 transcriptional initiation sites. Lower case letters indicate mutations; D and U refer to the downstream and upstream sites, respectively; - and + represent mutations designed to abolish or increase GABP binding, respectively. The consensus binding motif for GABP (8de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is shown at the bottom of the figure (R = purine).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A previous analysis of tetrameric GABP complexes formed on the rpL30 promoter (7Genuario R.R. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar) showed a broad footprint, similar to that seen with the cm9 mutant of rpS16. Thus, a comparison of footprint data indicates that the GABP tetrameric complexes formed on the rpS16 promoter are less stable than those formed on the rpL30 promoter. A difference in stability was also evident from the results of a kinetic competition experiment (Fig. 5). In this experiment, 84% of the rpS16 tetramers dissociated by 0.5 min, compared to 44% dissociation of the rpL30 tetramers. By 8 min, the fraction of residual rpS16 tetramer was about 0.1 that of the rpL30 tetramer. The decay of the tetramers in this experiment was not strictly first-order, as one might expect on theoretical grounds, possibly due to inadequate mixing at the later time points. For this reason, it is not possible to obtain a precise quantitative estimate of the difference in stability from these data. Nevertheless, it is clear that the GABP tetramers formed on the rpS16 initiator region are relatively unstable compared to tetramers formed on the upstream binding site of the rpL30 promoter. Indeed, the stability of the rpS16 tetramers is similar to that of dimeric complexes formed on either the rpS16 or rpL30 promoters (data not shown). To evaluate the role of GABP in rpS16 transcription, we carried out a series of experiments in which cell-free transcription reactions were supplemented with bacterially synthesized GABP. As a positive control, we examined the effect of GABP supplementation on rpL30 transcription reactions. Consistent with the role of GABP as a positive activator, rpL30 transcription was strongly stimulated when GABP was added to the transcription reaction (Fig. 6A). The stimulation was proportional to the amount of GABP added (lanes 8-10), was dependent on both GABP subunits (lanes 2-7) and required an intact GABP binding site (data not shown). In marked contrast to the stimulation of rpL30 transcription, GABP strongly repressed rpS16 transcription (Fig. 6B). The extent of repression was proportional to the amount of GABP added (lanes 8-10), and the repressive effect required both GABP subunits (lanes 2-7). The inverse effect of GABP supplementation on rpL30 and rpS16 transcription was dramatically illustrated by an experiment in which GABP was added to a single reaction containing both templates (Fig. 6C, lanes 1-3). In a parallel reaction, GABP had no effect on the transcription of a mutant rpS16 template, cm13 (see Fig. 8), which lacks GABP binding sites (Fig. 6C, lanes 4-6). These results indicate that the repressive effect of GABP requires binding to the template and that it is not due to a nonspecific squelching phenomenon. We also observed inverse effects on rpS16 and rpL30 transcription when GABPα and β2 subunits were added to the reaction. Since β2 lacks the homodimerization domain of the β1 subunit, α and β2 do not form a stable tetrameric complex on the rpS16 initiator region. Nevertheless, they form a readily detectable dimeric complex (Fig. 7A). This binding occurs at the stronger downstream site and is completely eliminated when this site is destroyed in the cm8 mutant (see below). As shown in Fig. 7B, the GABPαβ2 dimers repressed rpS16 transcription (lanes 5-7), although not quite as effectively as the αβ1 complexes (lanes 2-4). As expected, rpL30 transcription was stimulated by the GABPαβ2 dimers under the same conditions. These results indicate that dimeric complexes at the downstream site are sufficient to elicit a repressive effect. The effect is apparently potentiated when αβ1 tetramers can be formed. The foregoing results indicate that when GABP binds to the rpS16 initiator transcription is repressed. This conclusion was further supported by the results of mutational experiments. In these experiments we produced a series of mutations in the GABP-binding sites and studied their effects on both GABP binding and rpS16 promoter activity. The mutations (Fig. 8, bottom) were designed to alter the characteristics of GABP binding while preserving, insofar as possible, the integrity of the polypyrimidine/polypurine tract that spans the start points(10Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Single base pair substitutions in the core GGAA of the GABP motifs (cm8, cm11, cm12, and cm13) were used to abolish binding at one or both sites; such point mutations were previously shown to effectively eliminate GABP binding in the rpL30 and rpL32 promoters(7Genuario R.R. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a single base pair mutation, namely, substitution of a C for the nonconsensus G was used to strengthen the weak upstream site in cm9 and cm11. Finally in cm10, the sites were made contiguous by a single base pair deletion. The effects of the various mutations on GABP binding were determined by an EMSA analysis (Fig. 8, top). As expected, no GABP binding was detected with cm13 (lane 7), and tetramer formation was eliminated in cm11 and cm12 (lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, the cm8 mutation abolished dimer, as well as tetramer, formation (lane 2; also see Fig. 7A), indicating th"

The interactions were monitored both indirectly, by measuring the effects of the presequences on the ATPase activity and oligomeric state of the enzyme, and directly, by measuring the increased steady-state fluorescence polarization of fluorescent derivatives of the presequences as they bind to Ssa1p. The presequences are all able to convert Ssa1p from an oligomeric to a monomeric form in a concentration-dependent manner. The presequences are also able to stimulate the ATPase activity of the enzyme at similar concentrations. Quantification of the binding by fluorescence polarization showed that the affinity for Ssa1p is directly related to the physical properties of the presequences. The most amphiphilic presequences, as measured by retention times on reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography or surface activity in lipid monolayers, had the highest affinity for Ssa1p. The least amphiphilic presequences, which had previously been shown to be ineffective as mitochondrial targeting sequences, had relatively low affinity for Ssa1p. The results show that Ssa1p interacts with a broad range of amino acid sequences and that the strength of these interactions is related to the physical properties of the sequence. That the physical properties recognized by Ssa1p are identical to those necessary for the targeting function of mitochondrial presequences suggests that Ssa1p may interact with mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol.

Fragile sites, also known as folate-sensitive sites, are chromosomal aberrations that condense poorly during metaphase and can break under specific experimental conditions(8Sutherland G.R. Am. J.

All fragile sites identified so far have been found to be associated with amplifications of the simple unstable tandem repeat 5′-d(CGG)n-3′. In the fragile X syndrome, the expanded tandem repeat 5′-d(CGG)n-3′ is located in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionFHMfat head minnowAd12adenovirus type 12bpbase pair(s)EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysCGGBP(s)CGG binding protein(s)mC5-methyldeoxycytidine.) of the FMR1 gene in the human chromosomal location Xq27.3(13Verkerk A.J.M.H.

The number of repeat units varies between 6 and 54 in normal individuals, whereas more than 200 to up to 2000 repeat units can be found in affected individuals. Expansion of the repeat is accompanied by extensive methylation of the 5′-dCG-3′ dinucleotides in the repeat (14Oberlé I. Rousseau F. Heitz D. Kretz C. Devys D. Hanauer A. Boué J. Bertheas M.F.

The cellular mechanism of triplet repeat amplification is not understood. Interestingly, procaryotic DNA polymerases are capable of expanding short synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing simple tandem repeat sequences to DNA stretches of several thousand nucleotides in lengths even in the absence of template DNA(21Behn-Krappa A.

In transgenic mice for instance, a 5′-d(CAG)45-3′ repeat in the androgene receptor gene is stable upon transmission in the mouse, whereas it is expanding upon transmission in humans(25Bingham P.M.

The authors suggest the involvement of sequence-specific, probably species-specific, DNA-binding proteins in the amplification reaction. Experiments with crude nuclear extracts from human HeLa cells indeed have shown binding of proteins to tandem repeat sequences(26Richards R.I. Holman K. Yu S. Sutherland G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, an amplified 5′-d(CTG)-3′ repeat is a preferential target for nucleosome assembly(27Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1994; 265: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have initiated experiments to characterize and purify human nuclear proteins that bind specifically to the double-stranded 5′-d(CGG)n-3′ repeat. Such proteins are present in a variety of human and other mammalian cell lines, as well as in primary cells. Human HeLa cells were purchased from Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany. Human KB and Jurkat cells, BHK21 hamster cells, and fat head minnow (FHM) fish cells (29Schetter C. Grünemann B. Hölker I. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6973-6978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were propagated by standard methods. Primary human lymphocytes were prepared and grown as reported(30Behn-Krappa A. Hölker I. Sandaradura de Silva U. Doerfler W. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hamster cell line T637, an adenovirus type 12 (Ad12)-transformed BHK21 cell line, and the revertants of cell line T637, TR3, and TR12, with no detectable and about one genome equivalent of integrated Ad12 DNA, respectively(31Eick D. Stabel S. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1980; 36: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were all grown in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cell lines 293 and HEK12, human embryonic kidney cells transformed with parts of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) (32Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer. Hybridization to form double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides was carried out in a polymerase chain reaction thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus) under the following conditions: 10 min at 95°C, cooling to 70°C for 60 min, 60 min at 70°C, cooling to 58°C for 60 min, 60 min at 58°C, cooling to 17°C for 90 min, 60 min at 17°C. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were subsequently purified by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels according to standard procedures. The compositions of the synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this study and the abbrevations to designate them were summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Open table in a new tab DNA fragments were isolated from the plasmid pE5.1, which was a gift from Stephen T. Warren, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. This plasmid contained a 5′-d(CGG)16-3′ repeat in exon 1 of the human FMR1 gene and flanking genomic DNA sequences(13Verkerk A.J.M.H. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Fu Y.-H. Kuhl D.P.A. Pizzuti A. Reiner O. Richards S. Victoria M.F. Zhang F. Eussen B.E. van Ommen G.-J. B. Blonden L.A.J. Riggins G.J. Chastain J.L. Kunst C.B. Galjaard H. Caskey C.T. Nelson D.L. Oostra B.A. Warren S.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2826) Google Scholar). The plasmid was cut with NarI, and the excised 441-bp fragment was isolated. This fragment was subsequently treated with RsaI or BfaI to yield a 198-bp (198ds) or a 126-bp (126ds) fragment, respectively. To obtain the 248-bp (248ds) fragment, the plasmid was first cleaved with RsaI, and the resulting fragment was isolated and cut with DdeI. A restriction map illustrating the derivation of these fragments was presented in Fig. 1. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP. DNA fragments were labeled at the 3′-end with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim) and α-[32P]dATP or α-[32P]dCTP according to standard procedures. The specific activity of the DNA probes was 107 cpm/pmol. All procedures were carried out at 4°C, unless stated otherwise. Nuclei were isolated from cells according to Dignam et al.(34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9129) Google Scholar) and Barrett et al.(35Barrett P. Clark L. Hey R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2719-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) by lysing the cells either in hypotonic buffer A (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 M sucrose, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.9) in 0.25-0.5% Triton X-100 or by disintegrating the cells in a tight fitting glass Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 15 min. Nuclei were washed 3 times with Triton-free buffer B (same as buffer A, except 0.35 M sucrose) and extracted on ice for 30 min in buffer C (buffer A, without sucrose, containing 420 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol). The supernatant of the subsequent centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min was dialyzed for 3 h against buffer W (buffer A without sucrose, containing 80 mM KCl and 20% glycerol). The dialysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Under these conditions, DNA binding activity of proteins was stable. Protein concentrations were measured by standard procedures(36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from KB and BHK21 cells infected with Ad12 were gifts from Sabine Huppertz, those from the insect cell line IPLBSF21 (SF21) were from Andreas Kremer, and those of FHM cells were from Mark Munnes, all at the Institute of Genetics in Cologne. For the purification of HeLa cell proteins (designated CGGBP(s) = 5′-d(CGG)n-3′ds binding proteins) that bind to the double-stranded 5′-d(CGG)n-3′ repeat, crude nuclear extracts isolated from 2 × 109 cells (20 mg of protein) were equilibrated in buffer QA (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Tween-20, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.9) using NAP-10 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or Econo DP10-columns (Bio-Rad) and subsequently loaded on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer QA. Proteins binding to the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds (see Table 1) eluted in the flow-through (fraction I, see Fig. 4). DNA affinity Sepharose was prepared by coupling 400 μg of the 3′-amino modified oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CGG)17ds, CGG8Ads, or (CAG)17ds covalently to 1 ml of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose beads (HiTrap; Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The material was equilibrated in buffer QA immediately before use. Proteins were bound and eluted in a batch procedure, washing and elution were performed in spin columns (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Active fraction I was incubated with CGG8Ads-Sepharose (250 μl) in the presence of 200 μg of poly(dA•dT) for 1 h. Unbound proteins containing CGGBP(s) (fraction II) were then incubated with 100 μl of (CGG)17ds-Sepharose either at 4°C for 4 h or at room temperature for 1 h. The material was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 1 ml of buffer W 100 (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Tween-20, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.9), and subsequently washed twice with 1 ml of buffer W 150 (same as W 100 but with 150 mM NaCl and 100 pmol of an unrelated oligodeoxyribonucleotide). CCGBP(s) were eluted as fraction III from the resin in 100 μl of buffer E 750 and partly in 100 μl of buffer E 1000 (same as W 100 but with 750 mM and 1 M NaCl, respectively). After equilibration of fraction III in buffer W 100 supplemented with 0.4% Tween-20, proteins were again bound to 20 μl of (CGG)17ds-Sepharose. Binding, washing and elution were carried out as described above, but smaller volumes of the buffers W 100 (1 ml) and W 150 (100 μl) were used. CGGBP(s) eluted in 20 μl of buffer E 750 to yield fraction IV. Only low activity remained after elution with buffer E 1000 (fraction IV). Active fractions I to IV were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar) followed by silver staining. End-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides or DNA fragments (30,000 cpm, equivalent to 2 fmol), unspecific DNA (poly(dA•dT) or poly(dI•dC), 1 μg) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mM HEPES, 50-100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9, with 0.5-2 μg of protein from crude nuclear extracts or 1 μl of fractions I to IV. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels (T% = 5% for the separation of oligodeoxyribonucleotides, T% = 4% for DNA fragments, C% = 5%) in 1 × TEB (89 mM Tris, 89 mM H3BO3, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.4) without the addition of loading dye. T% was acrylamide + bis-acrylamide per volume; C% was bis-acrylamide per acrylamide + bis-acrylamide. Gels were dried and exposed for 2-48 h on Kodak XAR films. Influence of sodium deoxycholate on complex formation was tested as described previously(38Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts or fraction I were incubated with labeled DNA fragments as described above for 10 min. Different amounts of sodium deoxycholate were then added in the absence or presence of 0.6% Nonidet P-40, the mixture was incubated for another 30 min and subsequently analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The monoclonal antibody against the human transcription factor Sp1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Crude nuclear extracts or fraction I or III were incubated with the specific DNA fragment as described above in the presence of the anti-Sp1 antibody (0.3-1 μg) for 60 min at room temperature. Complexes were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. We have examined nuclear extracts from various human and other mammalian cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) for the presence of proteins that bind to the double-stranded 5′-d(CGG)n-3′ repeat located in the exon 1 of the human FMR1 gene(13Verkerk A.J.M.H. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Fu Y.-H. Kuhl D.P.A. Pizzuti A. Reiner O. Richards S. Victoria M.F. Zhang F. Eussen B.E. van Ommen G.-J. B. Blonden L.A.J. Riggins G.J. Chastain J.L. Kunst C.B. Galjaard H. Caskey C.T. Nelson D.L. Oostra B.A. Warren S.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2826) Google Scholar). For this purpose, DNA fragments containing a 5′-d(CGG)16-3′ repeat and the flanking genomic sequences from the 5′-UTR of the human FMR1 gene (Fig. 1) or double-stranded, repetitive oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Table 1) were used. In order to ensure formation of the double strand, the repetitive single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides were hybridized under controlled conditions at high annealing temperatures. Double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides migrated according to their sizes in native polyacrylamide or NuSieve agarose gels, whereas the single-stranded 5′-d(CNG)n-3′ oligodeoxyribonucleotides showed increased mobility (data not shown; (39Mitchell J.E. Newbury S.F. McClellan J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1876-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). Binding of nuclear proteins to the synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds and the FMR1 promoter derived DNA fragment 198ds was demonstrated by EMSA (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, a and c). Specificity of binding was ascertained by competition experiments using the unlabeled homologous oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds and additional synthetic products containing different tandem repeat sequences as competitors (Fig. 3, a and c). Nuclear proteins isolated from the established human cell lines HeLa, C4/I, KB, Jurkat, A549, 293, HEK12, an amnion tumor-derived cell line, as well as from primary human lymphocytes gave rise to the specific DNA-protein complex I (Fig. 2a, cI) after incubation with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds. Formation of complex I could be competed by the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds in at least 75-fold excess, but not by several oligodeoxyribonucleotides with different sequences (Fig. 3a). Additional DNA-protein complexes apparent in EMSAs shown in Fig. 2a were not specific as shown by competition experiments (Fig. 3a). Extracts from non-human cells like hamster BHK21 cells and rat embryo fibroblasts REF12 produced the same patterns as those from human cells (Fig. 2b). However, proteins from monkey Vero cells, from nonmammalian FHM fish cells, and from the insect cell line SF21 generated specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2b), which were different from those with proteins from human cell lines.Figure 3:Specific binding of nuclear proteins to the double-stranded trinucleotide repeat 5′-d(CGG)17-3′. Binding of nuclear proteins from HeLa cells to the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds (a), to the fully methylated oligodeoxyribonucleotide (MGG)17ds (b), or to the promoter-derived DNA fragment 198ds (c) led to the formation of several specific DNA-protein complexes. a, complex I (cI) with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds could be competed only with oligodeoxyribonucleotides of the general structures (CGG)nds (n ≥ 12) and (CGGNGG)8CGGds (with n = T or 5-methyldeoxycytidine). Oligodeoxyribonucleotide (MGG)17ds containing the fully methylated trinucleotide repeat 5′-d(mCGG)17-3′ did not function as a competitor. b, CGGBP(s) did not bind to the fully methylated repeat 5′-d(mCGG)17-3′ in the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (MGG)17ds. Fraction I (see Fig. 4) was incubated with either (CGG)17ds (lane 2) or (MGG)17ds (lane 4); complex formation was only observed with (CGG)17ds. Specific complexes MI and MIII were formed only with crude nuclear extract and (MGG)17ds (lanes 5-8). c, DNA fragment 198ds contained the trinucleotide repeat 5′-d(CGG)16-3′ flanked by genomic sequences of the 5′-untranslated region from the human FMR1 gene. In binding experiments, it gave rise to the specific complexes 1, 3 and 4 (c1, c3, and c4). Their formation was competed only by oligodeoxyribonucleotides of the general structure (CGGNGG)8CGGds (with n = T or C). Complex 3 was not always detectable. Double-stranded competitor oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used at a 300 t-fold excess over the double-stranded binding fragment (2 fmol). Sequences of oligodeoxyribonucleotides and a summary of competition experiments were described in Table 1, Table 2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Infection of the permissive human cell lines HeLa and KB with Ad12 did not abolish CGG-binding activity (Fig. 2a). However, the abortive infection of hamster BHK21 cells with Ad12 gave rise to two additional bands showing slightly higher mobility in EMSA (Fig. 2b). In contrast, extracts from the Ad12-transformed BHK21 cell line derivative T637 or from its revertants TR3 or TR12 showed the same patterns as proteins from extracts of the parental BHK21 cells. Interestingly, CGGBP(s) were not detectable in extracts isolated from BHK21 cells grown in suspension cultures (Fig. 2b). The biological significance of these data had to be ascertained by repeating the binding experiments with authentic DNA fragments from the 5′-UTR of the FMR1 gene. Fragment 198ds gave rise to the DNA-protein complexes 1-4 (Fig. 3c, c1-c4) when nuclear extracts from human HeLa cells were used. Similar or identical patterns were found when extracts from other human or non-human cell lines were investigated. Complex 3 was not always detectable. Complex 1 appeared to be specific for CGG binding, as its formation could be blocked by competition with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds, but not with other oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The strong complex 4 seemed also to be formed by CGGBP(s), because its formation was partly competed by the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds (Fig. 3c) and also by 198ds. During the purification of CGGBP(s), complex 4 was the only detectable complex involving the 198ds fragment. Its formation could then be specifically competed by the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds and FMR1 promoter fragments 126ds, 198ds, and 248ds, but not by other oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Thus, complex 1 might contain additional factors that were probably associated with factors binding to flanking 3′-sequences. These additional factors could have been lost during purification and were no longer present in the CGGBP(s) in complex 4. Interestingly, the binding of proteins from nuclear extracts to the 126ds fragment with the same 5′-sequence as 198ds but a shorter 3′-end (Fig. 1) gave rise to only one complex and a pattern similar to that formed with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds (data not shown). In contrast, binding of nuclear proteins to the 248ds fragment, which had the same 3′-sequence as 198ds but a longer 5′-sequence, produced the same pattern as the 198ds fragment. It is concluded that several human and other mammalian cells express a (CGG)17ds binding activity that gives rise to the same, strong complex I with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CGG)17ds and to at least one specific complex with the authentic DNA fragments 198ds, 126ds, and 248ds from the 5′-UTR of the human FMR1 gene. The results of a series of competition experiments, which were performed to assess the specificity of complex I formation, were summarized in Table 2. The formation of complex I was impaired only by competition with the double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CGG)nds (8 < n ≤ 17) and with the authentic DNA fragments 126ds, 198ds, and 248ds from the 5′-UTR of the FMR1 gene (Fig. 3a). Single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CCG)17ss or (CGG)17ss did not compete for binding.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Moreover, complex I was observed only with oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CGG)17ds and (CGG)12ds as binding probes, whereas (CGG)8ds gave rise to a very faint complex (data not shown). The oligodeoxyribonucleotide FraxF isolated from the human FRAXF locus (9Parish J.E. Oostra B.A. Verkerk A.J.M.H. Richards C.S. Reynolds J. Spikes A.S. Shaffer L.G. Nelson D.L. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) did not serve as a specific binding probe for CGGBP(s) and did not compete for binding to (CGG)17ds. The FraxF oligodeoxyribonucleotide contained eight 5′-d(CGG)-3′ repeats and alternating 5′-d(CAGCGG)-3′ds repeats (Table 1). Hence, effective binding of CGGBP(s) to the recognition sequence required more than 8 repeat units. Formation of complex I was only partly competed by the synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide CGG8Tds (Fig. 3a), whereas no competition was observed with the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (TGG)17ds (nucleotide sequences, see Table 1). However, complex I formation was not competed by the addition of oligodeoxyribonucleotides with other triplet repeat sequences (Fig. 3a). Moreover, binding of nuclear proteins to the 5′-d(CAG)17-3′ds repeat was unspecific (data not shown). When the authentic DNA fragments 198ds or 126ds were used as binding probes, the 5′-d(CGG)16-3′-specific complexes 1, 3, and 4 were competed by the oligodeoxyribonucleotide CGG8Tds (Fig. 3c) but not with other oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Complex I and complexes 1-4 were destroyed after the addition of the anionic detergent sodium deoxycholate (≥0.03%), whereas the nonionic detergents Triton X-100 or Tween 20 (≤2%) did not have any effects on complex formation (data not shown). Complex disruption by sodium deoxycholate was reversed in the presence of 0.6% Nonidet P-40. Although it cannot be ruled out that sodium deoxycholate as an anionic detergent affects protein-DNA interaction, the sodium deoxych"

Melanosomes preloaded with tyrosine demonstrated countertransport of 10 μM [<sup>3</sup>H]tyrosine, indicating carrier-mediated transport. Melanosomal tyrosine transport was saturable, with an apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for tyrosine transport of 54 μM and a maximal velocity of 15 pmol of tyrosine/unit of hexosaminidase/min. Transport was temperature-dependent (<i>E</i><sub>a</sub> = 7.5 kcal/mol) and showed stereospecificity for the L-isomer of tyrosine. Aromatic, neutral hydrophobic compounds (such as tryptophan and phenylalanine), as well as the small, bulky neutral amino acids (such as leucine, isoleucine, and methionine) competed for tyrosine transport. Tyrosine transport was inhibited by the classical system L analogue, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid and by monoiodotyrosine, but not by cystine, lysine, glutamic acid, or 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid. Tyrosine transport showed no dependence on Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>, and did not require an acidic environment or the availability of free thiols. These results demonstrate the existence of a neutral amino acid carrier in murine melanocyte melanosomes which resembles the rat thyroid FRTL-5 lysosomal system <i>h</i>. This transport system is critical to the function of the melanosome since tyrosine is the essential substrate required for the synthesis of the pigment melanin."

Reduction of qBH2 at 25 μM proceeds at a rate that is comparable with that of the overall reaction (citrulline synthesis) and requires calcium ions and calmodulin for optimal activity; NADH has only 10% of the activity of NADPH. The reduction rate with the quinonoid form of 6-methyldihydropterin is approximately twice that with qBH2. 7,8-Dihydrobiopterin had negligible activity. Neither 7,8-dihydrobiopterin nor BH4 affected the rate of qBH2 reduction. Reduction is inhibited by the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, whereas inhibitors of electron transfer through heme (7-nitroindazole and N-nitroarginine) stimulated the rate to a small extent.

These studies provide the first demonstration of the reduction of qBH2 to BH4 by NOS and indicate that the reduction is catalyzed by the flavoprotein “diaphorase” activity of NOS.

A subsequent accumulation of the 6-phosphogluconate precursor 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone was observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. These metabolites were shown to be intracellular, although a small amount of leakage of 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone occurred. The intracellular concentrations of 6-phosphogluconate and 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone were 1.9 ± 0.8 μmol/108 cells (±1 standard deviation) and 0.8 ± 0.4 μmol/108 cells, respectively, after 15 h. Glucose utilization and lactate production were significantly inhibited by 6-aminonicotinamide (both p < 0.05), indicating inhibition of glycolysis. 31P NMR data showed that phosphocreatine was significantly depleted in cells exposed to 6-aminonicotinamide (p < 0.05).

Fig. 1 summarizes the major pathways of glucose metabolism in tumor cells. Tumor cells have long been known to metabolize glucose to lactate, via glycolysis, under aerobic conditions (9Warburg O. The Metabolism of Tumours. Constable, London1930Google Scholar). A significant portion of glucose, however, has been shown to be metabolized to lactate via PPP(10Reitzer L.J. Wice B.M. Kennell D. J.

The effect of a number of drugs and hormones on glucose and glycogen metabolism have been studied, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide(20Galons J.P. Fantini J. Vion-Dury J. Cozzone P.J. Canioni P. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), rhodamine 123 (21Singer S. Neuringer L.J. Thilly W.G. Chen L.B.

Most of these studies have been limited to observation of glucose utilization and glycogen and lactate production, although labeled alanine and glutamate have also been observed in some systems. In this study we have investigated the effect of 6AN on the glucose metabolism of RIF-1 tumor cells using 13C and 31P NMR, and observed accumulation of the PPP intermediates 6PG and 6PGL. We also investigated the potential of 6AN as a radiosensitizer. RIF-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY). 96 h before the start of perfusion, approximately 5 × 107 RIF-1 cells were seeded on 0.12 g of conditioned Cultispher-G collagen beads (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) in a spinner jar in 125 ml of medium. The medium for perfusion experiments was phosphate-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1.2 mg/liter DNase I (Sigma). The total number of cells on the beads at the time of transfer from the spinner flask to the perfusion apparatus was approximately 1.7 × 108 cells. Cells were counted by removing 1 ml of beads and medium from the spinner flask. Following sedimentation of the beads 0.8 ml of the supernatant was removed and replaced by 0.8 ml of collagenase (10 mg/ml). This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. With the collagen beads digested, it was possible for the released cells to be counted by eryrthrosin B dye exclusion. The total volume of the perfusion circuit, including the reservoir, was 130 ml. The head space of the medium reservoir was gassed with O2/CO2 (95:5). The design of the perfusion apparatus was as described previously for agarose threads(23Mahmood U. Alfieri A.A. Ballon D. Traganos F. Koutcher J.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1248-1254PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were perfused on the collagen beads as a fluidized bed in a shortened screw cap NMR tube (Wilmad, Buena, NJ). The reduction in upward force as the cross-sectional area of the tube increased at the neck was sufficient to prevent flow of cells into this part of the tube; the medium flow rate was adjusted accordingly. Two five-turn solenoid coils, wrapped around the bead-containing volume, were used to collect either 31P NMR spectra or 13C NMR spectra. Proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were obtained using a WALTZ-16 pulse-sequence on a Bruker/GE 4.7T Omega spectrometer (Bruker NMR, Fremont, CA) operating at 81.03 MHz. 31P NMR data were acquired with a spectral width of 10,000 Hz, a 60° pulse angle (12-μs pulse width), a relaxation delay of 2 s, 4K data points, and 4096 signal-averaged free induction decays. Under these conditions spectra were partially saturated. 135 min of data acquisition (4096 transients) was sufficient to give a good signal:noise ratio. 31P NMR spectra were processed with 5-Hz exponential line broadening and referenced to PCr at 0 ppm. Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra of cells were acquired at 50.34 MHz. 13C NMR spectra of cells were acquired with a sweep width of 20,000 Hz, a 60° flip angle (30 μs), a recycle time of 3 s, 8192 data points, and 1024 transients. Each spectrum took 55 min to acquire. 13C NMR spectra were processed with 2-Hz exponential line broadening and referenced to the β-anomer of glucose at 96.0 ppm, except where stated in the figure legends. As a known amount of labeled glucose was used in each experiment, it was used as an internal concentration standard. Since two different coils were used it was necessary to retune and shim the magnet each time the observe nucleus was changed. The NMR tube containing collagen beads was immersed in water to minimize inhomogeneities due to magnetic susceptibility gradients(24Ballon D. Mahmood U. Jakubowski A. Koutcher J.A. Magn. Reson. Med. 1993; 30: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A Helmholtz decoupling coil was built on the outside of the water bath. High resolution proton-decoupled 13C and 31P NMR spectra of cell extracts, at approximately pH 9, were acquired on a Bruker AC 250-MHz magnet operating at 62.90 and 101.25 MHz, respectively, using a 5-mm probe. Experimental parameters for 13C NMR were 20,000 Hz, 64K data points, a 60° flip angle (pulse width of 3.0 μs), and a recycle time of 4.1 s. Spectra were zero-filled and processed with 1-Hz line broadening. Spectra were referenced to the β-anomer of glucose at 96.0 ppm. Experimental parameters for 31P NMR included a sweep width of 15,000 Hz, 32K data points zero-filled to 64K, a 45° flip angle of 2.75-μs pulse width, and a recycle time of 5.1 s. Free induction decays were processed with 1-Hz exponential line broadening. Spectra were referenced to GPC at 0.0 ppm, as the chemical shift of this peak is almost invariant with changes in pH(25Navon G. Ogawa S. Shulman R.G. Yamane T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Dimethyl methyl phosphonate (1 mM) was used as an internal concentration standard for calculating cellular concentrations of phosphatic metabolites. It was assumed for these calculations that the density of the extracted cells was the same as that of the deuterium oxide in which the extract was reconstituted. Assignments of peaks in 31P NMR spectra of PCA extracts were made by adding known compounds to the extract and noting whether they were coincident with peaks present in the extract spectrum. In some cases assignments were confirmed by pH titration. After the collagen beads had been transferred to the perfusion apparatus, the magnet shimmed and the coil tuned and matched, two 31P NMR spectra were collected. Following this initial stabilization period, the medium reservoir was replaced by 100 ml of phosphate-free perfusion medium with [1-13C]glucose (180 mg) substituted for [U-12C]glucose. This volume of labeled media was much greater than the volume of media already in the perfusion circuit, so labeled and unlabeled pools were able to equilibrate during shimming and tuning. The total volume of the medium reservoir and the perfusion circuit was 130 ml. Sixteen sequential 13C NMR spectra were then acquired over the next 15 h. 13C label was then washed out of the perfusion apparatus by perfusing with two aliquots of unlabeled media, each for 15 min. A 31P NMR spectrum was collected before once more changing over to media containing [1-13C]glucose (180 mg) and a final concentration of 40 μM 6AN. Sixteen 13C NMR spectra were acquired as before. Following wash-out of the label and 6AN, further 13C NMR spectra were acquired. It was noted that the peaks arising due to the C-1 carbons of glucose were reduced to natural abundance levels, indicating efficient removal of label and drug. Finally a 31P NMR spectrum was acquired prior to harvesting the cells for PCA extraction. 13C and 31P NMR data were collected from a total of three separate perfusion experiments in this manner. 31P NMR spectra were obtained, in these experiments, immediately before and after each period of perfusion in the presence of [1-13C]glucose, with 13C NMR data acquired at all other times. In addition to these experiments, three further experiments were carried out in which RIF-1 cells were perfused, both with and without 6AN, in the absence of labeled glucose. The same protocol, as described above, was followed for experiments in which 31P NMR spectra were acquired throughout. Unlabeled glucose was used in these experiments. Initially eight 31P NMR spectra were acquired prior to addition of 6AN, after which a further six spectra were acquired. Following wash-out of the drug, six more 31P NMR spectra were acquired. In three control experiments, in which drug was not added after 22 h, fresh perfusate was exchanged for the old at this point, and perfusion continued for an additional 22 h, for a total of 44 h. Chelex-100 was obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. PCA extracts of excised tumors were made using slight modifications of previously described methods(26Bell J.D. Cox I.J. Sargentoni J. Peden C.J. Menon D.K. Foster C.S. Watanapa P. Iles R.A. Urenjak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PCA extracts of cells on beads were made by washing sedimented beads directly into liquid nitrogen with a small volume of medium. Briefly, the cells and beads were ground to a powder in a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar. Approximately 3 volumes of 10% PCA was added to the powdered cells. This mixture was ground further until cells and PCA were well mixed. The mixture was then transferred to a polypropylene centrifuge tube and thawed and immediately refrozen three times. Following this freezing and thawing cycle the precipitate was removed by centrifugation for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and neutralized with potassium carbonate (1 N). Following adjustment to pH 10.0, the potassium perchlorate precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then mixed and regularly shaken, over a period of 1 h, with Chelex-100 to remove any paramagnetic ions. Chelex-100 was subsequently removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was frozen and lyophilized prior to NMR analysis. The lyophilized extract was reconstituted in 1-2 ml of deuterated water. A crude extraction procedure, similar to that described previously(27Street J.C. Delort A.-M. Braddock P.S.H. Brindle K.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was carried out to concentrate the media and remove serum protein. Briefly, an equal volume of cold acetone was added to the harvested media sample and left on ice for 20-30 min. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted from the protein fraction, and the acetone was removed from the sample under vacuum using a rotary evaporator. The temperature of the water bath used was not in excess of 37°C. Chelex-100 (Sigma) was added to the remaining water phase and shaken periodically over a period of approximately 2 h to chelate any paramagnetic ions present in the sample. Chelex-100 was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting solution was lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was reconstituted in 2 ml of deuterated water. 105 RIF-1 cells/ml were seeded in 5 ml of RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 25-cm2 culture flasks and grown for 48 h, in order to establish log phase growth. After 48 h the media was changed. Different flasks of cells were harvested by trypsinization following one of eight different treatments. Control cells were harvested without any treatment. Three flasks were treated with 40 μM 6AN for 15 h as in the NMR experiments. Of these, one flask was harvested after 15 h, one was exposed to 3-Gy irradiation after 15 h of 6AN exposure, and the other was exposed to 6-Gy irradiation. Irradiation was carried out as described previously. These irradiated flasks of cells were harvested 3 h following irradiation(23Mahmood U. Alfieri A.A. Ballon D. Traganos F. Koutcher J.A.

Also cells were exposed to 3- or 6-Gy irradiation only and harvested 3 h later. The trypsinized cells were counted and plated on a 5-cm Petri dish in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. A number of plating densities were used to ensure colony counts were in a range likely to give accurate data. After 9 days the plates were stained for 3 h with crystal violet and rinsed, and surviving colonies were counted. All results are quoted as mean ± 1 standard deviation of triplicate determinations. Paired t tests were used to evaluate differences in the metabolic response of batches of cells to perfusion in the presence and absence of 6AN. Unpaired t tests were used to compare differences between cells that were exposed to 6AN after 22 h and those that were perfused for 48 h in the absence of 6AN and to compare plating efficiencies in the surviving fraction experiments. Errors are quoted as plus or minus one standard deviation. Error bars on the figures are standard errors of the mean. Fig. 2 shows 31P NMR spectra of RIF-1 cells obtained at intervals during a perfusion experiment, following the addition of 6AN. These spectra demonstrate a decrease in PCr and an accumulation of 6PG following the addition of 6AN (40 μM) to the perfusate. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that this accumulation of 6PG continued for at least 12 h after wash-out of 6AN, albeit at a reduced rate. This 6PG peak persisted for at least 36 h following wash-out of 6AN. The extracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate was constant in all of the experiments, as the same batch of serum was used throughout. Also, the extracellular volume was much larger than the intracellular volume, so changes in Pi with varying cell number were minimal. It was possible, therefore, to normalize metabolite ratios for cell number by dividing the ratio by the initial number of cells on the beads. 31P NMR data were obtained from cell perfusion experiments in which cells were perfused both in the presence and absence of 13C label (n = 7). There was a significant increase in PCr levels over the first 22 h of perfusion in the absence of 6AN, the PCr/Pi ratio increasing from 0.19 ± 0.04/108 cells to 0.36 ± 0.12/108 cells (p < 0.01). 20 h after administration of 6AN, however, there was a significant drop in this ratio to 0.12 ± 0.07/108 cells (p < 0.05). PCr/Pi increased from 0.36 ± 0.10/108 cells to 0.42 ± 0.06/108 cells at 40 h, in cells that continued to be perfused in the absence of 6AN (n = 3). PCr/Pi was significantly lower after 40 h of perfusion in cells exposed to 6AN than in control cells that were not treated with the drug (p < 0.001). The observed increases in NTP/Pi were not significant. The initial increase in PCr/Pi, coupled with the disappearance of GPC after 2-4 h, indicates that the cells were well perfused and not stressed in the first 22 h prior to addition of the drug. The maintenance of NTP and PCr levels for up to 48 h in untreated cells confirm that it is valid to compare data from the same batch of cells.Figure 3:A, plot showing the increase in the 6PG:Pi ratio after the addition of 40 μM 6AN to perfusate of perfused RIF-1 tumor cells on collagen beads. The plot also follows the change in 6PG:Pi after wash-out of 6AN from the perfusate. B, plot showing change in PCr/Pi over time during perfusion of RIF-1 tumor cells in which media were changed after 20 h to that containing regular media or media containing 40 μM 6AN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After 4 h of perfusion of RIF-1 cells in the presence of [1-13C] glucose and 6AN (40 μM) a peak began to appear at around 178.8 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (see Fig. 4A). After a further 4 h, a second peak appeared at 178.6 ppm. The downfield peak has been assigned to 6PG, by observing an increase in the peak in both the 31P and 13C NMR spectra following addition of the authentic compound. The peak assigned to 6PG in the 31P NMR spectrum was coresonant with added 6PG over a wide pH range, from pH 5.5 to 9.5. The second peak, observed 0.2 ppm upfield from 6PG, was observed to slowly disappear in extracts at neutral pH. The intensity of 6PG increased as that of the second resonance decreased. 6PGL, the precursor to 6PG in PPP, is known to spontaneously hydrolyze to 6PG in solution at neutral pH even in the absence of 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactonase(28Brodie A.F. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 212: 677-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . This peak was therefore assigned to 6PGL, both on the basis of this evidence and the similarity of its structure to 6PG. The rate of hydrolysis of 6PGL was much slower at pH 9 than at neutral pH. 6PGL is not commercially available. Other possible glucose metabolites were ruled out on the basis of their chemical shifts. Further evidence for these assignments comes from the fact that the chemical shifts of the two compounds reported here are very similar to those reported for the nonphosphorylated forms(29Blazer R.M. Whaley T.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 5082-5085Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) . The chemical environment of the phosphate group in these two molecules was sufficiently similar that they could not be resolved in the 31P NMR spectrum of extracts, even upon pH titration of their chemical shifts. In each labeling experiment, RIF-1 cells were perfused for 15 h in the presence of [1-13C] glucose. Following wash-out of this label with unlabeled media, cells were perfused in the presence of both [1-13C] glucose and 6AN. Each experiment, therefore, acted as its own control. Fig. 4A shows a 13C NMR spectrum acquired after 15 h of perfusion in the presence of 1 mmol [1-13C]glucose and 40 μM 6AN, and Fig. 4B shows a 13C NMR spectrum following wash-out of 13C-labeled media and 6AN, respectively. It can be seen that following wash-out of labeled media, peaks arising due to 6PG and 6PGL persisted. Peaks due to labeled glucose and lactate were reduced to natural abundance levels (not shown). 6PG and 6PGL were diminished only slightly in the hours following wash-out of the label and drug. This suggests that these metabolites are intracellular. Fig. 4C shows a PCA extract of RIF-1 cells after perfusion in the presence of [1-13C]glucose and 6AN. Fig. 4D shows an acetone extract of the 13C-labeled perfusate. 6PGL, but not 6PG, was found to be present. The presence of 6PG and 6PGL in PCA extracts of cells and the absence of 6PG in the perfusate provide further evidence that these metabolites are intracellular. The presence of 6PGL, but not 6PG, in the perfusate indicates that this compound was more readily leaked from the cell. Cell lysis as a mechanism for leakage of 6PGL can be ruled out, as this would be expected to yield 6PG also. Neither 6PG nor 6PGL were observed in the control experiments. The cellular concentration of 6PG calculated from the 31P NMR spectra of PCA extracts, made after the 6AN wash-out phase of the perfusion experiment, was 2.0 μmol/108 RIF-1 cells. This was as compared with 0.3 μmol/108 RIF-1 cells of NTP. This value for the concentration of 6PG was used to calculate the amount of unlabeled (1% natural abundance) 6PG required to cause a doubling of the 6PG peak in the 13C NMR spectrum of a PCA extract of cells incubated with [1-13C] glucose and 6AN. Addition of a 100 × concentration of unlabeled 6PG caused an approximate doubling of the peak assigned to 6PG in the 13C NMR spectrum (since the natural abundance of 13C is approximately 1%), indicating that it was essentially 100%13C-labeled. In the perfusion apparatus the cells were restricted to a volume of 6 ml inside the NMR tube. Assuming that 6PG and 6PGL are intracellular, these metabolites are therefore restricted to this volume, whereas other labeled metabolites such as glucose and lactate are present in the entire 130 ml of the perfusion apparatus. Fig. 5 charts the increase in concentration of 6PG and 6PGL following administration of 6AN, as calculated from the 13C NMR data. The corresponding increase in 6PG/Pi observed in the 31P NMR spectrum over the same period in an experiment in which 13C label was not utilized is shown in Fig. 3A. As expected, it can be seen that 6PG appears at approximately the same time in both experiments. The intracellular concentrations of 6PG and 6PGL after 15 h (900 min) of perfusion in the presence of 10 mM [1-13C]glucose and 40 μM 6AN were 1.9 ± 0.8 μmol/108 RIF-1 cells and 0.8 ± 0.4 μmol/108 RIF-1 cells, respectively. These values are in close agreement with the value calculated from PCA extracts. Fig. 6 shows two series of 13C NMR spectra. The first series in Fig. 6A shows the metabolism of glucose to lactate over a period of 15 h in RIF-1 tumor cells perfused in the presence of 10 mM [1-13C]glucose. The second series in Fig. 6B shows glucose metabolism of the same cells over 15 h in the presence of 10 mM [1-13C]glucose and 40 μM 6AN. It can be seen from these two series of spectra that metabolism of glucose to lactate was reduced in the presence of 6AN. Fig. 7A shows the change in glucose concentration over time in control and treated cells. After 15 h the glucose concentration was 0.32 ± 0.03 mmol/108 cells and 0.46 ± 0.05 mmol/108 cells for control and treated cells, respectively. Glucose utilization was therefore significantly inhibited in the presence of 6AN (p < 0.05). Similarly, Fig. 7B shows that production of lactate was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05), being 0.17 ± 0.02 mmol/108 cells in control and 0.07 ± 0.01 mmol/108 cells in the presence of 6AN. 1H NMR analysis of the methyl peak of lactate and its 1H-13C coupled satellites, in acetone extracts of the perfusate, showed no significant change in the percentage of labeling of lactate (data not shown). The amount of label unaccounted for in the mass balance equation, i.e. lost as carbon dioxide, was 1.67 ± 0.43 mmol/108 cells in control and 0.62 ± 0.52 mmol/108 cells in the presence of 6AN. Significantly less carbon was lost as carbon dioxide in cells treated with 6AN than in control cells (p < 0.01).Figure 7:A, plot showing utilization of [1-13C] glucose, as measured by 13C NMR, by RIF-1 tumor cells in the presence and absence of 40 μM 6AN.

In addition to participating in electrolyte transport, colonic crypt cells also synthesize and secrete a number of proteins and peptides that play a crucial role in mucosal homeostasis. In the present study we show that cAMP regulates not only electrolyte secretion but also polarized protein secretion in a tissue culture model of colonic crypt cells. We found that apical but not basolateral protein secretion was stimulated by a physiological activator of the cAMP pathway, vasoactive intestinal peptide, as well as by a cell-permeant analogue of cAMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP) at concentrations as low as 12.5 μM. Based on several criteria, we determined that the regulation of protein secretion by cAMP in HT29-CL19A cells occurs via stimulation of constitutive membrane traffic from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the apical cell surface. In addition, the regulation of apical protein secretion by cAMP was Cl--dependent with cAMP inhibiting rather than stimulating secretion in Cl--depleted cells. The locus of cAMP action on the secretory pathway is at least in part at the level of the TGN, where it stimulates the sialylation of α1-antitrypsin (i.e. one of the identified secretory proteins) in addition to the traffic of secretory proteins from the TGN to the apical cell surface. We propose that a cyclic AMP and Cl--dependent regulation of TGN acidification could modulate both sialylation and secretory vesicle budding at the TGN.

Epithelial cells form a continuous barrier between the external environment (i.e. lumen) and interstitium while vectorially transporting ions, solutes, and macromolecules between these two compartments. These cells also vectorially secrete their own protein products; for example, epithelial cells composing the exocrine glands secrete specific secretory products (e.g. mucins and digestive enzymes) into the lumen. Nonglandular epithelial cells also secrete a number of “housekeeping” proteins (e.g. cytokines, protease inhibitors, components of the extracellular matrix, and antibacterial peptides) that protect and maintain the mucosa and serosa(1Eckmann L.

Two well defined classes of protein secretory pathways are utilized by epithelial as well as nonepithelial cells: (a) the regulated secretory pathway and (b) the constitutive pathway (for review see (6Bauerfeind R. Huttner W.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). The regulated secretory pathway involves the acute, stimulus-induced release of secretory material from a preformed storage compartment, such as the mucin storage granules of goblet cells(7Lethem M.I. Dowell M.L. Scott M.V. Yankaskas J.R. Egan T. Boucher R.C. Davis C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Conversely, the constitutive secretory pathway lacks well defined storage granules and operates at a considerable basal level of activity. Constitutive membrane traffic pathways are also subject to regulation; e.g. there is accumulating evidence that the rate of constitutive membrane traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface can be modulated by regulatory factors such as heterotrimeric G proteins and protein kinases(8Hansen S.H.

Less is known about the regulatory role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in constitutive membrane traffic. Apical membrane traffic in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells is stimulated by cAMP analogs but only at high concentrations (0.5-5 mM 8-Br-cAMP) (10Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. J. Biol.

Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Unresolved issues include: (a) whether or not apical protein secretion can be stimulated by physiological activators of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway (e.g. hormone receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase) in polarized epithelial cells and (b) the identities of the downstream effectors that mediate the stimulation of constitutive secretion by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

In an earlier work we demonstrated that cAMP inhibits endocytosis and stimulates the recycling of previously internalized glycoproteins to the cell surface in pancreatic and intestinal epithelial cells that express wild type CFTR(13Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C752-C759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Berta G. Sorscher E.J. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cells that were homozygous for the most common CFTR mutation (ΔF508) lacked the regulation of either endocytosis or exocytosis by cAMP(14Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Berta G. Sorscher E.J. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Because CFTR itself has been shown to enter the recycling pathway (15Prince L.S. Workman R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and is present in clathrin-coated vesicles(16Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8296-8302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been postulated that CFTR modulates the recycling pathway via its function as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel within this pathway(15Prince L.S. Workman R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given that a subset of recycling glycoproteins recycle through the TGN following their endocytosis from the cell surface(17Green S.A. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21269-21278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Huang K.M. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9302-9310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bos C.R. Shank S.L. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 665-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the recycling and biosynthetic pathways share common compartments and perhaps regulatory elements at the level of the TGN. On this basis we reasoned that cAMP (perhaps through CFTR) could regulate not only apical membrane recycling but also protein processing and polarized secretion along the biosynthetic pathway. In order to assess the role of cAMP in regulating the biosynthetic pathway, we measured polarized protein secretion by colonic epithelial cells (T84 and HT29-CL19A) cultured on permeable supports, characterized the cargo within the apical and basolateral secretory pathways, and determined the effects of cAMP both on polarized secretion and on protein sialylation. We demonstrate that cAMP regulates apical but not basolateral protein secretion by these cells in a dose-dependent manner. The apical secretion by colonic epithelial cells is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive to cAMP analogues than that described for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and is regulated by a physiological stimulator of the cAMP second messenger system (i.e. VIP). One of the proteins secreted by HT29-CL19A cells was identified as α1 antitrypsin, which is secreted at both the apical and basolateral surfaces. Based on several criteria, we determined that the secretion of AT from HT29-CL19A cells takes place primarily via the constitutive pathway and that cAMP facilitates the delivery of AT from the TGN to the apical cell surface. In addition, when Cl- was replaced by gluconate, a nonpermeant anion, the regulation was reversed, i.e. cAMP inhibited apical protein secretion. Finally, we observed that cyclic AMP also stimulates the rate of AT sialylation within the biosynthetic pathway, indicating that the TGN is at least one site of action for cAMP. We discuss how CFTR, a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel that has been implicated in the acidification of the TGN and in the regulation of membrane recycling, may be involved in the cAMP-dependent regulation of protein sialylation and apical protein secretion in colonic epithelial cells. Tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc., and defined fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, ammonium persulfate, TEMED, urea, β-mercaptoethanol, and ampholytes were from Bio-Rad. Protein G immobilized on agarose beads was from Boehringer Mannheim. Dialyzed FBS was prepared by dialyzing FBS against 100 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4°C in dialysis bags (Spectrapor; molecular weight cut-off, 3,500) followed by sterile filtration.

HT29-CL19A cells represent a tissue culture model of nongoblet colonic crypt cells based on the fact that less than 1% are mucin positive cells(20Augeron C. Laboisse C.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of cAMP-induced vectorial Cl- transport, and high levels of CFTR expression(21Morris A.P. Cunningham S.A. Tousson A. Benos D.J.

T84 cells, another colonic cell line that we used for our studies, also exhibit a very small proportion of mucin-producing cells (~5%)(24McCool D.J. Marcon M.A. Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), display similar ion transport properties, and also express CFTR(25Bell C.L. Quinton P.M. Am. J.

T84 cells were cultured in 1:1 DMEM:F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. For all experiments cells were seeded onto Transwell filters (pore diameter, 0.4 μm; Costar); either 105 cells for filters of 6.5-mm diameter or 106 cells for filters of 24.5-mm diameter. Electrical resistance was monitored using “chopstick” electrodes and a high impedance ohmmeter (Millipore). Cells were typically used for experiments between 10 and 20 days following seeding at which time the electrical resistances were at 600 ohms•cm2 or higher. For metabolic labeling, cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37°C in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS for 30 min followed by treatment with Tran-[35S]-label in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM/5% dialyzed FBS for an additional 30 min. Tran-[35S]-label was added to the basolateral side only; 50 μCi/100 μl volume for the 6.5-mm filters and 500 μCi/600 μl volume for the 24.5-mm filters. Following metabolic labeling, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2. 200 μl of DMEM + 10% FBS was then placed into both the apical and basolateral compartments with or without secretagogues. Both media samples were collected following various time periods and placed on ice. Apical samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 2 min to remove any loose cells. When the chase was performed in the absence of serum, FBS (i.e. carrier) was added to samples to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) before trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the apical and the basolateral samples to a final concentration of 10%. Following incubation for 20 min on ice, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min, supernatants were discarded, and pellets were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Finally, the media samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min, and the pellets were dissolved in 0.5 N NaOH. The radiolabeled proteins remaining in the cells were collected by cutting the filters from the filter cups and placing them into ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Filter were then washed in 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by dissolving the cells in 0.5 N NaOH. Samples were counted using a Packard (Downers Grove, IL) scintillation counter. Secretion was expressed as (media counts/cell counts) × 100 (i.e. the percentage of radiolabeled proteins released). For SDS-PAGE analysis, filters were labeled as above and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2. 30 μl of DMEM without serum was placed into each compartment either with or without secretagogues. In some experiments, the chase was performed in a modified Earle's buffered salt solution (MEBSS) (116 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM potassium acetate, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 1.8 mM CaSO4, 0.9 mM NaH2PO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 4.9 mM sodium pyruvate, 26 mM NaHCO3 in 5% CO2 atmosphere) or in the same buffer but containing sodium gluconate instead of NaCl (MEBSS gluconate). Following the chase period, the media samples were collected and loose cells were removed from the apical samples as described above. 5 × SDS sample buffer (60 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2%SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol) was then added to each sample followed by heating to 95°C for 10 min. Samples and 14C-methylated molecular weight markers were resolved on 8% T, 3% C SDS-PAGE gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphor image analysis was performed using IPlab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA) on a Macintosh IIci computer. Cell pellets were lysed at 4°C for 60 min in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 24 mM sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 4 min. Supernatants were precleared by treatment with protein G immobilized on agarose at 4°C for 1 h. Precleared supernatants were then incubated with AT antibody or with an identical amount of nonimmune IgG for 90 min followed by incubation with immobilized protein G overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with RIPA buffer and solubilized in sample buffer either for SDS-PAGE or for one-dimensional IEF. For one-dimensional IEF, gels with a composition of 5% T, 3.3% C, 9 M urea, 1% (v/v) Biolyte 3/10, 4% Biolyte 5/7, 2% Triton X-100 were cast in minigel slabs (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitated AT was dissolved in a sample buffer containing 9 M urea, 1% (v/v) Biolyte 3/10, 4% Biolyte 5/7, 2% Triton X-100, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto the slab gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 5 watts constant power for 4 h and 8 watts constant power for 2 h using 20 mM NaOH as catholyth and 10 mM H3PO4 as anolyth. Gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed in 1% trichloroacetic acid, and dried prior to phosphor imaging. The first dimension of two-dimensional PAGE was performed using the aforementioned gel composition and the Mini-PROTEAN II tube system (Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 300 V for 90 min, 500 V for 120 min, and 1000 V for 60 min. For the second dimension gel tubes were adapted briefly in 100 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 8% glycerol and then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 8% T, 3% C gel slabs. Gels were stained, dried, and subjected to phosphor imaging or autoradiography. In order to assess the regulation of polarized protein secretion by filter-grown cultures of colonic epithelial cells, we analyzed the secretion of metabolically pulse-labeled proteins by three different methods. First, labeled proteins that were secreted into either the apical or basolateral compartment, as well as labeled proteins retained within the cells, were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and quantified by scintillation counting. The rates of secretion were then calculated as the percentage of radiolabeled proteins released into either compartment as a function of time. This technique provided a macroscopic assay of the kinetics and regulation of apical and basolateral secretion. Second, the apical and basolateral media samples were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphor imaging. This “medium resolution” technique provided an initial qualitative assessment of the cargo within the apical and basolateral secretory pathways and quantitative information regarding the secretion of individual protein bands. Third, we used a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and one-dimensional isoelectric focusing to identify specific proteins within the secretory pathway and to monitor protein processing in the biosynthetic pathway. Fig. 1 summarizes the results of our initial experiments performed using the macroscopic assay of polarized protein secretion. Both colonic cell lines behaved very similarly regarding the polarized secretion of metabolically labeled proteins analyzed with this method. Secretion exhibited linear kinetics throughout the 120-min chase period and the rate of basolateral secretion by both cell lines was severalfold greater than the apical secretion (Fig. 1, a and b). Secretion in both directions was abolished at 4°C, as expected for a vesicle-mediated secretory process (Fig. 1b). When the chase was performed in the presence of cpt-cAMP (Fig. 1, a and b), the rate of apical secretion was stimulated significantly over baseline in both colonic cell lines. Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, also stimulated apical secretion by T84 cells (Fig. 1b). Basolateral secretion was unaffected by cyclic AMP in either of these two cell lines. Responsiveness to secretagogues was more consistent for HT29-CL19A cells (Fig. 1, error bars); accordingly, these cells were utilized for the more detailed analysis of the apical secretory pathway (see Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:).Figure 2:a, electrophoretic profile of secreted proteins under control and stimulated conditions.

Factor VIIIa increased the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg factor IXa (Fl-FFR-FIXa; Kd = 42.4 nM), whereas cleavage of factor VIIIa by APC eliminated this property. Isolation of the APC-cleaved A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (A1336/A3-C1-C2), and the fragments derived from cleaved A2 subunit (A2N/A2C), permitted dissection of the roles of individual cleavages in cofactor inactivation. Intact A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer increased Fl-FFR-FIXa anisotropy and bound factor X in a solid phase assay, while these activities were absent in the A1336/A3-C1-C2. However, the residues removed by this cleavage, Met337-Arg372, did not directly participate in these functions since neither a synthetic peptide to this sequence nor an anti-peptide polyclonal antibody blocked these activities using intact dimer.

This activity was measured in a pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-adenylate kinase-linked reaction.

Then, 0.8 units/ml of adenylate kinase was added, and the decrease in the amount of NADH was measured. The initial decrease after the addition of KCl corresponds to the amount of remaining ADP, and the subsequent decrease after the addition of adenylate kinase corresponds to the amount of hydrolyzed AMP.

Since the presence of 100 μM AMP was found to prevent hydrolysis of ADP to AMP, 100 μM AMP was added in the reaction mixture. When AMP was absent, ATP concentration decreased with time even in the presence of the ATP regenerating system. Mg2+-ATPase activity has been measured usually in a K+-free solution, but K+-free condition is not available in the coupled enzyme method because K+ is necessary for pyruvate kinase reaction. A K+-competitive H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, SCH 28080, completely inhibited the K+-ATPase activity and 38% of Mg2+-ATPase activity(21Wallmark B. Briving C. Fryklund J. Munson K. Jackson R. Mendlein J. Rabon E. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2077-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Keeling D.J. Laing S.M. Senn-Bilfinger J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using this information, we measured the ATPase activity in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KCl, 10 μM SCH 28080, and 250 mM sucrose and in the absence of valinomycin. The remaining ATPase activity was assumed to be equal to 62% of the Mg2+-ATPase activity as described previously(23Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21553-21559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this method to evaluate Mg2+-ATPase activity still contains some ambiguity, it did not introduce significant errors in estimating K+-ATPase activity, because Mg2+-ATPase activity was small compared with total Mg2+ plus K+-ATPase activity. Resultant Mg2+-ATPase activity was comparable with the value obtained by the method of Yoda and Hokin(24Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). K+-ATPase activity was defined as the difference between Mg2+ plus K+-ATPase activity and Mg2+-ATPase activity. Proton uptake into gastric vesicles was measured from quench of fluorescence of acridine orange(25Takeguchi N. Yamazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2560-2566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 μg/ml of gastric vesicles, 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), 150 mM KCl, 10 μg/ml of valinomycin, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 μM AMP, 0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 4 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 5 μM acridine orange, and various concentrations of ATP. Fluorescence of acridine orange was measured with a Hitachi 650-10S spectrofluorometer or with a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer at 25°C (Ex = 495 nm, Em = 525 nm). The rate of proton uptake was determined as the initial slope of fluorescence quench. To evaluate the specific labeling of E3810 to the α-subunit of H+,K+-ATPase, gastric vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 μM [benzimidazole-2-14C]E3810 in a solution containing 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, and 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40) for 20 min at 25°C. The intravesicular space of gastric vesicles mimics the acidic lumen of gastric glands and was acidified when Mg-ATP was added into the vesicle solution containing valinomycin and a high concentration of K+. [benzimidazole-2-14C]E3810 was accumulated in the acidic intravesicular space, activated by acid, and bound to a Cys residue of H+,K+-ATPase from the luminal side (23Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21553-21559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of the electrophoresis sample buffer solution containing 30 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.75), 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol. Immediately, SDS-PAGE of the E3810-labeled gastric vesicles was performed using Tris-glycine-SDS buffer and 7.5-15% gradient gel following the method of Laemmli(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The SDS-solubilized sample solution was warmed to 40°C for solubilization of precipitated potassium dodecyl sulfate and applied to a well in the gel. β-Mercaptoethanol was omitted during electrophoresis to avoid dissociation of bound E3810 from a Cys residue of H+,K+-ATPase. Then, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and protein distribution was assayed with a densitometer. The gel was sliced into 2-mm-wide pieces. The sliced gel pieces were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide solution in tightly capped vials for 20 h at 60°C. The amount of bound [benzimidazole-2-14C]E3810 was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. For determination of the ratio of bound H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, E3810, to the α-subunit of H+,K+-ATPase, gastric vesicles were specifically labeled with [α-methylene-14C]E3810. For specific labeling, gastric vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 2 mM ATP in a solution containing 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, and 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40) for 20 min in the presence of various concentrations of [α-methylene-14C]E3810. Reaction was stopped by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 150 mM KCl and 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40). The gel filtration dissipated the proton gradient across the vesicle membrane, resulting in decomposition of the activated E3810, and unreacted [α-methylene-14C]E3810 was removed. After the redetermination of protein concentration of the filtrate by means of absorbance at 260 nm, the amount of bound [α-methylene-14C]E3810/mg of vesicle protein was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. K+-ATPase and proton uptake activities of E3810-labeled vesicles were also measured at low (10 μM) and high (200 μM) ATP concentrations. The α-subunit of H+,K+-ATPase comprised 48.3% of the total vesicle protein determined by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. A gastric vesicle solution (1 mg/ml) containing 2 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, and 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40) in the presence or absence of 1 mM ATP was irradiated with UV light (260 nm) for 1 h at 25°C using a Hitachi 650-10S spectrofluorometer (150-watt Xenon lamp with 20 nm excitation slit width). The possibility of irreversible ATP binding to the enzyme was evaluated using [8-14C]ATP under the same conditions. The UV light-irradiated gastric vesicle solution (0.1 ml) was added to 1 ml of cold stop solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid solution and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, and precipitated enzymes were collected on a 0.45-μm Millipore filter (HAWP02500). The precipitated enzymes were washed with 10 ml of cold stop solution. The amount of bound 14C-labeled ATP was measured with a scintillation counter. To obtain the exact relation between the ATP concentration and K+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles, it is necessary to maintain constant ATP concentrations during the measurement of the enzyme activity. Although the coupled enzyme method to measure ATPase activity employs an ATP regenerating system (phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase), we found that the ATP concentration was not constant in the gastric vesicle suspension. The Mg2+ plus K+-ATPase activity at 10 μM ATP gradually decreased (data not shown). Preincubation of vesicles in the absence of 2 mM Mg2+ for 1 h did not decrease the Mg2+ plus K+-ATPase activity at 10 μM ATP, but preincubation in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ and absence of K+ for 1 h induced the same extent of decrease in the ATPase activity as that observed in the presence of Mg2+ plus K+. These results suggest the possibility that ADP was not completely converted to ATP, and part of ADP was further hydrolyzed to AMP in a Mg2+-dependent and K+-independent manner. The hydrolysis of ADP to AMP can be detected by an adenylate kinase-catalyzed reaction linked to the coupled enzyme method where 2 mol of ADP is produced from 1 mol of AMP and 1 mol of ATP. The hydrolyzing activity of ADP to AMP by gastric vesicles was 1.45 ± 0.58 μmol of Pi/mg•h (mean ± S.E., n = 3), which was about half of the Mg2+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles measured at 10 μM ATP. To keep the Mg2+ plus K+-ATPase activity constant over a long time, it was found that the addition of 100 μM AMP was effective, possibly because the high concentration of AMP shifts an enzymatic reaction equilibrium between ADP and AMP toward ADP. Here we did not further explore the mechanism of the ADP hydrolyzing activity. K+-ATPase activity was measured at various ATP concentrations (2-1,000 μM) in the presence of 100 μM AMP, 10 μg/ml gastric vesicles, 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, and 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40). The ATP concentration was kept constant during the reaction by inclusion of phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and 100 μM AMP. The double-reciprocal plot between K+-ATPase activity and ATP concentration yielded two Km values, 7 and 80 μM ATP in the presence of proton and potassium gradients and a membrane potential (Fig. 1). However, in the presence of 2 μg/ml of nigericin, which dissipated K+ and H+ gradients across the vesicle membrane, only one Km value (5 μM) was observed (Fig. 1). We confirmed the existence of a potassium gradient across the vesicle membrane, in the presence of valinomycin, by inhibition of K+-ATPase with SCH 28080 at 20 μM, a specific reversible inhibitor that competes with K+ at the luminal high affinity binding site, this inhibition being reversed by the addition of 2 μg/ml of nigericin (data not shown). Irradiation of vesicles with UV light (260 nm) in the absence of ATP induced almost complete inhibition of the K+-ATPase activity of gastric vesicles, whereas irradiation in the presence of 1 mM ATP produced only minor inhibition (Fig. 2). Fig. 1 shows that the high affinity ATP binding is inhibited and the low affinity ATP binding is completely protected from UV light irradiation in the presence of 1 mM ATP. The values of Km for the low affinity ATP binding and Vmax did not change from control values. When UV light-irradiated vesicles were used, the binding of [8-14C]ATP to the enzyme was not detected, indicating that UV light irradiation in the presence of ATP did not induce the irreversible binding of ATP to the high affinity ATP binding site of the enzyme. We also examined the effect of UV light irradiation on proton uptake rate into gastric vesicles. The rate of proton uptake into the UV light-irradiated vesicles was enhanced at high ATP concentrations (>100 μM) but inhibited at low ATP concentrations (<20 μM) when compared with control vesicles (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3A, the differences in proton uptake at 5 and 10 μM ATP were significant, and those at 200-1000 μM ATP were not significant (three observations). Increasing the number of observations at 500 μM ATP to nine resulted in the difference becoming significant.Figure 3:Effects of UV light irradiation on the rate of proton uptake. Gastric vesicles (1 mg of protein/ml) were irradiated with UV light for 1 h at 25°C in the presence of 1 mM ATP. Proton uptake was determined from fluorescence quench of acridine orange. A, each point represents the mean of three observations of the initial slope of the fluorescence quench. The difference between the UV light-irradiated (○) and control vesicles (•) are significant (∗, p < 0.05,∗∗, p < 0.01, unpaired Student's t test) at 5 and 10 μM ATP. B, the values represent means of nine observations of the initial slope of fluorescence quench at 500 μM ATP. The difference of the rates of proton uptake between control and UV light-irradiated vesicles is significant (∗ p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test). Proton uptake was measured in a solution containing 10 μg/ml of gastric vesicles, 150 mM KCl, 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 μg/ml of valinomycin, 100 μM AMP, 5 μM acridine orange, 0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 4 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and various concentrations of ATP at 25°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relationship between K+-ATPase activity and proton uptake rate was not linear in control vesicles, but it was linear in UV light-irradiated vesicles (Fig. 4), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis at the high affinity ATP binding site regulates the coupling between K+-ATPase activity and proton uptake rate in negative and positive cooperative manners at high and low ATP concentrations, respectively. We studied the effect of a nonhydrolyzing ATP analog AMP-PNP on K+-ATPase activity at 200 μM ATP. The presence of 10 μM AMP-PNP enhanced K+-ATPase activity in control vesicles but decreased it in UV light-irradiated vesicles (Table 1). We discuss this AMP-PNP effect later.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Gastric vesicles were labeled with a proton pump inhibitor [α-methylene-14C]E3810 according to the method described under “Materials and Methods.” E3810 at 5 μM inhibited about 80% of K+-ATPase activity. Fig. 5 shows distribution of gastric vesicle proteins and 14C-counts in sliced gels, indicating that E3810 bound only to the α-subunit of H+,K+-ATPase (98.7%). The relations between the amounts of bound E3810, K+-ATPase, and proton uptake rate at 200 and 10 μM ATP were measured. At 200 μM ATP, K+-ATPase activity was completely inhibited when 2.6 nmol of E3810 bound per mg of vesicle protein, and proton uptake was completely inhibited when 2.1 nmol of E3810 bound per mg of vesicle proteins (Fig. 6). E3810 binding increased further to 8.6 nmol/mg of vesicle proteins, more than required for complete inhibition of proton uptake, probably due to nonspecific binding. At 10 μM ATP, K+-ATPase activity was completely inhibited when 2.5 nmol of E3810 bound per mg of vesicle proteins, whereas proton uptake was completely inhibited when 1.0 nmol of E3810 bound per mg of vesicle proteins (Fig. 7).Figure 6:Relationship between the amount of bound E3810 and the K+-ATPase activity (A) and between the amount of bound E3810 and the rate of proton uptake (B) of gastric vesicles measured at 200 μM ATP. Gastric vesicles (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of radioactive E3810 in the presence of 150 mM KCl, 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, and 2 mM ATP for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by gel filtration through Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 150 mM KCl and 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40). The amount of bound E3810 was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. K+-ATPase activity was measured at 200 μM ATP. The rate of proton uptake was determined by the initial slope of fluorescence quench of acridine orange after the addition of 200 μM ATP in a solution containing 10 μg/ml of vesicles, 150 mM KCl, 40 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.40), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, 100 μM AMP, 5 μM acridine orange, 0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 3 units/ml pyruvate kinase at 25°C. The experimental values less than 10% of the control were omitted for the linear least-square fits, which gave the intercepts of 2.6 (A) and 2.1 nmol/mg of protein (B) at the complete inhibition of the enzyme activity and proton uptake, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7:Relationship between the amount of bound E3810 and the K+-ATPase activity (A) and between the amount of bound E3810 and the rate of proton uptake (B) of gastric vesicles measured at 10 μM ATP. These experiments were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 6. K+-ATPase activity and proton uptake were measured at 10 μM ATP. The experimental values less than 10% of the control were omitted for the linear fits, which gave the intercepts of 2.5 (A) and 1.0 nmol/mg of protein (B) at the complete inhibition of the enzyme activity and proton uptake, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ratio of bound E3810/α-subunit was calculated taking into consideration that E3810 binds only to the α-subunit of H+,K+-ATPase, the α-subunit comprised 48.3% vesicle proteins and the mass of the α-subunit is 114 kDa; for example, 2.1 nmol/mg of proteins gives the ratio of 0.50 (= 2.1 × 10-9× 1.14 × 105/(10-3× 0.483)). Table 2 shows the ratios necessary for complete inhibitions of K+-ATPase activity and proton uptake at 200 and 10 μM ATP. These results suggest that binding of one molecule of E3810 can arrest the K+-ATPase activity of two molecules of the α-subunit at the both high and low ATP concentrations, and it can arrest protein uptake of two or four molecules of the α-subunit at the high or low ATP concentration, respectively.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The gastric H+,K+-ATPase consists of α- and β-subunits. Crystallization of H+,K+-ATPase has shown that two (9Askari A. Huang W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or four (10Rabon E. Wilke M. Sachs G. Zampighi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1434-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) monomers comprised the crystalline unit, which may suggest the presence of α-α-subunit contact and interaction, as shown in Na+,K+-ATPase(12Blanco G. Koster J.C. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8542-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Koster J.C. Blanco G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3989-3995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). So far there has been no report whether the α-α-subunit interaction of H+,K+-ATPase is involved in the function of the enzyme activity and the active ion transport. The present study using a specific proton pump inhibitor E3810 has demonstrated that the ratio of bound E3810/α-subunit necessary for the complete inhibition of K+-ATPase activity is about 0.6 at both high and low ATP concentrations, and the ratio necessary for the complete inhibition of proton uptake is 0.5 or 0.24 at high or low ATP concentrations, respectively (Table 2). That is, when E3810 binds to one of two α-subunits, both subunits lose the catalytic activity at every ATP concentration. When E3810 binds to one of two α-subunits, both subunits lose the proton transporting activity at high ATP concentration, and when E3810 binds to one of four α-subunits, all four subunits lose the proton transporting activity at low ATP concentrations. These results strongly suggest that the functional unit for K+-ATPase activity is the (αβ)2-diprotomer at every ATP concentration, whereas the functional unit for proton transport is (αβ)2-diprotomer at high ATP concentrations and the (αβ)4-tetraprotomer at low ATP concentrations. When H+,K+-ATPase was irradiated by UV light in the presence of ATP, the high affinity ATP binding was inhibited, whereas the low affinity ATP binding remained intact (Fig. 1). In these irradiated vesicles, proton uptake rate was stimulated at high ATP concentrations and inhibited at low ATP concentrations compared with those of control vesicles (Fig. 3). Furthermore, control vesicles show negative or positive cooperative coupling between the K+-ATPase activity and proton uptake rate at high or low ATP concentrations, respectively, whereas the UV light-irradiated vesicles show no cooperativity (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the high affinity ATP binding site has a regulatory role in addition to that of ATP hydrolysis. The presence of AMP-PNP enhanced K+-ATPase activity in control vesicles but decreased it in UV light-irradiated vesicles. We propose the following explanation. Although AMP-PNP competes with ATP and inhibits ATP hydrolysis at both ATP binding sites in control vesicles, competition at the high affinity site diminishes the negative cooperativity, resulting in a net increase of K+-ATPase activity. In UV light-irradiated vesicles, which have only the low affinity ATP binding site, AMP-PNP competition with ATP inhibits K+-ATPase activity. We suggest that the presence of high and low affinity ATP binding sites in H+,K+-ATPase is due to the dimeric α-α interaction shown in this study. Other explanations, however, are also possible as previously discussed for Na+,K+-ATPase(9Askari A. Huang W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Ward O.J. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, solubilized αβ Na+,K+-ATPase protomer had two different affinities for ATP(27Ward O.J. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have shown that H+,K+-ATPase has only one ATP binding affinity (Km = 5 μM) when measured in the presence of nigericin, which dissipates the proton and potassium ion gradients across the vesicle membrane. This result shows that each α-subunit has a single ATP binding site that is involved in hydrolysis. Our explanation clearly differs from a previous one that the nucleotide binds to H+,K+-ATPase with different affinities in the sequential reaction cycle, E•ATP•H+ and EP•H+•ADP (or EP•H+•ATP)(28Helmich-de Jong M.L. Van Emst-de Vries S.E. Swarts H.G.P. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H. M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose that the dimeric or tetrameric subunit interaction is necessary for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, and two different affinities for ATP of this enzyme are due to the dimeric subunit interaction, which is sensitive to UV light irradiation and pH and/or K+ gradient across the vesicle membrane. We thank Drs. Barry H. Hirst and Shinji Asano for helpful discussions and reviewing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2094812937,"UV cross-linking was used to identify estrogen-induced hepatocyte proteins that bind to apoII mRNA. Probes spanning the entire message revealed the presence of eight estrogen-induced proteins cross-linked to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR), but not to the coding region or the 5′-UTR. Two estrogen-induced proteins of 132 and 50 kDa were either absent or barely detectable in control animals, whereas six additional proteins of 93, 83, 74, 65, 58, and 45 kDa were clearly present in control animals and increased 2-5-fold by estrogen. A similar profile of estrogen-induced proteins was seen with the 3′-UTRs of the estrogen-regulated mRNAs for apoB and vitellogenin II, but not with the 3′-UTRs of the non-estrogen-regulated mRNAs for apoA-I and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. These findings indicate that the estrogen-induced proteins discriminate among mRNAs and suggest that they interact selectively with the family of estrogen-regulated mRNAs. The estrogen-induced proteins are found in the cytoplasmic fraction of liver extracts, and a subset of them are also found in adrenal glands, testes, heart, brain, and kidneys, but they are estrogen-induced only in the liver. Deletion analysis defined a 150-nucleotide region of the apoII 3′-UTR that is necessary for maximal binding of the estrogen-induced proteins. An internal deletion of endonucleolytic cleavage sites previously identified within the apoII 3′-UTR selectively reduced the binding of the 58-kDa protein. These findings reveal remarkable complexity in estrogen-stimulated protein-RNA interactions within the 3′-UTRs of estrogen-regulated mRNAs.

Regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism is known to play a major role in determining the expression levels of cellular proteins. The types of regulation are varied and include hormonally and developmentally induced changes in mRNA stability(1Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of Messenger RNA Stability.

An emerging theme is that sequence and structural elements required for regulation are frequently localized to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionVTGIIvitellogenin IImRNPmessenger ribonucleoproteinPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.) of mRNAs. A number of trans-acting factors that bind to such elements have been identified as potential mediators of cytoplasmic mRNA regulation. For instance, the stability of the transferrin receptor mRNA has been linked to stem-loop elements that interact with the high affinity state of the iron regulatory factor to reduce mRNA degradation when cellular iron stores are low(10Harford J.B.

This regulation was first documented in estrogen-stimulated chick oviduct, where hormone withdrawal caused ovalbumin mRNA to decay 5-10-fold faster than in the presence of the hormone(20Palmiter R.D.

Similar findings were later reported for apoII and vitellogenin mRNAs during estrogen-mediated vitellogenesis in chick liver (21Wiskocil R. Bensky P. Dower W. Goldberger R.F. Gordon J.I. Deeley R.G.

The effects of estrogen on the turnover of apoII and VTGII mRNAs are complex. Estrogen appears to have no effect on the decay of these mRNAs after short-term (1-3 days) hormone treatment since their rate of degradation (t1/2 = 12 h) is the same in the presence and absence of the hormone. However, long-term (5-14 days) hormone treatment leads to the rapid and selective destabilization (t1/2 = 1.5 h) of apoII and VTGII mRNAs when hormone is withdrawn(32Gordon D.A. Shelness G.S. Nicosia M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2625-2631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mean poly(A) tail lengths were not different during either rapid or slow mRNA decay, and analysis of apoII mRNA degradation intermediates identified multiple sites of endonucleolytic cleavage within the 3′-UTR(33Binder R. Hwang S.-P. L. Ratnasabapathy R. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16910-16918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage sites were mapped to 5′-AAU-3′ or 5′-UAA-3′ elements localized to single-stranded domains within two larger regions of secondary structure(33Binder R. Hwang S.-P. L. Ratnasabapathy R. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16910-16918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hwang S.L. Eisenberg M. Binder R. Shelness G.S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8410-8418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that mRNA decay is initiated via site-specific endonucleolytic cleavages within the 3′-UTR. The present study was carried out to identify cytosolic proteins that interact with the 3′-UTR of apoII mRNA, to characterize the specificity and binding sites for these proteins, and to determine whether these proteins are regulated by estrogen. The results from UV cross-linking analyses indicate that estrogen induces the assembly of an mRNP complex of eight proteins on the apoII 3′-UTR as well as on the 3′-UTRs of other estrogen-regulated mRNAs. Within the apoII 3′-UTR, deletion of one cluster of endonucleolytic cleavage sites selectively reduced the binding of a previously identified 58-kDa protein(35Ratnasabapathy R. Hwang S.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14050-14055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results reveal remarkable complexity in estrogen-stimulated protein-RNA interactions within the 3′-UTRs of estrogen-regulated mRNAs. These proteins may participate in the mRNA degradation process or in other aspects of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism that accompany estrogen-stimulated vitellogenesis. White Leghorn cockerels (2-3 week old; SPAFAS, Norwich, CT) were treated with estrogen for 2 days by subcutaneous implantation of a 100-mg 17β-estradiol constant-release pellet (~5 mg/day; Innovative Research of America, Toledo, OH)(32Gordon D.A. Shelness G.S. Nicosia M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2625-2631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control animals received placebo pellets. Cytosolic extracts from various tissues were prepared according to Ratnasabapathy et al.(35Ratnasabapathy R. Hwang S.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14050-14055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 1 g of tissue/7 ml of buffer. Extracts from adrenal glands and testicles were made by homogenization of the entire organ in 1 ml of buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Dignam et al.(36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9116) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad microprotein assay using γ-globulin as standard. Templates for the synthesis of labeled RNA probes were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of various plasmid DNAs using 18-23-mer primer pairs. Each upstream primer also included the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence GGCTCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA at its 5′-end. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 1-10 ng of template, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 1 × buffer (polymerase chain reaction kit, Perkin-Elmer), 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and 50 pmol of each primer. After 25-30 cycles, the DNA product was purified through a 2% agarose gel (NuSieve GTG, FMC BioProducts). High specific activity RNA probes were synthesized by incubation for 15 min at 37°C of a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine (HCl)3, 0.4 mM GTP, 0.4 mM ATP, 0.4 mM CTP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNA guard (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 10-20 ng of DNA template, 200 μCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.), and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA was purified through a Quick Spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). This method generates an RNA having 6 extra nucleotides (GGGAGA) at its 5′-end. The integrity of the labeled probe was checked on a 5% sequencing gel. The probes were stable for ~1 week. The conditions for synthesis of large amounts of unlabeled RNA (for use in competition experiments) were identical, except that the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained all four unlabeled nucleotides at 0.5 mM, 0.2 μg of DNA template, 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase, and a trace of [3H]UTP (10 μCi, 36.2 Ci/mmol) to allow for quantitation of the synthesized RNA. ApoII mRNA probes are labeled A-F with numbers (e.g. D1, etc.) used to designate deletions of the indicated fragment. Probe coordinates are given in the text or legends. The 3′-UTR probes for chicken apoB, apoA-I, VTGII, and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs extend from the translation stop codon up to (but not including) the site of poly (A) addition. The sequences used were as follows: apoA-I, RNA-(816-958)(37Rajavashisth T.B. Dawson P.A. Williams D.L. Shackelford J.E. Lebherz H. Lusis A.J. J. Biol.

Three probes were prepared from the mRNA encoding the cytosolic form of chicken phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase(41Cook J.S. Weldon S.L. Garcia-Ruiz J.P. Hod Y. Hanson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7583-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PEPCK-1 extends from the translation stop codon up to a major stem-loop structure (nucleotides 2113-2358). PEPCK-2 covers the same region, but includes the stem-loop (nucleotides 2113-2486). PEPCK-3 covers the entire UTR (nucleotides 2113-2792). pGEM-4Z® corresponds to RNA-(961-1111) using the SP6 RNA polymerase transcription initiation site as nucleotide 1. Northern blots and hybridization conditions were as described(42Margot J.B. Binkert C. Mary J.-L. Landwehr J. Heinrich G. Schwander J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from the livers of five control and five estrogen-treated chickens (from two independent experiments) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane (Nytran+, Schleicher & Schuell), the blot was stained with methylene blue (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to ensure equal RNA loading before being hybridized with the PEPCK-3 DNA template, which had been labeled by random priming (Prime-it II, Stratagene). The PEPCK mRNA signal was quantified on a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Protein cross-linking was carried out in a 10-μl reaction containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 40 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 15 μg of yeast tRNA, 1-5 ng of labeled probe, and 20-60 μg of protein extract. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 26°C and cross-linked at full power for 30 min in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). After addition of 0.2 μl of RNase VI (0.7 unit/μl; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 0.8 μl of RNase A (10 μg/ml), the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C followed by 30 min at 55°C. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using the buffer system of Laemmli(44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204784) Google Scholar). Fixation was in 7% methanol and 7% acetic acid for 1 h before drying and autoradiography. Protein bands were quantified with a GS-670 imaging densitometer (Molecular Analyst/PC, Bio-Rad). We have referred to the bands detected by autoradiography as protein bands even though they represent proteins cross-linked to RNA fragments. Protein molecular mass represents the average from five independent experiments using prestained protein standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) whose molecular masses have been corrected against 14C-labeled protein standards (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cytosolic proteins that bind to apoII mRNA were detected via UV cross-linking using four uniformly labeled RNA probes that span the entire mRNA (Fig. 1, lower panel). The influence of hormone treatment was determined by comparing cytosolic extracts from control birds with those receiving 17β-estradiol for 2 days via a constant-release implant. Note that radiolabeled bands detected by this cross-linking assay were abolished by protease treatment and were dependent on UV irradiation (data not shown). The results indicate that probes A, B, and C, which cover nucleotides 1-510, cross-link with several proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 1-6). Although there is variation in band intensity with these probes, the cross-linking pattern is qualitatively similar, and no difference was observed between extracts from estrogen-treated or control animals. In contrast, probe D, which covers most of the 3′-UTR, shows several significant differences. First, in extracts from control birds (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), a number of bands that cross-link weakly to probes A-C were prominently detected with probe D, suggesting that these proteins selectively recognize the 3′-UTR. Second, estrogen treatment enhanced the cross-linking of several proteins to probe D, including bands of 93, 83, 74, 65, 58, and 45 kDa (compare lanes 7 and 8). Densitometric scanning of autoradiograms from seven independent experiments indicated that the mean ± S.E. increase in band intensity was 3.9 ± 0.6-, 5.7 ± 1.1-, 4.6 ± 0.8-, 4 ± 0.7-, 1.8 ± 0.2-, and 2.1 ± 0.2-fold for the 93-, 83-, 74-, 65-, 58-, and 45-kDa bands, respectively. Third, a very intense band of 132 kDa and a band of 50 kDa were often seen only in extracts of estrogen-treated birds. In those instances in which faint 132- and 50-kDa bands were seen in control liver extracts, the -fold induction in estrogen-treated liver extracts ranged from 14- to 25-fold for the 132-kDa band and from 3- to 29-fold for the 50-kDa band. Thus, the 132- and 50-kDa proteins may be induced de novo by estrogen or may simply be increased by estrogen to a much greater degree than the other proteins noted above. These data define a set of proteins that bind selectively to the 3′-UTR of apoII mRNA and that are markedly increased by estrogen treatment. We will refer to these as estrogen-induced proteins although this is not meant to imply anything about the mechanism of the estrogen-stimulated increase in cross-linking activity. Two additional points should be noted. First, the 116-kDa protein that cross-links to probe D (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) was not included among the estrogen-induced proteins because it does not reproducibly show estrogen induction. This band is only occasionally resolved from a minor estrogen-induced band of 107 kDa (for example, see Fig. 2, Fig. 4, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7), which may account for the irreproducibility of estrogen induction of the 116-kDa band. Because the 107-kDa band was not reproducibly resolved, we have not considered it further. Second, several cross-linked bands in the 30-42-kDa range (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) appear to show differences with estrogen. However, since these differences were not reproducible, these bands were not considered further. To test the ability of the estrogen-induced proteins to discriminate among mRNAs, we compared the cross-linking pattern of probe D with eight probes generated from the 3′-UTRs of five different mRNAs as well as with an RNA probe generated from the pGEM vector. Among the RNAs tested are several known to be estrogen-regulated (apoII, apoB, and VTGII) and several known not to be estrogen-regulated (apoA-I, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pGEM). Fig. 2 shows that probes from the 3′-UTRs of apoII, apoB, and VTGII mRNAs generate similar patterns, each showing prominent cross-linking of estrogen-induced proteins of 132, 83, 74, 65, 58, and 45 kDa (lanes 2, 6, and 10). Several differences are also apparent. For example, the 93- and 83-kDa proteins cross-link less well to VTGII mRNA (lane 10), and the 50-kDa protein is not easily seen with apoB mRNA (lane 6). Nevertheless, the cross-linking patterns are remarkably similar for the three estrogen-regulated mRNAs. In contrast, the cross-linking patterns for the three non-estrogen-regulated mRNAs are markedly different (lanes 4, 8, and 18) and show no evidence of estrogen-induced proteins, with the possible exception of the 45-kDa band (lane 3 versus 4, lane 7 versus 8, and lane 17 versus 18). The estrogen-induced proteins of 132, 93, 83, 74, 65, 58, and 50 kDa are clearly absent with probes from apoA-I, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pGEM RNAs. Upon first inspection, the results with the PEPCK probes are puzzling. PEPCK-2 shows little cross-linking and no indication of estrogen-induced proteins (Fig. 2, lanes 13 and 14). With control liver extract, PEPCK-1 (lane 11) shows some bands in common with the estrogen-regulated mRNAs (lanes 1, 5, and 9) and slightly increased cross-linking of some bands upon estrogen treatment (lane 12). In contrast, in control liver extracts, PEPCK-3 (lane 15) shows most bands in common with the estrogen-regulated mRNAs and clear evidence of estrogen induction with extracts from hormone-treated birds (lane 16). Since estrogen regulation has not been reported for the cytosolic form of PEPCK, we carried out Northern blot analysis to examine this possibility. Analysis of the blot with a PhosphorImager indicated that PEPCK mRNA was increased 3.1-fold (arbitrary units: control, 1500 ± 333 (S.E., n = 5); estrogen-treated, 4640 ± 1070 (n = 5); p = 0.02) following 2 days of estrogen treatment. Thus, although not dramatically induced, PEPCK mRNA abundance appears to be under estrogenic control. Taken together, these data indicate that the estrogen-induced proteins show specificity in their binding as they appear to distinguish among mRNAs that are estrogen-regulated (apoII, apoB, VTGII, and PEPCK) and mRNAs that are not estrogen-regulated (apoA-I, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pGEM). The specificity of the estrogen-induced proteins was further tested by competition of probe D1 (RNA-(510-659)) with increasing amounts of unlabeled probes derived from the 3′-UTRs of five mRNAs. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that apoII (lane 4), apoB (lane 10), and VTGII (lane 13) 3′-UTRs compete effectively for the apoII probe, whereas the 3′-UTRs of apoA-I (lane 7) and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (lane 15) mRNAs are ineffective at a 250-fold excess. These competition data confirm the specificity of the estrogen-induced proteins for the estrogen-induced mRNAs as seen with the direct cross-linking assay (Fig. 2). To determine the cellular location of the estrogen-induced proteins, nuclear and cytosolic liver extracts from chickens treated for 2 days with estrogen were cross-linked with probe D1 (RNA-(510-659)). Fig. 4 shows that the cross-linking pattern is distinct for nuclear (lanes 1 and 3) and cytosolic (lanes 2 and 4) extracts. Estrogen-induced proteins were detected exclusively in cytosolic extracts (lanes 1 and 3 versus 2 and 4). The estrogen-induced proteins of 132, 93, 83, and 50 kDa appear to have no nuclear counterparts of similar mobility, whereas proteins of 74, 65, 58, and 45, although not estrogen-induced, were found at low levels in nuclear extracts (lanes 1 and 3). Whether these nuclear proteins are the same as the cytosolic proteins of equivalent mobility is unknown. The tissue distribution and estrogen inducibility of the apoII 3′-UTR-binding proteins was determined by cross-linking probe D1 (RNA-(510-659)) to cytosolic extracts prepared from tissues of three control and three estrogen-treated animals. The results for one representative tissue from each group are shown in Fig. 5. Several points are of interest. First, of the 10 tissues tested, only the liver shows estrogen-induced proteins that cross-link to the apoII 3′-UTR probe. Second, each tissue exhibits a unique pattern of cross-linked proteins. Third, some of the estrogen-induced liver proteins may be present in other tissues as judged by similar mobilities, whereas some are absent in other tissues. For example, the 58-kDa protein is detected only in the liver and possibly the kidney (lanes 11 and 12), but appears to be absent in all other tissues tested. Similarly, the 132-kDa protein is not seen in the intestine (lanes 9 and 10), kidney (lanes 11 and 12), lungs (lanes 13 and 14), muscle (lanes 15 and 16), and spleen (lanes 17 and 18), but may be present in the adrenal gland (lanes 3 and 4), brain (lanes 5 and 6), heart (lanes 7 and 8), and testes (lanes 19 and 20). In addition, some proteins such as the 74- and 65-kDa proteins appear to be present in all tissues, albeit at quantitatively different levels. Whether proteins in different tissues that cross-link to the apoII 3′-UTR and that have the same electrophoretic mobility are identical will require further study. To determine which region of the apoII mRNA 3′-UTR is recognized by the estrogen-induced proteins, various deletions of probe D (RNA-(481-659)) were generated by progressive 5′-end deletions and tested with liver cytosolic extracts from control and estrogen-treated chickens (Fig. 6). Deletion of the first 29 nucleotides (probe D1) modestly but reproducibly increased the cross-linking of the estrogen-induced proteins. Further deletions revealed that most of the binding of the 132-, 93-, 83-, and 50-kDa estrogen-induced proteins was lost with deletion to nucleotide 550 (probe D3). Densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram indicated that ≥84% of the cross-linking signal was lost for these proteins when comparing probes D1 and D3. The cross-linking signal was also diminished for the 74- and 65-kDa proteins with these deletions, but the decrease was more gradual. In contrast, cross-linking of the 58-kDa protein was relatively insensitive to these deletions. Even with probe D4, the 58-kDa protein showed clear estrogen induction (lane 9 versus 10), and densitometry indicated a cross-linking signal that was 72% of the signal with probe D1. The 45-kDa protein also appeared to behave differently, showing an increase in cross-linking with probe D2 and little difference between probes D1 and D3. The results of progressive 3′-end deletions (Fig. 7) reveal that cross-linking of the 132-, 83-, 74-, and 50-kDa bands was greatly red"
