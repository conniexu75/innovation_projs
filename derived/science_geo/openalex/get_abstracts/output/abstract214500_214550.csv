https://openalex.org/W2075126224,"Human lymphocytes, cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin, undergo morphologic transformation and subsequent mitosis. Before mitosis (48 to 72 hours), a sharp increase in acid phosphatase activity occurs in cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Histochemical examination of these cells demonstrates that innumerable granules containing acid phosphatase develop in the cytoplasm before mitosis. It is possible that enzymes present in granules which stain for acid phosphatase activity (lysosome-like) may play a role in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cell division."

Since mice can also be lethally sensitized to visible light by the administration of hæmatoporphyrin intraperitoneally, it seemed likely that injection of the carotenoid pigment, (β-carotene, would protect against the lethal photosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2409440302,"Brown adipose tissue has been shown to be a strongly thermogenic effector organ in homeothermic animals exposed to cold and in hibernators during cold-induced arousal from deep hibernation. Because of the anatomical distribution of brown fat and the utilization of vascular countercurrent heat exchange, this cold-induced thermogenic response protects the animal by contributing heat to the vital organs of the thorax, the cervical and thoracic segments of the spinal cord, and the sympathetic chain. Evidence indicates that control of thermogenic activity of brown fat is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1995083930,"Deficiency of the serum α1-antitrypsin appears to be under genetic control. The level of this protein is reduced to less than 10 percent of the norm in individuals homozygous for the trait, who may suffer from pulmonary emphysema. Heterozygous individuals have a concentration of serum α1-antitrypsin between 50 and 60 percent of normal, but appear to be in good health. The estimated heterozygous frequency of the trait in a small white population in Georgia is 2.1 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2053096299,"Storage of dieldrin in the adipose tissue of female rats was markedly depressed when DDT and dieldrin were fed simultaneously. The amount of dieldrin present in the tissues of rats fed 1 and 10 parts of dieldrin per million was significantly reduced by the addition of 5 ppm DDT to the feed. The addition of 50 ppm DDT to the feed caused a 15-fold reduction in the amount of dieldrin stored in rats fed 1 ppm dieldrin, and a 6-fold reduction in rats fed 10 ppm dieldrin. This antagonistic effect of DDT suggests that the criteria used in predicting the pharmacological effects of combined residues of related insecticides need some revision."
https://openalex.org/W2057411263,"An alcoholic extract of Asclepias curassavica L., a plant widely used in folk medicine for treating cancer and warts, shows cytotoxic activity when tested in vitro against cells derived from human carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Systematic fractionation of the extract has led to isolation and characterization of calotropin as a cytotoxic principle. Calotropin is similar in structure to two cardiac glycosides recently shown to be responsible for the cytotoxicity of Apocynum cannabinum L."
https://openalex.org/W2003288108,"A study of temperature sensitive clear-plaque-forming mutants of bacteriophage P22 demonstrates that the c(1) and c(2) loci must function in a temporal sequence in the establishment of lysogeny in Salmonella typhimurium. The c(1) locus acts for only a 4-minute interval between the 7th to 11th minute of the infection. The c(2) locus begins to function some minutes later, and its continued activity is necessary for perpetuation of the lysogenic state."
https://openalex.org/W2009532464,"The renal tubules of the shark actively reabsorb urea. They also can reabsorb acetamide and methylurea, but there is no evidence for active reabsorption of thiourea. The specificity of the transport system thus appears to be different from the urea secretory system in the frog in which thiourea is secreted but acetamide and methylurea are not secreted."

https://openalex.org/W2044788223,"The hyperacute form of allergic encephalomyelitis is characterized by its short incubation period, 100 percent incidence, overwhelming severity, and high mortality and by the massive quantities of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, fibrin, and edema fluid which infiltrate the central nervous system. The hyperacute form has been produced with the aid of aqueous pertussis vaccine as an adjuvant. This is the first reproducible laboratory model for human acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy."

https://openalex.org/W1985600652,"Sections and macerated specimens of kidneys from several species of wild and domestic mammals injected with India ink or vinyl acetate, or both, show that the specialized blood vessels of the renal medulla (vasa recta) consist of parallel, relatively unbranched vessels which break up into plexuses at different levels of the medulla. This concept differs from that expressed in many current textbooks. In some species there is a distinct zonation of the medullary blood supply, and in certain other species no zonation was observed. Functional differences exist between these two groups, and it is suggested that these differences may be due to the vasa recta."
https://openalex.org/W2013906644,"Electrical stimulation of the visceral ganglion of the mussel Mytilus edulis caused cilia on the lateral epithelium of the gill to beat faster. This effect was blocked by cocaine, physostigmine, hyoscyamine, and acetylcholine but not by tubocurarine. These agents did not block the cilioexcitatory effect of serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W2057117439,"A cell-free preparation composed mainly of cilia, obtained by treatment with K(2)Cr(2)O(7) from stocks of Paramecium multimicronucleatum (syngen 2) pure for mating type, can regularly induce conjugation in intact animals of the opposite mating type."
https://openalex.org/W2021913229,"Anesthetics can be administered to the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, by means of special ventilating equipment and intubation techniques. Nitrous oxide has been administered successfully on six occasions, and has produced definite signs of anesthesia. These developments open the possibility of performing major surgery in this species for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W1983322990,"A tissue layer, which was continuous with the cementum covering the roots, was found external to the crown enamel of normal, unerupted permanent human teeth. Light microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and amino acid analysis indicated that the major constituent of this tissue was collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2072637741,"Sucrose-gradient analyses of cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli B show that the sedimentation patterns are markedly affected by exposure of the cells to mitomycin C; 50S subunits are progressively degraded in the cells after 30 minutes exposure. The 30S subunits, although affected, are less sensitive to the antibiotic than the 50S subunits. Incorporation of uracil-2-C(14) into the ribosomal particles by the treated cells is markedly reduced by exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1971856154,"Serums from 1015 individuals, mainly Norwegians, were studied by starch-gel electrophoresis. All but one showed the same albumin phenotype. The appearance of the exceptional sample on starch gel fits with that of a heterozygote. A genetic theory of two alleles Al(F) and Al(S) is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2023173900,"Miniature transmitters (weighing 2.5 to 2.7 grams, including encapsulation) implanted subcutaneously in deermice (Peromyscus) radiate a pulsed signal at 27 megacycles per second which can be detected by a simple antenna at a distance of 45 meters. The radio signal indicates movements of the deermice, periods of activity, and the location of occupied nests. One mouse was traced as it returned to its nest 300 meters in 1 hour. This rate of homing is many times more rapid than the rate usually determined by conventional methods for tracking small terrestrial mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2031009148,"In the kidney of the amphibian, Necturus, appreciable quantities of inulin and human serum albumin are transported from the tubular lumen of the proximal tubules into the blood. These findings suggest that inulin may not be a satisfactory indicator for measuring net water movement in the kidney of this species."

https://openalex.org/W2045199819,"INHERITED variation in the electrophoretic mobility of the serum protein transferrin (siderophilin) has been established for a number of mammalian species1–12 and for doves13. In other mammals14,15, several colubrid snakes and one amphibian species, variants exist16 and, although family data are not yet available, it is probable that they are also genetically determined. This communication reports the discovery of inherited variation in the transferrin of an Australian marsupial, Megaleia rufa (= Macropus rufus), commonly known as the red kangaroo."

https://openalex.org/W2168580805,"Cytosine, adenine, guanine, and thymine, but not uracil, have been detected in core samples taken from various depths of the experimental Mohole. The following quantities of bases were found in the deepest core samples available (approximately 25 x 10(6) years old): cytosine, 2.5 microg/5 g; adenine, 0.9 microg/5 g; guanine, 0.2 micro/5 g; thymine and uracil, 0 microg/5 g."
https://openalex.org/W2061426599,"Subjects fixated luminous figures in darkness and reported the parts, either points or lines, that disappeared. After carefully controlled instructions, almost half of the disappearances were of lines and less than 20 percent were of fixation points, thus refuting the argument that meaningful disappearances are artifacts of the manner of fixation."

https://openalex.org/W2076331108,THE distribution of the ABO blood groups is interpreted by Vogel (1961) as the outcome of a dynamic equilibrium between the selective action of epidemic diseases of the world-populations and selection through materno-fœtal incompatibility.
https://openalex.org/W2077148852,A monkey was trained to release a lever when a stimulus was applied to the striate cortex. Reaction times to stimulation of the striate cortex were consistently 30 milliseconds shorter than reaction times to visual stimulation. The technique appears to be fruitful for analysis of neural mechanisms in a simple behavioral task.
https://openalex.org/W2069005493,Streptomyces umbrinus var. cyaneoniger produces the antibiotic lincomycin. When grown in the presence of ethionine an additional antibiotic is produced. Physical and chemical analyses and incorporation of radioisotopes indicate that the new antibiotic is the S-ethyl homolog of lincomycin.

https://openalex.org/W2064766393,"MANY books recommend chloralose as an anaesthetic for laboratory animals and give a dosage rate of 40–80 mg/kg body-wt.; the drug is considered particularly useful for animals in which autonomic reflexes are to be preserved. I have recently carried out a series of experiments in the dog and rabbit, and in no case did surgical anaesthesia result from intravenous injections of 70 mg/kg or less. If chloralose was used after induction with ether slight improvement was seen, but surgery was still not possible. The heart rate was slowed by 30 per cent in these experiments and excessive secretions caused respiratory embarrassment."

https://openalex.org/W2086210669,"IT is known that the size of inoculum, affects results in tests of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics1,2. This is due to individual differences in the bacterial population; the greater the number exposed to a certain concentration of antibiotic, the greater the likelihood that one organism may grow out."
https://openalex.org/W1965667919,IT is becoming increasingly clear that the visual perception of form involves the interaction of a number of parallel computing or ‘image-processing’ operations. Stimuli which preferentially excite one or other of the neural computing networks concerned can give rise to visual anomalies indicative of the way in which the optical information is normally broken down.

https://openalex.org/W2054536406,"SIALIC acid and polymers containing sialic acid1–3 have been shown to specifically inhibit agglutination of Rho(D) red blood cells by specific antiserum. Urinary mucoprotein, which consists of 9.1 per cent sialic acid4 in terms of total mucoprotein, was therefore considered as a possible inhibitor of anti-Rh. The other sugars which make up the prosthetic group of this molecule have been shown not to block specifically Rh agglutination5."
