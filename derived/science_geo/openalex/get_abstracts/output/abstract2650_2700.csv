https://openalex.org/W4293241835,"Bacteria with motility directed by the local geomagnetic field have been observed in marine sediments. These magnetotactic microorganisms possess flagella and contain novel structured particles, rich in iron, within intracytoplasmic membrane vesicles. Conceivably these particles impart to cells a magnetic moment. This could explain the observed migration of these organisms in fields as weak as 0.5 gauss."
https://openalex.org/W1589390349,"1. Xanthine oxidase acting aerobically upon acetaldehyde was found to cause the peroxidation of linolenate. This was demonstrated by increased absorbance at 233 nm due to diene conjugation and by the detection of a lipid peroxide spot on the thin layer chromatograms. 2. Superoxide dismutase inhibited this lipid peroxidation, as did catalase, thus indicating that both O2- and H2O2 were essential intermediates. Scavengers of singlet oxygen also inhibited the peroxidation of linolenate, whereas scavengers of hydroxyl radical did not. These effects, which were observed in the absence of iron salts, led to the proposal that O2- and H2O2 can directly give rise to a singlet oxygen, as follows: O2- + H2O2 leads to OH- + OH. + O2. 3. This proposal was further supported through the use of 2,5-dimethylfuran, as an indicating scavenger of singlet oxygen. Thus, when this compound was exposed to a known source of singlet oxygen, it gave a product which was detectable by thin layer chromatography. This product was also observed when 2,5-dimethylfuran was exposed to the xanthine oxidase system, in which case its accumulation was prevented by superoxide dismutase or by catalase, but not by scavengers of hydroxyl radical."

https://openalex.org/W1587305227,"Abstract The binding and the velocity of degradation of 125I-insulin in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of native procline insulin were studied using isolated rat hepatocytes. At insulin concentrations ranging from 5 X 10(-11) to 10(-6) M, insulin degradation velocity showed a first order dependence on the total concentration of insulin bound at steady state. The overall reaction had an apparent rate constant of 0.030 +/- 0.011 min-1. Furthermore, the degradation of a given amount of 125I-insulin bound to cells was more rapid and extensive than the degradation of the same amount of insulin which had been newly exposed to fresh cells. Mid pretreatment of isolated hepatocytes with trypsin or chymotrypsin at concentrations of 5 to 20 mug/ml depressed to the same degree the amount of 125-I-insulin bound at steady state and the 125I-insulin degradation velocity. Peptide or protein hormones unrelated to insulin, including the oxidized A and B chains of insulin, failed to depress the amount of insulin bound or the velocity of insulin degradation when present at concentrations of 10-5 or 10-6 M. Over a wide range of concentrations, various synthetic insulin analogues and naturally occurring insulins depressed to the same degree the amount of 125I-insulin bound at steady state and the 125I-insulin degradation velocity. These observations suggest that insulin bound to hepatocyte plasma membranes is the substrate for insulin degradation by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1593025965,"Gonadotropin binding and stimulation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) formation and testosterone synthesis were studied in collagenase-dispersed interstitial cells from the adult rat testis. Binding of 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by isolated Leydig cells was of high affinity (Ka = 10(10) M-1) and low capacity, equivalent to approximately 6000 sites/cell. The binding data were consistent with the presence of a single order of receptors, with no interaction between binding sites. Stimulation of testosterone synthesis by increasing concentrations of hCG was completely dissociated from changes in cyclic AMP formation, and maximum activation of steroidogenesis was induced by hCG concentrations which had no effect upon cyclic AMP production. Kinetic analysis of gonadotropin-induced responses in dispersed Leydig cells also showed a marked dissociation between steroidogenesis and cyclic nucleotide formation. Low concentrations of hCG caused maximum stimulation of testosterone production which was not accompanied by a rise in cyclic AMP formation at any time after addition of gonadotropin. Higher concentrations of hCG caused marked elevations of cyclic AMP at progressively earlier time intervals, but did not alter the 20 to 30 min lag period required for induction of testosterone synthesis. These observations indicated that occupancy of gonadotropin receptors occurs over a much wider range of hCG concentration than that required for maximum steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1599492633,"The hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters contained in plasma low density lipoprotein was reduced in cultured fibroblasts derived from a patient with cholesteryl ester storage disease, an inborn error of metabolism in which lysosomal acid lipase activity is deficient. While these mutant cells showed a normal ability to bind low density lipoprotein at its high affinity cell surface receptor site, to take up the bound lipoprotein through endocytosis, and to hydrolyze the protein component of the lipoprotein in lysosomes, their defective lysosomal hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester component of the lipoprotein led to the accumulation within the cell of unhydrolyzed cholesteryl esters, the fatty acid distribution of which resembled that of plasma lipoprotein. When the cholesteryl ester storage disease cells were incubated with low density lipoprotein, the reduced rate of liberation of free cholesterol by these mutant cells was associated with a delay in the occurrence of two lipoprotein-mediated regulatory events, suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, and activation of endogenous cholesteryl ester formation. In contrast to their defective hydrolysis of exogenously derived lipoprotein-bound cholesteryl esters, the choleseryl ester storage disease cells showed a normal rate of hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters that had been synthesized within the cell. These data lend support to the concept that in cultured human fibroblasts cholesteryl esters entering the cell bound to low density lipoprotein are hydrolyzed within the lysosome and that one of the functions of this intracellular organelle is to supply the cell with free cholesterol."

Two classes of binding sites were demonstrated: Type 1, of low affinity (Kd approximately 160 nM) and high capacity (Ro approximately 1 X 10(5) sites per cell); and Type 2, of high affinity (Kd approximately 9 nM) but low capacity (Ro approximately 1.5 X 10(4) sites per cell). Both sites are developmentally regulated and are expressed during aggregation. The specificities of both sites are consistent with the specificity observed in vivo for the chemotactic response."
https://openalex.org/W1607004775,"Conditions are described for digesting single-stranded DNA by S1 nuclease without introducing breaks in double-stranded DNA. The enzyme is inhibited by low concentrations of various compounds of phosphate. Under certain conditions S1 nuclease cleaves the strand opposite a nick in bacteriophage T5 DNA; under other conditions, the enzyme cleaves a loop in one strand of heteroduplex lambdaDNA while leaving the opposite strand intact. S1 nuclease makes many single strand breaks in ultraviolet-irradiated duplex lambdaDNA. Superhelical DNA of phiX174 (Form I) is converted first to a relaxed circular molecule (Form II), and then to a linear molecule (Form III) by cleavage at one site per molecule. Since the cleavage occurs at many sites in the population of molecules, the partially single-stranded regions in phiX174 superhelical DNA are not determined by specific nucleotide sequences."

The striking parallelism between protein kinase activity that is dependent on cytosol cyclic AMP and cellular responses to dibutyryl cyclic AMP in wild-type cells and three classes of clones resistant to cyclic AMP indicates that protein kinase mediates cyclic AMP regulation of growth and enzyme induction in S49 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040174872,"The relationship between activation of resting chick embryo fibroblasts by proteases and proteolytic alteration of the cell surface has been investigated. Five different proteases were examined: trypsin, collagenase, plasmin, α-chymotrypsin, and thrombin. All of these proteases, when added to the culture medium at concentrations of 8–22 μg/ml, stimulated deoxyglucose uptake and induced cell division. The absolute levels of stimulation depended on the specific protease. Activation ranged from a doubling in cell number in 24 hr for trypsin and thrombin down to a 47% increase in cell number for α-chymotrypsin. Except in the case of thrombin, the stimulatory effects of these proteases correlated with breakdown of Z, a protein which is the major chick surface protein as revealed by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and which disappears upon transformation. In the case of thrombin, stimulatory concentrations brought about no detectable loss of surface components. Thus loss of Z is not a necessary condition for activation of chick fibroblasts; it may be a sufficient condition for activation of part of the cell population."

https://openalex.org/W1623120283,"The arrangement of the six cytochrome c oxidase subunits in the inner membrane of bovine heart mitochondria was investigated. The experiments were carried out in three steps. In the first step, exposed subunits were coupled to the membrane-impermeant reagent p-diazonium benzene [32S]sulfonate. In the second step, the membranes were lysed with cholate anc cytochrome c oxidase was isolated by immunoprecipitation. In the third step, the six cytochrome c oxidase subunits were separated from each other by dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and scanned for radioactivity. Exposed subunits on the outer side of the mitochondrial inner membrane were identified by labeling intact mitochondria. Exposed subunits on the matrix side of the inner membrane were identified by labeling sonically prepared submitochondrial particles in which the matrix side of the inner membrane is exposed to the suspending medium. Since sonic irradiation leads to a rearrangement of cytochrome c oxidase in a large fraction of the resulting submitochondrial particles, an immunochemical procedure was developed for isolating particles with a low content of displaced cytochrome c oxidase. With mitochondria, subunits II, V, and VI were labeled, whereas in purified submitochondrial particles most of the label was in subunit III. The arrangement of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial inner membrane is thus transmembraneous and asymmetric; subunits II, V, and VI are situated on the outer side, subunit III is situated on the matrix side, and subunits I and IV are buried in the interior of the membrane. In a study of purified cytochrome c oxidase labeled with p-diazonium benzene [32S]sulfonate, the results were similar to those obtained with the membrane-bound enzyme. Subunits I and IV were inaccessible to the reagent, whereas the other four subunits were accessible. In contrast, all six subunits became labeled if the enzyme was dissociated with dodecyl sulfate before being exposed to the labeling reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1482966555,"Mutants of Saccharomyces cervisiae with defects in enzymes of the electron transfer chain and in the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase have been isolated. Some of the mutants are specifically affected in either cytochrome oxidase, coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase or ATPase. Other strains are deficient in both cytochrome oxidase and coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase but still have rutamycin-sensitive ATPase. All the mutants reported in this study fail to be complemented by a rho0 tester derived from a respiratory competent strain. The meiotic spore progeny obtained by mating the mutants to a respiratory competent haploid yeast, when scored for growth on glycerol, show a non-Mendelian segregation of the phenotype. These two genetic tests indicate the mutations to be cytoplasmically inherited."
https://openalex.org/W1541405218,"A pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (pyrophosphate; D-fructose-6-phosphate-1-phosphotransferase) has been purified and characterized from extracts of Propionibacterium shermanii. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from pyrophosphate to fructose 6-phosphate to yield fructose-1,6-P2 and phosphate. This unique enzymatic activity was observed initially in Entamoeba histolytica (Reeves, R.E., South, D.J., Blytt, H.G., and Warren, L. G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 7734-7741). This is the third pyrophosphate-utilizing enzyme that these two diverse organisms have in common. The others are phosphoenolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase and pyruvate phosphate dikinase. The PPi-phosphofructokinase from P. shermanii is specific for fructose-6-P and fructose-1,6-P2, no other phosphorylated sugars were utilized. Phosphate could be replaced by arsenate. The Km values are: phosphate, 6.0 X 10(-4) M; fructose-1, 6-P2, 5.1 X 10(-5) M; pyrophosphate, 6.9 X 10(-5) M; and fructose-6-P, 1.0 X 10(-4) M. The S20w is 5.1 S. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is 95,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the enzyme showed a single band migrating with an Rf corresponding to a molecular weight of 48,000. Extracts of P. shermanii have PPi-phosphofructokinase activity approximately 6 times greater than ATP-phosphofructokinase and 15 to 20 times greater than fructose diphosphatase activities. It is proposed that (a) PPi may replace ATP in the formation of fructose-1-6-P2 when the organism is grown on glucose and (b) when the organism is grown on lactate or glycerol the conversion of fructose-1,6-P2 to fructose-6-P during gluconeogenesis may occur by phosphorolysis rather than hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1560163967,"The nucleotide sequence of ribosomal 5.8 S RNA (also known as 7 S or 5.5 S rRNA) from Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells has been determined to be (see article). Estimations of the secondary structure based upon maximized base pairing and the fragments of partial ribonuclease digestion indicate that there may be five base-paired regions in the molecule, three forming a folding of the termini and two forming secondary hairpin loops. The sequence of Novikoff hepatoma 5.8 S rRNA is about 75% homologous with that of yeast 5.8 S rRNA (Rubin, G.M. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3860-3875) and similar models for secondary structure are proposed. Both models contain a very stable G-C rich hairpin loop (residues 116 to 138), a less stable A-U-rich hairpin loop (residues 64 to 91) and two symmetrical bulges (residues 15 to 25 and 40 to 44)."
https://openalex.org/W54881700,"The mechanism by which 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1alpha,25-(OH)2D3), the biologically active metabolite of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), stimulates intestinal calcium absorption has been shown to involve an interaction of the steroid with a specific cytosol-chromatin receptor system in this target organ. Thus, 1alpha,12(OH)2D3 binds to a specific cytoplasmic receptor protein and then, following a temperature-dependent step, becomes associated with a finite number of chromatin acceptor sites prior to the initiation of the physiological response. In this respect, 1alpha,25(OH) 2D3 is similar to a number of other steroid hormones. In this investigation, studies were performed to help define the essential structural features required for interaction of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 with its intestinal receptor system, and presumably, for biological activity. To this end, competition studies utilizing a series of closely related structural analogs of cholecalciferol were carried out by means of a competitive binding assay highly specific for 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. The competitive binding assay employed in this study is dependent upon the ability to duplicate, in vitro, the conditions which permit the saturable binding of 1alpha,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 to chick intestinal chromatin, in vivo. Optimal conditions for this assay were achieved by the incubation of a reconstituted intestinal receptor system consisting of separately isolated cytosol and Triton X-100 chromatin fractions at 25 degrees for 45 min with 2.0 X 10-8 M 1alpha,25-(OH)2[3H]D3. Maximal binding of about 21 to 24 pmol of radioactive steroid bound per chick intestinal chromatin occurred under these conditions. The ability of the various analogs to compete with the radioactive hormone was assessed by virtue of a decrease in the amount of radioactive steroid bound to the chromatin in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive analog."
https://openalex.org/W2069201433,"Three Abelson virus-transformed lymphoma cell lines were established in tissue culture and the immunoglobulin biosynthesis by these cell lines was studied. Two of the cell lines (ABLS-1 and ABLS-5) were found to synthesize monomeric IgM molecules which were deposited in the cell membrane, probably to serve as an antigen receptor. The third cell line (ABLS-8) was found to synthesize membrane-associated IgM as well as cellular IgG molecules. In addition, these cell lines were found to synthesize a protein of 35,000 molecular weight which is also membrane-associated and which has the capability to bind the immunoglobulins (MAID). It is speculated that this protein might play a role in adapting the receptor immunoglobulin molecule to the hydrophobic environment of the cell membrane. The kinetics of amino acid incorporation into immunoglobulins by these cell lines show that they produce immunoglobulins at a rate which is two orders of magnitude smaller than plasmacytoma cells (MOPC 104E). These results suggest that Abelson virus transforms thymus-independent lymphocytes in various stages of maturation and these lymphocytes might be of B cell origin. The T lymphoma (P1798) used as a control cell line was found occasionally to produce minute amounts of immunoglobulin."

https://openalex.org/W1646353375,"In an earlier investigation (Shanmugam, K. T., Buchanan, B. B., and Arnon, D. I. (1972) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 256, 477-486) the extraction of ferredoxin from Rhodospirillum rubrum cells with the aid of a detergent (Triton X-100) and acetone revealed the existence of two types of ferredoxin (I and II) and led to the conclusion that both are membrane-bound. In the present investigation, ferredoxin and acid-labile sulfur analyses of photosynthetic membranes (chromatophores) and soluble protein extracts of the photosynthetic bacteria R. rubrum and Rhodopseudomonas spheroides showed that ferredoxins I and II are primarily components of the soluble protein fraction. After their removal, washed R. rubrum chromatophores were found to contain a considerable amount of tightly bound iron-sulfur protein(s), as evidenced by acid-labile sulfur and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses. Thus, like all other photosynthetic cells examined to date, R. rubrum cells contain both soluble ferredoxins and iron-sulfur proteins tightly bound to photosynthetic membranes. The molecular weights of ferredoxins I and II from photosynthetically grown R. rubrum cells were found to be 8,800 and 14,500, respectively. Using these molecular weights, the molar extinction coefficients at 390 nm for ferredoxins I and II were determined to be 30.3 and 17.2 mM-1 CM-1, respectively. Ferredoxin I contains 8 non-heme iron and 8 acid-labile sulfur atoms per molecule; ferredoxin II contains 4 non-heme iron and 4 acid-labile sulfur atoms per molecule. Ferredoxin I was found only in photosynthetically grown cells whereas ferredoxin II was present in both light- and dark-grown cells. Ferredoxin II from both light- and dark-grown cells has the same molecular weight (14,500) and absorption spectrum and has 4 iron and 4 acid-labile sulfur atoms per molecule. Low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of oxidized and photoreduced ferredoxins I and II from R. rubrum were recorded. The EPR spectrum of oxidized ferredoxin II exhibited a single resonance line at g = 2.012. Oxidized ferredoxin I, however, exhibited a spectrum that may arise from the superimposition of two resonance lines near g = 2.012. Photoreduced ferredoxin II displayed a rhombic EPR spectrum with a g value of 1.94. Photoreduced ferredoxin I exhibited a similar EPR spectrum at a temperature of 16 K, but when the temperature was lowered to 4.5 K the spectrum of ferredoxin I changed. This temperature-dependent spectrum may result from a weak spin-spin interaction between two iron-sulfur clusters. These results are consistent with the conclusion that R. rubrum ferredoxins I and II are, respectively, 8 iron/8 sulfur and 4 iron/4sulfur proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1964441417,"THE first evidence for an abnormality in insulin receptor capacity in pathological states was provided by Kahn et al.1, who found that liver plasma membranes from the obese hyperglycaemic mouse bound only a fraction of insulin compared with membranes from lean littermates. A similar observation was made with lymphocytes from obese insulin-resistant diabetic patients2. In lymphocyte cultures the insulin concentration in the medium seemed to determine the binding capacity of the cells3. These results suggested an inverse relationship between the number of receptors and the surrounding concentration of insulin, regardless of the tissue sensitivity to the hormone. We have now found greater than normal binding capacity in the diabetic Chinese hamster, which has genetic insulin deficiency, in many ways resembling juvenile diabetes4."

https://openalex.org/W1479759526,"Although the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase from beef liver (E.C. 1.1.1.22) is known to abstract the pro-R hydrogen stereospecifically at carbon 6 of the glucose moiety of the substrate by a reversible step in converting UDP-glucose to UDP-alpha-D-gluco-hexodialdose (UDP-Glc-6-CHO), prolonged incubation of the enzyme with UDP-glucose and tritium-labeled NADH, under conditions favoring hydrogen exchange between the two, results in equivalent labeling of both hydrogens at carbon 6. This shows that the pro-S hydrogen at carbon 6 is also abstracted by a reversible process which must then involve a derivative of the carboxyl group of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) that is capable of reversible hydrogenation-dehydrogenation. It is the hydrolysis of this derivative that accounts for the well known irreversibility of the overall reaction. Derivatization of the enzyme's essential thiol group with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) eliminates the ability of the enzyme to either oxidize or reduce UDP-Glc-6-CHO. Replacement of the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate group with cyanide fully restores the enzyme's capacity to reduce UDP-Glc-6-CHO but has no effect on the inhibition of the oxidation to UDP-GlcUA. This indicates that the essential thiol group is involved in the second reversible dehydrogenation step and serves to form a thiol ester with the carboxyl of the product, UDP-GlcUA. It is suggested that thiol ester intermediates are a general characteristic of all 4-electron NAD-linked dehydrogenase reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1584870824,"Hepatocytes and Kupffer cells were separated from rat liver after prelabeling the Kupffer cells with colloidal iron and perfusion of the liver with digestive enzymes. The activity of several enzymes from Kupffer cells and hepatocytes was compared to validate this method of cell separation. The ratios of hepatocyte to Kupffer cell specific activities of glucose-6-phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, adenylate cyclase, and acid phosphatase were 20, 0.39, 0.18, and 0.078, respectively. Adenylate cyclases from hepatocytes and Kupffer cells were stimulated by fluoride ion, GTP, and catecholamines. Hepatocyte adenylate cyclase was also stimulated by glucagon, secretin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and by prostaglandin E1, whereas, the Kupffer cell enzyme was completely insensitive to these hormones. The stimulation of hepatocyte adenylate cyclase by combinations of glucagon plus secretin, or glucagon plus vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were equivalent to the sum of the individual stimulations. This suggests that the hepatocyte has specific receptors for glucagon and for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and secretin. Prostaglandin E1 stimulation of hepatocyte adenylate cyclase was not additive to the stimulation caused by polypeptide hormones or catecholamines, nor did prostaglandin E1 decrease stimulation caused by these hormones. Although prostaglandin-sensitive adenylate cyclase was recovered with hepatocytes, 40 to 50% of the total liver prostaglandin-sensitive activity was recovered in a fraction of cell debris mixed with small cells which did not phagocytize colloidal iron."

These analogs have been examined for their effects on reactions catalyzed by the ribonucleotide reductase of Lactobacillus leichmannii. All the analogs are inhibitors of ATP reduction in the presence of adenosylcobalamin as coenzyme, and hence all are bound to the catalytic site. Only the 3-beta-D-ribofuranosyladenine analog (isoadenosylcobalamin) showed substantial activity as a coenzyme in ATP reduction, giving a rate of 59% of that obtained with the adenosylcobalamin. Lesser rates of reduction were obtained with nebularyl-, 2'-deoxyadenosyl-, tubercidyl-, isopropylideneadenosyl-, L-adenosyl-, and ara-adenosylcobalamin, coenzyme activity decreasing in that order. Other analogs showed no significant coenzyme activity. The rate of hydrogen exchange into water from the 5'-methylene group of the nucleoside ligand appeared to parallel the coenzyme activity in those analogs examined, but only the four cobalamins with highest coenzyme activity (adenosyl, isoadenosyl, nebularyl, 2'-deoxyadenosyl) gave detectable amounts of coenzyme B12, THe rapidly formed paramagnetic intermediate of ribonucleotide reduction. The enzyme system produced the slowly formed paramagnetic species characterized by a doublet EPR spectrum only with adenosyl- and isoadenosylcobalamin. By contrast the enzymic degradation of analogs to cob(II)alamin and 5'-deoxynucleoside occurred not only with those analogs active as coenzymes and in the exchange reaction but also with a number of coenzymically inactive analogs, and the rate of degradation was unrelated to the rate of ribonucleotide reduction for those analogs with coenzyme activity."

Among the different nucleotides tested, GTP, GDP, and GMP were able to protect the native sulfhydryl group against reaction with DTNB in the absence of ribosomes. Their Kd values with the faster reacting EF-G were 3.4 x 10(-4) M, 0.3 X 10(-4)M, and 2.0 x 10(-4) M, respectively. Because of the specificity of protection by guanine nucleotides and the correspondence of the Kd values with Ki values for GDP and GMP in the ribosome-EF-G GTPase reaction, their binding site on EF-G should be closely related to the active center for ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Blockage of the native sulfhydryl group of EF-G with a variety of irreversible thiol reagents reduced its activity from one to two-thirds in ribosome-dependent complex formation, GTP hydrolysis, and poly(U)-directed poly(phenylalanine) synthesis. A test of the N-ethylmaleimide-treated EF-G showed both the Km and Vmax of the GTPase reaction to be affected. Thus, the native sulfhydryl group, although important, appears not to be located in the GTPase active center. Denaturation of EF-G with guanidine-HCl and random blockage of any of the three masked sulfhydryl groups caused inactivation, likely due to steric interference with proper chain folding upon renaturation. Treatment of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits with six different thiol reagents at a concentration of 0.27 mM had little or no effect on the ribosome-EF-G GTPase, except for the case with HMB which inactivated the 30 S subunit. An interaction of EF-G with the 30 S subunit in addition to that known to occur with the 50 S subunit is suggested by a rapid and preferential exchange of HMB from the native sulfhydryl group of EF-G to the 30 S subunit of 70 S ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2160490652,"The high error rate characteristic of DNA polymerases from RNA tumor viruses has permitted measurements on the simultaneous incorporation of complementary and noncomplementary nucleotides during DNA synthesis. For example, avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase incorporates 1 molecule of dCMP for approximately 500 molecules of dTMP polymerized using polyriboadenylic acid as a template. The parallel incorporation of complementary and noncomplementary nucleotides afer gel filtration of avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase indicates that the observed fidelity is catalyzed by the polymerase itself. Nearest neighbor analysis of the product indicates that noncomplementary nucleotides are incorporated as single base substitutions. The incorporation of the noncomplementary dCMP is not reduced by a 20-fold greater amount of the complementary nucleotide, dTTP. Conversely, the concentration of the noncomplementary nucleotides does not effect the rate of incorporation of the complementary nucleotide. A similar lack of competition between complementary dGTP and noncomplementary dATP is exhibited using poly(rC)-oligo(dG) as a template-primer. Furthermore, there was no detectable competition between the different noncomplementary nucleotides. Possible explanations for this lack of competition are considered."

Diminished NAD occurring at organophosphorus and methyl carbamate concentrations as low as 0.6 to 2.0 parts per million in the egg constitutes a newly recognized biochemical lesion induced by the two most important classes of insecticide chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W1499084672,"Stopped flow fluorometry, measuring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of progesterone-binding globulin (PBG), was used to determine the association and dissociation rates of the interaction of PBG with seven delta4-3-ketosteroids. The rates of formation and dissociation of the PBG-progesterone complex were measured as a function of concentration and temperature. At 20 degrees, kon = 8.7 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 and koff = 0.060 S-1. The association rate constants for progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, testosterone, testosterone acetate, and medrogestone were found to be the same within experimental error. The different affinities of PBG for these steroids result from the dissociation rate constants of the steroids which ranged from 0.43 S-1 for testosterone to 0.024 S-1 for medrogestone. Two corticosteroids, corticosterone and cortisol, were both bound somewhat more slowly (approximately 5 X 10(7) M-1 S-1). Reflecting their very low affinity for PBG both steroids dissociate very rapidly: corticosterone at 1.4 S-1 and cortisol at 90 S-1. The ratio of association to dissociation rate constants gave affinity constants in agreement with independently determined constants."
https://openalex.org/W1506693883,"The reversible inactivation of porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate yields an irreversible modification upon sodium borohydride reduction. A 200-fold molar excess of pyridoxal-5'-P over enzyme results in inactivation to the extent of 54%, and incorporation of 5.7 mol of inactivator per mol of enzyme. The same inactivation carried out in the presence of 80 mM coenzyme, NADH, produces malate dehydrogenase which is approximately 94% active and contains 4.6 mol of pyridoxal-5'-P per mol of enzyme. The incorporation between inactivated and protected samples suggests, for total inactivation, the modification of 2 residues per mol of enzyme (i.e. 1 residue per subunit, or 1 per enzymatic active site). This specificity was confirmed by the isolation of a single pyridoxyl-5'-P-labeled difference obtained by comparison of the Dowex 1-X2 elution profiles of tryptic digests of protected and inactivated samples, respectively. Amino acid analysis of the peptide demonstrated the presence of N6-pyridoxyl-L-lysine (Lys(Pyx)), establishing the existence of an essential lysing residue in the active center of malate dehydrogenase. The amino acid sequence of the active center hexapeptide has been determined to be: H2NLys(Pyx)Pro-Gly-Met-Thr-Arg-COOH."

R. rubrum cytochrome c' is composed of a single peptide chain of 126 amino acid residues with a single heme covalently bound near the COOH terminus. There is no sequence similarity to mitochondrial cytochrome c, except at the heme binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1586589343,"Native human plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) interacts with concanavalin A but not with ricin; apOLDL reacts with both lectins. Each reaction is inhibited by the appropriate lectin-specific carbohydrate. The receptors on LDL for these two lectins are not destroyed by digestion by proteolytic enzymes. Peptide hydrolysis does not influence the reactivity of LDL toward concanavalin A. It does, however, substantially enhance the ability of the lipoprotein to interact with ricin. The data strongly suggest that the carbohydrate protion of a glycoprotein component of LDL is bound at the saccharidespecific active site on the lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1532525487,"In the direction of reductive condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and lysine, saccharopine dehydrogenase (N6-(glutar-2-yl)-L-lysine:NAD oxidoreductase (lysine-forming) is inhibited by high concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate and lysine, but not by NADH. NAD+ and saccharopine show no substrate inhibition in the reverse direction. Substrate inhibition by alpha-ketoglutarate and lysine is linear uncompetitive versus NADH. However, when the inhibition is examined with alpha-ketoglutarate or lysine as the variable substrate, the double reciprocal plots show a family of curved lines concave up. The curvature is more pronounced with increasing concentrations of the inhibitory substrate, suggesting an interaction of variable substrate with the enzyme form carrying the inhibitory substrate. These inhibition patterns, the lack of interaction of structural analogs of lysine such as ornithine and norleucine with the E-NAD+ complex (Fujioka M., and Nakatani, Y. (1972) Eur. J. Biochem. 25, 301-307), the identity of values of inhibition constants of alpha-ketoglutarate and lysine obtained with either one as the substrate inhibitor, and the substrate inhibition data in the presence of a reaction product, NAD+, are consistent with the mechanism that substrate inhibition results from the formation of a dead-end E-NAD+-alpha-ketoglutarate complex followed by the addition of lysine to this abortive complex."
https://openalex.org/W142430398,"Continued high levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase in cultured H4-II-E-C3 rat hepatoma cells require either serum or glucocorticoids in the culture medium. Upon withdrawal of serum, cellular phenylalanine hydroxylase levels decay exponentially with a half-life of 22 hours for about 60 hours, after which time a low, constant enzyme content persists for at least 96 hours. This decline of phenylalanine hydroxylase is fully reversible; normal enzyme levels are restored in a time- and dosage-dependent fashion upon addition of serum to basal cultures. The serum factor is nondialyzable and moderately heat-stable. The stimulation by serum of the phenylalanine hydroxylas content of basal cultures is blocked by 3-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]glutarimide and requires ongoing cellular protein synthesis. When added to the enzyme-assay mixture in vitro, serum does not alter the phenylalanine hydroxylase activity of extracts from basal cultures. Three lines of evidence suggest that serum contains a nonsteroidal phenylalanine hydroxylase stimulatory components(s): (a) glucocorticoid antagonists inhibit less than one-half of the biological activity of serum; (b) exhaustive extraction of endogenous serum glucocorticoids with charcoal reduces the activity of serum to about one-half of control values; and (c) the stimulatory effects of charcoal reduces the values; and (c) the stimulatory effects of charcoal-extracted serum and hydrocortisone are additive. The phenylalanine hydroxylase stimulatory activities of the charcoal-extracted sera from four mammalian species and from three stages in development in one mammalian species are comparable. A survey of partially purified preparations of a number of known hormones failed to reveal any one capable of elevating the phenylalanine hydroxylas levels of basal cultures in a manner comparable to that of charcoal-extracted serum."
