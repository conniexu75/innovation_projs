https://openalex.org/W1973895646,"Rabies virus was found on mouse diaphragms and on cultured chick myotubes in a distribution coinciding with that of the acetylcholine receptor. Treatment of the myotubes with alpha-bungarotoxin and d-tubocurarine before the addition of the virus reduced the number of myotubes that became infected with rabies virus. These findings together suggest that acetylcholine receptors may serve as receptors for rabies virus. The binding of virus to acetylcholine receptors, which are present in high density at the neuromuscular junction, would provide a mechanism whereby the virus could be locally concentrated at sites in proximity to peripheral nerves facilitating subsequent uptake and transfer to the central nervous system."

Using this system it has been shown that these phenotypes are under separate genetic control. Furthermore, the tumorigenic phenotype can be complemented by fusion of different tumorigenic cells, resulting in nontumorigenic hybrids. This system also provides information on the control of differentiated function. Molecular cytogenetic techniques should reveal the nature of the chromosomal control of neoplastic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1597160917,"Rabbit Fab' antibody fragments were covalently couple to preformed large unilamellar vesicles using a new sulfhydryl-reactive phospholipid derivative N-[4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyryl]phosphatidylethanolamine (MPB-PE). A highly efficient reaction between the sulfhydryl group on each Fab' fragment and the maleimide moiety of MPB-PE molecules incorporated at a low concentration in vesicle bilayers led to the formation of a highly stable Fab'-vesicle linkage. Coupling ratios in excess of 250 micrograms of Fab'/mumol of vesicle phospholipid were reproduciably obtained without vesicle aggregation. Bound Fab' fragments did not elute from vesicles in serum or in the presence of reducing agents (dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol). Vesicles bearing Fab' fragments raised against specific human erythrocyte surface determinants bound selectively to human erythrocytes under physiological conditions (isotonic medium containing 50% human serum, pH 7.4) with minimal leakage of vesicle contents. Advantages of the present coupling method are discussed in relationship to our effects to optimize the properties of liposomes as a carrier system."

The percentage of phagocytic macrophages and the number of particles per cell were determined from cell-size and fluorescence histograms. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro phagocytosis data showed that the percentage of phagocytic lavaged macrophages reflected the availability of instilled particles. With sodium azide used to model phagocytosis inhibition, it was shown that the percentage of phagocytic cells and the number of particles per cell can be determined simultaneously."

For some visual environments, however, the point of maximum rate of change of magnification in the retinal image coincides with the direction of self motion, independently of the direction of gaze. This visual indicator could be used to judge the direction of self motion."

The results of this experiment implicate a process that integrates by summing information from successive fixations after spatially reconciling the information from each glimpse. The output of this process is a memory image that preserves the properly reconciled information from successive fixations.

https://openalex.org/W2002134809,"Large Amounts of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK) are present in the rat caudatoputamen. The peptide occurs in axons and nerve endings but not in perikarya. The origin of CCK in the caudatoputamen was investigated with the use of immunocytochemistry and a radioimmunoassay specific for CCK. Although a small amount of CCK (approximately 30 percent) originates in the amygdaloid complex, the bulk of the peptide (approximately 70 percent) occurs in processes of neurons located ventral to the caudatoputamen, that is, the claustrum or the piriform cortex. The claustrum and piriform cortex receive inputs from various cortical areas and the olfactory system, respectively, and may process information and relay it to the caudatoputamen. Thus CCK may by the transmitter in the final common pathway linking various cortical areas and the olfactory system to the caudatoputamen."
https://openalex.org/W1483900477,"The turkey erythrocyte membrane insulin receptor was solubilized and reconstituted into vesicles composed of either soy or dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine. Reconstitution with soy phosphatidylcholine provided a lipid environment containing 43% unsaturated fatty acids, as compared with 82% saturated fatty acids in the dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine preparation. After reconstitution, both species of vesicles were isolated from a 2 to 30% continuous sucrose gradient at a density of 1.071 g/ml. Scatchard analysis of binding data obtained at 15 degrees C revealed that the reconstituted receptor had a greater affinity for [125I]iodoinsulin in the saturated lipid environment (Ke = 0.167 nM-1; K1 = 2.18 nm-1) than in the unsaturated lipid environment (Ke = 0.0162 nM-1; K1 = 0.479 nm-1). Low affinity binding also was increased in the saturated vesicles. These increases were paralleled by a reduction in the number of available insulin binding sites in the saturated lipid environment. There was no difference, however, in the relative affinity of the reconstituted receptor preparations for insulin or proinsulin. Electron microscopy and gel filtration indicated that the binding differences are not due to differences in vesicle size. They also are not due to differences in the orientation of the receptor within the lipid bilayer, for its sensitivity to trypsin digestion was similar in both types of vesicles. Solubilization studies with 1% beta-octylglucoside indicated, however, that the dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles incorporated a slightly lesser amount of insulin receptor. Similar results were also observed at 37 degrees C. These results suggest that the membrane lipid environment, especially the degree of unsaturation of the phospholipid fatty acyl chains, can influence the binding properties of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1604026341,"A new, highly discriminating affinity chromatographic technique has been developed which employs antithrombin and concanavalin A-Sepharose to fractionate heparin species of all molecular sizes. This methodology is able to subdivide the active mucopolysaccharide pools of molecular weight 6,000 to 8,000 (LMW) or 18,000 to 22,000 (HMW) into various species with descending affinities for antithrombin as well as decreasing anticoagulant potencies. The upper 10% of these two pools, either LMW or HMW highly active heparin, appears to be relatively homogeneous with respect to interactions with antithrombin and possessed anticoagulant potencies of 350 units/mg and 731 units/mg, respectively. The HMW highly active heparin has been examined by analytic ultracentrifugation. It exhibited a charge-connected weight-average molecular weight of 22,000 +/- 2,000 with minimal size heterogeneity. The stoichiometries of interaction of antithrombin and platelet factor 4 with HMW highly active heparin as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that 2 molecules of either protein are able to bind to 1 molecule of the mucopolysaccharide. These studies also reveal that the binding of antithrombin to HMW highly active heparin is characterized by KDISSHAT = 5.0 X 10(-8) M and KDISSHAT2 = 1.0 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The avidity of platelet factor 4 for HMW highly active heparin could not be quantitated but appears to be at least 10 to 100 times greater than that of antithrombin for mucopolysaccharide."

Diverse studies in immunology, wound healing, carcinogenesis, transplantation biology, and developmental biology are brought together to emphasize the practical implications of regional differences for research protocols in all these areas of research. The more fundamental question of mechanisms is approached by consideration of variations in the vascular supply, pattern of nervous system development, expression of temperature differentials, and the establishment of metabolic gradients during development."
https://openalex.org/W1597727103,"The epithelial cells of rat small intestine (jejunum-ileum) were separated from their supporting stroma (residue). Total nonacid and acid glycosphingolipids were prepared from the two compartments. The acetylated nonacid glycolipids were separated into 10-12 fractions by column chromatography. These were analyzed by chromatographic methods, mass spectrometry, and proton NMR spectroscopy and compared with glycolipids isolated from whole rat small intestine. The sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids were compared in the same way without subfractionation. At least 37 different glycosphingolipids (different carbohydrate moieties) were found, 23 in the nonepithelial residue and 17 in the epithelial cells of one rat strain. In a second rat strain, another 4 structures were detected. The glycosphingolipids of epithelial cells and nonepithelial residue were distinctly different. Glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide were found in both compartments, while isoglobotriaosylceramide was restricted to the nonepithelial residue. A tetrahexosylceramide with a terminal Gal alpha 1 leads to 3 on a globotriaosylceramide core was found in both compartments as were homologues with 1 or 2 additional internal leads to 3Gal alpha 1 leads to units, but homologues with 3 or 4 additional internal Gal were only nonepithelial. Glycosphingolipids with terminal beta-GalNAc were restricted to the nonepithelial residue comprising globotetraosylceramide, isoglobotetraosylceramide, and a series of glycolipids with 5 to 9 sugars having the above-mentioned oligohexosylceramides as core structures. Fucolipids (blood group H) having 3, 5, 6, and 7 sugars and lacking amino sugars, and fucolipids with 5 and 10 sugars containing N-acetylglucosamine were restricted to the epithelial cells. Fucolipids (blood groups H and B) with 5 and 6 sugars containing N-acetylgalactosamine were restricted to the nonepithelial residue. In a 4, 6, and 12 sugars were found in the epithelial cells. N-Glycoloylneuraminosyllactosylceramide was the only ganglioside found in the epithelial cells while N-acetylneuraminosyllactosylceramide was nonepithelial together with gangliosides based on gangliotetraosylceramide and isoglobotetraosylceramide."

Tritium was rapidly eliminated from the circulation by uptake in liver and excretion in bile as well as by renal uptake and excretion in urine. Chromatographic analyses of tritium in tissues and body fluids indicated that leukotrienes C3 and D3 constituted significant parts of the radioactivity in liver, bile, and small intestine 20 min after intravenous injection, whereas kidney contained leukotriene E3 and unidentified metabolites. Lung, pleural fluid, spleen, salivary glands, and connective tissue showed higher concentrations of tritium than blood.

https://openalex.org/W2032996819,"Murine B16 melanoma cells were adapted for lung survival and growth by allowing them to attach to Bio-Carrier beads and injecting the beads intravenously into normal mice. The beads lodged mechanically in the microcirculation of the lung. When the melanoma cells had grown into visible tumors from the arrested beads, the tumors were removed and the cells were dispersed, cultured to remove normal cells, and reattached to new beads. The process was repeated nine times. Previously another B16 subline was injected intravenously as a suspension of separate tumor cells. Those cells that survived and colonized the lungs were harvested, cultured, and injected again. This selection process was also repeated nine times. Only the subline that was injected in suspension was more metastatic than the parental line, indicating that metastasis involves selection of preexistent metastatic cells and is not an adaptive process by which all cells gradually acquire the ability to grow at particular organ sites."
https://openalex.org/W1495143544,"Rat serosal mast cells cultured in the presence of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum incorporated (35S) sulfate into heparin proteoglycan of approximately Mr = 750,000 after a 3-h pulse and a 2-h chase. beta-D-Xyloside (0.1 mM) treatments of cultures of rat mast cells resulted in an insignificant increase in total (35S) sulfate incorporation and the appearance of free glycosaminoglycans without a change in proteoglycan size. At higher beta-D-xyloside concentrations, total (35S)sulfate incorporation was inhibited and an increase in the relative glycosaminoglycan content was observed concomitant with a reduction in proteoglycan amount and size. As assessed by susceptibility to digestion by chondroitinase ABC, hydrolysis by nitrous acid, [3H]hexosamine content, and electrophoretic mobility, only heparin chains were polymerized onto the proteoglycan core in all cultures. In contrast, individual glycosaminoglycans which appeared only after beta-D-xyloside treatment were predominantly chondroitin sulfate rather than heparin, indicating that the beta-D-xyloside acceptor supported polymerization of chondroitin sulfate but not of heparin glycosaminoglycan. Thus, the peptide core is an important determinant for the synthesis of heparin glycosaminoglycan by rat peritoneal mast cells."

Commun. 49, 1061-1068), isolated from human type A-erythrocytes, were elucidated. The intact glycolipids and fragments produced by treatment with endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii (Fukuda, M. N., and Matsumura, G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 6218-6225) were analyzed by methylation. In addition, a specific limited enzyme digestion of Ad-glycolipid was made by incorporating the glycolipid into liposomes before endo-beta-galactosidase digestion. The method preferentially hydrolyzed one of the side chains carrying an A-determinant leaving a core which was recovered from the liposomes. The Ac- and Ad- glycolipids have two branched carbohydrate chains with 12 and 14 sugar residues, respectively, and both have two A-determinants as shown below. (formula see text). The structures of A- and H-active variants isolated from subgroups A1 and A2 have been compared. The results indicate that A variants from A1 or A2 erythrocytes have identical structures, and that H-variants isolated from A2 erythrocytes are identical to those isolated from O erythrocytes. Thus, there is no qualitative structural difference in A-active glycolipids between A1 and A2 erythrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1513911231,"We have studied the changes in tropomyosin subunits and their pattern of phosphorylation during embryonic development and also during in vitro differentiation of cultured muscle cells. We have found that in 10-day-old embryos tropomyosin consists of 75% beta subunit and 25% alpha subunit. However, only 60% of the beta subunit is phosphorylated while the alpha subunit is almost exclusively present in its phosphorylated form. During subsequent development, the amount of alpha-tropomyosin increases so that by hatching it represents 50% of the total subunits. During the same time, the amount of phosphorylated variants for both the alpha and the beta subunits decreases so that after hatching they represent less than 20% of each subunit. In cultures of differentiating myoblasts, the alpha subunit is synthesized before the beta subunit, and within each subunit, the unphosphorylated variants are the first to be synthesized. The reason for this discrepancy is not known at the present time."
https://openalex.org/W1607708211,"A heat-stable preparation from rat liver cytosol increases the glucocorticoid binding capacity of rat thymocyte cytosol and stabilizes thymocyte binding capacity that has been activated by dithiothreitol. The liver preparation contains at least two heat-stable activities. The activity that increases glucocorticoid binding capacity may represent a rather short lived reducing activity that can be separated from a small M, factor (or factors) that, like molybdate, stabilizes reduced receptors. In unheated cytosol, the majority of the heat stable, receptor-stabilizing activity is present in association with macromolecules but this is released to a small molecular weight form on heating. The properties of this receptor-stabilizing factor have been examined in a rat liver cytosol assay where the lability of the receptor has been increased by washing the cytosol free of low Mr substances by filtration on an Amicon UMlO filter. The binding capacity of the washed cytosol preparation is stabilized by addition of boiled cytosol prepared from several rat tissues. The heat-stable factor activity is acid labile and is not affected by incubation with a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases, nucleases, glycohydrolases, phospholipase A, lipase, or alkaline phosphatase. The endogenous heat-stable factor(s) is not a nucleotide, a cyclic nucleotide, pyridoxal phosphate, or inorganic phosphate. Steroid-bound receptors in cytosol washed free of low molecular weight substances are more rapidly transformed to the DNA-binding state on incubation at 15 “C than those in normal cytosol. This rapid transformation is inhibited by addition of the heat-stable factor preparation. The two heat-stable activities, inhibition of receptor inactivation and inhibition of receptor transformation, coelute from Sephadex G-10 and from Dowex 1 columns. Both activities have been purified more than 200-fold with respect to Lowry-reactive material. The heat-stable factor appears to be widely distributed as the activity has been found in primitive eukaryotes, like the lobster and yeast, as well as in avians, amphibians, and mammals. This heat-stable factor(s) may play a role in maintaining the glucocorticoid receptor in the untransformed, steroid-binding form that is found in the cytoplasm."

The phosphate transport protein was incorporated into liposomes (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid, 2.75:1:1), and phosphate/phosphate exchange rates were determined. With pHe (extraliposomal) = pHi (intraliposomal) = 7.2, we found a Km of 2.5 mM independent of [(Pi)i] and a Vmax of 12 mumol/min . mg of protein. Parallel phosphate transport experiments were carried out with liposomes containing phosphate transport protein isolated from mitochondria inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Phosphate transported unidirectionally [pHe = pHi = 6.8; = 1.0 mM, (Pi)i = 0 mM] reaches a maximum at 30 s and is 0.13 and 0.05 mumol/mg for active and inhibited protein, respectively.

At all the above pH values, about the same uptake is observed with liposomes prepared without protein as those prepared with inhibited protein. The initial rate of protein catalyzed unidirectional flux [(Pi)e = 1.0 mM, pHe = 6.8; (Pi)i = 0 mM, pHi = 8.0) is 2 mumol/min . mg of protein or 8 mumol/min . mg of phosphate transport protein estimated without the adenine nucleotide translocase."

Sequential ultracentrifugal isolation gave LDL that contained between 5 and 37% of the cholesteryl ester derived from the artificial cholesteryl ester donor. The labeling was essentially complete within 2 h of incubation. Resonance energy transfer of LDL, labeled with fluorescent cholesteryl esters and with the surface probe 5-(N-hexadecanoylamino) fluorescein, indicated that the added cholesteryl ester was located in the inner core of the lipoprotein. In addition, biological screening of the labeled LDL in cultured cells in vitro and in the rat in vivo showed that this labeling procedure had no detectable deleterious effect on LDL. This method of labeling lipoproteins allows a rapid and specific introduction of cholesteryl esters into lipoproteins."

Comparative studies indicated that the rate of sugar incorporation into albumin increased with increasing pH and temperature of incubation and followed a first order dependence with regard to monosaccharide and albumin concentrations. The extent of nonenzymatic galactosylation of human albumin was approximately 300% greater than the extent of nonenzymatic glucosylation under equivalent experimental conditions. Prolonged dialysis of the modified albumins against a large excess of the unlabeled monosaccharides failed to alter the amount of protein-bound radiolabeled carbohydrate, suggesting that the linkage between sugar and albumin is covalent in nature.

This effect is greatest with palmitic acid, less with linoleic and linolenic acids, and not seen with stearic acid. By use of the hydrophobic penetrating probe fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB), we find a second larger population of PE and phosphatidylserine (PS) molecules which reacts with FDNB and has a higher specific activity than the PE and PS molecules which do not react. With human polymorphonuclear cells, the labeled PE molecules inside the cell have a higher specific activity than the PE molecules located on the outer cell surface.

Gel filtration chromatography of a rat thyroid extract revealed a major peak of immunoreactive peptide of approximately the same molecular weight as synthetic CAP. A minor peak of higher molecular weight immunoreactive material was also observed. The isoelectric point of both the thyroid peptide and synthetic material was about 5.2.

The majority of the nuclear proteins, including all of H1 and 70% of the core histone oligomers, were solubilized. By contrast, suboptimal concentrations of heparin (heparin:DNA less than 0.3) resulted in the selective solubilization of non-histone proteins and the partial solubilization of chromatin without dissociation of histones from DNA. Among the RNA- and DNA-associated non-histone proteins revealed by the heparin fractionation procedure, some are noteworthy. A DNA-associated protein of 40,000 daltons was found to be associated with core histone oligomer. Three proteins of Mr = 62,000, 70,000, and 74,000, identical with that of the lamina proteins, were distinguished by their presence in all the fractions obtained, their predominance in the less soluble fractions, and their tight association with DNA and RNA.

Other characteristics of the sulfhydryl-dependent stimulation of receptor activation, such as pH-dependence and sensitivity to the sulfhydryl blocking agent iodoacetamide, suggest that the sulfhydryl groups essential for receptor activation are different from those involved in steroid binding. Progesterone receptor activation by sulfhydryl reduction was a reversible process, dependent on addition or removal (by dialysis) of the reducing agent. Optimal receptor activation (up to 75% of total receptor) occurred when cytosol was diluted with buffer in the presence of dithiothreitol, suggesting that dissociation of either a receptor subunit or an inhibitory factor present in cytosol may also be involved in the activation process. This putative inhibitor appears to have a Mr greater than or equal to 30,000 since it is not removed from cytosol by dialysis or gel filtration. These results emphasize the importance of sulfhydryl groups or a disulfide bridge, perhaps associated with the DNA-binding domain of the receptor, in a key regulatory step in the mechanism of steroid hormone action: activation and subsequent binding of the steroid-receptor complex to DNA or chromatin."

In this study, the reaction of the residues toward 4,4'-dithiodipyridine was measured at various degrees of saturation with O2. Analysis of initial rates of the reaction revealed that an intermediate, which reacts even more rapidly than the oxy form, occurs in the course of O2 binding to hemoglobin A, especially at higher degrees of saturation. Its occurrence was independent of the overall O2 affinity of hemoglobin. Time courses of the reaction were measured at pH 8.0, where the change in O2 saturation of hemoglobin by the 4,4'-dithiodipyridine reaction is negligible, and they were analyzed by the curve-fitting procedure. It was found that the rapidly reacting species appears in parallel with the Adair intermediate carrying three O2 molecules, and their close relationship was suggested. Furthermore, the analysis of the time course indicated the existence of another molecular species with an intermediate reactivity between those of oxy and deoxy forms. It was concluded that the ligand-linked structural changes in hemoglobin take place through several steps."

Optimum enzymatic activity was obtained using the detergent Triton CF-54 at a pH of 6.6. Enzyme activity appeared unaffected by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, EDTA, or histone. A slight elevation in activity was seen in the presence of Hg2+. When the disialoganglioside GD1b (galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl [N-acetylneuraminyl-N-acetylneuraminyl]galactosylglucosylceramide) was used as the glycolipid substrate, approximately 15% of the radioactive label was found in GQ1b. When this GQ1b was subjected to a periodate oxidation-borohydride reduction, the distribution of radioactive label was consistent with GQ1b being the major tetrasialoganglioside product and that its synthesis could proceed via the sequence GD1b-GT1b-GQ1b."
https://openalex.org/W1540186470,"Villin, a 95,000-dalton protein, is a major component of microvillus cores isolated from intestinal brush borders. In this study, we compared the Ca2+-dependent action of this protein on actin filaments with that of cytochalasin B, a fungal metabolite that binds to the barbed end of actin filaments and nuclei. We found that substoichiometric levels of villin inhibit actin filament elongation and self-association in a cytochalasin-like manner. In addition, the protein releases membrane-bound F-actin in the absence of high shear force, probably by severing the filaments. The filament fragments formed in the presence of villin, as well as a nucleating complex consisting of villin and actin, bind stoichiometric amounts of [3H]cytochalasin B with high affinity. The results of this study indicate that both villin and cytochalasin B bind to the same end of actin filaments, yet differ in their binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1677016206,"Inactivation of porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (L-malate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) by selective modification of an active center histidine residue with the reagent iodoacetamide has been further investigated to examine the existence of and the enzymatic activity of a hybrid (half)-modified dimer. The loss of enzymatic activity during iodo(1-14C) acetamide modification is linear with 14C incorporation. Enzyme was modified to various extents and the reaction was quenched. Microzonal electrophoresis was performed to separate native dimeric enzyme, hybrid-modified enzyme, and doubly modified enzyme. The distribution of each species was quantitated by scanning densitometry. The distribution generated throughout the time course of inactivation indicates that both subunits are modified independently and at the same rate. It is apparent that the hybrid-modified dimer contributes one-half of the enzymatic activity of a native dimer in the standard assay. Kinetic studies were performed and the results indicate that there is no apparent change in kinetic parameters between a subunit of the native dimer and the active subunit in the hybrid-modified dimer. Dissociation and reassociation of a mixture of native enzyme and doubly-iodoacetamide-modified enzyme indicates that there is no preferential association of a modified subunit with another modified subunit, or of a native subunit with another native subunit, but rather, association is random with respect to native and iodoacetamide-modified subunits."
