(p. 1694 , published online 5 November) analyzed microbial diversity among several distinct body habitats (including the gut, mouth, inside the ears and nose, and skin) of the same person at different times. They found that body habitat had more influence on microbial community composition than temporal differences and variation among people. Some skin locations, such as the index finger, back of the knee, and sole of the foot, on occasion harbored higher microbial diversity than the gut or oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2141570423,"Slowing Brain Disease with Gene Therapy X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the hereditary brain demyelinating disorder that was featured in the movie “ Lorenzo's Oil ,” is typically treated by transplantation of bone marrow from matched donors. This treatment slows progression of the disease by introducing cells that differentiate into myelin-producing cells. Cartier et al. (p. 818 ; see Perspective by Naldini ) tested an alternative gene therapy–based approach in two young patients without matched donors. A lentiviral vector was used to introduce a wild-type copy of the ALD gene into the patients' hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo. The modified cells were then infused back into the patients. Expression of the transferred gene was still detectable in the patients' blood cells 2 years later, and both patients showed neurological improvement and a delay in disease progression comparable to that seen with bone marrow transplants."
https://openalex.org/W1973950074,"Toward $1000 Genomes The ability to generate human genome sequence data that is complete, accurate, and inexpensive is a necessary prerequisite to perform genome-wide disease association studies. Drmanac et al. (p. 78 , published online 5 November) present a technique advancing toward this goal. The method uses Type IIS endonucleases to incorporate short oligonucleotides within a set of randomly sheared circularized DNA. DNA polymerase then generates concatenated copies of the circular oligonucleotides leading to formation of compact but very long oligonucleotides which are then sequenced by ligation. The relatively low cost of this technology, which shows a low error rate, advances sequencing closer to the goal of the $1000 genome."
https://openalex.org/W1976222527,"Nitrogen Overload The cycling of essential nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems has been altered by human activities. Elser et al. (p. 835 ) report a comparative analysis of lakes in Norway, Sweden, and in the United States that suggests that this is also true in aquatic ecosystems such as lakes. Deposition of anthropogenically derived atmospheric nitrogen controls whether N or P is growth-limiting for phytoplankton. Under elevated conditions of atmospheric N inputs, lake phytoplankton become consistently P-limited because the N:P ratio is strongly distorted. This is in contrast to conditions of low N deposition when lake phytoplankton are N-limited. These effects are even observed in remote lakes, demonstrating the indirect yet wide-ranging effects of humans on global food webs."
https://openalex.org/W2033270806,"The catalytic activity of metal clusters of different sizes adsorbed on oxide surfaces can be explored systematically by using model catalysts. We studied the temperature-programmed reaction of CO with O2 catalyzed by Pd clusters (Pd(n), for n = 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 16, 20, and 25) that were size-selected in the gas phase and deposited on rutile TiO2(110). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy revealed that the Pd 3d binding energy varied nonmonotonically with cluster size and that the changes correlated with strong size variations in CO oxidation activity. Taking final-state effects into account, low activity was correlated with higher-than-expected Pd 3d binding energy, which is attributed to a particularly stable valence electronic structure; electron transfer from the TiO2 support to the Pd clusters also occurs. Ion scattering shows that small clusters form single-layer islands on the surface and that formation of a second layer begins to occur for clusters larger than Pd10."

The genetic structure of an Antarctic lake viral community revealed unexpected genetic richness distributed across the highest number of viral families that have been found to date in aquatic viral metagenomes. In contrast to other known aquatic viromes, which are dominated by bacteriophage sequences, this Antarctic virus assemblage had a large proportion of sequences related to eukaryotic viruses, including phycodnaviruses and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses not previously identified in aquatic environments. We also observed that the transition from an ice-covered lake in spring to an open-water lake in summer led to a change from a ssDNA- to a double-stranded DNA-virus-dominated assemblage, possibly reflecting a seasonal shift in host organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2127192155,"Solving Pseudokinases Mutations of the protein kinase LKB1 are associated with cancer in humans. Many kinases are activated by phosphorylation, but LKB1 is activated by STRADα, a pseudokinase that is similar to protein kinases and binds ATP, but does not phosphorylate substrates. By solving the crystal structure of an activating complex containing LKB, Zeqiraj et al. (p. 1707 , published online 5 November) show that STRADα works with another protein, MO25α, to hold LKB1 in an active conformation. The results may help explain the evolutionary origin of pseudokinases, the biological roles of other pseudokinases, and the mechanisms of disease-causing mutations in LKB1."

https://openalex.org/W1978825085,"By human sensory analyses, we found that various extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonists enhance sweet, salty, and umami tastes, although they have no taste themselves. These characteristics are known as ""kokumi taste"" and often appear in traditional Japanese cuisine. Although GSH is a typical kokumi taste substance (taste enhancer), its mode of action is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate how the kokumi taste is enhanced by the CaSR, a close relative of the class C G-protein-coupled receptors T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 (sweet and umami receptors). We identified a large number of CaSR agonist gamma-glutamyl peptides, including GSH (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly) and gamma-Glu-Val-Gly, and showed that these peptides elicit the kokumi taste. Further analyses revealed that some known CaSR agonists such as Ca(2+), protamine, polylysine, L-histidine, and cinacalcet (a calcium-mimetic drug) also elicit the kokumi taste and that the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143, significantly suppresses the kokumi taste. This is the first report indicating a distinct function of the CaSR in human taste perception."
https://openalex.org/W2018846024,"Self-Renewing Macrophages The capacity for self-renewal is associated with progenitor cell populations and is lost upon differentiation. Aziz et al. (p. 867 ) discovered an exception to this rule when mouse monocytes and macrophages deficient in the transcription factors MafB and c-Maf were cultured in the presence of the growth factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Under these conditions, MafB/c-Maf–deficient cells were able to divide continuously while maintaining the phenotype and function of mature cells. Unexpectedly, when these in vitro–cultured cells were transferred into mice, they did not induce tumors, despite continuing to divide, but rather incorporated themselves into tissues and adopted normal macrophage functions. Suppression of two genes involved in the self-renewal capacity of inducible pluripotent stem cells, KLF4 and c-Myc, inhibited the ability of MafB/c-Maf–deficient macrophages to self-renew. Such long-term propagation of a differentiated cell population that does not result in transformation when reintroduced in vivo has exciting therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1980871955,"The Death of Cocco Emiliania huxleyi is a coccolithophore, a class of unicellular phytoplankton that forms vast blooms mediating the oceanic carbon cycle through shedding of its calcium carbonate scales. E. huxleyi is routinely infected and killed by lytic viruses that can abruptly halt a bloom. Vardi et al. (p. 861 ) have found that in E. huxleyi strains that are sensitive or resistant to infection, a sphingolipid-based “arms race” appears to regulate cell fate during host-virus interactions. The lipid also serves as a biomarker for active infection that may help to quantify the role and activity of viruses and virus-mediated processes in the oceans. This information will help in assessing the biogeochemical impact of these plankton species."

Ren et al. (p. 840 ; see the Perspective by Ollerton and Coulthard ) show that three families of scorpionflies had already evolved specialized mouth parts for feeding on the nectar of gymnosperms, as early as the Middle Jurassic (∼170 million years ago). The diversity and specialization of these insects and related plant structures suggests that they were also involved in pollination. These families died out later in the Cretaceous as angiosperms began to dominate."
https://openalex.org/W2095687796,"DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is initiated by DSB detection by Ku70/80 (Ku) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) recruitment, which promotes pathway progression through poorly defined mechanisms. Here, Ku and DNA-PKcs solution structures alone and in complex with DNA, defined by x-ray scattering, reveal major structural reorganizations that choreograph NHEJ initiation. The Ku80 C-terminal region forms a flexible arm that extends from the DNA-binding core to recruit and retain DNA-PKcs at DSBs. Furthermore, Ku- and DNA-promoted assembly of a DNA-PKcs dimer facilitates trans-autophosphorylation at the DSB. The resulting site-specific autophosphorylation induces a large conformational change that opens DNA-PKcs and promotes its release from DNA ends. These results show how protein and DNA interactions initiate large Ku and DNA-PKcs rearrangements to control DNA-PK biological functions as a macromolecular machine orchestrating assembly and disassembly of the initial NHEJ complex on DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2087077009,"Nitric oxide (NO) can induce acute pain in humans and plays an important role in pain sensitization caused by inflammation and injury in animal models. There is evidence that NO acts both in the central nervous system via a cyclic GMP pathway and in the periphery on sensory neurons through unknown mechanisms. It has recently been suggested that TRPV1 and TRPA1, two polymodal ion channels that sense noxious stimuli impinging on peripheral nociceptors, are activated by NO in heterologous systems. Here, we investigate the relevance of this activation. We demonstrate that NO donors directly activate TRPV1 and TRPA1 in isolated inside-out patch recordings. Cultured primary sensory neurons display both TRPV1- and TRPA1-dependent responses to NO donors. BH4, an essential co-factor for NO production, causes activation of a subset of DRG neurons as assayed by calcium imaging, and this activation is at least partly dependent on nitric oxide synthase activity. We show that BH4-induced calcium influx is ablated in DRG neurons from TRPA1/TRPV1 double knockout mice, suggesting that production of endogenous levels of NO can activate these ion channels. In behavioral assays, peripheral NO-induced nociception is compromised when TRPV1 and TRPA1 are both ablated. These results provide genetic evidence that the peripheral nociceptive action of NO is mediated by both TRPV1 and TRPA1."

We have generated AMPK β1−/− mice on a C57Bl/6 background that are viable, fertile, survived greater than 2 years, and display no visible brain developmental defects. These mice have a 90% reduction in hepatic AMPK activity due to loss of the catalytic α subunits, with modest reductions of activity detected in the hypothalamus and white adipose tissue and no change in skeletal muscle or heart. On a low fat or an obesity-inducing high fat diet, β1−/− mice had reduced food intake, reduced adiposity, and reduced total body mass. Metabolic rate, physical activity, adipose tissue lipolysis, and lipogenesis were similar to wild type littermates. The reduced appetite and body mass of β1−/− mice were associated with protection from high fat diet-induced hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance.

AMPK is activated in response to physiological processes that raise intracellular levels of AMP, such as exercise and hypoxia. It restores cellular energy balance by switching off ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and switching on ATP-generating catabolic pathways by direct phosphorylation of downstream targets. Modulation of AMPK activity by hormones adds an additional layer of control, allowing cellular energy supply and demand to be balanced with the energy requirements of the whole organism (2Steinberg G.R.

AMPK functions as an αβγ heterotrimer. Different isoforms for each of the subunits exist (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3) as well as some splice variants, allowing more than 12 heterotrimeric combinations to be generated that may mediate unique tissue-specific functions (3Mitchelhill K.I.

Hepatic AMPK is thought to play important roles in regulating lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity (1Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Here, activation of AMPK suppresses fatty acid synthesis and increases oxidation through direct phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, respectively (12Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J.

AMPK signaling also inhibits hepatic glucose output by transcriptional control. This is mediated by phosphorylation of CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2), (13Koo S.H. Flechner L.

Recently, three genetically modified animal models have provided important tools for dissecting the role AMPK plays in regulating hepatic glucose homeostasis. Liver-specific deletion of LKB1, one of three AMPK upstream kinases, leads to inhibition of AMPK signaling and up-regulation of gluconeogenic enzyme expression, resulting in elevated fasting blood glucose in mice (14Shaw R.J.

In a second model, transgenic overexpression of a constitutively active AMPKα2 allele in the liver was reported to cause hypoglycemia (14Shaw R.J. Lamia K.A. Vasquez D. Koo S.H. Bardeesy N.

Finally, AMPK α2 null mice display fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and increased hepatic glucose output due to elevated adrenergic signaling (17Viollet B. Andreelli F. J⊘rgensen S.B.

J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In summary, these studies support the view that hepatic AMPK lowers systemic glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic glucose output. Hypothalamic AMPK regulates appetite in response to circulating nutrients, such as glucose and fatty acids, as well as hormonal signals derived from the pancreas, adipose tissue, and gut (1Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). The activation of hypothalamic AMPK is associated with increased expression of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide and leads to increased appetite and food intake (1Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Inhibition of AMPK has the reciprocal effect. Recent studies suggest that many of the effects of AMPK on appetite may be mediated indirectly through modulation of hypothalamic ACC activity, resulting in altered malonyl-CoA and fatty acid levels (18Folmes C.D. Lopaschuk G.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 73: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, neither whole-body AMPKα1 nor AMPKα2 null mice have altered appetite or body mass (19Viollet B. Mounier R. Leclerc J. Yazigi A. Foretz M. Andreelli F. Diabetes Metab. 2007; 33: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, in mice lacking whole-body CAMKK2 or lacking both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 in agouti-related peptide containing neurons, there are modest reductions in appetite and body mass (20Claret M. Smith M.A. Batterham R.L. Selman C. Choudhury A.I. Fryer L.G. Clements M. Al-Qassab H. Heffron H. Xu A.W. Speakman J.R. Barsh G.S. Viollet B. Vaulont S. Ashford M.L. Carling D. Withers D.J. J. Clin.

The current study examined the effect of whole-body AMPK β1 deletion (β1−/−) on energy homeostasis and metabolism. AMPK β1−/− mice displayed tissue-specific defects in phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr-172 and AMPK activity, with the most dramatic effect observed in the liver and more modest effects in the hypothalamus and adipose tissue. Consistent with the known role of AMPK as a regulator of appetite, we found that AMPKβ1 null mice consumed significantly less food and were protected from developing high fat diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, AMPK β1 null mice also had markedly reduced fasting gluconeogenic enzyme expression and enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. In contrast, isolated hepatocytes from the β1 null mice had increased gluconeogenic enzyme expression, increased rates of fatty acid synthesis, and reduced rates of fatty acid oxidation. These data demonstrate that the deletion of AMPKβ1 results in reduced appetite and protection from diet-induced obesity and hepatic insulin resistance. We generated AMPK β1 subunit null mice on a pure C57Bl/6 background using standard homologous recombination techniques. We recently used hepatocytes from the β−/− mice to study the effects of thioenpyridine drugs on AMPK (22Scott J.W. van Denderen B.J. Jorgensen S.B. Honeyman J.E. Steinberg G.R. Oakhill J.S.

Our targeting strategy was designed to delete exons 2, 3, and 4 of the prkab1 gene. Because the β1 subunit binds the α and γ subunits via its C terminus (23Iseli T.J. Walter M. van Denderen B.J.

RNA from wild type and null mouse heart tissue was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified with primers designed to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the mouse β1 open reading frame. Amplification of β1 cDNA resulted in two products: the expected 440-bp species and an unexpected 320-bp product (supplemental Fig. 1). DNA sequencing revealed the longer product resulted from mRNA splicing of exon 1 to exon 5 with the expected frameshift, whereas the 320-bp product resulted from an alternative splicing event whereby exon 1 spliced in frame to exon 6. BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) searches performed using the predicted translated protein products from both of these AMPK β null transcripts revealed no matches in the data base. Because the unexpected splice variant occurred only in the null mouse sample, it is most likely the result of the gene targeting/deletion event and therefore not naturally occurring. To ascertain if either gene product was being translated, an antibody to the N-terminal residues 2–24 of AMPK β1 (within exon 1 residues 1–53) was used for immunoprecipitation studies. The N-terminal AMPK β1 antibody successfully immunoprecipitated native AMPK β1 from wild type mouse liver; however, no AMPK β1 protein products could be immunoprecipitated from AMPK β1−/− mouse liver (supplemental Fig. 2). Had the putative truncated AMPK β1 exon 1–6 splice variant been translated, it would not have contained the CBM, but it would have had the capacity to bind the AMPK γ but not α subunit. For all experiments, male homozygous β1−/− mice were compared with wild type littermate controls and were generated from heterozygous intercross matings. Mice were housed in SPF microisolators and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with lights on at 0700 h. Mice were fed a control low fat chow diet (diet 2014, Harlan Teklad) for 6 weeks following weaning and were then maintained on this diet or switched to a diet containing 45% kcal fat (diet SF-01-028, Specialty Feeds (Glen Forrest, Australia)). The St. Vincent's Health animal ethics committee approved all procedures. For food intake studies, mice were housed individually, and food was weighed daily over 7 days in mice 12–16 weeks of age. Metabolic rate and activity levels were measured using a Columbus Instruments laboratory animal-monitoring system over 48 h and following a 6-h acclimatization period. Glucose (1 g/kg d-glucose) and insulin (0.5 unit/kg) tolerance tests were performed 6 h after the removal of food as described previously (25Steinberg G.R. Watt M.J. Fam B.C. Proietto J. Andrikopoulos S. Allen A.M. Febbraio M.A. Kemp B.E. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3906-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed in conscious, 22–29-week-old mice as described previously (26Hevener A.L. He W. Barak Y. Le J. Bandyopadhyay G. Olson P. Wilkes J. Evans R.M. Olefsky J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 days prior to the clamp, two catheters were inserted into the right jugular vein. The clamp was conducted after a 6-h fast, which commenced at the start of the light cycle. At −60 min, tracer (d-[3-3H]glucose) was infused at a constant rate (7.5 μCi/h, 0.12 ml/h) for 1 h for determination of basal glucose turnover. At 0 min, an infusion of 10 milliunits/kg/min of insulin diluted in saline containing d-[3-3H]glucose (7.5 μCi/h, 0.12 ml/h) was begun. A 50% dextrose solution was infused at a variable rate to maintain euglycemia. Once steady state was achieved, glucose-specific activity was measured in whole blood after deproteinization with BaOH and ZnSO4. Hepatic glucose production and glucose disposal rate for the basal and clamp period were calculated using Steele's equation for steady state conditions. Clamp insulin was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia, Diagenics Ltd.). For serum cytokines and insulin measurements, fasting and fed blood samples (∼300 μl) were collected retroorbitally using a non-heparinized capillary tube, allowed to clot, and centrifuged (3000 rpm, 5 min). Serum was removed and stored at −80 °C until analysis as described previously (25Steinberg G.R. Watt M.J. Fam B.C. Proietto J. Andrikopoulos S. Allen A.M. Febbraio M.A. Kemp B.E.

The following day, experiments were performed. For measurement of the mRNA expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, hepatocytes were incubated with either vehicle or insulin (at the concentrations indicated) for 4 h before lysis in TRIzol. For lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation experiments, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free Medium 199 (Invitrogen) for 2 h. Lipogenesis was assessed by incubating cells with serum-free Medium 199 containing [1-14C]acetate (0.5 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.5 mm unlabeled sodium acetate. After 4 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested by scraping in methanol with lipids extracted and quantitated as described previously (27Watt M.J. Dzamko N. Thomas W.G.

For fatty acid oxidation, serum-free Medium 199 containing [1-14C]palmitic acid (0.5 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.5 mm unlabeled palmitate was used with fatty acid oxidation determined by measuring labeled CO2 and acid-soluble metabolites as described previously (29Chen M.B.

Epididymal adipose tissue explants were incubated in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (pH 7.4, supplemented with 8 mm glucose and 4% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Lipolysis was measured in the presence or absence of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 μm) (Sigma). At the conclusion of the 2-h incubation, the incubation medium was removed and assayed for glycerol using a free glycerol determination kit (Sigma). For the measurement of lipogenesis, the Kreb's buffer was supplemented with 1 mCi/ml d-[3-3H]glucose (Amersham) in the presence or absence of insulin (1 nm). After 2 h, adipose tissue explants were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, weighed, and then homogenized in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The lipid phase was extracted from the homogenate using a 2:1 chloroform/methanol extraction and resolved using thin layer chromatography as described previously (29Chen M.B. McAinch A.J.

For AMPK β1 and β2 immunoblots, a rabbit monoclonal antibody to the conserved C-terminal sequence in AMPK β (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) was used. Akt Ser(P)-473 and total Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). RNA was prepared and reverse transcribed, and relative gene expression was calculated using the comparative Ct (2−ΔΔCt) method as described (27Watt M.J. Dzamko N. Thomas W.G. Rose-John S. Ernst M.

Gluconeogenic genes and the housekeeping gene 18 S were determined using assay-on-demand gene expression kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Tissue lipids and glycogen levels were determined as described previously (27Watt M.J. Dzamko N. Thomas W.G. Rose-John S. Ernst M. Carling D. Kemp B.E. Febbraio M.A. Steinberg G.R. Nat.

Results were analyzed using Student's t test or analysis of variance procedures where appropriate using GraphPad Prism software. Tukey's post hoc test was used to test for significant differences revealed by the analysis of variance. Data were transformed logarithmically when necessary to obtain similar variances among groups. Significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05. Correlations were performed using GraphPad Prism software. AMPK β1−/− mice had no detectable β1 protein expression (Fig. 1A). β1−/− mice displayed no overt behavioral or externally visible phenotype and were fertile, and heterozygous intercrosses generated WT, β1−/−, and heterozygous progeny at the expected Mendelian frequency (1:1:2). In contrast to previous reports, β1−/− mice survived for in excess of 2 years. Deletion of β1 did not result in defects in the CNS (supplemental Fig. 3). The effect of β1 deletion on AMPK subunit protein levels was examined in liver, heart, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle (mixed vastus), and hypothalamus (predominantly arcuate-containing neurons). β1 deletion resulted in a significant loss of both α1 and α2 catalytic subunits in the liver (Fig. 1A). α1 protein was also modestly reduced in white adipose tissue and hypothalamus (p < 0.05), whereas α1 and α2 protein levels were unaltered in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). In contrast, protein levels of the γ1 subunit were unaltered between wild type (WT) and β1−/− mice in all tissues examined (Fig. 1A). We examined AMPK activity, AMPK α Thr-172 phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream target ACC. In the liver of β1−/− mice, the activities of both α1 and α2 and the phosphorylation of AMPK Thr-172 and ACC Ser-79/Ser-221 were substantially reduced (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). In adipose tissue, α1 activity tended to be reduced (−28%, p = 0.22), but the reduction in ACC phosphorylation was more dramatic (−30%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Hypothalamic AMPK activity was reduced in both fed (p = 0.034) (Fig. 1B) and fasting chow-fed β1−/− mice (data not shown) and was associated with significantly reduced ACC Ser-79 phosphorylation (−44%) (Fig. 1B). These findings demonstrate that deletion of AMPK β1 results in prominent changes in AMPK α subunit expression in the liver and more modest effects in the hypothalamus and white adipose tissue, resulting in reduced AMPK activity in these tissues. These tissue-specific effects on AMPK α expression and activity coincide with the more prominent expression of the AMPK β1 isoform (relative to AMPK β2) in these tissues (11Thornton C. Snowden M.A. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12443-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AMPK is an important regulator of whole body energy metabolism; therefore, we fed β1−/− mice a control chow or high fat diet (HFD) over 25 weeks. On both chow and HFD, β1−/− mice weighed less than their wild type littermates (Fig. 2A) and had reduced epidydymal adipose tissue mass (Fig. 2B). Reduced body and fat mass were also observed in β1−/− female mice (data not shown). Reduced adipose tissue mass in β1−/− mice was not due to reduced adipose tissue lipogenesis, which was increased in adipocytes from β1−/− mice (supplemental Fig. 4A) or elevated adipose tissue lipolysis (supplemental Fig. 4B). Markers of adipose tissue differentiation (PPARγ and AP2) were not different between WT and β1−/− mice fed either chow or a HFD (data not shown). A significant correlation between body weight and adiposity was observed for all mice, irrespective of diet (R2 = 0. 74, p < 0.0001). Consistent with the reduced adiposity of β1−/− mice, serum concentrations of the adipokines leptin, resistin, and IL-6 were lower in β1−/− mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Serum measurements in chow- and HFD-fed wild type and AMPK β1−/− miceChowHFDWTβ1 KOWTβ1 KOGlucose (mm)3.9 ± 0.74.2 ± 0.36.22 ± 0.18ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.6.05 ± 0.12ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.Non-esterified fatty acid (mm)1.48 ± 0.191.58 ± 0.181.25 ± 0.161.65 ± 0.11Triglyceride (mm)1.21 ± 0.30.94 ± 0.21.91 ± 0.22.23 ± 0.2Glycerol (mm)0.44 ± 0.070.41 ± 0.04NDbND, not determined.NDLeptin (pg/ml)1107 ± 2881182 ± 2678520 ± 2144ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.2714 ± 338ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.,cp < 0.05 compared with wild type for same dietary condition.Tumor necrosis factor α (pg/ml)1.85 ± 0.321.69 ± 0.284.97 ± 0.68ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.4.45 ± 0.27ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.IL-6 (pg/ml)16.4 ± 4.12.7 ± 1.1cp < 0.05 compared with wild type for same dietary condition.15.85 ± 4.54.55 ± 2.01cp < 0.05 compared with wild type for same dietary condition.Resistin (pg/ml)1312 ± 571167 ± 83cp < 0.05 compared with wild type for same dietary condition.3807 ± 514ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.2414 ± 374ap < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.,cp < 0.05 compared with wild type for same dietary condition.PAI-1 (pg/ml)2128 ± 4181576 ± 1912660 ± 4572102 ± 253Adiponectin (μg/ml)15.84 ± 1.5113.77 ± 0.9216.52 ± 1.3613.91 ± 2.47a p < 0.05 compared with chow for same dietary condition.b ND, not determined.c p < 0.05 compared with wild type for same dietary condition.

https://openalex.org/W2034891521,"Virtually all of the 560 human proteases are stored as inactive proenyzmes and are strictly regulated. We report the identification and characterization of the first small molecules that directly activate proenzymes, the apoptotic procaspases-3 and -6. It is surprising that these compounds induce autoproteolytic activation by stabilizing a conformation that is both more active and more susceptible to intermolecular proteolysis. These procaspase activators bypass the normal upstream proapoptotic signaling cascades and induce rapid apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. Systematic biochemical and biophysical analyses identified a cluster of mutations in procaspase-3 that resist small-molecule activation both in vitro and in cells. Compounds that induce gain of function are rare, and the activators reported here will enable direct control of the executioner caspases in apoptosis and in cellular differentiation. More generally, these studies presage the discovery of other proenzyme activators to explore fundamental processes of proenzyme activation and their fate-determining roles in biology."
https://openalex.org/W1976968230,"Background Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPE) with a cell size less than 3 µm play a critical role in oceanic primary production. In recent years, the composition of marine picoeukaryote communities has been intensively investigated by molecular approaches, but their photosynthetic fraction remains poorly characterized. This is largely because the classical approach that relies on constructing 18S rRNA gene clone libraries from filtered seawater samples using universal eukaryotic primers is heavily biased toward heterotrophs, especially alveolates and stramenopiles, despite the fact that autotrophic cells in general outnumber heterotrophic ones in the euphotic zone. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to better assess the composition of the eukaryotic picophytoplankton in the South East Pacific Ocean, encompassing the most oligotrophic oceanic regions on earth, we used a novel approach based on flow cytometry sorting followed by construction of 18S rRNA gene clone libraries. This strategy dramatically increased the recovery of sequences from putative autotrophic groups. The composition of the PPE community appeared highly variable both vertically down the water column and horizontally across the South East Pacific Ocean. In the central gyre, uncultivated lineages dominated: a recently discovered clade of Prasinophyceae (IX), clades of marine Chrysophyceae and Haptophyta, the latter division containing a potentially new class besides Prymnesiophyceae and Pavlophyceae. In contrast, on the edge of the gyre and in the coastal Chilean upwelling, groups with cultivated representatives (Prasinophyceae clade VII and Mamiellales) dominated. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate that a very large fraction of the eukaryotic picophytoplankton still escapes cultivation. The use of flow cytometry sorting should prove very useful to better characterize specific plankton populations by molecular approaches such as gene cloning or metagenomics, and also to obtain into culture strains representative of these novel groups."
https://openalex.org/W2049228433,"Ecological speciation occurs when ecologically based, divergent selection causes the evolution of reproductive isolation. There are many empirical examples of this process; however, there exists a poorly characterized stage during which the traits that distinguish species ecologically and reproductively segregate in a single population. By using a combination of genetic mapping, mate-choice experiments, field observations, and population genetics, we studied a butterfly population with a mimetic wing color polymorphism and found that the butterflies exhibited partial, color-based, assortative mate preference. These traits represent the divergent, ecologically based signal and preference components of sexual isolation that usually distinguish incipient and sibling species. The association between behavior and recognition trait in a single population may enhance the probability of speciation and provides an example of the missing link between an interbreeding population and isolated species."
https://openalex.org/W1994055885,"Desert Balancing Act Ecosystem nutrient budgets are often difficult to estimate given the variety of processes and organisms that influence their flux. In deserts, for example, the loss of nitrogen—a limiting nutrient for growth—is often thought to be mediated by the generation of trace gases from biological activity. McCalley and Sparks (p. 837 ) present results from the Mojave Desert that suggest most nitrogen is instead driven off by the Sun at high temperatures that inhibit microbial activity. This requires a reevaluation of the desert nitrogen budget both now and in the future when climate change may drive increased abiotic emissions in arid ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2040753525,"Background Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a recently re-emerged arthropod borne virus responsible for a massive outbreak in the Indian Ocean and India, and extended to Southeast Asia as well as Italy. CHIKV has adapted to Aedes albopictus, an anthropophilic mosquito species widely distributed in Asia, Europe, Africa and America. Our objective was to determine the clinical and biological features of patients at the acute phase of CHIKV infection. Methods and Findings A prospective study enrolled 274 consecutive patients with febrile arthralgia recorded at the Emergency Department of the Groupe Hospitalier Sud-Réunion between March and May 2006. Three groups were defined: one group of 180 viremic patients (positive CHIKV RT-PCR), one group of 34 patients with acute post-viremic infection (negative CHIKV RT-PCR, positive anti-CHIKV IgM and negative IgG), and one group of 46 uninfected patients (negative CHIKV RT-PCR, anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG). Bivariate analyses of clinical and biological features between groups were performed. Patients with CHIKV viremia presented typically with asymmetrical bilateral polyarthralgia (96.5%) affecting the lower (98%) and small joints (74.8%), as well as asthenia (88.6%), headache (70%), digestive trouble (63.3%), myalgia (59%), exanthems (47.8%), conjunctival hyperhemia (23%) and adenopathy (8.9%). Vertigo, cutaneous dysesthesia, pharyngitis and haemorrhages were seldom observed. So far unreported symptoms such as chondrocostal arthralgia (20%), entesopathies (1.6%), talalgia (14%) were also noted. Prurit was less frequent during the viremic than post-viremic phase (13.9% vs. 41.2%; p<0.001), whereas lymphopenia was more frequent (87.6% vs. 39.4%; p<0.001). Others biological abnormalities included leukopenia (38.3%), thrombocytopenia (37.3%), increased ASAT and ALAT blood levels (31.6 and 7.3%, respectively) and hypocalcemia (38.7%). Lymphopenia <1,000/mm3 was very closely associated with viremic patients (Yule coefficient 0.82, positive predictive value 92.3%). Age under 65 was associated with a benign course, as no patients younger than 65 had to be hospitalized (Yule coefficient 0.78). Conclusions The diagnosis of CHIKV infection in acute phase is based on commonly accepted clinical criteria (fever and arthralgia), however clinical and biological diffrences exist in acute phase depending on whether or not the patient is within the viremic phase of the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2018836338,"Analyses of supernovae (SNe) have revealed two main types of progenitors: exploding white dwarfs and collapsing massive stars. We present SN2002bj, which stands out as different from any SN reported to date. Its light curve rises and declines very rapidly, yet reaches a peak intrinsic brightness greater than -18 mag. A spectrum obtained 7 days after discovery shows the presence of helium and intermediate-mass elements, yet no clear hydrogen or iron-peak elements. The spectrum only barely resembles that of a Type Ia supernova, with added carbon and helium. Its properties suggest that SN2002bj may be representative of a class of progenitors that previously has been only hypothesized: a helium detonation on a white dwarf, ejecting a small envelope of material. New surveys should find many such objects, despite their scarcity."
https://openalex.org/W2052874119,"Background Liposomal-based gadolinium (Gd) nanoparticles have elicited significant interest for use as blood pool and molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Previous generations of liposomal MR agents contained gadolinium-chelates either within the interior of liposomes (core-encapsulated gadolinium liposomes) or presented on the surface of liposomes (surface-conjugated gadolinium liposomes). We hypothesized that a liposomal agent that contained both core-encapsulated gadolinium and surface-conjugated gadolinium, defined herein as dual-mode gadolinium (Dual-Gd) liposomes, would result in a significant improvement in nanoparticle-based T1 relaxivity over the previous generations of liposomal agents. In this study, we have developed and tested, both in vitro and in vivo, such a dual-mode liposomal-based gadolinium contrast agent. Methodology/Principal Findings Three types of liposomal agents were fabricated: core-encapsulated, surface-conjugated and dual-mode gadolinium liposomes. In vitro physico-chemical characterizations of the agents were performed to determine particle size and elemental composition. Gadolinium-based and nanoparticle-based T1 relaxivities of various agents were determined in bovine plasma. Subsequently, the agents were tested in vivo for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) studies. Characterization of the agents demonstrated the highest gadolinium atoms per nanoparticle for Dual-Gd liposomes. In vitro, surface-conjugated gadolinium liposomes demonstrated the highest T1 relaxivity on a gadolinium-basis. However, Dual-Gd liposomes demonstrated the highest T1 relaxivity on a nanoparticle-basis. In vivo, Dual-Gd liposomes resulted in the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio in CE-MRA studies. Conclusions/Significance The dual-mode gadolinium liposomal contrast agent demonstrated higher particle-based T1 relaxivity, both in vitro and in vivo, compared to either the core-encapsulated or the surface-conjugated liposomal agent. The dual-mode gadolinium liposomes could enable reduced particle dose for use in CE-MRA and increased contrast sensitivity for use in molecular imaging."
https://openalex.org/W1967025862,"The transmembrane glycoprotein CD98 regulates multiple cellular functions, including extracellular signaling, epithelial cell adhesion/polarity, amino acid transport, and cell-cell interactions. MicroRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, thereby functioning as modulators of numerous cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we investigated if microRNAs regulate CD98 expression during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and inflammation. We found that microRNA-7 repressed CD98 expression in Caco2-BBE cells by directly targeting the 3′-untranslated region of human CD98 mRNA. Expression of CD98 was decreased, whereas that of microRNA-7 was increased in well-differentiated Caco2-BBE cells compared with undifferentiated cells. Undifferentiated crypt cells isolated from mouse jejunum showed higher CD98 levels and lower levels of mmu-microRNA-706, a murine original microRNA candidate for CD98, than well-differentiated villus cells. Importantly, microRNA-7 decreased Caco2-BBE cell attachment on laminin-1, and CD98 overexpression recovered this inhibition, suggesting that microRNA-7 modulates epithelial cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, which in turn could affect proliferation and differentiation during the migration of enterocytes across the crypt-villus axis, by regulating CD98 expression. In a pathological context, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-β increased CD98 expression in Caco2-BBE cells by decreasing microRNA-7 levels. Consistent with the in vitro findings, microRNA-7 levels were decreased in actively inflamed Crohn disease colonic tissues, where CD98 expression was up-regulated, compared with normal tissues. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism underlying regulation of CD98 expression during patho-physiological states.

It has been shown that CD98 associates with β1 and β3 integrins and thereby regulates integrin signaling, such as cell proliferation/transformation, spreading, migration, and epithelial cell adhesion/polarity (1Yan Y.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This renewal process reflects continuous cell division of a stem cell population located in the intestinal crypt, migration of daughter cells along the villus, and extrusion of senescent cells into the intestinal lumen (22Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). During the migration of cells along the crypt-villus axis, extracellular matrix proteins interact continuously with enterocytes. These interactions are important in modulating several key biological activities, including cell adhesion and migration, gene expression, and cell survival (22Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As enterocytes migrate toward the villus tip, they develop specialized functions (differentiation). A succession of gene expression-promoting and expression-repressing events occurs during cell migration along the crypt-villus axis; these events involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) of ∼18–24 nucleotides negatively regulate target mRNAs by binding to their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) 2The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineTERtrans-epithelial resistanceECISelectric cell-substrate impedance sensingILinterleukinIECintestinal epithelial cell.

Although miRNAs are known to play a number of regulatory roles, little is known about their roles in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) differentiation. In the present study, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of CD98 expression during IEC differentiation and under inflammatory conditions, and assessed its potential involvement in epithelial-extracellular matrix interactions. Caco2-BBE and J774.A1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI media, respectively, supplemented with 14 mm NaHCO3, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1.5 μg/ml plasmocin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Cells were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 90% humidity. Colonic biopsies from patients undergoing endoscopy (normal samples) or surgical specimens from patients undergoing colon resection for Crohn disease (CD) at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Hsa-miR-7 (Pre-miR Precursor AM17100, Product ID: PM10047), anti-hsa-miR-7 (anti-miR inhibitor AM17000, Product ID: 10047), pre-miR negative control 1 (AM17110), anti-miRTM negative control 1 (AM17010), and mmu-miR-706 (Pre-miR miRNA Precursor AM17100, Product ID: PM11439) were obtained from Ambion. Caco2-BBE cells cultured on 24-well plastic plates, coverslips, or filter supports were transfected with 40 nm miRNA precursors or 40 nm miRNA antisenses using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The CD98-pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO was constructed as we previously described (17Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T. Lewis B. Madara J.L. J. Biol.

PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Caco2-BBE cells were transfected with the CD98-pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO construct (Caco2-BBE/CD98) or the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Caco2-BBE/Vector) using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and stably selected in culture medium supplemented with 1.2 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). For cell attachment assay, wild-type Caco2-BBE, Caco2-BBE/CD98, and Caco2-BBE/vector cells were trypsinized, counted, and transfected with 40 nm miRNA precursors or vehicle (control) using the siPORT NeoFX Transfection Agent (Ambion). The human (h) CD98 mRNA 3′-UTR was cloned into the SpeI/HindIII sites of the pMIR-REPORTTM Luciferase vector (Ambion) or the XhoI/HindIII sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). For luciferase assay, Caco2-BBE cells on 24-well plastic plates were transfected with 1 μg of the hCD98 3′-UTR-luciferase construct in the presence or absence of 40 nm the indicated miRNA precursors using Lipofectamine 2000. Firefly luciferase activity was measured at 24- and 48-h post-transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) and a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). Values were normalized to lysate protein concentration. For GFP repression experiment, Caco2-BBE cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with 1 μg of the hCD98 3′-UTR-GFP construct in the presence or absence of 40 nm miRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h of transfection, GFP expression was assessed by Western blot analysis and fluorescent microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope. Isolation of epithelial cells from the intestinal crypt-villus axe was performed as previously described (26Flint N. Cove F.L. Evans G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 280 (Pt 2): 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using 6–8-week-old FVB wild-type male mice. Briefly, small intestine was reverted and cut into pieces of 1–2 cm. Pieces were washed under constant stirring in HBSS− + 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 4 °C (Step 1). Epithelial cells from villi were collected after an incubation of pieces at 4 °C with constant stirring for 20 min in 150 ml of chelating buffer (27 mm trisodium citrate, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 96 mm NaCl, 8 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 55 mm d-sorbitol, 44 mm sucrose, pH 7.3) (Step 2). Pieces were then transferred to 20 ml of fresh chelating buffer in a 50 ml tube. Tube was manually inversed 20 times, buffer was through and 20 ml of fresh buffer was added. Manual wash was repeated 10 times (Step 3). Tissues were transferred to 100 ml of fresh chelating buffer and incubated at 4 °C with constant stirring for 10 min (Step 4). Steps 3 and 4 were repeated, and buffer containing epithelial cells from crypts was collected. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min on ice. The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Total cell lysates were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then probed with relevant primary antibodies: goat polyclonal anti-mouse CD98 (sc-7094; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-human CD98 (sc-7095; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-human integrin-β1 (MAB1981, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and monoclonal anti-GAPDH (AM4300, Ambion). After washes, membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and blots were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using an iCycler sequence detection system (Bio-Rad). Briefly, cDNA was amplified by 40 cycles of 95 °C-15 s and 60 °C-1 min using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and specific primers: hCD98 sense 5′-CAGGTTCGGGACATAGAGA-3′, hCD98 antisense 5′- GAGTTAGTCCCCGCAATCAA-3′; mCD98 sense 5′-GAGGACAGGCTTTTGATTGC-3′, mCD98 antisense 5′-ATTCAGTACGCTCCCCAGTG-3′; 18S sense 5′-CCCCTCGATGACTTTAGCTGAGTGT-3′, 18S antisense 5′-CGCCGGTCCAAGAATTTCACCTCT-3′; mouse 36B4 sense 5′-TCCAGGCTTTGGGCATCA-3′, mouse 36B4 antisense 5′-CTTTATCAGCTGCACATCACTCAGA-3′. 18S and 36B4 were used as housekeeping genes, and fold-induction was calculated using the Ct method as follows: ΔΔCt = (CtTarget − Cthousekeeping) treatment − (CtTarget − Cthousekeeping) nontreatment, and the final data were derived from 2−ΔΔCT. Total RNAs isolated from Caco2-BBE cells or mouse intestinal crypts and villi were polyadenylated and reverse transcribed using the NCodeTM miRNA first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Levels of mature miRNAs were quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described above using the universal reverse primer provided in the kit and the following forward primers: hsa-miR-7: 5′-ACTTCACCTGGTCCACTAGCCGT-3′; mmu-miR-706: 5′-AGAGAAACCCTGTCTCAAAAAA-3′. 18S and 36B4 were used as housekeeping genes. Caco2-BBE cells grown on 12-filter polycarbonate Transwell Inserts (Corning) were transfected with 40 nm miR-7 precursor or vehicle (Lipofectamine 2000). Filters were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Ca/Mg), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS-Ca/Mg for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS-Ca/Mg, cells were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Ca/Mg for 30 min at 37 °C, and then with mixture of goat anti-human CD98 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS-Ca/Mg and stained for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). After washing, filters were mounted by using the Slowfade medium (Molecular Probes). Images were taken using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal unit, computer, and laser scanning microscope image analysis software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Resistance of Caco2-BBE cells was monitored by using the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) 1600R device (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY). Cells were seeded in ECIS 8W1E electrodes (2 × 104 cells/400 μl/electrode), and resistance was measured in real-time at a frequency of 500 Hz and a voltage of 1 V (25Nguyen H.T. Dalmasso G. Yan Y.

Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G346-G353Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For cell attachment study, Caco2-BBE cells were seeded in electrodes precoated with 10 μg/ml of laminin-1 (Sigma) and kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity as previously described (25Nguyen H.T. Dalmasso G. Yan Y. Obertone T.S. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Driss A. Charrier L. Yan Y. Nduati V. Sitaraman S. Merlin D. Am. J.

Cell Res. 2000; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Attachment and spreading of cells on the electrode surface change the impedance in such a way that morphological information of the attached cells can be inferred. Capacitance of Caco2-BBE cells was measured at a frequency of 40 kHz and a voltage of 1 V. Details on the operation, equivalent resistance-capacitance circuit, and modification of the ECIS system can be found in the manufacturer's instructions. The time necessary for Caco2-BBE cells to spread out on half of the available electrode (t½) and the spreading rate of cells (s) were calculated for each electrode as previously described (29Wegener J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The capacitance shift (s = −ΔC/Δt) was determined between C = 1.5 nF and C = 3.5 nF by means of linear regression. We chose this capacitance range for analysis as it more or less symmetrically embraced the capacitance values at t½. Values were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test by InStat v3.06 (GraphPad) software. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Although CD98 has been shown to be located in the basolateral membrane of well-differentiated IEC (1Yan Y. Vasudevan S. Nguyen H.T. Merlin D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), its expression during IEC differentiation is not yet investigated. We first assessed the expression of human CD98 (hCD98) in intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells at different time points post-plating. Caco2-BBE cell differentiation during the conventional culture period was evaluated by measuring the trans-epithelial resistance (TER) of the cells in real-time using the ECIS technique. Fig. 1A shows that Caco2-BBE cells grown as a monolayer became increasingly differentiated over time, reaching a plateau after ∼8 days of culture. Importantly, hCD98 expression at both mRNA and protein levels was decreased with increasing levels of cell differentiation: hCD98 expression levels were higher in undifferentiated Caco2-BBE cells (day 2 post-seeding) than in well-differentiated cells (day 8 post-seeding) (Fig. 1, B and C). To confirm the in vitro observations, we examined the expression of CD98 toward the crypt-villus axis of mouse intestine. Villi and crypts were isolated from jejunum of 6–8-week-old FVB male mice. Fig. 1D shows that the isolated villi and crypts were pure and intact (upper panel). Total RNAs from villi and crypts were extracted and their integrity was shown (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed higher levels of mouse (m) CD98 expression in undifferentiated crypt cells compared with well-differentiated villus cells (Fig. 1, E and F). Together, these data demonstrate that CD98 expression is decreased with increasing levels of IEC differentiation. Evidence has shown a role for miRNAs in cell differentiation (23Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29609) Google Scholar, 24Ambros V. Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar), we therefore hypothesized that miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of CD98 expression during IEC differentiation. To test this possibility, we first used the miRBase web site to screen the 3′-UTR sequence of hCD98 or mCD98 mRNA against the public data base for possible complementation of miRNAs. The human original hsa-miR-7 and murine original mmu-miR-706 were identified as potential miRNAs for the hCD98 and mCD98 gene, respectively (Fig. 2, A and C). Using the N-Code miRNA first-strand cDNA synthesis kit, which permits first-strand cDNA synthesis from the tailed miRNAs, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis, the levels of mature forms of miR-7 in Caco2-BBE cells and of miR-706 in mouse intestinal crypt-villus axis were quantified. We found that the levels of mature miR-7 were inversely correlated with hCD98 expression levels during Caco2-BBE cell differentiation: hsa-miR-7 levels were higher in well-differentiated cells than in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, expression levels of hsa-miR-626, used as a control miRNA, in undifferentiated and well-differentiated Caco2-BBE cells were not significantly different (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, the levels of mature mmu-miR-706 were significantly decreased in the crypt cells, where mCD98 was expressed at a high level, compared with that observed in villus cells, where mCD98 was expressed at a low level (Fig. 2D). Together, the inverse correlation between miRNA and CD98 expression levels in IECs suggests a role for miRNAs in the regulation of CD98 expression during IEC differentiation. To directly examine the regulation of hCD98 by miR-7, Caco2-BBE cells were transiently transfected with vehicle (Lipofectamine 2000, control), miR-7 precursor (miR-7), or a negative control miRNA precursor (miR-control) containing a non-targeting sequence for the indicated time, and hCD98 expression levels were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. We found that miR-7 significantly reduced hCD98 mRNA levels in Caco2-BBE cells at 24 and 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 3A). hCD98 expression at the protein level was also decreased upon transfection of cells with miR-7 with a maximal reduction level after 48 h of transfection (Fig. 3B). In contrast, transfection of cells with miR-control or vehicle did not affect hCD98 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed a reduction of immunofluorescence staining for hCD98 in Caco2-BBE cells transfected with miR-7 compared with control cells (Fig. 3C), supporting the inhibition effect of miR-7 on hCD98 protein expression analyzed by Western blot. To examine if mmu-miR-706 inhibits mCD98 expression, we transfected mmu-miR-706 precursor (miR-706) into the murine macrophage cell line J774.A1. As shown in Fig. 3, D and E, miR-706 significantly down-regulated expression of mCD98 at both mRNA and protein levels after 1 and 2 days of transfection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miRNAs down-regulate CD98 mRNA and protein expression in IECs. To examine if miR-7 directly targets the 3′-UTR of hCD98 mRNA, we cloned the hCD98 3′-UTR into the pMIR-REPORTTM Luciferase vector (hCD98 3′-UTR-luc) and measured luciferase activity in Caco2-BBE cells transiently transfected with this construct in the presence or absence of miR-7. As shown in Fig. 4A, miR-7 significantly repressed luciferase activity by up to ∼59 and 60% at 1 and 2 days post-transfection, respectively, indicating that miR-7 bound to the hCD98 3′-UTR. In contrast, miR-control had no effect on luciferase activity in cells transfected with the hCD98 3′-UTR-luc (Fig. 4A). To confirm these results, the hCD98 3′-UTR was cloned downstream the GFP-coding sequence, and the effect of miR-7 on GFP expression in cells transfected with this construct was examined. We found consistently that miR-7 decreased the expression of the GFP as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, fluorescent microscopy showed a reduction of fluorescent intensity in Caco2-BBE cells transfected with miR-7 compared with control cells or cells transfected with the miR-control (Fig. 4C). Together, these data demonstrate that miR-7 down-regulates hCD98 expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of hCD98 mRNA. To confirm the miR-7-mediated inhibition of hCD98 expression, the hCD98 3′-UTR-luc construct and an antisense of miR-7 or miR-control were co-transfected into Caco2-BBE cells. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-7 antisense increased luciferase activity in Caco2-BBE cells, whereas miR-control antisense had no significant effect (Fig. 5A). This result demonstrates that miR-7 antisense effectively bound to endogenous miR-7, thereby reducing the interaction of miR-7 with the hCD98 3′-UTR-luc inside the cells. Co-transfection of cells with the hCD98 3′-UTR-luc construct and miR-7, which was performed in parallel, decreased luciferase activity, indicating the specificity of miRNA antisense effects. The effect of miR-7 antisense on hCD98 expression in Caco2-BBE cells was further assessed by Western blot analysis. Consistent with the luciferase assay results, transfection of cells with miR-7 antisense, but not miR-control antisense, resulted in an increase in hCD98 expression (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these results strongly support the finding that miR-7 post-transcriptionally represses hCD98 expression in Caco2-BBE cells. As CD98 has been shown to interact with and thereby function as a regulator of β1-integrin (1Yan Y. Vasudevan S. Nguyen H.T. Merlin D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we next investigated if miR-7 affects β1-integrin activity by regulating hCD98 expression. As shown in Fig. 6A, transfection of Caco2-BBE cells with either miR-7 or miR-control did not affect β1-integrin expression. By using the ECIS technique, we then examined the effect of miR-7 on the attachment and spreading of Caco2-BBE cells to laminin-1, which was previously demonstrated to be completely dependent on β1-integrin (28Driss A. Charrier L. Yan Y. Nduati V. Sitaraman S. Merlin D. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G1228-G1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Capacitance of Caco2-BBE cells was monitored quantitatively and in real-time on ECIS electrodes coated with 10 μg/ml of laminin-1. The time necessary for cells to spread out on half of the available electrode (t½) and the spreading rate of cells (s) were accordingly determined. Fig. 6, B and C show that Caco2-BBE cells transfected with miR-7 attached and spread on laminin-1 more slowly compared with control Caco2-BBE cells ([control: black solid line, t½ = 2.93 ± 0.46 h, s = 0.29 ± 0.04 nF/h, n = 4] versus [+miR-7: gray solid line, t½ = 7.3 ± 0.88 h, s = 0.21 ± 0.01 nF/h, n = 4]). These results demonstrate that miR-7 decreases β1-integrin activation but not β1-integrin expression, leading to a reduction in Caco2-BBE cell attachment to laminin-1. To examine if hCD98 was involved in the miR-7-mediated decrease of β1-integrin activa"
https://openalex.org/W1969206393,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates extracellular levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain by facilitating uptake of released 5-hydroxytryptamine into neuronal cells. SERT is the target for widely used antidepressant drugs, including imipramine, fluoxetine, and (S)-citalopram, which are competitive inhibitors of the transport function. Knowledge of the molecular details of the antidepressant binding sites in SERT has been limited due to lack of structural data on SERT. Here, we present a characterization of the (S)-citalopram binding pocket in human SERT (hSERT) using mutational and computational approaches. Comparative modeling and ligand docking reveal that (S)-citalopram fits into the hSERT substrate binding pocket, where (S)-citalopram can adopt a number of different binding orientations. We find, however, that only one of these binding modes is functionally relevant from studying the effects of 64 point mutations around the putative substrate binding site. The mutational mapping also identify novel hSERT residues that are crucial for (S)-citalopram binding. The model defines the molecular determinants for (S)-citalopram binding to hSERT and demonstrates that the antidepressant binding site overlaps with the substrate binding site."

Here, we demonstrate the previously proposed half-of-the-sites reactivity and intermonomeric electron transfer by characterizing the kinetics of ubiquinol oxidation in the dimeric bc1 complex from Paracoccus denitrificans that contains an inactivating Y147S mutation in one or both cytochrome b subunits. The enzyme with a Y147S mutation in one cytochrome b subunit was catalytically fully active, whereas the activity of the enzyme with a Y147S mutation in both cytochrome b subunits was only 10–16% of that of the enzyme with fully wild-type or heterodimeric cytochrome b subunits. Enzyme with one inactive cytochrome b subunit was also indistinguishable from the dimer with two wild-type cytochrome b subunits in rate and extent of reduction of cytochromes b and c1 by ubiquinol under pre-steady-state conditions in the presence of antimycin. However, the enzyme with only one mutated cytochrome b subunit did not show the stimulation in the steady-state rate that was observed in the wild-type dimeric enzyme at low concentrations of antimycin, confirming that the half-of-the-sites reactivity for ubiquinol oxidation can be regulated in the wild-type dimer by binding of inhibitor to one ubiquinone reduction site. We previously proposed that the dimeric cytochrome bc1 complex exhibits half-of-the-sites reactivity for ubiquinol oxidation and rapid electron transfer between bc1 monomers (Covian, R., Kleinschroth, T., Ludwig, B., and Trumpower, B. L. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 22289–22297). Here, we demonstrate the previously proposed half-of-the-sites reactivity and intermonomeric electron transfer by characterizing the kinetics of ubiquinol oxidation in the dimeric bc1 complex from Paracoccus denitrificans that contains an inactivating Y147S mutation in one or both cytochrome b subunits.

The cytochrome bc1 complex is a multisubunit enzyme that generates a transmembrane protonmotive force by transferring electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. Energy conservation in this enzyme complex is ensured by the oxidation of ubiquinol and the reduction of ubiquinone at active sites located on opposite sides of the membrane, as described by the protonmotive Q-cycle (1Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High resolution structures have shown that the bc1 complex is a dimer composed of two copies of cytochrome b, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, and cytochrome c1, which are the only polypeptides present in some bacterial enzymes (2Berry E.A.

The functional relevance of this dimeric arrangement has been supported by an extensive body of kinetic evidence (for review, see Ref. 6Covian R. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which includes the key observations that only one ubiquinol oxidation site, or center P, is active when the two ubiquinone reduction, or center N, sites are occupied by inhibitors (7Covian R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), that electrons rapidly equilibrate between the cytochrome b subunits (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J.

Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30925-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have proposed that this half-of-the sites activity at center P also exists under normal steady-state conditions in the absence of inhibitors and that this mechanism minimizes the leakage of electrons to oxygen under conditions that would favor the accumulation of electrons in the cytochrome b hemes (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Covian R. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Evidence consistent with this proposed dimeric mechanism has been obtained independently by other research groups (12Solmaz S.R. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17542-17549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Yang S. Ma H.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1888-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, other interpretations of these data have been proposed to support a strictly monomeric mechanism of action in the bc1 complex (15Crofts A.R. Holland J.T. Victoria D. Kolling D.R.

We have recently used the relatively simple three-subunit bc1 complex from Paracoccus denitrificans to show that the inhibitor stigmatellin, which is considered to be a mimetic of ubiquinol bound at center P, binds with different rates and spectral effects to one of the center P sites in the dimer, thereby supporting the functional relevance of the dimeric structure of this enzyme (16Covian R. Kleinschroth T. Ludwig B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22289-22297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have generated P. denitrificans bc1 heterodimers in which one center P site is largely inactivated by a mutation in cytochrome b, and we have determined its kinetics in comparison with wild-type and mutant homodimers. Our results directly demonstrate the half-of-the sites activity of the bc1 complex dimer both in the presence and absence of center N inhibitors and confirm other postulates of the dimeric mechanism that we have proposed (6Covian R. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), such as the existence of intermonomeric electron transfer and the activation of the second center P site upon binding of inhibitor to one center N site in the dimer. Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Anatrace. Stigmatellin, antimycin, decylubiquinone, and horse heart cytochrome c were purchased from Sigma. Decylubiquinol was prepared from decylubiquinone as described before (17Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All inhibitors as well as decylubiquinol were quantified by UV spectroscopy (18Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using reported extinction coefficients (19von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 20Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For the construction of the fbc operon with the deletion of the N-terminal acidic domain in cytochrome c1, a 1.5-kb SmaI-PstI cassette was subcloned into pTZ18R (Pharmacia). The resulting plasmid was then cut with XhoI and NotI in a double digestion, followed by the removal of the sticky ends using mung bean nuclease. This double digestion removed the sequence encoding the acidic domain (amino acids 39–203 in cytochrome c1) in-frame. After re-ligation of the vector and transformation, the newly obtained SmaI-PstI cassette was then subcloned into the cloning vectors described below. To clone the His tag into the fbc operon in which the acidic domain of the cytochrome c1 is deleted, a splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOEing PCR) 5The abbreviations used are: SOEing PCRsplicing by overlap extension PCRNTAnitrilotriacetic acidStrepa synthetic peptide of 8 amino acids, Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys. was used. First, a cassette containing the fbcB and fbcC genes was cloned via HindIII and Pfl23II restriction sites in an empty pSL1180 vector. The resulting plasmid was the template for the PCR. The primers used were as follows: SOEing4, 5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3′; SOEing1, 5′-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′; 5′-3′PCytbC-termHis-t_ext_ord, 5′-ACCCATCCTGCCGAGCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACTAAGGAGAGGCAAC-3′; and 3′-5′PCytbC-termHis-t_ext_ord, 5′-GTTGCCTCTCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTCGGCAGGATGGGT-3′. splicing by overlap extension PCR nitrilotriacetic acid a synthetic peptide of 8 amino acids, Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys. The PCR products were SOE1 and SOE2 (580 and 1287 bp, respectively), obtained using the primer 5′-3′PCytbC-termHis-t_ext_ord and SOEing1 for the first fragment and 3′-5′PCytbC-termHis-t_ext_ord and SOEing4 for the second fragment. The two products, annealing via 30 bp at the 3′-end of SOE1 and the 5′ terminus of SOE2, were then mixed together as templates for the third PCR, with the primers SOEing1 and SOEing4. This created a product of 1867 bp. The fragment was blunt-end-ligated in an empty pSL1180 vector and then cloned by Pfl23II and HindIII restriction into the expression vector pRI2 (21Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ostermann T. Weingard L. Ludwig B. Richter O.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) containing the fbc operon. This plasmid (pMC1) was used to transform competent DH5α cells, and the resulting strain was used in a triparental mating procedure to transfer the expression vector into the MK6 P. denitrificans strain (22Schröter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Strep tag II was introduced in the fbc operon using the same procedure as the His tag. In addition to the same primers SOEing1 and SOEing4, the other two primers were 5′-3′-CytbC-termstrep-tagII (5′-AACTGGTCGCATCCGCAGTTCGAGAAGTAAGGAGAGGCAACAATGAC-3′) and 3′-5′-CytbC-termStrep-tagII (5′-CTTCTCGAACTGCGGATGCGACCAGTTCTCGGCAGGATGGGTTTCAG-3′). The final fbc operon with Strep tag II was cloned into the expression vector pBBR1-MCS5 (23Antoine R. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1785-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), resulting in pTK56 (Fig. 1). The Y147S mutation was obtained by one-primer site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type fbc operon with the primer bY147SEco24I (5′-CCGCCTTCATGGGCTCGGTCCTGCCCTGG-3′). Sequencing confirmed that mutagenesis was successful. The mutation was then subcloned via SacI-Pfl23II into a pUC18 vector containing a copy of the fbc operon with the deletion of the acidic domain in Cyt c1 and the His tag. The clones obtained were screened by Eco24I digestion because the introduction of the Y147S mutation eliminates a restriction site for this enzyme in the operon. The clones showing the desired restriction pattern were then sequenced, and the newly obtained vector was digested with HindIII and SacI to subclone the fbc operon with mutation Y147S into the expression vector pEG400 (24Gerhus, E., (1992) Molecular Biology and Functional Studies of Cytochrome bc1 Complex from Paracoccus denitrificans, Ph.D. thesis, Lübeck Medical University, Lübeck, GermanyGoogle Scholar). Clones were screened by digestion with the previously mentioned enzymes, and the resulting plasmid was named pMC12 (Fig. 1). The two plasmids, pMC12 and pTK56, were used to transform competent DH5α cells, and the resulting strains were used in a four-strain mating procedure to transfer the expression vectors simultaneously into the MK6 P. denitrificans strain (22Schröter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) selected on rifampicin, kanamycin, gentamycin, and streptomycin, resulting in a strain stably containing both vectors. Cells from an overnight growth were harvested at an OD value of 3–5 and resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA, and frozen. Membranes were obtained as described previously (22Schröter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To solubilize the bc1 complex, membranes were diluted to a protein concentration of 35 mg/ml. The suspension was then diluted 1:1 with solubilization buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm sucrose, 1.2 m NaCl, with addition of trace amounts of avidine to titrate endogenous biotin compounds in the case of the Strep-tagged protein), and dodecylmaltoside was added to a final ratio 1.15:1 with respect to total protein. Solubilization of the complex was done on ice with stirring for 1 h. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was filtered and loaded onto the appropriate column. Mutant homodimer purification was performed using a Ni2+-NTA column, previously equilibrated with 6 column volumes of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.02% dodecylmaltoside). The column was then washed with 1 column volume, and a 0–200 mm histidine gradient in the same buffer (5 column volumes) was used to elute the complex. Wild-type homodimers were bound to a StrepTactin column (IBA), equilibrated with 5 column volumes of buffer A, and washed with 2 column volumes. A one-step elution was used with 1 column volume of buffer A containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The heterodimer was purified using the 2 columns sequentially in tandem purification (first Ni2+-NTA, then StrepTactin), following the protocols described above. Fractions from the purifications were collected and analyzed by redox difference spectra, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting, to define purity and protein composition. Protein concentrations were calculated using the extinction coefficients of 23.2 mm−1 cm−1 at 553–539 nm (25Anderka, O., (2005) Structural and Functional Studies of Cytochrome bc1 Complex from Paracoccus denitrificans, Ph.D. thesis, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main, GermanyGoogle Scholar) and 25.6 mm−1 cm−1 for the average of the two hemes in cytochrome b (26Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All enzyme samples yielded ratios very close to 2 b hemes:cytochrome c1. Pre-steady-state reduction of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator as described before (7Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 2 μm enzyme with or without 2.5 μm antimycin in assay buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% dodecylmaltoside against an equal volume of the same buffer containing the indicated concentration of decylubiquinol. For each experiment, 8 data sets were averaged after subtracting the oxidized spectrum. The time course of absorbance change at the appropriate wavelengths was extracted using software from OLIS and exported to the Origin 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.). The contribution of cytochrome b to c1 absorbance was calculated and corrected for as previously described (7Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Absorbance changes as a function of time were fitted to monophasic or biphasic exponential functions in Origin. Horse heart cytochrome c reduction was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator. Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 100 nm enzyme and 20 μm cytochrome c in assay buffer against an equal volume of the same buffer containing the indicated concentration of decylubiquinol. For each experiment, 6 data sets were averaged after subtracting the oxidized spectrum. The time course of absorbance change between 550 and 539 nm was extracted using software from OLIS and exported to the Origin 5.0 program, and the initial increase in absorbance was fitted to a linear regression function and expressed as turnover number (moles of cytochrome c reduced/mol of bc1 monomer/s) using an extinction coefficient of 21.5 mm−1cm−1 (28Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Initial rates at different decylubiquinol concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Vm and Km values. For the antimycin titration experiments, the indicated concentration of inhibitor was added to a 10 μm solution of enzyme on ice and incubated for at least 2 min before dilution in assay buffer at room temperature to a concentration of 100 nm enzyme in the presence of 20 μm cytochrome c, and rapid mixing against an equal volume of buffer containing 80 μm decylubiquinol. The very low Kd for antimycin (∼30 pm) (19von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) allows for the stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor to be preserved even after diluting the enzyme to 100 nm. The time course of absorbance change at 550 versus 539 nm from 6 individual data sets/antimycin concentration was extracted using software from OLIS and exported to the Origin 5.0 program, where rates were calculated as described above. Initial rates at each antimycin concentration were fitted to kinetic models published previously (7Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that assume that dimers with one antimycin bound contribute equally or twice as much as free dimers to the overall steady-state rate. The fbc operon of P. denitrificans is composed of three structural genes, encoding for the three subunits in the complex: the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c1 (Fig. 1). Three different domains can be identified in the last protein: an N-terminal, acidic domain, a “core domain” coordinating the c type heme, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. In this work, a cytochrome c1 mutant has been used in which the acidic domain was deleted (24Gerhus, E., (1992) Molecular Biology and Functional Studies of Cytochrome bc1 Complex from Paracoccus denitrificans, Ph.D. thesis, Lübeck Medical University, Lübeck, GermanyGoogle Scholar) to convert the enzyme from a dimer of dimers (29Morgner N. Kleinschroth T. Barth H.D. Ludwig B. Brutschy B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 18: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to a dimer, as judged by the molecular mass obtained by gel filtration and mass spectrometry when this domain is deleted, without affecting the catalytic rate at center P, as will be described in detail in a future publication. 6M. Castellani, T. Kleinschroth, and B. Ludwig, unpublished data. The construction of a heterodimeric bc1 complex (Fig. 1) in P. denitrificans was achieved by transforming a bc1 complex-deficient strain (MK6) with two plasmids: pMC12 and pTK56. The two plasmids were conjugated at the same time, using a four-strain mating procedure. Plasmid DNA obtained from the resulting colonies was screened with the restriction endonucleases BglII and Bpu1102I, cutting inside the antibiotic resistance genes of pTK56 (Gm) and pMC12 (Sm), respectively. Four positive clones were identified, followed by large scale expression and membrane preparation. Two different affinity columns were used to achieve purification of the heterodimer, a Ni2+-NTA and a StrepTactin column (Fig. 2A). From the clones transformed with both plasmids, three differently tagged dimers can be expressed (two His-tagged monomers, two Strep-tagged monomers, and the heterodimeric complex with one His and one Strep tag). The first column (Ni2+-NTA), retains the His-tagged dimer and the heterodimeric bc1 complex. These could subsequently be separated using the StrepTactin column. In Fig. 2B, the Western blot analysis of the different fractions from the purification shows the presence of the expected tags in the fractions obtained from each column, with the heterodimer containing both tags. Crystallographic structures (2Berry E.A. Huang L.S. Saechao L.K. Pon N.G. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 81: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Xia D.

Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar) show that the bc1 complex dimer is stabilized by the transmembrane helices of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, which traverse from one monomer to the other, and by the N terminus helical region of each cytochrome b subunit. The tilted arrangement of the iron-sulfur proteins is in turn stabilized by multiple interactions with cytochrome b and cytochrome c1. Therefore, re-equilibration of cytochrome b subunits between different dimers is not possible because it would require complete dissociation of the subunits of the two monomers of the complex and reassembly by in vivo factors that are not present in the purified enzyme solution. In the absence of inhibitors, decylubiquinol reduced cytochrome c1 under pre-steady-state conditions through center P with the rates shown in Fig. 3. Both the fully wild-type dimer and the mutant homodimers with the Y147S/Y147S cytochrome b mutations exhibited monophasic kinetics on the time scale shown but with a rate 6-fold lower in the case of the mutant dimer. The heterodimer, in contrast, exhibited biphasic kinetics with a fast and a slow rate identical to that obtained in the wild-type and mutant homodimers, respectively. All three dimer samples showed an initial lag in the reduction of cytochrome c1, which lasted longer in the case of the mutant homodimer. This lag phase could reflect a relatively slow binding or partitioning of the substrate toward center P immediately after rapid mixing. The extent of reduction of each phase in the heterodimer was approximately half of the total absorbance change, indicating that the fast rate corresponds to the catalysis of the wild-type monomer and the slow phase to that of the monomer with the Y147S cytochrome b mutation. This implies that, with center N free to reoxidize cytochrome b, the slower catalysis of the mutant center P site was revealed after the more active wild-type site became unable to continue catalysis due to the accumulation of electrons in the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and in cytochrome c1. The total absorbance change was identical in all three enzymes and corresponded to the total concentration of cytochrome c1 present in the assay, indicating that no significant fraction of enzyme in any of the three dimer preparations was inactivated during the purification procedure. In the presence of antimycin, which blocks reoxidation of the bH hemes through center N, both cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 undergo reduction exclusively through center P, although the observed rate of cytochrome c1 reduction is slightly slower than that of cytochrome b because of the higher redox potential of the Rieske protein, which causes a delay in the appearance of the electron in the c1 heme (as fully discussed in Ref. 30Crofts A.R. Shinkarev V.P. Kolling D.R. Kolling D.R. Hong S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36191-36201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both c1 and b reduction report the rate of quinol oxidation at center P with antimycin present. As shown in Fig. 4, the wild-type homodimer and the heterodimer showed very similar rates and extents of reduction for both cytochrome b and c1, whereas the mutant homodimer showed reduction rates ∼7-fold lower, yielding a significantly decreased and incomplete extent of reduction on the time scale shown. The kinetic traces obtained showed that only one c1 heme/dimer underwent reduction in the fully wild-type and heterodimeric enzymes, indicating that only one center P/dimer (the wild-type in the case of the heterodimer) was able to oxidize ubiquinol when antimycin was bound to both center N sites. However, the spectra showed reduction of close to 70% of the total cytochrome b present, without showing the shoulder at 566 nm that is indicative of bL reduction. These observations indicate that both bH hemes in the dimer were reduced through a single center P site by intermonomeric electron transfer between cytochrome b subunits. In the presence of an excess of cytochrome c and without inhibitors, a steady state that allows multiple turnovers of the enzyme occurs as it operates catalytically. As shown in Fig. 5, the rate of this steady-state activity in the heterodimer, as well as its affinity for substrate, was essentially identical to that of the wild-type homodimer. In contrast, the mutant homodimer showed a ∼10-fold lower Vm together with an increased apparent affinity for ubiquinol, possibly caused by the smaller relative contribution in the mutant of the catalytic rate constant (kcat) to the Km, which does not necessarily represents a true dissociation constant for substrate binding. The virtually identical activity between the fully wild-type and heterodimers demonstrates that only one of the two center P sites is active at a time in the homodimer, and in the heterodimer the one wild-type monomer oxidizes ubiquinol continuously and is able to catalyze the same steady-state rate as in the wild-type dimer. This identical activity also disproves the remote possibility that slow cytochrome b re-equilibration between dimers occurred in the heterodimeric preparation to form wild-type and mutant homodimers because the generation of the latter would have decreased the overall turnover rate. As shown in Fig. 6A, the tightly bound center N inhibitor antimycin (Kd ∼30 pm) (Ref. 19von Jagow G. Link T.A.

This effect, which we have already observed in the yeast bc1 complex with antimycin or ilicicolin H (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8614-8620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), could be fitted by assuming that, whereas free dimers have only one center P site active at a time, binding of antimycin to one center N activates the second center P site, allowing ubiquinol oxidation to proceed in both monomers simultaneously (Fig. 6A, inset). Consequently, a dimer with an inhibitor bound at one center N has twice as much activity as a free dimer due to activation of the otherwise silent center P site, being able to use a single center N site to catalyze quinone reduction due to rapid electron equilibration between cytochrome b subunits at the level of the bL hemes. This interpretation was supported by the results shown in Fig. 6B using the heterodimeric enzyme in which one center P site is inactivated. The stimulation of the activity by antimycin was virtually absent in the heterodimer, consistent with the assumption that in the free dimer activity is sustained only by the wild-type center P site and that binding of antimycin to one center N results in the activation of the mutant monomer that, because of its low intrinsic activity (∼10% of the wild-type, as shown in Fig. 5) conveyed by the Y147S cytochrome b mutation, contributes by a correspondingly small fraction to the total rate. Therefore, the activity of dimers with only one antimycin bound is equal to that of free dimers (Fig. 6B, inset), yielding a titration curve that lacks the stimulation observed with the wild-type homodimer. Because electrons coming from the wild-type center P site in heterodimers with one monomer occupied by antimycin are still able to reach the unbound center N, the titration curve exhibits a nonlinear hysteresis, given that a dimer would become fully inactive only when antimycin was bound to both center N sites. If electrons could not be transferred between cytochrome b subunits, wild-type center P sites with antimycin bound at the center N site in the same monomer would be inactive under steady-state conditions, and the titration curve would be linear (dotted line in Fig. 6B), which was clearly not the case. In both the wild-type and heterodimeric enzymes, antimycin at concentrations at or above 100% per monomer did not inhibit the rate of cytochrome c reduction beyond ∼70%. Pre-steady-state experiments with higher enzyme concentrations in the presence of cytochrome c and saturating antimycin showed that the ∼30% residual activity corresponded to bypass reactions in which electrons reach cytochrome c without cytochrome b undergoing reduction. These bypass reactions were associated with superoxide production, being ∼50% sensitive to superoxide dismutase (results not shown). This was expected considering that (as discussed in Ref. 31Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), after electrons accumulate in cytochrome b due to the antimycin blockage, center P transfers one electron from quinol to cytochrome c via the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1, whereas the remaining electron in the substrate is directly transferred to oxygen to form superoxide, which by itself is a good reductant of cytochrome c. Thus, superoxide dismutase only inhibits reduction of cytochrome c by superoxide but is not able to block reduction by the electron coming from the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1, yielding a maximal 50% inhibition in the total antimycin-insensitive reduction of cytochrome c. The relative simplicity of the three-subunit bc1 complex in P. denitrificans compared with its eukaryotic counterparts allowed us in the present work to tag differentially the C terminus of the cytochrome b subunits containing a largely inactivating center P mutation to purify heterodimers where only one monomer had the mutation. This would have been extremely difficult to achieve in a eukaryotic enzyme because the C terminus of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b is surrounded by a polypeptide of 14 kDa (4Zhang Z.

Chem. 2008; 283: 17542-17549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which would have masked or even sterically clashed with the tag extension. Furthermore, we have already demonstrated that the half- of-the sites activity at center P observed in the yeast enzyme is also evident in the complex isolated from P. denitrificans (16Covian R. Kleinschroth T. Ludwig B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22289-22297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It was necessary to delete an acidic N-terminal extension in the cytochrome c1 subunit peculiar to this bacterium that results in the stable aggregation of pairs of dimers, as will be published elsewhere, to purify heterodimers with the Y147S mutation in one cytochrome b subunit. Nevertheless, pre-steady-state kinetic experiments indicated no difference in the rates of cytochrome b or c1 reduction through center P between bc1 complexes containing the wild-type cytochrome b with or without the c1 acidic extension, nor were differences observed when comparing the effect of tagging the C terminus of wild-type or Y147S cytochrome b with His or Strep extensions (results not shown). Our present results demonstrate directly that only one center P site is active in both the wild-type and heterodimeric enzymes when antimycin is bound at both center N sites (see Fig. 4) and under steady-state conditions (see Fig. 5) in which, as we have previously proposed (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), both center N sites are likely occupied with semiquinone most of the time. The identical turnover rates obtained in the heterodimer, in which one ubiquinol oxidation site was largely inactivated by mutation, relative to the wild-type enzyme (see Fig. 5), is clear evidence that one active center P site is sufficient to sustain full catalysis in the bc1 complex dimer. The Y147S cytochrome b substitution does not preclude the binding of substrate, as evidenced by EPR studies that show normal occupancy at center P (32Saribas S. Ding H. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16004-16012Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This agrees with the even higher apparent affinity of the mutant homodimer for decylubiquinol (see Fig. 5) relative to the wild-type homodimer, and with its fast and tight binding of stigmatellin (results not shown), an inhibitor that occupies the same site as the substrate. Therefore, the observation that the wild-type monomer is the only one to manifest activity in the case of the WT/Y147S heterodimer suggests that ubiquinol oxidation at the faster center P site, and not merely its binding, contributes to the complete inactivation of the second center P site. This agrees with the proposal that electron transfer from bL to bH affects the mobility of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, as evidenced by the much slower cytochrome c1 reduction in enzyme that lacks the bH hemes (13Yang S. Ma H.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28767-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The half-of-the-sites dimeric mechanism we have proposed for the functioning of the bc1 complex (6Covian R. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) also postulates that an asymmetry in binding of ligands to the center N sites allows simultaneous activity at the center P sites, as evidenced by the stimulation exerted by low concentration of antimycin on the steady-state activity of the dimer. Our present data showing the absence of this stimulation in the heterodimer (see Fig. 6) are a clear indication that activation of the second center P site is indeed responsible for this paradoxical effect of center N inhibitors. Our pre-steady-state results in the absence of inhibitors and cytochrome c (see Fig. 3) are also consistent with this aspect of the dimeric mechanism. Given that center N was allowed to oscillate freely between states with different semiquinone occupancies, the second center P site in the dimer was allowed to manifest its intrinsic activity once the first site was prevented from further ubiquinol oxidation events by the accumulation of electrons in cytochrome c1 and the Rieske protein. This effect was evidenced by the biphasic c1 reduction kinetics obtained with the heterodimeric enzyme. However, under normal turnover conditions in which cytochrome c continuously oxidizes c1, only one monomer would be active at a time, as observed under steady-state conditions. This also supports our previous proposal that dimeric states in which semiquinone is present only at one center N site are probably transient under normal turnover conditions (6Covian R. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), having the effect of randomly switching which monomer will be active in the next cycle of ubiquinol oxidation. Our present kinetic results also convincingly demonstrate the existence of non-rate-limiting electron equilibration between cytochrome b subunits, which allows both bH hemes to undergo reduction through only one active center P site (see Fig. 4) and permits the recycling of electrons coming from either or both center P sites through only one center N (see Fig. 6). We have already provided direct evidence for rapid electron transfer (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8614-8620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) at the level of the bL hemes, given the close distance between them as shown in crystallographic structures, which is optimal to sustain fast electron tunneling rates (8Covian R.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 1096-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, our present work clearly demonstrates that the bc1 complex does not function as independent monomeric units, as has been argued recently (15Crofts A.R. Holland J.T. Victoria D. Kolling D.R. Dikanov S.A. Gilbreth R. Lhee S. Kuras R. Kuras M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1001-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and supports our previous conclusion (10Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30925-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that a strong selective pressure has preserved the dimeric structure and function of this energy-transducing enzyme to regulate its activity in response to the redox poise of the substrate pool and minimize formation of reactive oxygen species."

Although S. cerevisiae has the simplest known kinetochores, they nonetheless contain approximately 70 subunits that assemble on centromeric DNA in a hierarchical manner. Developing an accurate picture of the DNA-binding, linker and microtubule-binding layers of kinetochores, including the functions of individual proteins in these layers, is a key challenge in the field of yeast chromosome segregation. Moreover, comparison of orthologous proteins in yeast and humans promises to extend insight obtained from the study of simple fungal kinetochores to complex animal cell kinetochores.We show that S. cerevisiae Spc105p forms a heterotrimeric complex with Kre28p, the likely orthologue of the metazoan kinetochore protein Zwint-1. Through systematic analysis of interdependencies among kinetochore complexes, focused on Spc105p/Kre28p, we develop a comprehensive picture of the assembly hierarchy of budding yeast kinetochores. We find Spc105p/Kre28p to comprise the third linker complex that, along with the Ndc80 and MIND linker complexes, is responsible for bridging between centromeric heterochromatin and kinetochore MAPs and motors. Like the Ndc80 complex, Spc105p/Kre28p is also essential for kinetochore binding by components of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Moreover, these functions are conserved in human cells.Spc105p/Kre28p is the last of the core linker complexes to be analyzed in yeast and we show it to be required for kinetochore binding by a discrete subset of kMAPs (Bim1p, Bik1p, Slk19p) and motors (Cin8p, Kar3p), all of which are nonessential. Strikingly, dissociation of these proteins from kinetochores prevents bipolar attachment, even though the Ndc80 and DASH complexes, the two best-studied kMAPs, are still present. The failure of Spc105 deficient kinetochores to bind correctly to spindle microtubules and to recruit checkpoint proteins in yeast and human cells explains the observed severity of missegregation phenotypes."

To complicate matters, there are differences between conditions during in vitro ischemia-like events and stroke in vivo (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J.

When combined with two-photon imaging of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) fluorescence, this model allowed us to monitor Δψm with high temporal and spatial resolution.

Urethane-anesthetized 2–5-month-old green fluorescent protein (GFP-M) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP-H) transgenic mice (19.Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M.

All mice were bred at the University of British Columbia animal facilities. All experimental anesthesia was achieved by intraperitoneal injections of urethane (0.12%, w/w) as described (20.Zhang S. Boyd J. Delaney K. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5333-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The core temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C using a heating pad with feedback regulation from a rectal temperature probe. A heat exchanger was used to warm the head plate and the area around the craniotomy, including the physiological solution surrounding the water immersion objective. Cortical surface temperature was maintained at ∼37 °C by pumping 38 °C water through the heat exchanger using a heating pad water pump (T/Pump TP500, Gaymar, Orchard Park, NY). Urethane supplementation for maintenance of anesthesia and saline injections with glucose for hydration and nutrition were administered as described previously (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Experimental protocols were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Mice were attached to a custom-made head hold, and a cranial window was created over the forelimb-hind limb somatosensory cortex. Imaging was performed in the forelimb area in brain regions lacking major arterioles and anterior and lateral to the hind limb border. Detailed surgical procedures for cranial window preparation for in vivo two-photon imaging are as described previously (20.Zhang S. Boyd J. Delaney K. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5333-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because of the potential low blood-brain barrier permeability of CsA (21.Uchino H. Elmér E. Uchino K. Li P.A. He Q.P. Smith M.L. Siesjö B.K. Brain Res. 1998; 812: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the reduced ability of Rh123 to penetrate a healthy dura (observed in our experiments), the dura was removed from all preparations to permit direct application of compounds to the cortex. Instrumentation for two-photon laser scanning and the procedure for image acquisition are as described previously (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). During imaging of ischemia, fluorophores were excited at 900 nm because of excitation wavelength requirements of GFP/yellow fluorescent protein. During imaging of pressure injection of KCl and other solutions, all fluorophores were excited at 810 nm because of excitation wavelength requirements for Alexa 594. The Rh123 signal was adequate at both wavelengths (higher signals were observed at 810 nm). For all in vivo time-lapse imaging performed during stroke experiments, multiple z-series of 20 images with z-spacing of 1 μm were taken during ischemia and reperfusion within the superficial dendritic tuft. Each image was the average of three frames taken over 5.5 s. For pressure injection experiments, each frame was taken over 0.46 s, and a total of 50 frames of the same z-plane were taken per injection. Pressure injection was triggered at frame 10 after 4.6 s. Fig. 1A provides a schematic overview of a CCA occlusion experiment. One suture (5-0, silk, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) was surgically looped around each CCA as described previously (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the sutures were not crossed over the trachea as performed previously (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We found that animals with uncrossed sutures had reduced rates of heart failure during stroke, possibly because of reduced pressure on the carotid bodies at the CCA bifurcation. Sutures were pulled by hand to apply pressure on the CCAs, secured with tape to induce occlusion, and released for reperfusion. As observed previously, ischemic durations of >7 min led to poor cardiovascular recovery during reperfusion and were avoided (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Over the duration of the stroke, two-photon imaging of Texas Red-dextran confirmed that blood flow was blocked immediately upon occlusion of the CCAs and remained occluded for the duration of the stroke (see Fig. 1, B and C) and detailed previously (20.Zhang S. Boyd J. Delaney K. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5333-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Our previous two-photon measurements indicated that the CCA occlusion is sufficient to generate a >90% reduction in cortical blood flow within seconds of tensioning the sutures (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In some animals, a second stroke was induced. For measurements of Rh123 fluorescence or electroencephalogram (EEG) quantification, both first and second stroke trials were pooled for our final data comparison (see Figs. 2 and 4). Comparison of data from the first and second strokes indicated no significant difference (p > 0.05), suggesting that pooling of two stroke trials within the same animal is reasonable. For dendritic structural analysis (see Fig. 5), only the first stroke from each animal was tabulated because some animals never recover completely within the time of monitoring.FIGURE 2Synchronous Δψm collapse occurs during ischemia and coincides with the Δψp depolarization.

Rh123 is concentrated by the mitochondria because of the negative Δψm, and at a high local concentration, Rh123 fluorescence becomes autoquenched. Upon Δψm collapse, it is dispersed and becomes dequenched, leading to an increase in fluorescence. A stock solution of Rh123 (52.5 mm) was made in anhydrous Me2SO and diluted in HEPES-buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) to a working solution of 20 μm. Rh123 was directly applied to the craniotomy for 1 h and washed before imaging. A relatively high concentration of Rh123 was required because it was applied to the brain surface. Lower concentrations led to poor loading and signals. For in vivo pressure injection experiments (1–4 s, 3–6 p.s.i.; Picospritzer II, General Valve Corp., Fairfield, NJ), injected solutions were first filtered using a 0.2-μm filter and injected into somatosensory cortex layer I. Agarose and a coverslip were applied over the cranial window prior to pressure injection. The pipette was slowly inserted through the agarose and into the brain. Injection protocols were similar to those described previously (22.Stosiek C. Garaschuk O. Holthoff K. Konnerth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The injection pipettes were 4–6 megaohms in resistance. Under the condition with added extracellular Ca2+, standard ACSF (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.8 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5.0 mm NaHEPES) was used to bath the brain prior to imaging, to make the agarose, and to apply under the water immersion objective for the duration of imaging. Under the condition with no added extracellular Ca2+, a similar ACSF was made; however, in this solution, CaCl2 was substituted with 5 mm MgCl2 (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 5.0 mm NaHEPES). Under this condition, Ca2+-free ACSF was gently perfused over the surface of the brain for 5 min prior to agarose application. Ca2+-free ACSF was also used to make the agarose and to apply under the water immersion objective. For control injections, standard ACSF, which contained 135 mm NaCl, was injected. For KCl injections, 135 mm NaCl in the ACSF was substituted with KCl, resulting in a total of 140.4 mm KCl (140.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.8 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5.0 mm NaHEPES). For all experiments performed under the condition of no added extracellular Ca2+, the injection solution was also made Ca2+-free by substituting CaCl2 with MgCl2 as described above. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was freshly made prior to each experiment. FCCP was initially dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO at 10 mm and diluted with ACSF for pressure injections. A concentration-response experiment was performed by injecting different concentrations of FCCP to determine the concentration that resulted in maximal Δψm depolarization in vivo. Injection of FCCP at 50 μm showed a small Rh123 fluorescence response (∼30% increase), whereas injection of FCCP at 200 and 500 μm (supplemental Fig. 1) showed similar apparently maximal responses of ∼120%. This suggests that the concentration we selected for the rest of the experiments (200 μm) generates a maximal Δψm depolarization. For each animal, one to three injections of each treatment were preformed. In cases in which multiple injections of the same treatment were performed, the results were averaged for that animal. All pressure injections contained Alexa 594 as a tracer (20 μm). This allowed us to monitor the volume of each injection. All Rh123 fluorescence measurements in pressure injection experiments were performed within a circular region of interest (ROI), with the center oriented at the tip of the pipette and the radius being the distance to the point where the tracer Alexa 594 fluorescence intensity measured was half of the intensity measured at the pipette tip. The plot of Alexa 594 fluorescence change versus time (n = 30 total injections) showed faster kinetics than any of the Rh123 fluorescence signals (see Fig. 3B). This and other data (sham injection of NaCl) indicate that there was no Alexa 594 bleed-through affecting the Rh123 signals. For each injection, Alexa 594 fluorescence at each time point was divided by the maximal intensity measured within that record to obtain values scaled relative to the maximal increase. Because volume addition due to pressure injection can cause a small local mechanical stimulation of the brain, in the same experiments, a series of control injections (n = four animals) were performed. In the control injections, no Rh123 elevation was observed. Moreover, pressure injection resulted in a small decrease in tissue fluorescence (∼19%) that was attributed to minor tissue deformation due to the injection volume and the solution possibly washing away Rh123 that was present extracellularly. Consequently, records obtained from all other pressure injection experiments were normalized to the control 135 mm NaCl injection to correct for mechanical stimulation-induced fluorescence changes. In stroke experiments, imaging of Rh123 was done within layer I of the somatosensory cortex, typically within 50 μm of the pial surface. The maintained presence of Rh123 within mitochondria after stroke was confirmed by monitoring basal Rh123 fluorescence at times after reperfusion onset. We were also able to trigger a second Rh123 fluorescence elevation during the second stroke, indicating the presence of responsive dye. In pressure injection experiments, imaging of Rh123 was also done within layer I of the somatosensory cortex, typically within 30–70 μm of the pial surface. To quantify Rh123 signal changes in stroke experiments, for each time point, fluorescence values (F) during ischemia within a given ROI (typically 80 × 80 μm) were subtracted from base-line values (dF = F − F0). dF values were normalized to base-line values (F0) to give dF/F0 values. In pressure injection experiments, for a given time point, the F values within the ROI were subtracted from the base-line average (F0) to give dF. F0 was calculated by averaging the F values of a given ROI over the first 10 time-lapse images acquired during the base-line period before injection (recorded over 4.6 s). dF values within an ROI were then normalized to the base line (F0) to generate dF/F0 values. CsA (C3662, Sigma) was stored in solid form at 4 °C. Immediately prior to an experiment, CsA was dissolved into anhydrous Me2SO (25 mg/ml) and subsequently diluted in ACSF to a working concentration of 20 μm. CsA at 20 μm was bath-applied directly to the craniotomy for 1 h and mixed into the agarose at 10 μm for sustained application. An FK-506 (F4679, Sigma) stock solution was prepared in anhydrous Me2SO (20 mg/ml) and stored at 4 °C. During the experiments, it was diluted to a working concentration of 50 μm in ACSF. FK-506 was bath-applied directly to the craniotomy for 1 h and mixed into the agarose at 50 μm for sustained application. Note that concentrations of both CsA and FK-506 within the brain were expected to be lower because the drugs were applied only to the surface. In experiments in which both Rh123 and a drug (such as CsA) were incubated, Rh123 was always incubated first. EEG recording was performed as described previously (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One electrode was inserted into the agarose inside the craniotomy, a second reference on the back between the scapula, and a ground electrode on the foot. A surface direct current (DC) EEG was recorded as described previously (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Abrupt changes in the DC EEG potential were indicative of Δψp depolarization. After alternating current (AC) filtering (0.1–10-Hz band pass) or collection of the EEG in an AC mode, we observed slow wave cortical activity (∼1 Hz). The suppression of this slow wave cortical activity was used to define the onset of occlusion (supplemental Fig. 2, upper). The appearance of a large slow ripple oscillation on AC EEG recording was temporally correlated with a maximal rate of Δψp depolarization (supplemental Fig. 2) (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In stroke trials that lacked DC EEG recording (because of larger offsets), AC mode recording was used to estimate the time when Δψp depolarization reached a maximal rate of depolarization. DC EEG recording was required to determine a measure of the total Δψp depolarization amplitude. For this reason, the number of ischemic trials was different between latency from occlusion to maximal rate of Δψp depolarization (see Fig. 4D) and total Δψp depolarization amplitude (see Fig. 4E) because some animals had only AC mode recordings. Calcium imaging data in supplemental Fig. 3 was reanalyzed from Ref. 2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar (see this article for a full description of this method and data). The MouseOx pulse oximeter (Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA) was used in some animals to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation and was mounted on the tail (2.Murphy T.H. Li P. Betts K. Liu R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1756-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The dendritic tufts of GFP-labeled layer V neurons were imaged within 50 μm of the pial surface. CCA occlusion can induce shifts in the vertical position of the cortex, making it difficult to examine only a single image plane. To ensure that we examined the same dendrites throughout the experiment despite small vertical position shifts, z-series of 20 images with z-spacing of 2 μm were taken. Intrinsic optical signal imaging was performed before strok"
https://openalex.org/W2109971777,"A decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been associated with extended life span in animal models of longevity. Mice deficient in the p66Shc gene are long-lived, and their cells are both resistant to oxidative stress and produce less ROS. Our microarray analysis of p66Shc(−/−) mouse tissues showed alterations in transcripts involved in heme and superoxide production and insulin signaling. Thus, we carried out analysis of ROS production by NADPH oxidase (PHOX) in macrophages of control and p66Shc knock-out mice. p66Shc(−/−) mice had a 40% reduction in PHOX-dependent superoxide production. To confirm whether the defect in superoxide production was a direct consequence of p66Shc deficiency, p66Shc was knocked down with siRNA in the macrophage cell line RAW264, and a 30% defect in superoxide generation was observed. The pathway of PHOX-dependent superoxide generation was investigated. PHOX protein levels were not decreased in mutant macrophages; however, the rate and extent of phosphorylation of p47phox was decreased in mutants, as was membrane translocation of the complex. Consistently, phosphorylation of protein kinase Cδ, Akt, and ERK (the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of p47phox) was decreased. Thus, p66Shc deficiency causes a defect in activation of the PHOX complex that results in decreased superoxide production. p66Shc-deficient mice have recently been observed to be resistant to atherosclerosis and to oxidant injury in kidney and brain. Because phagocyte-derived superoxide is often a component of oxidant injury and inflammation, we suggest that the decreased superoxide production by PHOX in p66Shc-deficient mice could contribute significantly to their relative protection from oxidant injury and consequent longevity.

PM were harvested 4 days after thioglycollate injection of the peritoneal cavity. Cells were washed with chilled PBS, red blood cells were hypotonically lysed, and macrophages were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 15% FBS, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and plated on 100-mm round Petri dishes. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 non-adherent cells were removed, and the remaining adherent cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 15% FBS, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin for no more than 48 h before functional assays. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 15% FBS, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and subcultured twice a week. Total RNA was extracted by direct lysis of the cells on the tissue culture plate using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal RNA amounts were added to Superscript II First Strand reverse transcriptase reaction mixture (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primer. The resulting templates were subject to SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR using specific primers, listed above. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 3 min as initial denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 15 s and finished by melting curve by gradual heating until 95 °C. Only experiments with a single melting peak were considered for analysis. Reaction qualities have being verified by gel electrophoresis. PCR was carried out using a LightCycler480 real time PCR instrument and LightCycler480 analysis software (Roche Applied Science). Blood heme measurement was performed on heart blood samples. Blood was collected in capillary tubes containing electrolyte-balanced heparin at 70 IU/ml of blood. Following collection, blood samples were immediately analyzed for hemoglobin levels on a Radiometer OSM3 hemoximeter (Copenhagen, Denmark). Cells were cultivated and transfected on 6-well plates (Nunc) started at 200,000 cells/well. Transfection was performed as described, and after 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, and 3 ml of KRP, which contains PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 μg/ml OxyBURST Green H2HFF-BSA dye, was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 2 min, and readings of fluorescence at 530 nm excited at 480 nm were taken for 12 min using CytoFluor Multi-Well Plate Reader (PerSeptive Biosystems). Then PMA until 3 μg/ml was added to experimental wells, and readings were continued for the next 30 min, and then DMSO (solvent for PMA) was added to control cells, used as base line. After the assay, one-half of the cells from each well were taken to the cell count and trypan blue-based viability assay, and the number of cells in each well was calculated. Fluorescence readings were normalized to exact viable cell number in each well. Another half of the cells were used for either protein extraction for Western blots or total RNA extraction for semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. For the gliotoxin or DPI inhibition of NAD(P)H-oxidase, gliotoxin or DPI was directly added to the tissue culture medium until a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for gliotoxin or 10 μm for DPI, and cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to measurements of superoxide production. For the H2HFF-based assay, cells were cultivated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 24–48 h after harvesting. Medium was RPMI 1640 containing 15% FBS, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended in ice-cold KRP. Aliquots were taken for the cell counting and viability assay, and the exact number of cells was calculated. The indicated number of cells was taken into a warm 96-well plate with fresh KRP supplemented with OxyBURST Green H2HFF-BSA dye until 10 μg/ml, and the final volume was 190 μl. After a 2-min incubation in the dark, readings were started at emission of 530 nm and excitation of 480 nm. As a stimulus, PMA at 3 μg/ml, fMLP at 3 μm, or AA at 15 μm was added at minute 12, and readings were continued during the next 30 min. A 10-s mixing step was used in each reading cycle of the instrument to prevent the cells from sedimentation. Gliotoxin or DPI inhibition was done similarly, as described above. For the SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction-based assay, PM were harvested from the peritoneal cavity 4 days after thioglycollate injection by lavage with ice-cold PBS. Contaminating erythrocytes were hypotonically lysed, and PM were resuspended in KRP, pH 7.4, at 5 × 106 cells/ml and kept on ice until use. The reaction mixture was 250 μl and contained 50 μm cytochrome c and 6.25 × 105 PM in KRP. The superoxide release was induced with 4 μg of PMA, and readings of absorbance at 550 nm were taken for 10 min using a Tecan Spectra Rainbow 96-well plate spectrophotometer (Tecan). The same assay was carried out in the presence of SOD at 2.5 μg/reaction in order to evaluate the superoxide-independent change in absorbance. A sample without PMA was used as a negative control. siRNA Transfection of RAW264.7 cells was carried out on 6-well plates (Nunc). 200,000 cells/well were plated in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640, 15% FBS and after settlement washed with PBS. The transfection mixture was prepared using 70 nm siRNA specific for p66Shc or nonspecific AllStar siRNA (Qiagen), Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h of transfection in 600 μl of transfection mixture/well, cells were fed with fresh RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% FBS. After 48 h of cultivation, cells were used in NAD(P)H-oxidase measurement assays followed by cell counting and RNA or protein extraction as described above. Total RNA was extracted from the following tissues of individual age-matched mice: liver, spleen, lungs, epididymal fat, and PM at 3 months of age and liver, retroperitoneal fat, and spleen at 12 months of age. TRIzol reagent was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and then RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Two mutant and two control mice were used for each experiment. In total, 16 samples from mutant mice and 16 samples from control mice tissues were used. First and second strand of cDNA were generated using the One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix), and labeled cRNAs were synthesized using the Gene Chip IVT Labeling System (Affymetrix), fragmented, and hybridized to the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting CEL files were analyzed for each group of tissue individually using dChip (DNA chip analyzer) software (10Schadt E.E. Li C. Ellis B. Wong W.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 37 (Suppl.): 120-125Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Updated annotations were obtained from the NetAffx data base, and multisample analysis was performed by combining the dChip lists using Excel. Probesets with a pCall of >20% and p < 0.05 were considered significantly altered. An additional set of CEL files was obtained. Liver, spleen, and lungs samples from 3-month-old p66Shc(−/−) and 3-month-old control mice were hybridized in a similar way to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome U74Av2 chips. RNA samples of each tissue from three animals were pulled together. Two chips for each RNA sample of control and two chips for each RNA sample of mutant mice were used. The CEL files were analyzed with dChip in our laboratory and incorporated into our expression data table using a >90% probeset match between two different chip formats, Mouse Genome 430 2.0 and U74Av2. Probesets were then resorted by number of times they were significantly changed through different experiments. Lists of the top 250 up- and down-regulated genes were categorized using the Onto-Express Pathway analysis tool, and lists of the 100 top up- and down-regulated genes were categorized using the Onto-Express bioprocess analysis tool (11Khatri P. Bhavsar P. Bawa G. Draghici S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W449-W456Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For filtering OntoExpress results, we used a cut-off value for p of 0.05. Lists of significantly altered pathways (which included 27 pathways) and significantly altered bioprocesses (18 bioprocesses) were sorted by impact factor and p value, respectively, and the four top up- and down-regulated pathways and bioprocesses were tabulated. Total protein was isolated by direct lysis of adherent cells or isolated from cell pellets washed with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies), containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with Complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 40 μg of protein/line, as determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences), and hybridized with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by development with infrared IR dye 700CW- and/or 800CW-labeled secondary antibodies (Li-Cor Corp.). Blots were scanned on an Odyssey infrared imaging instrument and quantified using Odyssey 2.1 software. Use of different IR dye-labeled secondary antibodies allowed us to measure the level of housekeeping proteins at the same time as the proteins of interest on the same membrane and improved the accuracy of quantification and normalization. Macrophages were induced with DMSO (mock treatment) or PMA for 5 min, as indicated; reactions were stopped with 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS; cells were collected by quick centrifugation at 0 °C and lysed by sonication with First Dimension Buffer, containing 8.0 m urea, 2.0% Triton X-100, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.6% Bio-Lyte 5/7 and 0.4% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes, and 1.5% CHAPS. Samples were isoelectrofocused on 4% PAGE (T = 25%, C = 3%), supplemented with 8 m urea, 1.5% CHAPS at a pH range of 4–9. Isoelectrofocusing gels were than transferred on top of 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE for the second dimension. Blots were probed with goat anti-p47phox antibody. For the second hybridization, blots were probed with donkey anti-goat monoclonal antibodies (Li-Cor), labeled with IR dye 800CW. The membrane was scanned with an Odyssey infrared scanner and analyzed with Odyssey 2.1 software. Total protein was isolated from control and p66Shc(−/−) PM induced with PMA for 5 min or mock-treated as described above. Cells were collected and lysed by 20 strokes in CHAPS lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS and supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Unbroken cells were collected by brief centrifugation at 400 × g, and protein concentrations were determined. 100 μg of total protein were adjusted to 60 μl with CHAPS lysis buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at +4 °C. Supernatant was called the cytosolic fraction, and pellet was washed with CHAPS lysis buffer and contained the membrane fraction of proteins. The cytosolic fraction was supplemented until 1× with Laemmli sample buffer, and the membrane fraction was resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Fractions were boiled until they dissolved completely and were loaded on SDS-PAGE. Western blots with the indicated antibody were performed as described above. Macrophages were isolated from 3-month-old mice as described above, and 7 × 106 cells were resuspended in 6 ml of KRP medium. 3 ml of cell suspension were induced with stimulus: 3 μg/ml PMA for 5 min or 5 μm fMLP for 60 s, as indicated; the other half of the cell suspension was treated with an equal amount of DMSO (mock treatment). For fMLP induction, cells were pretreated with 10 μm cytochalasin b for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by a 5-volume dilution of ice-cold PBS, and cells were collected by rapid centrifugation and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA 630, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete Mini proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were rapidly clarified by low speed centrifugation at +4 °C and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Aliquots of protein lysates were left for protein quantification. GTP-Rac1/2 was precipitated using Rac/Cdc41 assay reagent PAK-1 PBD-agarose conjugate (Millipore Inc.) from equal amounts of protein, as recommended by the manufacturer. For the positive controls, one-third aliquots of each experimental sample were loaded with 100 μm GTPγS for 10 min at 30 °C and than used for precipitation with PAK-1 p21-binding domain-agarose. Positive control samples were used to estimate total Rac available for GTP binding in a sample and to ensure that affinity reagent was not saturated. Precipitates were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE, and blots were probed with mouse anti-Rac1 monoclonal (Millipore Inc.) and goat anti-Rac2 polyclonal antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA). Blots were developed and quantified using infrared-labeled secondary antibodies as described above. Fluorescent arbitrary units from Rac bands were normalized to a 50 kDa constitutive band of constant intensity between all samples regardless of GTPγS loading of lysates. To identify transcripts altered in long-lived p66Shc knock-out mice, we microarrayed RNA from liver, spleen, lungs, fat, and peritoneal macrophages of 3-month-old males and 12-month-old males and females of p66Shc(−/−) and control mice. A total of 19 mutants and 19 age/sex-matched control animals were used for the hybridization with Affymetrix oligo-microarray chips, followed by analysis of gene expression data using dChip (10Schadt E.E. Li C. Ellis B. Wong W.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 37 (Suppl.): 120-125Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Each data set was analyzed individually, transcripts of p < 0.05 were organized in a megatable, and the top 250 up- and down-regulated genes were entered into OntoExpress (12Draghici S. Khatri P. Tarca A.L. Amin K. Done A. Voichita C. Georgescu C. Romero R. Genome Res. 2007; 17: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The top four significantly altered pathways are presented. Also, lists of top 100 up- and down-regulated genes were analyzed with OntoExpress for biological process (11Khatri P. Bhavsar P. Bawa G. Draghici S.

Some of the genes underlying these down-regulated processes were related to NADPH oxidase activity. Given the involvement of heme in NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, this activity was specifically measured. NADPH oxidase (PHOX) is the basis of the respiratory burst. We measured the respiratory burst of p66Shc(−/−) peritoneal macrophages by two different methods: the conventional SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c assay and a more sensitive, fluorescence-based H2HFF-oxidation assay (Fig. 1). Both H2HFF dye oxidation and cytochrome c reduction were inhibitable with DPI or gliotoxin, specific PHOX inhibitors (13Hancock J.T. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Nishida S. Yoshida L.S. Shimoyama T. Nunoi H. Kobayashi T. Tsunawaki S. Infect.

As determined by the cytochrome c assay, the mean value of SOD-inhibitable superoxide production by 600,000 PMA-induced control macrophages was 151 pmol of superoxide/min, whereas p66Shc(−/−) macrophages produce 104 pmol of superoxide/min. Thus, mutant macrophages have 69% of the NAD(P)H-oxidase activity of control. The difference in means was significant, p < 0.000003 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the H2HFF oxidation method demonstrated an about 40% defect in superoxide production by mutant macrophages, p = 0.01084 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained for fMLP- and AA-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were also obtained for p66Shc(−/−) mice in the 129 genetic background using the DCFDA assay.FIGURE 2NAD(P)H oxidase activity in peritoneal macrophages from control and p66Shc(−/−) mice.

First, we investigated the expression of the components of the NOX2 complex (i.e. Rac1/2, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, p22phox, and gp91phox), using Western blots of protein extracts from peritoneal macrophages of p66Shc(−/−) and control mice (Fig. 3) (data not shown). There was no significant decrease in the protein levels of any tested NOX2 subunit"
https://openalex.org/W2021623394,"Goldilocks Immunology T cells are carefully calibrated in the thymus to react to invading pathogens and to ignore the self. This occurs through interactions between the T cell receptor and major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) expressing self-peptides. A Goldilocks-like selection process is carried out whereby T cells that do not react or react too strongly to self-peptide MHCs are deleted, whereas those with interactions that are “just right” are allowed to survive. The result is T cells highly specific for a particular foreign peptide-MHC complex. Receipt of survival signals from “just-right” interactions (positive selection) and deletion of cells that are too reactive (negative selection) are spatially and temporally segregated in the thymus, and it is unclear at which stage T cells acquire their high degree of peptide-MHC specificity. By using mice expressing a single peptide-MHC complex, Wang et al. (p. 871 ) now show that this single complex is sufficient for selection of a CD8 + T cell repertoire with a broad range of specificity. Importantly, recognition of peptide MHC by these cells was highly specific, demonstrating that peptide-MHC specificity is acquired during positive selection in the thymus."
https://openalex.org/W1996444490,"Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutation in either the dual specificity phosphatase laforin or ubiquitin ligase malin. A pathological hallmark of LD is the accumulation of cytoplasmic polyglucosan inclusions commonly known as Lafora bodies in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. How mutations in these two proteins cause disease pathogenesis is not well understood. Malin interacts with laforin and recruits to aggresomes upon proteasome inhibition and was shown to degrade misfolded proteins. Here we report that malin is spontaneously misfolded and tends to be aggregated, degraded by proteasomes, and forms not only aggresomes but also other cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates in all transfected cells upon proteasomal inhibition. Malin also interacts with Hsp70. Several disease-causing mutants of malin are comparatively more unstable than wild type and form aggregates in most transfected cells even without the inhibition of proteasome function. These cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates are immunoreactive to ubiquitin and 20 S proteasome. Interestingly, progressive proteasomal dysfunction and cell death is also most frequently observed in the mutant malin-overexpressed cells compared with the wild-type counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate that the co-chaperone carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) stabilizes malin by modulating the activity of Hsp70. All together, our results suggest that malin is unstable, and the aggregate-prone protein and co-chaperone CHIP can modulate its stability."

https://openalex.org/W2008124321,"The observed matter in the universe accounts for just 5 percent of the observed gravity. A possible explanation is that Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity fail where gravity is either weak or enhanced. The modified theory of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) reproduces, without dark matter, spiral-galaxy orbital motions and the relation between luminosity and rotation in galaxies, although not in clusters. Recent extensions of Einstein's theory are theoretically more complete. They inevitably include dark fields that seed structure growth, and they may explain recent weak lensing data. However, the presence of dark fields reduces calculability and comes at the expense of the original MOND premise -- that the matter we see is the sole source of gravity. Observational tests of the relic radiation, weak lensing, and the growth of structure may distinguish modified gravity from dark matter."

Using 14N ESEEM and HYSCORE spectroscopies at a lower frequency (S-band, ∼3.4 GHz), the 14N nuclear quadrupolar parameters of the interacting nitrogen nucleus (κ = 0.49, η = 0.50) were determined and correspond to those of a histidine Nδ, assigned to the heme bD ligand His-66 residue. Moreover S-band 15N ESEEM spectra enabled us to directly measure the anisotropic part of the nitrogen hyperfine interaction (T(15N) = 0.16 MHz).

https://openalex.org/W2021081647,"We have recently identified FIBCD1 (Fibrinogen C domain containing 1) as a type II transmembrane endocytic receptor located primarily in the intestinal brush border. The ectodomain of FIBCD1 comprises a coiled coil, a polycationic region, and a C-terminal FReD (fibrinogen-related domain) that assembles into disulfide-linked homotetramers. The FIBCD1-FReD binds Ca(2+) dependently to acetylated structures like chitin, N-acetylated carbohydrates, and amino acids. FReDs are present in diverse innate immune pattern recognition proteins including the ficolins and horseshoe crab TL5A. Here, we use chemical cross-linking, combined with analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy of the negatively stained recombinant FIBCD1-FReD to show that it assembles into noncovalent tetramers in the absence of the coiled coil. We use surface plasmon resonance, carbohydrate binding, and pulldown assays combined with site-directed mutagenesis to define the binding site involved in the interaction of FIBCD1 with acetylated structures. We show that mutations of central residues (A432V and H415G) in the hydrophobic funnel (S1) abolish the binding of FIBCD1 to acetylated bovine serum albumin and chitin. The double mutations (D393N/D395A) at the putative calcium-binding site reduce the ability of FIBCD1 to bind ligands. We conclude that the FReDs of FIBCD1 forms noncovalent tetramers and that the acetyl-binding site of FReDs of FIBCD1 is homologous to that of tachylectin 5A and M-ficolin but not to the FReD of L-ficolin. We suggest that the spatial organization of the FIBCD1-FReDs determine the molecular pattern recognition specificity and subsequent biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1976010532,"When glucose is added to yeast cells that are starved for 3 days, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and malate dehydrogenase 2 are degraded in the vacuole via the vacuole import and degradation (Vid) pathway. In this study, we examined the distribution of FBPase at the ultrastructural level. FBPase was observed in areas close to the plasma membrane and in cytoplasmic structures that are heterogeneous in size and density. We have isolated these intracellular structures that contain FBPase, the Vid vesicle marker Vid24p, and the endosomal marker Pep12p. They appeared irregular in size and shape. In yeast, actin polymerization plays an important role in early steps of endocytosis. Mutants that affect actin polymerization inhibited FBPase degradation, suggesting that actin polymerization is important for FBPase degradation. Both FBPase and malate dehydrogenase 2 were associated with actin patches. Vid vesicle proteins such as Vid24p or Sec28p were also at actin patches, although they dissociated from these structures at later time points. We propose that Vid24p and Sec28p are present at actin patches during glucose starvation. Cargo proteins arrive at these sites following the addition of glucose, and the endocytic vesicles then pinch off from the plasma membrane. Following the fusion of endosomes with the vacuole, cargo proteins are then degraded in the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W2090081233,"The purpose of this work was to obtain information about conformational changes of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-pump (PMCA) in the membrane region upon interaction with Ca(2+), calmodulin (CaM) and acidic phospholipids. To this end, we have quantified labeling of PMCA with the photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine analog [(125)I]TID-PC/16, measuring the shift of conformation E(2) to the auto-inhibited conformation E(1)I and to the activated E(1)A state, titrating the effect of Ca(2+) under different conditions. Using a similar approach, we also determined the CaM-PMCA dissociation constant. The results indicate that the PMCA possesses a high affinity site for Ca(2+) regardless of the presence or absence of activators. Modulation of pump activity is exerted through the C-terminal domain, which induces an apparent auto-inhibited conformation for Ca(2+) transport but does not modify the affinity for Ca(2+) at the transmembrane domain. The C-terminal domain is affected by CaM and CaM-like treatments driving the auto-inhibited conformation E(1)I to the activated E(1)A conformation and thus modulating the transport of Ca(2+). This is reflected in the different apparent constants for Ca(2+) in the absence of CaM (calculated by Ca(2+)-ATPase activity) that sharply contrast with the lack of variation of the affinity for the Ca(2+) site at equilibrium. This is the first time that equilibrium constants for the dissociation of Ca(2+) and CaM ligands from PMCA complexes are measured through the change of transmembrane conformations of the pump. The data further suggest that the transmembrane domain of the PMCA undergoes major rearrangements resulting in altered lipid accessibility upon Ca(2+) binding and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2046596031,"Background Genetic markers for thyroid cancers identified by microarray analysis have offered limited predictive accuracy so far because of the few classes of thyroid lesions usually taken into account. To improve diagnostic relevance, we have simultaneously analyzed microarray data from six public datasets covering a total of 347 thyroid tissue samples representing 12 histological classes of follicular lesions and normal thyroid tissue. Our own dataset, containing about half the thyroid tissue samples, included all categories of thyroid lesions. Methodology/Principal Findings Classifier predictions were strongly affected by similarities between classes and by the number of classes in the training sets. In each dataset, sample prediction was improved by separating the samples into three groups according to class similarities. The cross-validation of differential genes revealed four clusters with functional enrichments. The analysis of six of these genes (APOD, APOE, CLGN, CRABP1, SDHA and TIMP1) in 49 new samples showed consistent gene and protein profiles with the class similarities observed. Focusing on four subclasses of follicular tumor, we explored the diagnostic potential of 12 selected markers (CASP10, CDH16, CLGN, CRABP1, HMGB2, ALPL2, ADAMTS2, CABIN1, ALDH1A3, USP13, NR2F2, KRTHB5) by real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 32 other new samples. The gene expression profiles of follicular tumors were examined with reference to the mutational status of the Pax8-PPARγ, TSHR, GNAS and NRAS genes. Conclusion/Significance We show that diagnostic tools defined on the basis of microarray data are more relevant when a large number of samples and tissue classes are used. Taking into account the relationships between the thyroid tumor pathologies, together with the main biological functions and pathways involved, improved the diagnostic accuracy of the samples. Our approach was particularly relevant for the classification of microfollicular adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W80393959,"Despite the availability of influenza vaccines, influenza virus continues to be a world-wide public health burden. During typical epidemic years, approximately 36,000 people die and 200,000 are hospitalized just in the US due to severe complications associated with influenza virus infections 1. These numbers can dramatically increase in severe pandemic years. One of the most extreme that examples of how damaging influenza can be was the 1918–1919 pandemic. This pandemic, caused by an H1N1 virus, resulted in fifty million deaths, mainly among the adult population, and had devastating consequences for humankind 2.

The new H1N1 virus that is causing the first influenza virus pandemic of this century is clearly less virulent than the 1918 virus. But this pandemic episode has given us sobering lessons on our ability to combat pandemic influenza. First of all, it has reminded us of our inability to predict the specific subtype that will start a new pandemic. While most the attention was given mainly to H5, and to some extent to H7, H9 and H2 viruses as potential new pandemic strains, H1 viruses were under the radar because there was no precedent of an influenza pandemic caused by the same subtype virus circulating in humans. However, the large antigenic differences between the new swine-origin H1N1 virus and the previously circulating human H1N1 viruses, responsible for the limiting pre-existing immunity in humans against swine H1N1 viruses, most likely facilitated the species jump from a pig reservoir to humans 3–5. Moreover, the extended influenza virus surveillance programs in humans allowed us to conclude that the new H1N1 virus started a pandemic with almost no previous period of adaptation to humans, challenging our prospects of producing a vaccine against the new pandemic virus in time to protect the human population. Thus, while a vaccine will soon be available, no vaccination has been possible during the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere, where the new H1N1 virus is prevalent at this time.

During the lagging time needed to produce vaccines, our only weapon against pandemic influenza viruses are antivirals. And even during typical epidemic years, since vaccination does not prevent completely influenza virus infection, antivirals are also critical for the therapeutic treatment of influenza.

Currently, two classes of antivirals have been FDA approved for the treatment of influenza: the M2 channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The first class inhibits the ability of the viral M2 protein to pump protons, a function required for viral uncoating during the first steps of viral entry into the host cell. By contrast, the second class inhibits the enzymatic activity of the viral NA protein, needed for the spread of the newly generated influenza virions by the infected host cell. However, a major concern for the use of these antivirals is the wide-spread resistance of circulating influenza viruses. The majority of the human circulating H3N2 viruses are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, while the human H1N1 viruses of the last season have acquired oseltamivir resistance 6. The new H1N1 pandemic viruses are resistant to the M2 channel blockers, but sensitive to NA inhibitors. However, resistant isolates have already been described and they may become prevalent under selection pressure. Clearly, novel antivirals are needed to efficiently combat influenza viruses.

A potential new target for the development of novel influenza antiviral compounds is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This viral enzyme required for viral RNA replication and transcription has several unique enzymatic properties that make it ideal for the development of specific antivirals. In fact, inhibitors of the influenza polymerase activity have already been described 7, and they have the potential to become new antiviral drugs if proven safe and efficacious in humans. However, one of the hurdles in the rational design of influenza virus RNA polymerase inhibitors has been the lack of detailed structures of its enzymatic domains required for RNA transcription.

The influenza viral RNA polymerase is a heterotrimeric complex composed by three subunits, PB2, PB1 and PA (Fig. 1). During viral mRNA synthesis, the PB1 subunit binds to the promoter of the influenza virus RNA genes formed by the very terminal sequences at the 3’ and 5’ ends of negative sense viral RNAs, while the PB2 subunit binds to 5’ cap structures present in cellular mRNAs. The cellular mRNAs bound to PB2 are subsequently cleaved, generating short capped RNA oligonucleotides that are used as primers for the initiation and elongation of the newly synthesized viral mRNAs. Thus, two enzymatic activities are associated with viral mRNA synthesis by the influenza virus polymerase, an endonuclease that cleaves the cellular mRNAs, a process also referred to as “cap snatching”, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that elongates the capped primers using viral RNAs as templates. The PB1 subunit contains the RNA polymerase domain, and for a long time it was believed that the PB1 subunit was also responsible for the endonuclease activity, while the role of the PA subunit in the heterotrimeric complex was unclear.

New antiviral target



Only recently, crystal structures of some domains of the viral polymerase associated with protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions have been generated, These include the contact domains between the PB1 and PA proteins 8,9 and between the PB1 and PB2 proteins 10, the PB2 cap-binding domain 11 and the nuclear localization signal of PB2 complexed with importin-α5 12. While these complexes represent potential targets for antiviral compounds with the ability to inhibit critical interactions of the viral polymerase, the structure of the whole polymerase complex or of the enzymatic domains of the polymerase will help in the rational design of small molecules that target the active sites of this viral enzyme.

A recent breakthrough was achieved by Yuan et al 13 and Dias et al 14 who independently determined the crystal structure of the first 197 and 209 amino acid residues of the PA subunit, respectively.

Surprisingly, the structure revealed that this domain contains the endonuclease active site of the influenza virus polymerase complex, in contrast to the belief that this activity was located in the PB1 subunit (Fig. 1). The structure also allowed the identification of amino acid residues conserved in all influenza viruses which bind to metal ions and form the endonuclease active site. Mutations at these amino acids abolished the endonuclease activity of the influenza viral polymerase complex.

This information now provides a structural framework for the identification of small molecule compounds that bind to the endonuclease and inhibit this viral enzyme. Such inhibitors are predicted to prevent viral mRNA synthesis and therefore viral replication. Even more recently, Zhao et al 15, following on the previous PA endonuclease structure, conducted a crystallographic analysis of this domain complexed with nucleoside monophosphates. These studies identified a distinct site inside the catalytic center of the enzyme that binds rUMP, rAMP and TMP but not rGMP or rCMP, highlighting then a nucleotide binding pocket for potential inhibition by small molecule compounds.

The rapid pace by which structures of domains of the influenza virus polymerase have recently been resolved also provides hope that the X-ray structure of the whole heterotrimeric complex of the viral RNA polymerase will be determined in the near future. Such a structure will help in the rational design of inhibitors against the different active domains of the viral polymerase.

The use of inhibitors against multiple domains of the influenza virus polymerase in combination with other antiviral therapies should reduce the probabilities of emergence of resistant strains of influenza viruses. Moreover, the identification of cellular factors required for influenza virus replication may also expand the number of potential targets for the development of antiviral compounds. In this respect, ongoing studies using proteomics and siRNA high throughput screening techniques to determine the subset of cellular proteins and pathways that comprise the functional influenza virus interactome is likely to, in the near future, uncover cellular targets for influenza treatment.

Even if new classes of inhibitors that efficiently reduce viral replication are developed, challenges associated with the time for effective intervention against influenza could still remain. The antivirals already in use are only effective if individuals are treated early during infection, most likely because appearance of disease symptoms only precedes by a few days the peak of influenza viral replication. Thus, any effective therapy for influenza virus requires the development of rapid diagnostic techniques in addition to effective and safe antiviral drugs.

In the absence of an effective influenza virus universal vaccine, more reliable and faster diagnostic methods and new antivirals are required to reduce the burden imposed by epidemic and pandemic influenza."

Absorption of a photon by an opsin pigment induces isomerization of its chromophore to all-trans-retinaldehyde. After a brief period of activation, opsin releases all-trans-retinaldehyde and becomes insensitive to light. Restoration of light sensitivity to the apo-opsin involves the conversion of all-trans-retinaldehyde back to 11-cis-retinaldehyde via an enzyme pathway called the visual cycle. The critical isomerization step in this pathway is catalyzed by Rpe65. Rpe65 is strongly associated with membranes but contains no membrane-spanning segments. It was previously suggested that the affinity of Rpe65 for membranes is due to palmitoylation of one or more Cys residues. In this study, we re-examined this hypothesis. By two independent strategies involving mass spectrometry, we show that Rpe65 is not palmitoylated nor does it appear to undergo other post-translational modifications at significant stoichiometry. Instead, we show that Rpe65 binds the acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin, but not phosphatidic acid. No binding of Rpe65 to basic phospholipids or neutral lipids was observed. The affinity of Rpe65 to acidic phospholipids was strongly pH-dependent, suggesting an electrostatic interaction of basic residues in Rpe65 with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups. Binding of Rpe65 to liposomes containing phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol, but not the basic or neutral phospholipids, allowed the enzyme to extract its insoluble substrate, all-trans-retinyl palmitate, from the lipid bilayer for synthesis of 11-cis-retinol. The interaction of Rpe65 with acidic phospholipids is therefore biologically relevant.

https://openalex.org/W2028938084,"A dominant strand of U.S. educational policy for the past two decades has been incorporation of information about student achievement into management and regulation of schools. Although this policy idea is often attributed simply to the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), 44 states already had some form of test-based accountability (TBA) when the NCLB came into existence in 2002. NCLB transformed TBA into a national strategy, placed a clear goal on improvements in student achievement as reflected on certain standardized tests, and established a series of actions and penalties for failure to meet annual improvement goals on those tests (including school closure in the worst cases). More than 70% of the American public favors renewal of federal accountability legislation (1), and performance on similar tests is known to relate to important economic outcomes (2). In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court focused on the importance of outcome accountability in a major school finance decision (3). Thus, TBA has become a fixture of American education. However, it is also clear that the current version could be improved significantly."
