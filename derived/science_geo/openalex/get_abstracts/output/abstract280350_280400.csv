Coadsorption of two omega-hydroxyalkanethiols of different chain lengths n resulted in the formation of a monolayer having a disordered surface region that was markedly less hydrophilic than the homogeneous, hydroxylic surface formed from either pure compound. By controlling the composition of the monolayer, it was also possible to control simultaneously the degree of order in the surface and its hydrophilicity. In the monolayers containing a mixture of alkanethiol components, these components apparently did not phase-segregate into macroscopic islands, but were dispersed on a molecular scale. assistance and many useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2050310350,"Quantitative bulk ferromagnetic behavior has been established for the molecular/organic solid [Fe(III)(C(5)Me(5))(2)].(+)[TCNE].(-). Above 16 K the dominant magnetic interactions are along a 1-D chain and, near T(c), 3-D bulk effects as evidenced by the value of the critical exponents dominate the susceptibility. The extended McConnell model was developed and provides the synthetic chemist with guidance for making new molecular materials to study cooperative magnetic coupling in systems. Assuming the electron-transfer excitation arises from the POMO, ferromagnetic coupling by the McConnell mechanism requires stable radicals (neutral, cations/anions, or ions with small diamagnetic counterions) with a non-half-filled POMO. The lowest excited state formed via virtual charge transfer (retro or forward) must also have the same spin multiplicity and mix with the ground state. These requirements limit the structure of a radical to D(2d) or C>/=(3) symmetry where symmetry breaking distortions do not occur. Intrinsic doubly and triply degenerate orbitals are not necessary and accidental degeneracies suffice. To achieve bulk ferromagnetism, ferromagnetic coupling must be established throughout the solid and a microscopic model has been discussed. These requirements are met by [Fe(III)(C(5)Me(5))(2)].(+)[TCNE].(-). Additionally this model suggests that the Ni(III) and Cr(III) analogs should be antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic, respectively, as preliminary data suggest. Additional studies are necessary to test and further develop the consequences of these concepts. Some molecular/organic solids comprised of linear chains of alternating metallocenium donors (D) and cyanocarbon acceptors (A) with spin state S = 1/2 (...D.(+)A.(-)D.(+)A.(-)...) exhibit cooperative magnetic phenomena, that is, ferro-, antiferro-, ferri-, and metamagnetism. For [Fe(III)(C(5)Me(5))(2)].(+)[TCNE](-). (Me = methyl; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene), bulk ferromagnetic behavior is observed below the Curie temperature of 4.8 K. A model of configuration mixing of the lowest charge-transfer excited state with the ground state was developed to understand the magnetic coupling as a function of electron configuration and direction of charge transfer. This model predicts that ferromagnetic coupling requires stable radicals with a non-half-filled degenerate valence orbital and a charge-transfer excited state with the same spin multiplicity that mixes with the ground state. Ferromagnetic coupling must dominate in all directions to achieve a bulk ferromagnet. Thus, the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are crucial considerations for the design of molecular/organic ferromagnets."

https://openalex.org/W2009661660,"Symbioses between chemoautotrophic bacteria and several specialized marine invertebrates are well documented. However, none of these symbioses have been demonstrated to provide sufficient energy and carbon to the host to enable it to grow. Growth rates of seep mussels collected from hydrocarbon seeps off the coast of Louisiana were measured in a controlled environment where methane was the sole carbon and energy source. The growth rates increased to a maximum of 17.2 micrometers per day in response to methane and approached zero in the absence of methane. These mussels contain methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria in their gills, which suggests that these bacteria provide their hosts with a net carbon flux originating from methane."
https://openalex.org/W2109445638,"'Ain Ghazal, an archeological site located on the outskirts of Amman, Jordan, is one of the largest early villages known in the Near East. The site dates to the Neolithic period, during which mankind made one of its most significant advances, the adoption of domestic plants and animals as primary subsistence sources. Recent excavations at 'Ain Ghazal have augmented considerably current knowledge of several aspects of the Neolithic. Of particular interest has been the documentation of a continuous, or near continuous, occupation from early through late Neolithic components, and a concomitant dramatic economic shift. This shift was from a broad subsistence base relying on a variety of both wild and domestic plants and animals, to an economic strategy reflecting an apparent emphasis on pastoralism."

https://openalex.org/W2112621520,"The nuclear abundances in the helium-burning shells of presupernova stellar models are calculated. For stars of over 20 solar masses the (22)Ne(alpha,n)(23) Mg reaction produces enough neutrons on a sufficiently short time scale for the s-process to produce (59)Fe (half-life = 45 days) and (60)Co (half-life = 5.3 years). These isotopes are expected to survive the passage of the shock, and gamma rays from their decays should be detectable from most galactic type II supernovae with the NASA Gamma Ray Observatory. Because of its great distance and low metallicity, these lines are not expected to be observable from supernova 1987A."
