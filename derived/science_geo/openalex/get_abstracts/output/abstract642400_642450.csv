https://openalex.org/W2982991142,"Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant challenge in perioperative medicine and is related to oxidative programmed cell death. However, the role of ferroptosis, a newly discovered form of oxidative cell death, has not been evaluated widely. Pannexin 1 (PANX1), an ATP-releasing pathway family protein, has pro-apoptotic effects during kidney injury. Here, we demonstrate that PANX1 deletion protects against renal IRI by regulating ferroptotic cell death. Panx1 knockout mice subjected to renal IRI had decreased plasma creatinine, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in kidney tissues, and tubular cell death (visible as decreased TUNEL-positive renal tubular cells) compared with WT mice. In cultured human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells, silenced Panx1 expression significantly attenuated ferroptotic lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation induced by the ferroptosis inducer erastin. Moreover, the Panx1 silencing significantly modulated ferroptosis-related protein expression. Furthermore, Panx1 deletion induced the expression of a cytoprotective chaperone, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and inhibited ferroptinophagy via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In summary, Panx1 deletion protects against renal IRI by attenuating MAPK/ERK activation in a ferroptotic pathway. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of PANX1 in ferroptotic cell death and highlight a potential therapeutic target for the management of acute kidney injury (AKI) during the perioperative period."

To identify relationships between proteins, and thereby enable functional annotation of proteins, we determined changes in abundance of 10,323 human proteins in response to 294 biological perturbations using isotope-labeling mass spectrometry. We applied the machine learning algorithm treeClust to reveal functional associations between co-regulated human proteins from ProteomeHD, a compilation of our own data and datasets from the Proteomics Identifications database. This produced a co-regulation map of the human proteome. Co-regulation was able to capture relationships between proteins that do not physically interact or colocalize. For example, co-regulation of the peroxisomal membrane protein PEX11β with mitochondrial respiration factors led us to discover an organelle interface between peroxisomes and mitochondria in mammalian cells. We also predicted the functions of microproteins that are difficult to study with traditional methods. The co-regulation map can be explored at www.proteomeHD.net ."
https://openalex.org/W2985648358,"The green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using plant extracts is an eco-friendly method. It is a single step and offers several advantages such as time reducing, cost-effective and environmental non-toxic. Silver nanoparticles are a type of Noble metal nanoparticles and it has tremendous applications in the field of diagnostics, therapeutics, antimicrobial activity, anticancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work, the aqueous extracts of aerial parts of Lampranthus coccineus and Malephora lutea F. Aizoaceae were successfully used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The formation of silver nanoparticles was early detected by a color change from pale yellow to reddish-brown color and was further confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX). The TEM analysis of showed spherical nanoparticles with a mean size between 12.86 nm and 28.19 nm and the UV- visible spectroscopy showed λmax of 417 nm, which confirms the presence of nanoparticles. The neuroprotective potential of SNPs was evaluated by assessing the antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Metabolomic profiling was performed on methanolic extracts of L. coccineus and M. lutea and resulted in the identification of 12 compounds, then docking was performed to investigate the possible interaction between the identified compounds and human acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and glutathione transferase receptor, which are associated with the progress of Alzheimer’s disease. Overall our SNPs highlighted its promising potential in terms of anticholinesterase and antioxidant activity as plant-based anti-Alzheimer drug and against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2983727063,"Despite the fact that many important problems (including clustering) can be described using hypergraphs, theoretical foundations as well as practical algorithms using hypergraphs are not well developed yet. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph modularity function that generalizes its well established and widely used graph counterpart measure of how clustered a network is. In order to define it properly, we generalize the Chung-Lu model for graphs to hypergraphs. We then provide the theoretical foundations to search for an optimal solution with respect to our hypergraph modularity function. A simple heuristic algorithm is described and applied to a few illustrative examples. We show that using a strict version of our proposed modularity function often leads to a solution where a smaller number of hyperedges get cut as compared to optimizing modularity of 2-section graph of a hypergraph."
https://openalex.org/W2988151056,"Microalgal biotechnology has gained considerable importance in recent decades. Applications range from simple biomass production for food and animal feed to valuable products for fuel, pharmaceuticals, health, biomolecules and materials relevant to nanotechnology. There are few reports of the exploration of wider microalgae biodiversity in the literature on high value microalgal compounds, however, because it is believed that there is little to be gained in terms of biomass productivity by examining new strains. Still, without diversity, innovation in biotechnology applications is currently limited. Using microalgal diversity is a very promising way to match species and processes for a specific biotechnological application. In this context, three benthic marine diatom strains (Entomoneis paludosa NCC18.2, Nitzschia alexandrina NCC33, and Staurosira sp NCC182) were selected for their lipid production and growth capacities. Using PAM fluorometry and FTIR spectroscopy, this study investigated the impact of nitrogen repletion and depletion as well as light intensity (30, 100, and 400 μmol.photons.m-2.s-1) on their growth, photosynthetic performance and macromolecular content, with the aim of improving the quality of their lipid composition. Results suggest that under high light and nitrogen limitation, the photosynthetic machinery is negatively impacted, leading cells to reduce their growth and accumulate lipids and/or carbohydrates. However, increasing lipid content under stressful conditions does not increase the production of lipids of interest: PUFA, ARA and EPA production decreases. Culture conditions to optimize production of such fatty acids in these three original strains led to a balance between economic and ecophysiological constraints: low light and no nitrogen limitation led to better photosynthetic capacities associated with energy savings, and hence a more profitable approach."

This study aimed at finding out these impacts on cholera infections by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) from 2021 to 2050. Daily data for cholera infection cases in Qom city, which is located in the center of Iran, were analyzed from 1998 to 2016. To determine the best lag time and combination of inputs, Gamma Test (GT) was applied. General circulation model outputs were utilized to project future climate pattern under two scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Statistical downscaling was done to produce high-resolution synthetic time series weather dataset. ANNs were applied for simulating the impact of climate change on cholera. The observed climate variables including maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation were tagged as predictors in ANNs. Cholera cases were considered as the target outcome variable. Projected future (2020–2050) climate in previous step was carried out to assess future cholera incidence. A seasonal trend in cholera infection was seen. Our results elucidated that the best lag time was 21 days. According to the results of downscaling tool, future climate in the study area by 2050 will be warmer and wetter. Simulation of cholera cases indicated that there is a clear trend of increasing cholera cases under the worst scenario (RCP8.5) by the year 2050 and the highest cholera cases observe in warmer months. The precipitation was recognized as the most effective input variable by sensitivity analysis. We observed a significant correlation between low precipitation and cholera infection. There is a strong evidence to show that cholera disease is correlated with environment variables, as low precipitation and high temperatures in warmer months could provide the swifter bacterial replication. These conditions in Iran, especially in the central parts, may raise the cholera infection rates. Furthermore, ANNs is an executive tool to simulate the impact of climate change on cholera to estimate the future trend of cholera incidence for adopting protective measures in endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2988885193,"In female mammals, the majority of primordial follicles (PFs) are physiologically quiescent, and only a few of them are activated and enter the growing follicle pool. Specific molecules, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt (AKT), have been proven to be important for PF activation. However, how the transcription of these genes is regulated is not clear. Although activators of mTOR or AKT have been successfully used to rescue the fertility of patients with premature ovarian insufficiency, the low efficacy and unclear safety profile of these drugs hinder their clinical use in the in vitro activation (IVA) of PFs. Here, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, was demonstrated to activate mouse PFs independent of its deacetylase activity. SIRT1 was prominently expressed in pregranulosa cells (pGCs) and oocytes, and its expression was increased during PF activation. PF activation was achieved by either up-regulating SIRT1 with a specific activator or overexpressing SIRT1. Moreover, SIRT1 knockdown in oocytes or pGCs could significantly suppress PF activation. Further studies demonstrated that SIRT1 enhanced both Akt1 and mTOR expression by acting more as a transcription cofactor, directly binding to the respective gene promoters, than as a deacetylase. Importantly, we explored the potential clinical applications of targeting SIRT1 in IVA via short-term treatment of cultured ovaries from mice and human ovarian tissues to activate PFs by applying the SIRT1 activator resveratrol. RSV-induced IVA could be a candidate strategy to develop more efficient procedures for future clinical treatment of infertility.-Zhang, T., Du, X., Zhao, L., He, M., Lin, L., Guo, C., Zhang, X., Han, J., Yan, H., Huang, K., Sun, G., Yan, L., Zhou, B., Xia, G., Qin, Y., Wang, C. SIRT1 facilitates primordial follicle recruitment independent of deacetylase activity through directly modulating Akt1 and mTOR transcription."

The regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, necessary for sustained visual function, is an endergonic process normally conducted by specialized enzyme systems. However, 11-cis-retinal also can be formed through reverse photoisomerization from all-trans-retinal. A nonvisual opsin known as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-retinal G-protein–coupled receptor (RGR) was previously shown to mediate visual chromophore regeneration in photic conditions, but conflicting results have cast doubt on its role as a photoisomerase. Here, we describe high-level production of 11-cis-retinal from RPE membranes stimulated by illumination at a narrow band of wavelengths. This activity was associated with RGR and enhanced by cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), which binds the 11-cis-retinal produced by RGR and prevents its re-isomerization to all-trans-retinal. The activity was recapitulated with cells heterologously expressing RGR and with purified recombinant RGR. Using an RGR variant, K255A, we confirmed that a Schiff base linkage at Lys-255 is critical for substrate binding and isomerization. Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of the retina and RPE tissue confirmed that RGR is expressed in human and bovine RPE and Müller glia, whereas mouse RGR is expressed in RPE but not in Müller glia. These results provide key insights into the mechanisms of physiological retinoid photoisomerization and suggest a novel mechanism by which RGR, in concert with CRALBP, regenerates the visual chromophore in the RPE under sustained light conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2987701564,"Although numerous studies of diversity have been conducted in cassava, there is no comprehensive assessment of global genetic diversity. Here we draw on previous studies and breeders’ knowledge to select diversity sets from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) genebanks and breeders’ germplasm, as well as elite germplasm and landraces from eastern, southern and central (ESC) Africa to make a global assessment of diversity in cassava, using a SNP based GoldenGate (Illumina Inc.) assay. A synthesis of results from genetic distance and ADMIXTURE analysis essentially revealed four populations (i) South American germplasm characterised by relatively higher genetic diversity with hypothetical ancestral founder genotypes from Brazil, (ii) a smaller group of African introduction germplasm which is more distantly related to all other germplasm, (iii) West Africa germplasm dominated by IITA breeding lines, containing sources of cassava mosaic disease resistance, and IITA genebank accessions from West Africa, both characterised by slightly lower diversity, and (iv) a less cohesive group of African germplasm, termed ‘Other’, with moderate levels of diversity and a majority of germplasm from ESC Africa. This study highlights opportunities for heterosis breeding, purging of duplicates in genebanks and the need for conservation of ESC Africa landraces."
https://openalex.org/W2984356675,"Tropical plant species are expected to have high heat tolerance reflecting phenotypic adjustments to warm regions or their evolutionary adaptation history. However, tropical highland specialists adapted to the colder temperatures found in the highlands, where short and prostrated vegetation decouples plants from ambient conditions, could exhibit different upper thermal limits than those of their lowland counterparts. Here we evaluated leaf heat tolerance of 21 tropical alpine paramo species to determine: 1) whether species with restricted distribution (i.e., highland specialists) have lower heat tolerance and are more vulnerable to warming than species with widespread distribution; 2) whether different growth forms have different heat tolerance; and 3) whether species height (i.e., microhabitat) influences its heat tolerance. We quantified heat tolerance by evaluating T50, which is the temperature that causes a reduction in 50% of initial Fv/Fm values and reflects an irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Additionally, we estimated the thermal safety margins as the difference between T50 and the maximum leaf temperature registered for the species. All species presented high T50 values ranging between 45.4°C and 53.9°C, similar to those found for tropical lowland species. Heat tolerance was not correlated with species distributions or plant height, but showed a strong relationship with growth form, with rosettes having the highest heat tolerance. Thermal safety margins ranged from 12.1 to 31.0°C. High heat tolerance and broad thermal safety margins suggest low vulnerability of paramo species to warming as long as plants are capable of regulating the leaf temperature within this threshold. Whether paramo plants would be able to regulate leaf temperature if drought episodes become more frequent and transpirational cooling is compromised is the next question that needs to be answered."
https://openalex.org/W2984238785,"The goal of this study is to characterize the genomic and immune profiles of metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) and identify the association with survival through an analysis of archived tumor tissue. A next-generation sequencing-based mutational assay (Onco-48) was performed for 21 MpBC patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were captured, including relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD3, CD4, CD8, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was also performed. Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 5 years was 57% (95% CI 0.34-0.75) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 66% (95% CI 0.41-0.82). The most commonly altered genes were TP53 (68.4%, 13/19), PIK3CA (42.1%, 8/19), and PTEN (15.8%, 3/19. For patients with PIK3CA mutations, RFS and OS were significantly worse than for those without (HR 5.6, 95% CI 1.33-23.1 and HR 8.0, 95% CI 1.53-41.7, respectively). Cox regression estimated that PD-L1 expression was associated with worse RFS and OS (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16 and HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.11, respectively, for an absolute increase in PD-L1 expression of 1%). In conclusion, PIK3CA mutation and PD-L1 expression confer poor prognosis in this cohort of patients with MpBC."
https://openalex.org/W2983846497,"Modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are being mass-reared for release in disease control programs around the world. Releases involving female mosquitoes rely on them being able to seek and feed on human hosts. To facilitate the mass-production of mosquitoes for releases, females are often provided blood through artificial membrane feeders. When reared across generations there is a risk that mosquitoes will adapt to feeding on membranes and lose their ability to feed on human hosts. To test adaptation to membrane feeding, we selected replicate populations of Ae. aegypti for feeding on either human arms or membrane feeders for at least 8 generations. Membrane-selected populations suffered fitness costs, likely due to inbreeding depression arising from bottlenecks. Membrane-selected females had higher feeding rates on membranes than human-selected ones, suggesting adaptation to membrane feeding, but they maintained their attraction to host cues and feeding ability on humans despite a lack of selection for these traits. Host-seeking ability in small laboratory cages did not differ between populations selected on the two blood sources, but membrane-selected females were compromised in a semi-field enclosure where host-seeking was tested over a longer distance. Our findings suggest that Ae. aegypti may adapt to feeding on blood provided artificially, but this will not substantially compromise field performance or affect experimental assessments of mosquito fitness. However, large population sizes (thousands of individuals) during mass rearing with membrane feeders should be maintained to avoid bottlenecks which lead to inbreeding depression."

Membrane binding by tBid initiates an ordered series of events culminating in membrane permeabilization by Bax.Cell. 2008; 135 (19062087): 1074-108410.1016/j.cell.2008.11.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Among the multi–BH domain BCL-2 proteins, BAX has some unique properties because of its membrane-associating C-terminal helix (α9). Mutating any of α9’s residues affects membrane association and truncating it by as few as five residues abolishes MOM translocation (17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. Conformation of the Bax C-terminus regulates subcellular location and cell death.EMBO J. 1999; 18 (10228148): 2330-234110.1093/emboj/18.9.2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of BAX shows that α9 is sequestered and folds into the BH3-binding groove where it acts as an autoinhibitor (18Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Structure of Bax: Coregulation of dimer formation and intracellular localization.Cell. 2000; 103 (11106734): 645-65410.1016/S0092-8674(00)00167-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). This is a major inactive conformation of BAX; however, FRET analysis in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells demonstrates that α9 can also be extended when monomeric BAX is still in the cytosol (19Gahl R.F. He Y. Yu S. Tjandra N. Conformational rearrangements in the pro-apoptotic protein, bax, as it inserts into mitochondria: A cellular death switch.J. Biol.

Helix α9 is also directly implicated in BAX’s oligomerization and membrane permeabilization activity. When BAX is translocated to the MOM, the entire protein adopts a completely extended conformation that facilitates intermolecular contacts between BAX proteins at two sites, α9-α9 and BH3-BH3 (19Gahl R.F. He Y. Yu S. Tjandra N. Conformational rearrangements in the pro-apoptotic protein, bax, as it inserts into mitochondria: A cellular death switch.J. Biol.

These observations suggest that BAX’s uniquely regulated BH3-binding groove and C-terminal helix are of great significance for its apoptotic function. The present work was inspired by factors that are naturally produced by the mitochondria to regulate the effects of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 oligomerization on itself. Mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDP) are short proteins encoded by alternate small open reading frames within the region of the mitochondrial genome that is transcribed for the 12S and 16S rRNA subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome (20Chu Q.

A description of HN's specific mechanism of action against BAX currently does not exist, and the present work was conducted to elucidate the molecular interactions between HN and BAX. Here, using a combination of quantitative spectroscopic methods, negative staining EM, and proteolytic digestion we investigated fibril formation and the concomitant sequestration of structurally reorganized BAX. The fibrillation process was rapid and complex. Both molecules are required for significant aggregation to occur, and mature fibrils could be isolated from the reactions. We showed that BAX is structurally part of the fiber lattice after undergoing secondary and tertiary structure conformational changes and that a portion of the protein is protected from digestion by trypsin. We sought to further elucidate the interactions of HN with BAX by observing the effects of BAX mutations on formation of the fibers. Two BAX variants, namely the helix α9 deletion (BAX ΔC) and the S184V mutants, were assessed for their HN fibril formation abilities. BAX with increased helix α9 exposure from the S184V mutation formed fiber more readily than WT. Counterintuitively, the α9 deletion mutation, exposing the major BH3-binding groove, also showed an increase in fiber formation propensity relative to WT BAX, albeit to a lesser degree than the S184V mutant. Taken together, those results allowed us to propose a novel BAX rearrangement mechanism involving both the helix α9 and the major BH3-binding groove upon HN binding, all while exposing the N terminus. Our finding reveals for the first time a novel mechanism for BAX inhibition by sequestration into a stable fibril structure. The interaction between BAX and HN was first interrogated using fluorescence spectroscopy. Scattering of the excitation beam reports on the aggregation propensity of the protein and peptide mixture, whereas the emission spectra provide information on potential conformational changes associated with their interaction. Addition of HN into a solution of BAX causes enhanced light scattering at a wavelength of 280 nm (Fig. 1a). Individual data points are available in Table S1. It is worth noting that this scattering could be observed in a matter of seconds after the peptide was introduced to BAX. Increased scattering was not observed when HN was added into buffer alone or buffer was titrated into BAX. The scattering plot as a function of HN concentration shows significant aggregation formation between HN and BAX that continues to form beyond the equal molar ratio of the two. This hints at an aggregation mechanism that involves a single molecule of BAX and multiple HN peptides. A shift from 340 nm to 332 nm was observed in the maximum fluorescence emission spectra of BAX upon addition of HN, indicating a conformational change in BAX (Fig. S1). EM was used to probe the morphology of these aggregates directly. The aggregates were imaged as fibers and came in two major conformations: Single fibers and bundles (Fig. 1b). The latter contained multiple fibers organized in parallel and appeared to be highly ordered. These fibers were not observed on EM grids prepared from solutions containing BAX or HN alone. The fiber bundles could be separated from single fibers by centrifugation. Separation allowed imaging of the bundled fibers in much greater detail (Fig. 1c). A statistical analysis of single fibers was performed to describe the average fiber dimensions. Images of the fibers were isolated from the background using difference of Gaussian band-pass filtering (32Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C. Saalfeld S. Schmid B. Tinevez J.Y. White D.J. Hartenstein V. Eliceiri K. Tomancak P. Cardona A. Fiji: An open-source platform for biological-image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 (22743772): 676-68210.1038/nmeth.2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (30140) Google Scholar), and their dimensions were measured automatically using the ridge detection plugin for ImageJ/FIJI (33Steger G. An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 1998; 20: 113-12510.1109/34.659930Crossref Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). These fibers showed a relatively narrow distribution in width Fig. S2e), and the length ranged from 10 to 250 nm with a maximum distribution around 40 nm (Fig. S2f). The average bundled fiber, however, is clearly much longer. Conformational changes in BAX upon fibrillation with HN were further probed using circular dichroism (CD) (Fig. 1d). The CD spectrum of BAX alone is representative of α helices with minima at 209 nm and 222 nm. A resuspension of purified fibers produces a CD spectrum with one minimum at 222 nm, characteristic of β-sheet structure (34Micsonai A. Wien F. Kernya L. Lee Y.-H. Goto Y. Réfrégiers M. Kardos J. Accurate secondary structure prediction and fold recognition for circular dichroism spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112 (26038575): E3095-E310310.1073/pnas.1500851112Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that HN induces structural rearrangements in BAX effecting a significant loss of its α-helical structure and formation of β-sheet upon fibrillation. Additionally, the CD spectrum of HN peptide alone is characteristic of disordered protein, demonstrating that the protein and peptide are together required for β-sheet fibrillation. Their interaction instigates mutual conformational changes that result in fibers. To investigate this phenomenon under ionizing conditions, we undertook a salt concentration study. Light scattering titrations in the presence of NaCl revealed a significant increase in the amount of scattered light over the standard reaction conditions (Fig. S3a). Fibers were centrifuge purified as before; however, EM images of fibers purified from a no-salt reaction versus a salt-containing reaction were quite different. The same bundled structures were observed in the reaction with no salt (Fig. S3b). Fibers from the salt-containing reaction produced only short fibers. There was no sign of the bundled structures and some fibers could be seen only loosely associating with each other (Fig. S3c). Taken together, the observation that salt inhibits the formation of parallel bundles but also increases light scattering suggests that the BAX/HN interaction is enhanced by ionic conditions and that interactions between individual fibers might be mediated by electrostatic interactions. The fiber formation kinetics for two HN mutants were evaluated: C8A HN, showing reduced apoptotic inhibition; and S14G HN, exhibiting increased protective properties (35Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Tajima H. Yasukawa T. Sudo H. Ito Y. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Doyu M. Sobue G. Koide T. Tsuji S. Lang J. Kurokawa K. Nishimoto I.

A peptide derived from the BAX-binding domain of viral mitochondria-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA) was used as a control (36Ma J. Edlich F. Bermejo G.A. Norris K.L. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Structural mechanism of Bax inhibition by cytomegalovirus protein vMIA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109 (23213219): 20901-2090610.1073/pnas.1217094110Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There was no statistically relevant variation in the titration scattering profile among the three HN peptides at these concentrations, and vMIA does not cause any increase in light scattering beyond forming a complex with BAX. Both mutants present variation in fiber structure versus the WT (Fig. 2a–f). The C8A mutant has a dense network with branching nodes of globular structures connecting fibers instead of the parallel bundles seen in the WT (Fig. 2c). In addition, the fibers are nonuniform in their diameter and can appear thicker or thinner than the WT (Fig. 2d). The S14G mutant produces similar structure to the WT, but there are fewer parallel bundles (Fig. 2e). The fibers are also generally thicker than WT fibers. Bundled S14G fibers have a smaller diameter than fibers that are unassociated with other fibers. Single fibers could be found with diameters ranging from 15–50 nm (Fig. 2f). No fibril structures were observed in samples containing vMIA (data not shown). It appears that sequence specific interactions between the peptide and BAX are required for fiber formation, and their modification can alter fiber morphologies. To further investigate the role of BAX in fiber formation we used two BAX mutants, namely, BAX ΔC and BAX S184V. These mutations are highlighted on the Bax structure (Fig. 3a). In the first case, helix α9 was deleted (after residue Gln-171) to expose the major BH3-binding groove (18Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Structure of Bax: Coregulation of dimer formation and intracellular localization.Cell. 2000; 103 (11106734): 645-65410.1016/S0092-8674(00)00167-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In the second case, a serine-to-valine substitution in position 184 (a phosphorylation site that regulates MOMP activity) enhances helix α9 hydrophobicity, hence increasing α9 flexibility and MOM association (17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. Conformation of the Bax C-terminus regulates subcellular location and cell death.EMBO J. 1999; 18 (10228148): 2330-234110.1093/emboj/18.9.2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Light scattering experiments were performed by titrations of WT HN peptide into WT BAX and each BAX mutant. Both BAX mutants featured enhanced fiber formation rates over WT BAX (Fig. 3b). The individual data points for this graph are available in Tables S2A–S2C. BAX ΔC only has a slight rate enhancement over WT BAX during the first part of the titration. After an excess amount of peptide has been titrated, this mixture results in comparable scattering to the WT BAX. Conversely, BAX S184V shows a significantly enhanced rate of fibrillation over the WT. It reaches an end point plateau early in the titrations with a scattering value close to the end points for the full WT and ΔC titrations. This indicates that exposure of helix α9 can accelerate fibrillation. Because BAX ΔC does not inhibit fiber formation, in fact, it is comparably better than the WT BAX, this indicates that the helix α9 is not a sole determinant for fiber formation. Exposing the BH3 groove or simply making the protein less stable overall may facilitate fiber formation. To determine whether there is a segment of BAX being incorporated into the fiber core, we performed a trypsin fragmentation assay on the fibers and with BAX alone as a control. After fibrillation was allowed to proceed for 1 h, trypsin was added to the reactions and fragmentation products were analyzed after 2 h of digestion. The total ion chromatogram of a control digestion with BAX alone shows several peaks that could be assigned to six fragments in the N-terminal half of BAX (Fig. 4a and Fig. S5). Fiber samples lose three of those six BAX fragments, the three most C-terminal of them (Fig. 4d). A typical mass spectrum for an unprotected fragment in the BAX control sample is shown (Fig. 4b). An additional peak (no. 12) appears in the fiber digestion that correlates to a fragment spanning residues 10–190 of BAX (Fig. 4, c and d). This is nearly the entire protein minus nine N-terminal and two C-terminal residues. Deconvoluted mass spectra for each peak showing fragment ion masses are available in Fig. S5. A summary of these data relating the observed and theoretical ions to the expected molecular weight is available in Table S3. The full-length HN peptide and five fragments were also detected (Fig. S6). This digestion pattern implies that nearly all of BAX is protected by the fiber to some degree and that some portion of the N terminus remains exposed. However, it isn’t clear from these early digestion experiments what the exact conformation of BAX is within the fibers. The differences in fiber morphology among HN mutants and tryptic digestion patterns of BAX mixed"
https://openalex.org/W2982927831,"Bird-building collisions are the largest source of avian collision mortality in North America. Despite a growing literature on bird-building collisions, little research has been conducted in downtown areas of major cities, and no studies have included stadiums, which can be extremely large, often have extensive glass surfaces and lighting, and therefore may cause many bird collisions. Further, few studies have assessed the role of nighttime lighting in increasing collisions, despite the often-cited importance of this factor, or considered collision correlates for different seasons and bird species. We conducted bird collision monitoring over four migration seasons at 21 buildings, including a large multi-use stadium, in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We used a rigorous survey methodology to quantify among-building variation in collisions and assess how building features (e.g., glass area, lighting, vegetation) influence total collision fatalities, fatalities for separate seasons and species, and numbers of species colliding. Four buildings, including the stadium, caused a high proportion of all collisions and drove positive effects of glass area and amount of surrounding vegetation on most collision variables. Excluding these buildings from analyses resulted in slightly different collision predictors, suggesting that factors leading some buildings to cause high numbers of collisions are not the exact same factors causing variation among more typical buildings. We also found variation in collision correlates between spring and fall migration and among bird species, that factors influencing collision fatalities also influence numbers of species colliding, and that the proportion, and potentially area, of glass lighted at night are associated with collisions. Thus, reducing bird collisions at large buildings, including stadiums, should be achievable by reducing glass area (or treating existing glass), reducing light emission at night, and prioritizing mitigation efforts for glass surfaces near vegetated areas and/or avoiding use of vegetation near glass."
https://openalex.org/W2985101570,"The increased recurrence of Candida albicans infections is associated with greater resistance to antifungal drugs. This involves the establishment of alternative therapeutic protocols, such as probiotic microorganisms whose antifungal potential has already been demonstrated using preclinical models (cell cultures, laboratory animals). Understanding the mechanisms of action of probiotic microorganisms has become a strategic need for the development of new therapeutics for humans. In this study, we investigated the prophylactic anti-C. albicans properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35® using the in vitro Caco-2 cell model and the in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model. In Caco-2 cells, we showed that the strain Lcr35® significantly inhibited the growth (~2 log CFU.mL-1) and adhesion (150 to 6,300 times less) of the pathogen. Moreover, in addition to having a pro-longevity activity in the nematode (+42.9%, p = 3.56.10−6), Lcr35® protects the animal from the fungal infection (+267% of survival, p < 2.10−16) even if the yeast is still detectable in its intestine. At the mechanistic level, we noticed the repression of genes of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway and genes involved in the antifungal response induced by Lcr35®, suggesting that the pathogen no longer appears to be detected by the worm immune system. However, the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, implicated in the longevity and antipathogenic response of C. elegans, is activated by Lcr35®. These results suggest that the probiotic strain acts by stimulating its host via DAF-16 but also by suppressing the virulence of the pathogen."

However, only a limited number of studies have been reported in skeletal muscle mitochondria and were conducted under maximal ADP-stimulated conditions, which do not accurately reflect physiological thermodynamics and thus confound the findings. Additionally, mitochondrial respiratory function is a complex multifaceted process that incorporates mitochondrial dehydrogenases/enzymes, oxygen consumption (JO2), membrane potential, redox status, and ATP production, but studies have traditionally focused on only one or two of these elements limiting their diagnostic potential (3.Gouspillou G. Scheede-Bergdahl C. Spendiff S. Vuda M. Meehan B. Mlynarski H. Archer-Lahlou E. Sgarioto N. Purves-Smith F.M. Konokhova Y. Rak J. Chevalier S. Taivassalo T. Hepple R.T. Jagoe R.T.

Meanwhile, attempts to identify the source of doxorubicin-induced mitochondriopathy have focused on oxidative damage. Although acute treatment with the reducing agent DTT has been shown to attenuate H2O2 emissions, respiratory defects were not mitigated (14.Gilliam L.A.A. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Lin C.-T. Maples J.M. Cathey B.L. Neufer P.D. The anticancer agent doxorubicin disrupts mitochondrial energy metabolism and redox balance in skeletal muscle.Free Radic. Biol.

Thus, the relationship between doxorubicin and loss of skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality remains to be fully understood. The present study was designed to determine the functional impact of acute systemic doxorubicin exposure on skeletal muscle. Measures were conducted 72 h post-treatment to study the initial phase of dysfunction, prior to extensive muscle wasting and oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Fiber type–specific effects were assessed using the predominantly type IIx and IIb, and type I and IIa myofiber containing extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles, respectively. In addition, we employed a novel protocol for the assessment of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake across a physiologically relevant span of free energies of ATP hydrolysis. The study also applied a multiplexed diagnostic assay platform to assess doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction under physiological energetic states, which has not previously been explored. Doxorubicin impaired force production regardless of fiber type, but specific force and half-relaxation defects were unique to the soleus, whereas a decline in fatigue resistance was notable in the EDL. Mitochondria exhibited notable declines in oxygen consumption and membrane potential; together, these are indicative of declining respiratory efficiency. In addition, we found no change to minor hyper-reductions in NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ redox status, as well as similar protein content and dehydrogenase enzyme activities between groups. Together, the present data indicated that doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial damage was largely confined to the electron transport system and was located upstream of ATP synthase, likely spanning complexes I–IV. Mice were administered equal volumes of PBS (n = 8) or doxorubicin (Doxo; n = 9) at a dose of 20 mg/kg body mass and euthanized 72 h postinjection. Consistent with previous reports, Doxo exposure decreased total body mass compared with PBS-treated controls (Fig. 1A; −15.6 ± 1.2%). Reductions in body mass were associated with relatively small changes in absolute EDL and soleus muscle mass, resulting in increases in relative muscle mass (Fig. 1B). However, the individual fiber CSA of the EDL and soleus were unaffected by Doxo treatment (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that decreases in muscle mass did not contribute to Doxo-induced loss of body mass. Muscle fiber type of the EDL and soleus were unaffected by Doxo treatment, indicating that a shift in myofiber type was not responsible for any measured functional decline (Fig. 1E). To determine the impact of Doxo on contractile function, in vitro force production and fatigue protocols were performed using EDL and soleus muscles from PBS- and Doxo-treated mice. Absolute force (mN) production from both EDL and soleus muscles was reduced following Doxo treatment (Fig. 2A). This was accompanied by reductions in specific force (i.e. absolute force normalized to physiological CSA) in Doxo-exposed EDL and soleus muscles (Fig. 2B). Muscle fatigue (percent drop in initial force produced) was reduced by Doxo in EDL but unchanged in soleus muscles (Fig. 2C). Analysis of contractile kinetics revealed that reduced force production in the soleus was associated with a greater half-relaxation time but not in the EDL (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these findings suggest that impairments in contractile function are fiber type–specific and are not dependent on muscle atrophy, following acute systemic Doxo exposure. To address doxorubicin-induced contractile dysfunction, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake rates were measured across a physiologic range of ATP free energies of hydrolysis (ΔGATP) using a creatine kinase (CK) clamp and additions of creatine phosphate (PCr). Importantly, the rate of Ca2+ uptake was greater in the presence of ΔGATP −14.70 versus −12.94 kcal/mol, demonstrating that SERCA-dependent Ca2+ uptake retains responsiveness to ATP free energy in vitro (Fig. 3A). Within group Ca2+ uptake rates also demonstrated significant sensitivity to ΔGATP −14.70 versus −12.94 kcal/mol (Fig. 3, B and C). With respect to Doxo exposure, Ca2+ uptake was depressed in SR isolated from Doxo-treated mice across all energetic states (Fig. 3D). Finally, measures of Fe2+, Fe3+, and total iron (Fe2+ + Fe3+) were similar in gastrocnemius muscles between groups (Fig. 3E). A mitochondrial diagnostics platform was leveraged to unbiasedly assess the impact of Doxo on skeletal muscle bioenergetic fluxes. To perform the assays, mitochondria were isolated from skeletal muscle of PBS- and Doxo-treated mice, and respiratory control was assessed across the same thermodynamic conditions as those used to measure SR–Ca2+ uptake. All assays were done using multiple substrate conditions (P/M, G/M, Pc/M, and R/S), each of which activates a unique set of matrix dehydrogenases and respiratory complexes. Exposure to Doxo lowered mitochondrial JO2, independent of ΔGATP or substrate condition (Fig. 4A). Although not conclusive using respirometry alone, the identical JO2 effects induced by Doxo across multiple substrate conditions argues against bioenergetic lesions being localized to the matrix dehydrogenase network. With the exception of Pc/M, maximal uncoupled JO2, assessed via the addition of FCCP at the end of the ΔGATP titration, remained lower in Doxo exposed mitochondria (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Doxo-mediated respiratory impairments are not caused by lesions in the phosphorylation system (e.g. ATP synthesis, ADP/ATP transport). Interestingly, although absolute respiratory sensitivity (i.e. the linear change in JO2 for a given ΔGATP shift) was generally depressed by Doxo (Fig. 4C), normalization to the starting JO2 eliminated respiratory sensitivity differences for all substrates but R/S (Fig. 4D). Collective analysis of all respirometry data suggests that doxorubicin impairs skeletal muscle bioenergetics via impinging on the respiratory complexes. Parallel measurements of membrane potential (ΔΨm) and NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ redox state were performed to localize Doxo-mediated differences in respiratory control into one of three energy transduction control nodes: 1) ATP synthesis, 2) electron transport system (ETS), and 3) matrix dehydrogenases. Across all substrate conditions, ΔΨm was decreased in Doxo-exposed mitochondria at each ΔGATP (Fig. 4E), as well as following normalization to JO2 (Fig. 4F). In contrast, NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ redox was largely unaffected by Doxo exposure, except for hyper-reduction in the presence of R/S at the lowest ATP free energy (Fig. 4, G and H). Taken together, these data corroborate the respirometry data and suggest that bioenergetic impairments induced by doxorubicin are caused by ETS alterations. Citrate synthase and ATP synthase (CV) activities were unaffected by Doxo exposure, suggesting mitochondrial content (20.Larsen S. Nielsen J. Hansen C.N. Nielsen L.B. Wibrand F. Stride N. Schroder H.D. Boushel R. Helge J.W. Dela F. Hey-Mogensen M. Biomarkers of mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle of healthy young human subjects.J. Physiol. 2012; 590 (22586215): 3349-336010.1113/jphysiol.2012.230185Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) per mitochondrial isolation was similar between PBS and Doxo groups (Fig. 5A). With one exception (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH)), no differences were observed across groups for various NAD(P)-linked dehydrogenases (IDH3), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (αKGDH), branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2), malic enzyme (ME), hydroxyacyl CoA (HADHA)), and GOT2 activity, although there was an upward trend for MDH2 activity in the Doxo group (Fig. 5B). Using isolated mitochondria prepared from PBS- and Doxo-treated mice, blue native PAGE experiments were carried out to quantify the combined content of the mitochondrial supercomplexes I + III2 + IV2, I + III2 + IV1, and I + III2 + IIn, as well as CV. Exposure to Doxo did not alter the skeletal muscle content of either mitochondrial supercomplexes or CV (Fig. 5, C–E). Finally, iron content was similar in mitochondria isolated from PBS- and Doxo-treated mice (Fig. 5F). Mitochondrial JO2 was reduced independent of ΔGATP in soleus permeabilized muscle fiber bundles (PMFBs) energized with G/M but remained unchanged when energized with R/S (Fig. 6, A and B). Respiration rates were unchanged in EDL fiber bundles regardless of substrate condition (Fig. 6, A and B). Together, these data suggest a divergent susceptibility to Doxo-induced mitochondrial defects between EDL and soleus muscle, with the primary deficit localized to complex I of the ETS. Maximal complex IV JO2 was unhindered in the EDL and soleus (Fig. 6C), suggesting no loss of functional complex IV units and that any intrinsic lesions are not sensitive to ΔGATP fluxes outside the physiological range.

In fact, pigs are one of the major animal species used in translational research, surgical models and procedural training due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. To ensure high bioethical standards in animal trials, new directives have been implemented, among others, to refine the procedures and minimize animals’ stress and pain. This paper presents a contactless motion-based approach for monitoring cardiorespiratory signals (heart rate and respiratory rate) in anesthetized pigs using infrared thermography. Heart rate monitoring is estimated by measuring the vibrations (precordial motion) of the chest caused by the heartbeat. Respiratory rate, in turn, is computed by measuring the mechanical chest movements that accompany the respiratory cycle. To test the feasibility of this approach, thermal videos of 17 anesthetized pigs were acquired and analyzed. A high agreement between infrared thermography and a gold standard (electrocardiography and capnography-derived respiratory rate) was achieved. The mean absolute error averaged 3.43 ± 3.05 bpm and 0.27 ± 0.48 breaths/min for heart rate and respiratory rate, respectively. In sum, infrared thermography is capable of assessing cardiorespiratory signals in pigs. Future work should be conducted to evaluate infared thermography capability of capturing information for long term monitoring of research animals in a diverse set of facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2985980598,"Increased carbohydrate consumption increases hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which has been linked to the development of chronic metabolic diseases, including obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a critical lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of two monounsaturated fatty acids, oleate and palmitoleate, from the saturated fatty acids stearate and palmitate, respectively. SCD1-deficient mouse models are protected against diet-induced adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism of this protection by SCD1 deficiency is unclear. Using liver-specific SCD1 knockout (LKO) mice fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, we show that hepatic SCD1 deficiency increases systemic glucose uptake. Hepatic SCD1 deficiency enhanced glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression in the liver and also up-regulated GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in adipose tissue. The enhanced glucose uptake correlated with increased liver expression and elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine known to increase systemic insulin sensitivity and regulate whole-body lipid metabolism. Feeding LKO mice a triolein-supplemented but not tristearin-supplemented high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet reduced FGF21 expression and plasma levels. Consistently, SCD1 inhibition in primary hepatocytes induced FGF21 expression, which was repressed by treatment with oleate but not palmitoleate. Moreover, deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) reduced hepatic and plasma FGF21 and white adipocyte tissue-specific GLUT4 expression and raised plasma glucose levels in LKO mice. These results suggest that hepatic oleate regulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue either directly or partially by modulating the hepatic PGC-1α–FGF21 axis."

However, precise roles of CEP290 in photoreceptors and pathomechanisms of retinal degeneration in CEP290-associated ciliopathies are not sufficiently understood. Using conditional Cep290 mutant mice, in which the C-terminal myosin-tail homology domain of CEP290 is disrupted after the connecting cilium is assembled, we show that this domain is essential for protein confinement between the inner and the outer segments. Upon disruption of the myosin-tail homology domain, inner segment plasma membrane proteins, including syntaxin 3 (STX3), synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), and interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2 (IMPG2), rapidly accumulated in the outer segment. In contrast, localization of endomembrane proteins was not altered. Trafficking and confinement of most outer segment-resident proteins appeared to be unaffected or only minimally affected in Cep290 mutant mice. One notable exception was rhodopsin (RHO), which severely mislocalized to inner segments during the initial stage of degeneration. Similar mislocalization phenotypes were observed in Cep290rd16 mice. These results suggest that a failure of protein confinement at the connecting cilium and consequent accumulation of inner segment membrane proteins in the outer segment, along with insufficient RHO delivery, is part of the disease mechanisms that cause retinal degeneration in CEP290-associated ciliopathies. Our study provides insights into the pathomechanisms of retinal degenerations associated with compromised ciliary gates."
https://openalex.org/W2984968210,"Coloration is one of the most recognizable characteristics in chickens, and clarifying the coloration mechanisms will help us understand feather color formation. ""Yufen I"" is a commercial egg-laying chicken breed in China that was developed by a three-line cross using lines H, N and D. Columbian plumage is a typical feather character of the ""Yufen I"" H line. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the pigmentation of Columbian plumage, this study utilizes high-throughput sequencing technology to compare the transcriptome and proteome differences in the follicular tissue of different feathers, including the dorsal neck with black and white striped feather follicles (Group A) and the ventral neck with white feather follicles (Group B) in the ""Yufen I"" H line.In this study, we identified a total of 21,306 genes and 5,203 proteins in chicken feather follicles. Among these, 209 genes and 382 proteins were differentially expressed in two locations, Group A and Group B, respectively. A total of 8 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 9 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found to be involved in the melanogenesis pathway. Additionally, a specifically expressed MED23 gene and a differentially expressed GNAQ protein were involved in melanin synthesis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis mapped 190 DEGs and 322 DEPs to 175 and 242 pathways, respectively, and there were 166 pathways correlated with both DEGs and DEPs. 49 DEPs/DEGs overlapped and were enriched for 12 pathways. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that the following pathways were activated: melanogenesis, cardiomyocyte adrenergic, calcium and cGMP-PKG. The expression of DEGs was validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) that produced results similar to those from RNA-seq. In addition, we found that the expression of the MED23, FZD10, WNT7B and WNT11 genes peaked at approximately 8 weeks in the ""Yufen I"" H line, which is consistent with the molting cycle. As both groups showed significant differences in terms of the expression of the studied genes, this work opens up avenues for research in the future to assess their exact function in determining plumage color.Common DEGs and DEPs were enriched in the melanogenesis pathway. MED23 and GNAQ were also reported to play a crucial role in melanin synthesis. In addition, this study is the first to reveal gene and protein variations in in the ""Yufen I"" H line during Columbian feather color development and to discover principal genes and proteins that will aid in functional genomics studies in the future. The results of the present study provide a significant conceptual basis for the future breeding schemes with the ""Yufen I"" H line and provide a basis for research on the mechanisms of feather pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2986017531,"People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) are at high risk of developing non-HIV related comorbidities, particularly at older ages. In a retrospective claims database analysis, we compared PLHIV to a matched, non-HIV cohort to assess the prevalence of comorbidities and healthcare costs in PLHIV and the general non-HIV population in Germany. In total, 2,132 adult patients with HIV were identified in the InGef research database with HIV ICD-10 diagnosis within each year from 2011 to 2014. Of these, 1,969 could be matched to a control cohort of 3,938 individuals (1:2 ratio). Matching criteria included age, gender and socio-economic variables. The prevalence of acute renal disease (0.5% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.045), bone fractures due to osteoporosis (6.4% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001), chronic renal disease (4.3% vs. 2.4%, p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (12.8% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.006), Hepatitis B (5.9% vs. 0.3%, p<0.001) and Hepatitis C infection (8.8% vs. 0.3%, p<0.001) was significantly higher in PLHIV compared to the matched non-HIV cohort. Mean costs excluding costs for antiretroviral therapy (ART) were significantly higher in the HIV cohort (8,049€ vs. 3,658€, p<0.05). On average, PLHIV incurred excess costs of 16,441€ for ART, 2,747€ for pharmaceuticals excluding ART (p<0.05), 1,441€ for outpatient care (p<0.05) and 321€ for inpatient care (p<0.05). Devices and remedies’ costs were significantly higher in the control cohort with excess costs of 113€ (p<0.05). Considering mean total costs, excluding ART, excess costs for PLHIV amounted to 8,049€ (p<0.05). This analysis demonstrated an increased comorbidity and economic burden of PLHIV compared to matched controls. Our findings suggest that HIV remains an area of high unmet medical need. To improve patient outcomes, adequate HIV management including regular monitoring, screening for comorbidities and optimal ART selection throughout the life course of PLHIV are of key importance."
https://openalex.org/W2987132567,"Apple scab caused by Venturia inaequalis Cooke (Wint.) is one the important diseases of trade and industrial significance in apple. In present study variability studies in pathogen isolates were studied, which is one of the most important factors for devising management studies of scab disease in apple. Genetic diversity of 30 Venturia inaequalis isolates from 12 districts of two geographical distinct regions of Jammu and Kashmir was calculated based on the allele frequencies of 28 SSR markers and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA. The ITS based characterized sequences were submitted to NCBI GenBank and accession numbers were sanctioned. Dendrogram showed that all the accessions formed 2 main clusters with various degree of sub clustering within the clusters. Analysis based on SSR study reveals that the heterozygosity ranged from 0.0 and 0.5, with an average value of 0.39. The expected heterozygosis or gene diversity (He) ranged from 0.0 to 0.50 with an average of 0.40. The Fst value ranges from 0 to 0.6 with an average of 0.194. Diversity within each population (HS) values ranging from 0.26 to 0.33. Average differentiation among populations (GST) was 0.11 and populations were isolated by significant distance (r 2 = 0.50, P < 0.01). From the AMOVA analysis, 25% of variation was observed among population, 9% among individuals and 66% within individuals observed in the population. Structure analysis grouped isolates into two populations. Principle coordinate analysis explained variation of 36.6% in population 1, 14.30% in population 2 and 13.10% in population 3(Admixture) with 64.07% as overall cumulative percentage of variation. This indicates that extensive short-distance gene flow occurs in Kashmir region that dispersal over longer distances also appears to occur frequently enough to prevent differentiation due to genetic drift. Also it is evident that Jammu and Kashmir most likely has V. inaequalis subpopulations linked to diverse climatic conditions of the Jammu region compared to the mountainous inland Kashmir region. The results of present study would help to understand the genetic diversity of V. inaequalis from Jammu and Kashmir that would lead in the development of more effective management strategies and development of new resistant cultivars through marker-assisted selection."
https://openalex.org/W2983762285,"Background Vancomycin is a commonly used antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-positive organisms, but prolonged use and high doses can lead to toxicity. While vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is widely reported, few cases of ototoxicity have been described. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of negative changes in audiograms in patients receiving long-term intravenous (IV) vancomycin and to identify high-risk patients who need audiogram monitoring. Methods This was an IRB approved, cross-sectional study performed at an academic medical center from 1/2012-3/2019. Patients who were prescribed IV vancomycin for ≥ 14 days and had baseline and follow-up weekly audiometry were included. All data was extracted from the electronic medical record. The primary endpoint was worsening audiogram while on vancomycin. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to describe the patient population. Results 424 patients were screened for inclusion; 92 received at least two audiograms while on vancomycin. Fifty-three percent of patients were men, the median (IQR) patient age was 44 (34–58) years, and 8% of patients had an estimated Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min or received hemodialysis. The median (IQR) vancomycin exposure up until the last recorded audiogram was 30 (17–42) days. Vancomycin indications were: 53 (58%) bone and joint infections, 17 (18%) infective endocarditis, 10 (11%) bacteremia, 12 (13%) other infections. Seven (8%) patients experienced a worsening change in hearing from baseline, two (2%) of them suffered mild loss, two (2%) had mild to moderate loss, and three (3%) developed moderate-to-severe hearing loss. In bivariate analyses, no variables were found to be associated with a worsening change in audiogram, including baseline abnormal audiogram, age ≥ 40 years, elevated serum vancomycin levels, or vancomycin doses ≥ 4 grams/day. Conclusions The prevalence of negative changes in audiograms among patients receiving long-term intravenous vancomycin was low. The utility of routine audiogram testing in this population remains questionable except in high-risk patients; however, larger prospective studies with controls may be warranted to further explore the risk of ototoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2983520850,"Introduction Self-care has been shown to improve clinical outcome of hypertension. Gauging the level of self-care among patients with hypertension enables the design of their personalized care plans. This study aimed to determine the self-care profiles and its determinants among patients with hypertension in the Malaysian primary care setting. Methods This was a cross sectional study conducted between 1 October 2016–30 April 2017 in three primary care clinics in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. All adults aged 18 years and above with hypertension for at least 6 months were recruited with a systematic random sampling of 1:2 ratio. The participants were assisted in the administration of the structured questionnaire, which included socio-demographic information, medical information and the Hypertension Self-Care Profile (HTN SCP) tool. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 20.0. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the determinants for self-care. Results The mean age of the participants was 59.5 (SD10.2) years old. There were more women (52.5%) and most were Malays (44.0%) follow by Chinese (34%) and Indians (21%). Majority (84.2%) had secondary or primary school level of education. A third (30.7%) had a family history of hypertension. The mean total HTN-SCP score was 124.2 (SD 22.8) out of 180. The significant determinants that influenced the HTN-SCP scores included being men (B-4.5, P-value0.008), Chinese ethnicity (B-14.7, P-value<0.001), primary level education/no formal school education level (B-15.7, P-value<0.001), secondary level education (B-9.2, P-value<0.001) and family history of hypertension (B 4.4, P-value 0.014). Conclusions The overall hypertension self-care profile among patients in this multi-ethnic country was moderate. Being men, Chinese, lower education level and without family history of hypertension were associated with lower hypertension self-care profile score. Healthcare intervention programmes to address self-care should target this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2983360864,"In order to understand the influence of unloading on the mechanical properties of shale rock, triaxial unloading tests under different stress paths were conducted. In this paper, three types of tests are completed, including: 1) Conventional triaxial compression test;2) Pre-peak constant maximum principal stress-unloading confining pressure test with different initial confining pressures and rates;3) Increasing axial stress-unloading confining pressure test. The deformation and rupture modes characteristics of shale sample under different unloading stress paths were obtained. Research results show that: 1) The confining pressure effect is obvious and the peak strength increases with the increase of initial confining pressure, under conventional triaxial compression test, the samples show obvious elastic-plastic characteristics; Under unloading confining pressure test, it shows obvious elastic brittleness characteristics.2) Compared with conventional triaxial compression test, unloading confining pressure is more prone to deformation and rupture, and the damage is more serious. Under same initial stress level, the brittle characteristics in unloading confining pressure are more obvious and the expansion is more intense. 3) Under same unloading stress path, the higher the initial confining pressure is, the more severe the sample failure is. With the increase of unloading rate, the rupture degree of the sample becomes more complex.4) The brittle rupture characteristic increases with the increase of unloading rate and initial confining pressure. Increasing axial stress-unloading confining pressure, various types of tensile and shear fractures with different mechanisms are well developed. These conclusions reveal loading and unloading mechanical properties of gas-bearing shale under different stress paths; it provides theoretical basis for horizontal drilling, fracturing design and long-term fracturing effect analysis of shale gas reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2984967579,"Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) regulate the activity of various downstream kinases through serine or threonine or tyrosine dephosphorylation. Loss of function and aberrant expression of DUSPs has been implicated in cancer progression and poor survival, yet the function of DUSP22 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells is not clear. Gene Expression Omnibus and cBioPortal microarray database analyses showed that DUSP22 expression was lower in PCa tissues than normal prostate tissues, and altered DUSP22 expression was associated with shorter progression-free and disease-free survival of patients with PCa. Exogenous DUSP22 expression in LNCaP, PC3, and C4-2B PCa cells inhibited cellular proliferation and colony formation, supporting a growth inhibitory role for DUSP22 in PCa cells. DUSP22 expression significantly attenuated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and its downstream ERK1/2 signaling by dephosphorylation. However, DUSP22 failed to suppress the growth of CWR22Rv1 and DU145 cells with elevated phosphorylated (p-)ERK1/2 levels. A serine-to-alanine mutation at position 58, a potential ERK1/2-targeted phosphorylation site in DUSP22, was sufficient to suppress growth of CWR22Rv1 cells with elevated p-ERK1/2 levels, suggesting a mutually antagonistic relationship between DUSP22 and ERK1/2 dependent on phosphorylation status. We showed that DUSP22 can suppress prostate-specific antigen gene expression through phosphatase-dependent pathways, suggesting that DUSP22 is an important regulator of the androgen receptor (AR) in PCa cells. Mechanistically, DUSP22 can interact with AR as a regulatory partner and interfere with EGF-induced AR phosphorylation at Tyr534, suggesting that DUSP22 serves as a crucial suppressor of both EGFR and AR-dependent signaling in PCa cells via dephosphorylation. Our findings indicate that loss of function of DUSP22 in PCa cells leads to aberrant activation of both EGFR-ERKs and AR signaling and ultimately progression of PCa, supporting the potential for novel therapeutic design of harnessing DUSP22 in the treatment of PCa.-Lin, H.-P., Ho, H.-M., Chang, C.-W., Yeh, S.-D., Su, Y.-W., Tan, T.-H., Lin, W.-J.

https://openalex.org/W2984992553,"In recent years, vaccines against tumor antigens have shown potential for combating invasive cancers, including primary tumors and metastatic lesions. This is particularly pertinent for breast cancer, which is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in women. MUC1 is a glycoprotein that is normally expressed on glandular epithelium, but is overexpressed and under-glycosylated in most human cancers, including the majority of breast cancers. This under-glycosylation exposes the MUC1 protein core on the tumor-associated form of the protein. We have previously shown that a vaccine consisting of MUC1 core peptides stimulates a tumor-specific immune response. However, this immune response is dampened by the immunosuppressive microenvironment within breast tumors. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of MUC1 vaccination in combination with four different drugs that inhibit different components of the COX pathway: indomethacin (COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor), celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor), 1-methyl tryptophan (indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase inhibitor), and AH6809 (prostaglandin E2 receptor antagonist). These treatment regimens were explored for the treatment of orthotopic MUC1-expressing breast tumors in mice transgenic for human MUC1. We found that the combination of vaccine and indomethacin resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden. Indomethacin did not increase tumor-specific immune responses over vaccine alone, but rather appeared to reduce the proliferation and increase apoptosis of tumor cells, thus rendering them susceptible to immune cell killing."

Design A prospective longitudinal study with a cohort of 88 moderate-to-late preterm and 83 full term born Dutch children, followed from 18 months to 6 years of age. Orienting, alerting and executive attention skills were assessed at 18 months (corrected for prematurity), and cognitive, motor and language skills (Bayley-III-NL) at 24 months (corrected for prematurity). At 6 years (corrected for prematurity), cognitive (indices of IQ; WPPSI-III-NL) and behavioural functioning (CBCL/6-18) were assessed. Group differences and potential predictors were examined with MANCOVAs and hierarchical regression analyses. Results At 6 years, moderate-to-late preterm born children performed poorer than full term born children on cognitive processing speed, and they showed more behavioural attention problems. Attention problems at 6 years were predicted by poorer orienting attention skills at 18 months, while lower performance IQ was predicted by poorer alerting attention skills at 18 months. Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ at 6 years were predicted by language skills at 24 months. Moderate-to-late preterm and full term born children showed some differing correlational patterns in the associations between early skills and later functioning, although in further analyses predictors appeared the same for both groups. Conclusions Moderate-to-late preterm born children show specific vulnerabilities at primary school-age, particularly in cognitive processing speed and behavioural attention problems. Cognitive and behavioural functioning at 6 years can be predicted by differentiated attention skills at 18 months and language skills at 24 months."

We investigated these mechanisms and their specificity in distinct cell types by means of an interactome-based analysis of expression data.Genes associated to the diseases were identified using data mining approaches, and their multimorbidity mechanisms in distinct cell types were characterized by means of an in silico analysis of the topology of the human interactome.We characterized specific pathomechanisms for multimorbidities between asthma, dermatitis and rhinitis for distinct emergent non-eosinophilic cell types. We observed differential roles for cytokine signaling, TLR-mediated signaling and metabolic pathways for multimorbidities across distinct cell types. Furthermore, we also identified individual genes potentially associated to multimorbidity mechanisms.Our results support the existence of differentiated multimorbidity mechanisms between asthma, dermatitis and rhinitis at cell type level, as well as mechanisms common to distinct cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2986642110,"Ribosome biogenesis is critical for proliferating cells and requires the coordinated activities of three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. We recently showed that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system controls the global level of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)–controlled transcription in mammalian cells by regulating cyclin-dependent kinase 9 activity. Here, we present evidence that the SUMO system also plays a critical role in the control of Pol I transcription. Using an siRNA-based knockdown approach, we found that multiple SUMO E3 ligases of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family are involved in SUMO-mediated repression of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription. We demonstrate that endogenous SUMO represses rDNA transcription primarily by repressing upstream-binding factor and proto-oncogene c-Myc expression and that ectopic overexpression of SUMO-associated enzymes additionally represses rDNA transcription via c-Myc SUMOylation and its subsequent degradation. The results of our study reveal a critical role of SUMOylation in the control of rDNA transcription, uncover the underlying mechanisms involved, and indicate that the SUMO system coordinates Pol I– and Pol II–mediated transcription in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2988123021,"Studies in animal models have suggested that hepatic steatosis impacts on portal pressure, potentially by inducing liver sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction and thereby increasing intrahepatic resistance. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the impact of hepatic steatosis on hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in patients with chronic liver disease.261 patients undergoing simultaneous HVPG measurements and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)-based steatosis assessment were included in this retrospective study.The majority of patients had cirrhosis (n = 205; 78.5%) and n = 191 (73.2%) had clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; HVPG≥10mmHg). Hepatic steatosis (S1/2/3; CAP ≥248dB/m) was present in n = 102 (39.1%). Overall, HVPG was comparable between patients with vs. without hepatic steatosis (15.5±7.5 vs. 14.8±7.7mmHg; p = 0.465). Neither in patients with HVPG (<6mmHg; p = 0.371) nor in patients with mild portal hypertension (HVPG 6-9mmHg; p = 0.716) or CSPH (HVPG≥10mmHg; p = 0.311) any correlation between CAP and HVPG was found. Interestingly, in patients with liver fibrosis F2/3, there was a negative correlation between CAP and HVPG (Pearson's ρ:-0.522; p≤0.001). In multivariate analysis, higher CAP was an independent 'protective' factor for the presence of CSPH (odds ratio [OR] per 10dB/m: 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.85-1.00; p = 0.045), while liver stiffness was associated with the presence of CSPH (OR per kPa: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.17-1.36; p≤0.001). In 78 patients, in whom liver biopsy was performed, HVPG was neither correlated with percentage of histological steatosis (p = 0.714) nor with histological steatosis grade (p = 0.957).Hepatic steatosis, as assessed by CAP and liver histology, did not impact on HVPG in our cohort comprising a high proportion of patients with advanced chronic liver disease. However, high CAP values (i.e. pronounced hepatic steatosis) might lead to overestimation of liver fibrosis by 'artificially' increasing transient elastography-based liver stiffness measurements."

Diabetic complication is related with structural and functional changes of brain. Studies investigated that homocysteine as an independent risk factor of several organ complications. This marker might have a role in pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in T2DM patients. We aimed to know the association between serum homocysteine level and cognitive impairment in middle-aged T2DM populations. The study was a cross-sectional study involving 97 T2DM patients aged <60 years old. Cognitive assessment was based on validated Indonesian version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-INA) test. Besides, serum homocysteine level (Hcy) was measured based on standard laboratory assay. Filling out the questionnaire of MoCA-INA was conducted when patients came to take the blood sample. This study used independent t-test, chi-square and multivariate logistic regression model to analyze the data. There were 47 subjects (48.5%) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Delayed recall was the most impaired domain (94.8%). There was no significant mean difference of serum Hcy level in MCI and non-MCI group (11.99±3.27 μmol/L vs 12.36±4.07 μmol/L respectively, p = 0.62). Final model of logistic regression showed no association between serum Hcy and cognitive function after adjusting confounding variables (OR: 1.778; 95%CI: 0.69-4.54). Further investigation involving slight elderly T2DM patients with larger sample size should be conducted to confirm this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2989273496,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is characterised by hyperglycemia due to the incidence of insulin resistance. Testosterone supplementation has been shown to have a positive co-relation with improved glycemic control in T2DM males. Clinical studies have reported that Androgen Replacement Therapy (ART) to hypogonadic males with T2DM resulted in improved glycemic control and metabolic parameters, but, these studies did not address in detail how testosterone acted on the key glucose homeostatic organs.In this study, we delineate the effect of testosterone supplementation to high-fat diet (HFD) induced T2DM in male C57BL6J mice and the effect of testosterone supplementation on the skeletal muscle insulin responsiveness. We also studied the effect of testosterone on the insulin signaling pathway proteins in C2C12 myocyte cells to validate the in vivo findings.We found that testosterone had a potentiating effect on the skeletal muscle insulin signaling pathway to improve glycaemic control. We demonstrate that, in males, testosterone improves skeletal muscle insulin responsiveness by potentiating the PI3K-AKT pathway. The testosterone treated animals showed significant increase in the skeletal muscle Insulin Receptor (IR), p85 subunit of PI3K, P-GSK3α (Ser-21), and P-AKT (Ser-473) levels as compared to the control animals; but there was no significant change in total AKT and GSK3α. Testosterone supplementation inhibited GSK3α in the myocytes in a PI3K/AKT pathway dependent manner; on the other hand GSK3β gene expression was reduced in the skeletal muscle upon testosterone supplementation.Testosterone increases insulin responsiveness by potentiating insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle cells, which is in contrast to the increased insulin resistance in the liver of testosterone treated T2DM male animals."
https://openalex.org/W2984517971,"Contamination control and removal are very important technical aspects of microbiological research. Bacterial contamination is very common in fungal cultures. Currently, the commonly used approach for inhibiting bacteria is antibiotic treatment; however, there are drawbacks to using antibiotics, including incomplete removal, limited antibacterial spectra, tendency toward recontamination, effects to fungal strains, and potential risks to the environment. Therefore, in the present work, we developed a new method for bacterial removal from fungi cultured on solid medium, the Cabin-Sequestering (CS) method, based on the different culture characteristics between fungi and bacteria. First, 3–5 mm round or square holes (the “cabin”) are excavated on a solid medium plate. The fungal strain containing possible bacterial contamination is inoculated into the cabin. The cabin is then covered with a sterilized coverslip, followed by incubation at the appropriate temperature. After 7–10 days of culturing, fungal hyphae grow out along the edge of the coverslip; however, the contaminating bacteria cannot pass through the space formed between the medium and the coverslip and, thus, remain in the cabin. The newly grown fungal hyphae around the coverslip are re-inoculated into fresh culture plates, where they form bacteria-free fungal colonies. The CS method is easy handling, with a short experimental cycle and rare recontamination. When necessary, it can also be used in combination with antibiotics in bacterial removal operations."
https://openalex.org/W2986236287,"Background Most parents with young children pay routine visits to Well-Baby Clinics, or so-called Preventive Child Health Care (PCHC) services. This offers a unique opportunity to promote and deliver interconception care. This study aimed to integrate such care and perform an implementation evaluation. Methods In seven Dutch municipalities, PCHC professionals were instructed to discuss the possibility of an interconception care consultation during each routine six-months well-baby visit. The primary outcome of this study was coverage of the intervention, quantified as the proportion of visits during which women were informed about interconception care. Secondary outcomes included adoption, fidelity, feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention, studied by surveying PCHC professionals and women considering becoming pregnant. Results The possibility of interconception care was discussed during 29% (n = 1,849) of all visits, and 60% of the PCHC physicians adopted the promotion of interconception care by regularly informing women. About half of the PCHC professionals and most women judged integration of interconception care in PCHC appropriate and acceptable. Estimated feasibility was poor, since 13% of the professionals judged future integration in daily practice as probable. The uptake of interconception care consultations was low (n = 4 consultations). Conclusions Promotion of interconception care was achieved in approximately one-third of the routine PCHC consultations and appeared promising with regards to adoption, appropriateness and acceptability. However, concerns on feasibility and uptake of interconception care consultations in daily practice remain. Suggestions for improvement may include further integration of interconception care health promotion in routine PCHC consultations, while allocating sufficient resources."

The second objective was to explore whether relationships between predictors and never having a mammogram varied across the three groups (moderation effects of ethnicity). Methods Merged (2005-2007-2009-2011) California Health Interview Survey data were utilized. Unweighted sample was 3,710 Asian women ages 40 years and older (Chinese = 1,389; Vietnamese = 1,094; Korean = 1,227). Replicate weighted total sample size was 1,710,233 (Chinese = 940,000; Vietnamese = 410,000; Korean = 360,000). Replicate-weighted multivariate logistic regression was applied. Interaction effects (moderator role of ethnicity) were also examined, using multivariate logistic regression, for the second objective. Results For the first objective, odds of never having a mammogram were higher for women who were Korean (Ref = Vietnamese), unmarried, or a non-U.S. citizen. Odds were lower in women ages 50–59 or 60–69 (Ref = 70–85). Regarding the second objective, only for Chinese women, odds of never having a mammogram were lower as the number of physician visits got higher. Conclusion Culturally-sensitive outreach and services should be developed to target higher-risk groups. Patient-centered healthcare strategies tailored for the three groups could be effective. For Chinese women, in particular, regular information sessions or education programs could be provided for enhancing their physician visits."

The present study conducts a traditional contrast sensitivity task for face images of various facial expressions. Findings show that visual contrast thresholds do not differ for different facial expressions We re-conduct analysis of faces’ effective contrast, using the procedure developed by Hedger, Adams and Garner, and show that higher effective contrast in fearful face expressions relies on face images first being normalised for RMS contrast. When not normalised for RMS contrast, effective contrast in fear expressions is no different, or sometimes even lower, compared to other expressions. However, the effect of facial expression on detection in a backward masking study did not depend on the type of contrast normalisation used. These findings are discussed in relation to the implications of contrast normalisation on the salience of face expressions in behavioural and neurophysiological experiments, and also the extent that natural physical differences between facial stimuli are masked during stimulus standardisation and normalisation."
https://openalex.org/W2983006429,"The ability of model animal species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, to adapt quickly to various adverse conditions has been shown in many experimental evolution studies. It is usually assumed by default that such adaptation is due to changes in the gene pool of the studied population of macroorganisms. At the same time, it is known that microbiome can influence biological processes in macroorganisms. In order to assess the possible impact of microbiome on adaptation, we performed an evolutionary experiment in which some D. melanogaster lines were reared on a food substrate with high NaCl concentration while the others were reared on the standard (favourable) substrate. We evaluated the reproductive efficiency of experimental lines on the high salt substrate three years after the experiment started. Our tests confirmed that the lines reared on the salty substrate became more tolerant to high NaCl concentration. Moreover, we found that pre-inoculation of the high salt medium with homogenized salt-tolerant flies tended to improve reproductive efficiency of naïve flies on this medium (compared to pre-inoculation with homogenized control flies). The analysis of yeast microbiome in fly homogenates revealed significant differences in number and species richness of yeasts between salt-tolerant and control lines. We also found that some individual yeast lines extracted from the salt-tolerant flies improved reproductive efficiency of naïve flies on salty substrate (compared to baker's yeast and no yeast controls), whereas the effect of the yeast lines extracted from the control flies tended to be smaller. The yeast Starmerella bacillaris extracted from the salt-tolerant flies showed the strongest positive effect. This yeast is abundant in all salt-tolerant lines, and very rare or absent in all control lines. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that some components of the yeast microbiome of D. melanogaster contribute to to flies' tolerance to food substrate with high NaCl concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2985696279,"Preventive treatments for dementia are warranted. Here we show that utilization of certain combinations of prescription medications and supplements correlates with reduced rates of cognitive decline. More than 1,900 FDA-approved agents and supplements were collapsed into 53 mechanism-based groups and traced in electronic medical records (EMRs) for >50,000 patients. These mechanistic groups were aligned with the data presented in more than 300 clinical trials, then regression model was built to fit the signals from EMRs to clinical trial performance. While EMR signals of each single agents correlated with clinical performance relatively weakly, the signals produced by combinations of active compounds were highly correlated with the clinical trial performance (R = 0.93, p = 3.8 x10^-8). Higher ranking pharmacological modalities were traced in patient profiles as their combinations, producing protective complexity estimates reflecting degrees of exposure to beneficial polypharmacy. For each age strata, the higher was the protective complexity score, the lower was the prevalence of dementia, with maximized life-long effects for the highest regression score /diversity compositions. The connection was less strong in individuals already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Confounder analysis confirmed an independent effect of protective complexity in multivariate context. A sub-cohort with lifelong odds of dementia decreased > 5-folds was identified; this sub-cohort should be studied in further details, including controlled clinical trials. In short, our study systematically explored combinatorial preventive treatment regimens for age-associated multi-morbidity, with an emphasis on neurodegeneration, and provided extensive evidence for their feasibility."
https://openalex.org/W2986313602,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen are cyclooxygenase inhibitors commonly used as symptomatic medicines for myofascial pain syndrome. Using the selective inhibitors celecoxib and zaltoprofen, cyclooxygenase-2 has been shown to be involved in the initiation, but not the maintenance, of muscular mechanical hyperalgesia induced by lengthening contractions, which serves as a useful model for the study of myofascial pain syndrome. The effect of other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, such as acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, loxoprofen sodium, and acetaminophen, on muscular mechanical hyperalgesia during maintenance has not been studied. Here, we examined the analgesic effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen on the model. Consistent with previous studies, mechanical withdrawal threshold of the muscle was significantly decreased and reached its lowest level 24 h after lengthening contractions. Celecoxib had no effect on muscular mechanical hyperalgesia, when orally administered 24 h after lengthening contractions. In contrast, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, loxoprofen sodium, and acetaminophen increased the withdrawal threshold, which had decreased by lengthening contractions, in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the analgesic actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen in the maintenance process of lengthening contraction-induced muscular mechanical hyperalgesia, which may occur through cyclooxygenase-2 independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2987351058,"Objectives The objectives of the study were to assess the knowledge and skills of medical interns and nurses regarding family planning (FP) services, and document the prevailing FP practices in the teaching hospitals in India. Study design A cross-sectional study was conducted in three states (Delhi, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra) of India, among randomly selected 163 participants, including medical interns (n = 81) and in-service nurses (n = 82), during 2017. The semi-structured, pre-tested interview schedule, was used to assess the knowledge and status of training received; and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) based checklist was used to evaluate the skills. Results About 60% of the interns and 48% of the nurses knew more than five contraceptives that could be offered to the clients. About 22% (11.1% interns and 33.3% nurses) respondents believed that contraceptives should not be given to a married woman coming alone, and 31.9% (17.3% interns and 46.3% nurses) respondents reported that it was illegal to provide contraceptives to unmarried people. Nearly 43.3% interns and 69.5% nurses refused to demonstrate intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) insertion in the dummy uterus as per OSCE, and among those who did, 12.3% interns and 18.3% nurses had failed. About 63% interns and 63.4% of nurses had observed IUCD insertion, and 12.3% interns and 17.1% had performed IUCD insertion, during their training. Conclusions Knowledge and skills of interns and nurses regarding FP services were inadequate. The medical training during graduation or internship, and during the job, was found to be inadequate to provide quality FP services as per guidelines of nursing/medical council of India and Government of India on FP."
https://openalex.org/W2988227505,"Although the HIV epidemic is generalized in West Africa, some population groups such as men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those engaged in transactional sex (TS), are thought to be particularly more vulnerable to HIV than others. However, few data are available to help identify their health-related needs with a view to implementing targeted prevention interventions. To fill this knowledge gap, we aimed to characterize MSM reporting TS (MSM-TS) and to identify factors associated with their sexual practices using data from the prospective cohort study CohMSM, which was conducted in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and Togo. Three stigmatization sub-scores were constructed (experienced, perceived and internalized). The generalized estimating equation method was used for data analysis. Of the total 630 HIV-negative MSM recruited in CohMSM, 463, 410 and 244 had a follow-up visit at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. In a total of 1747 follow-up visits, 478 TS encounters were reported by 289 MSM-TS (45.9%). Of the latter, 91 regularly reported TS (31.5%), 55 (19.0%) stopped reporting TS after baseline, and 53 (18.3%) reported TS after baseline and 90 (31.1%) occasionally reported TS. The following variables, regarding the previous 6 months, were positively associated with TS: being younger (aOR[95%CI]:1.86[1.39-2.50]), less educated (aOR[95%CI]:1.49[1.09-2.03]), unmarried status (aOR[95%CI]:1.79[1.10-2.93]), satisfaction with current sex life (aOR[95%CI]:1.41[1.06-1.88]), group sex with men (aOR[95%CI]:2.07[1.46-2.94]), multiple male sexual partners (aOR[95%CI]:1.85[1.40-2.44]), receptive or versatile anal sex with male partners (aOR [95%CI]:1.48[1.12-1.96]), giving benefits in exchange for sex with a man (aOR[95%CI]:2.80[1.97-3.98]), alcohol consumption (aOR[95%CI]:1.44[1.08-1.93]) and drug use (aOR[95%CI]:1.82[1.24-2.68]) during sex, and finally experiencing stigmatization (aOR [95%CI]:1.15[1.07-1.25]). Condom use during anal sex (aOR[95%CI]:0.73[0.53-0.99]) was negatively associated with TS."
https://openalex.org/W2988401306,"Background In Uganda, the HIV epidemic is now mature and generalized. Recently, there have been reports of resurgence in the incidence of HIV after several years of successful control. The causes for this resurgence are not clear but suspected to be driven by structural factors that influence large groups of people rather than individuals. The aim of this study was to describe the structural drivers of the HIV epidemic in high prevalence regions and inform the next generation of interventions. Methodology We conducted a total of 35 focus group discussions in 11 districts in Uganda. Due to their high HIV prevalence, the districts had been selected to implement a donor supported program to scale up HIV prevention, care and treatment. Focus groups consisted of men and women including opinion leaders, civil servants including teachers, police officers, religious, political leaders, shop keepers, local residents and other ordinary persons from all walks of life. The qualitative data were transcribed and analyzed manually. Texts were coded using a coding scheme which was prepared ahead of time but emerging themes and codes were also allowed. Results Our data indicated there is persistence of several structural drivers and factors for HIV in rural Uganda. The structural drivers of HIV were divided into three categories: Gender issues, socio-cultural, and economic drivers. The specific drivers included several gender issues, stigma surrounding illness, traditional medical practices, urbanization, alcohol and substance abuse and poverty. New drivers arising from urbanization, easy access to mobile phone, internet and technological advancement have emerged. These drivers are intertwined within an existing culture, lifestyle and the mixture is influenced by modernization. Conclusion The traditional structural drivers of HIV have persisted since the emergence of the HIV epidemic in Uganda and new ones have emerged. All these drivers may require combined structural interventions that are culturally and locally adapted in order to tackle the resurgence in incidence of HIV in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W2987988900,"Purpose Light physical activity (LPA) and patterns of sedentary behavior influence cardio-metabolic health independently of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Understanding the trajectory and determinants of these activity levels over time may provide insights relevant to public health practice. Methods We measured a cohort of young women recruited in middle school (age 14) using accelerometry for 1 week and remeasured them in high school (age 17) and again at age 23 (n = 385). We assessed changes in LPA and patterns of sedentary behavior by hours in a day. We examined the association of social and contextual factors, including employment status, screen time, and neighborhood context with LPA and sedentary behavior patterns. Results The amount of LPA decreased over time, while the length of LPA bouts tended to increase. Sedentary bout durations increased over time and sedentary breaks decreased. Sedentary time and bout length were correlated with internet use, rather than with TV or videogaming. Employment was associated with less sedentary time; being a student was associated with longer sedentary time and bouts. Conclusions Because LPA and sedentary breaks can be protective for cardio-metabolic health, and the duration of sedentary bouts increase as women age from adolescence to young adulthood, worksites and college campuses should remind employees and students to take frequent activity breaks when they use computers and the internet for long stretches."
https://openalex.org/W2983845237,"Forest development is a complex phenomenon which, for the number of actors involved and the response time expressed by forests, is difficult to understand and explore. Forests in Italy, as in several areas of Europe, are experiencing intensive management and recently, an increasing impact by ungulates. The effects on forest development of these two disturbances combined are difficult to predict, and consequently to be properly managed. We used a forest landscape change model, LANDIS-II, to simulate forest development as driven by forestry practices and roe deer impact for 200 years in a mountain forest of the Italian Apennines. We found that each disturbance alters forest tree species richness, forest type abundance and distribution, and forest structure. When considered combined, the two disturbances show additive behavior, enhancing or moderating each other’s effects. Forest management has a negative effect on tree species richness. We expected roe deer to have a negative effect on harvest yields, but this result was significant only for two of seven harvesting treatments. On the other hand, roe deer presence had a positive effect on tree species richness. All the simulation scenarios returned some extent of forest loss. The amount of the forest loss is lowest in the scenario without disturbances, and greatest when both disturbances are considered. However, the two disturbances combined, with the magnitude modelled in our simulations, have relatively low effects on the forest dynamics we analyzed in our study area. LANDIS-II was an effective approach for simulating combined management and ungulate driven trends of forest development, and to help understand the dynamics that lay behind it."
https://openalex.org/W2985541202,"To investigate the association between ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and ossification of the nuchal ligament (ONL) in terms of incidence and size.This retrospective study evaluated 297 patients who underwent CT of the cervical spine (C-spine). Two radiologists worked in consensus. The incidence of OPLL from patients with and without ONL was compared using Chi Square tests. The mean lengths of ONL from patients with and without OPLL were compared using Student t-test. The correlations between the length of ONL and the presence of OPLL and between the length of ONL and the length of OPLL were analyzed with Pearson correlations.We found that OPLL occurred more frequently in patients with ONL than in patients without ONL (odd ratio = 2.524, p = 0.037); however, the mean length of ONL did not differ significantly patients with and without OPLL (p = 0.874). We found no significant correlation between the length of ONL and the length of OPLL (p = 0.233).The presence of ONL was associated with the presence of OPLL. The length of OPLL and ONL showed no correlation."
