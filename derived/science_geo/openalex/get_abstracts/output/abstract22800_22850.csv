https://openalex.org/W2069444054,"Caveolae have been implicated in the transcytosis of macromolecules across endothelial cells and in the receptor-mediated uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Structural studies indicate that caveolae are decorated on their cytoplasmic surface by a unique array of filaments or strands that form striated coatings. To understand how these nonclathrin-coated pits function, we performed structural analysis of the striated coat and searched for the molecular component(s) of the coat material. The coat cannot be removed by washing with high salt; however, exposure of membranes to cholesterol-binding drugs caused invaginated caveolae to flatten and the striated coat to disassemble. Antibodies directed against a 22 kd substrate for v-src tyrosine kinase in virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts decorated the filaments, suggesting that this molecule is a component of the coat. We have named the molecule caveolin. Caveolae represent a third type of coated membrane specialization that is involved in molecular transport."
https://openalex.org/W2094070743,"The intracellular pathogenic bacterium L. monocytogenes can spread directly from cell to cell without leaving the cytoplasm. The mechanism of this movement, generated through bacterially induced actin polymerization, is not understood. By analyzing an avirulent Tn917-lac mutant defective for actin polymerization, we have identified a bacterial component involved in this process. The transposon had inserted in actA, the second gene of an operon. Gene disruption of downstream genes and transformation of the mutant strain with actA showed that the actA gene encodes a surface protein necessary for bacterially induced actin assembly. Our results indicate that it is a 610 amino acid protein with an apparent molecular weight of 90 kd."
https://openalex.org/W1968727721,"We show that phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) by the protein kinase GCN2 mediates translational control of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4. In vitro, GCN2 specifically phosphorylates the alpha subunit of rabbit or yeast eIF-2. In vivo, phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha increases in response to amino acid starvation, which is dependent on GCN2. Substitution of Ser-51 with alanine eliminates phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha by GCN2 in vivo and in vitro and abolishes increased expression of GCN4 and amino acid biosynthetic genes under its control in amino acid-starved cells. The Asp-51 substitution mimics the phosphorylated state and derepresses GCN4 in the absence of GCN2. Thus, an established mechanism for regulating total protein synthesis in mammalian cells mediates gene-specific translational control in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2058110454,"The approximately 120-kilodalton amyloid beta protein precursor (beta APP) is processed into a complex set of 8- to 12-kilodalton carboxyl-terminal derivatives that includes potentially amyloidogenic forms with the approximately 4-kilodalton amyloid beta protein (beta AP) at or near their amino terminus. In order to determine if these derivatives are processed in a secretory pathway or by the endosomal-lysosomal system, (i) deletion mutants that produce the normal set of carboxyl-terminal derivatives and shortened secreted derivatives were analyzed and (ii) the effect of inhibitors of endosomal-lysosomal processing was examined. In the secretory pathway, cleavage of the beta APP occurs at a single site within the beta AP to generate one secreted derivative and one nonamyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal fragment, whereas, in the endosomal-lysosomal system, a complex set of carboxyl-terminal derivatives is produced that includes the potentially amyloidogenic forms."
https://openalex.org/W2096580557,"The homeodomain protein alpha 2 and the SRF-like protein Mcm1 are required to establish cell type in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Together, these regulatory proteins recognize a specific DNA operator, marking a set of genes for transcriptional repression. In this paper, we show that occupancy of the operator by alpha 2-Mcm1 is not sufficient to bring about repression. Rather, repression is effected only when Ssn6 (a TPR protein) and Tup1 (a beta-transducin repeat protein) are also present in the cell. We show that Ssn6 represses transcription when brought to a promoter by a bacterial DNA-binding domain and that Tup1 is required for this repression. Based on these and other results, we propose that Ssn6-Tup1 is a general repressor of transcription in yeast, recruited to target promoters by a variety of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053544216,"We report the first intracellular characterization of an endogenous nontransmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). Using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, we have identified PTP-1B as a 50 kd serine phosphoprotein in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. Surprisingly, indirect immunofluorescence experiments indicate that PTP-1B is localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subcellular fractionation is consistent with this localization and establishes that PTP-1B is tightly associated with microsomal membranes, with its phosphatase domain oriented towards the cytoplasm. The C-terminal 35 amino acids of PTP-1B are both necessary and sufficient for targeting to the ER. The finding of a tyrosine phosphatase on the ER suggests new possibilities for cellular events controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2059637973,"A novel mechanism for inhibition of T cell responses is described. Using the recognition of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) 307–319 peptide in the context of DR1 class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, we have found that nonstimulatory analogs of the HA peptide preferentially inhibit HA-specific T cells in inhibition of antigen presentation assays. This antigen-specific effect could be generalized to another DR1-restricted peptide, Tetanus toxoid 830–843. Direct binding and cellular experiments indicated that the mechanism responsible was distinct from competition for binding to DR1 molecules. Likewise, negative signaling and induction of T cell tolerance could also be excluded as effector mechanisms. Thus, the most likely mechanism for this effect is engagement of antigen-specific T cell receptors by DR1-peptide analog complexes, which results in antigen-specific competitive blocking of T cell responses by virtue of their capacity to compete with DR1-antigen complexes for binding to the T cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2120236371,"The 39- to 43-amino acid amyloid beta protein (beta AP), which is deposited as amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, is encoded as an internal peptide that begins 99 residues from the carboxyl terminus of a 695- to 770-amino acid glycoprotein referred to as the amyloid beta protein precursor (beta APP). To clarify the processing that produces amyloid, carboxyl-terminal derivatives of the beta APP were analyzed. This analysis showed that the beta APP is normally processed into a complex set of 8- to 12-kilodalton carboxyl-terminal derivatives. The two largest derivatives in human brain have the entire beta AP at or near their amino terminus and are likely to be intermediates in the pathway leading to amyloid deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2066101080,"Fos and Jun, the protein products of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun, associate preferentially to form a heterodimer that binds to DNA and modulates transcription of a wide variety of genes in response to mitogenic stimuli. Both Fos and Jun contain a single leucine zipper region. Previous studies have shown that the leucine zippers of Fos and Jun are necessary and sufficient to mediate preferential heterodimer formation. The leucine zipper regions from Fos and Jun are also known to fold autonomously, most likely as two-stranded, parallel coiled coils. We show here that 8 amino acids from Fos and from Jun are sufficient to mediate preferential heterodimer formation in a background of the GCN4 leucine zipper sequence. Using pH titration and amino acid replacements, we also show that destabilization of the Fos homodimer by acidic residues provides a major thermodynamic driving force for preferential heterodimer formation."

In the developing mammalian retina, gradual regression of chondroitin sulfate may help control the onset of ganglion cell differentiation and initial direction of their axons. Changes induced by the removal of chondroitin sulfate from intact retinas in culture confirm the function of chondroitin sulfate in retinal histogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970327593,"In U. maydis the multiallelic b locus controls sexual and pathogenic development. In the b locus a gene coding for a regulatory protein had been identified, and it was suggested that the interaction of two b polypeptides specified by different alleles programs sexual development in this fungus. We now demonstrate the existence of a second regulatory gene in the b locus. We term this gene bW and refer to the former as the bE gene. Both genes exist in many alleles. Although unrelated in primary sequence, both genes are similar in their overall organization. The gene products display allele-specific variability in their N-terminal domains, show a high degree of sequence conservation in the C-terminal domains, and contain a homeodomain-related motif. Genetic evidence is provided to show that the pair of bE and bW polypeptides encoded by different b alleles is the key regulatory species."
https://openalex.org/W1979576335,"The outgrowth of single axons through different cellular environments requires distinct sets of genes in the nematode C. elegans. Three genes are required for the pioneering circumferential outgrowth of identified motor neuron axons between the lateral hypodermal cell membrane and the basal lamina. Three other genes are required for the longitudinal outgrowth of these axons along preexisting axon bundles as well as for the fasciculation of axons within these neuron bundles. Five additional genes are required for circumferential outgrowth, longitudinal outgrowth, and fasciculation; mutations in three of these genes disrupt axon ultrastructure, suggesting that they function in axon formation rather than in axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2151469110,"Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) mediates viral entry into cells by a low pH-induced membrane fusion event in endosomes. A number of structural changes occur throughout the length of HA at the pH of fusion. To probe their significance and their necessity for fusion activity, we have prepared a site-directed mutant HA containing novel intersubunit disulfide bonds designed to cross-link covalently the membrane-distal domains of the trimer. These mutations inhibited the low pH-induced conformational changes and prevented HA-mediated membrane fusion; conditions that reduced the novel disulfide bonds restored membrane fusion activity. We conclude that structural rearrangements in the membrane distal region of the HA are required for membrane fusion activity."
https://openalex.org/W2064119552,"Synapsin I is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that binds to small synaptic vesicles and F-actin in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. We have found that dephosphorylated synapsin I induces a dose-dependent increase in the number of actin filaments, which at high ionic strength is abolished by synapsin I phosphorylation. The increase in filament number appears to be due to a nucleating effect of synapsin I and not to a barbed-end capping/severing activity. Synaptic vesicle-bound synapsin I was as effective as free synapsin I in increasing the number of filaments. These data support the view that synapsin I is involved in the regulation of the dynamics of the actin-based network during the exo-endocytotic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1538077597,"The DNA binding properties of ABF2, an abundant protein found in the mitochondria of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been examined in detail. ABF2 is closely related to the vertebrate high mobility group protein HMG1 and like HMG1, ABF2 will introduce negative supercoils into a relaxed, double-stranded circular DNA molecule in cooperation with a DNA topoisomerase. Additionally, ABF2 binds approximately 5-10 times more tightly to negatively supercoiled DNA than to relaxed circular or linear DNA. Although ABF2 binds to most random double-stranded sequences with roughly equal affinity, its binding within certain key regulatory regions is qualitatively quite different. First, ABF2 binding induces a distinct pattern of DNA bending within the chromosomal origin of DNA replication, ARS1. Second, ABF2 binding to all nuclear replication origins tested, in addition to a critical mitochondrial promoter and replication origin, is clearly nonrandom as visualized by DNase1 footprinting. Analysis of the sequences found within these regions as well as competition experiments with synthetic DNA molecules suggest that site-specific DNA binding may be accomplished by the phased distribution of short stretches of poly(dA), which exclude ABF2 binding. These patterns of ABF2 DNA binding suggest a role for the protein in genome organization and site-specific regulation of transcription or DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1480548164,"Oligonucleotide-directed triplex formation within upstream regulatory sequences is envisioned as a potential tool for gene inhibition. However, this approach requires that triple helix-forming oligonucleotides are chemically modified, so that the triplex is stable under physiological conditions. Here, we have compared several chemical modifications of an oligonucleotide, targeted to a natural 15-base pair homopyrimidine.homopurine sequence located in the upstream regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (p55, IL-2 R alpha). Methylation of the cytosines strongly stabilized the triplex. Further attachment of an intercalating agent (acridine) dramatically increased the stability of the triplex, as assessed by Tm measurements or by band shift assays. Furthermore, the acridine-derivatized oligonucleotide was more efficient in competing away high affinity DNA-binding proteins, as assessed by restriction enzyme inhibition assays. Using a novel footprinting assay, we have further shown that the interaction of the methylcytosine-substituted, acridine-derivatized oligonucleotide with a plasmidic target, harboring the IL-2 R alpha regulatory region, remains highly sequence specific, occurs at physiological pH and is independent of the superhelicity of the plasmid. Acridine derivatization did not impair the exquisite target specificity of triplex formation, since the derivatized oligonucleotide inhibited the binding of nuclear proteins to the overlapping NF kappa B enhancer sequence on an IL-2 R alpha target and not on the related human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat target. Finally, the oligonucleotide inhibited the NF kappa B-dependent tax-induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 R alpha chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct in live cells, whereas it did not have any effect on a human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. We conclude that this modified oligonucleotide acts as a transcriptional repressor for the IL-2 R alpha gene via triple helix formation with regulatory sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1499220263,"The mitogen-activated 70K S6 kinase has an apparent Km for 40 S ribosomal subunits of 0.25 microM. The apparent Km for a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of S6 and containing all of the in vivo sites of phosphorylation was 2.5-fold higher. A number of shorter peptides revealed that the substrate recognition determinants for the preferred site of phosphorylation, Ser236, reside in a seven-amino acid stretch of S6, residues 231-217. Critical to recognition is a block of 3 consecutive arginines, especially Arg231 and Arg233. In contrast, replacement of Ser235 or the preferred site of phosphorylation, Ser236, with alanine has little effect on the apparent Km. Based on this data the consensus recognition sequence would be Arg-(Arg)-Arg-X-X-Ser-X. A number of kinases known to phosphorylate S6, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C and the 92K S6 kinase II, were also tested for their ability to phosphorylate a decapeptide containing all the critical recognition determinants. Finally, a synthetic peptide containing a putative 70K S6 kinase autoinhibitory domain did not serve as a substrate for the enzyme but did inhibit its activity, although much less effectively than a synthetic peptide containing all the recognition determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1527997452,"A structural characteristic of many antiestrogens (AEs) is a bulky side chain with basic or polar functional groups that may interact with charged and polar amino acids near the hormone-binding site in the estrogen receptor. Recently, we have identified Cys530 as the residue of the human estrogen receptor that is the site of covalent labeling by aziridine analogs of estrogens (Es) and AEs (Harlow, K. W., Smith, D. N., Katzenellenbogen, J. A., Greene, G. L., and Katzenellenbogen, B. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17476-17485). Since the aziridine function is on the bulky side chain of these ligands, Cys530 must be at or near the site of those side chain interactions. To probe these interactions, we have, by site-directed mutagenesis, made mutant human estrogen receptors in which charged and polar amino acids near Cys530 are changed (Glu523 to Gln, Lys529 and Lys531 to Gln, Asn532 to Asp, and Asp538 to Asn) so as to alter charge with minimal steric alteration. These receptors were expressed in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary or COS-1) cells and assayed for their binding affinity for Es and AEs, their interaction with estrogen-responsive element DNA, and their ability to activate or suppress transcription of estrogen-responsive reporter genes. Two of the estrogen receptor mutants, KKN-QQD (mutation of Lys529, Lys531, and Asn532 to Gln529, Gln531, and Asp532, respectively) and KK-QQ (mutation of Lys529 and Lys531 to Gln529 and Gln531, respectively), in which the local charge is changed from +2 to -1 or 0, respectively, display an affinity for estradiol (E2) 5-10 times lower than that of the wild-type receptor, which is attributable to an enhanced rate of E2 dissociation. Although these mutant receptors have reduced affinity for a variety of Es, they retain unaltered affinity for AE. The profiles of transcriptional activation of reporter genes by various concentrations of E2 show that these two mutants (KKN-QQD and KK-QQ) require 40- and 15-fold higher E2 concentrations, respectively, to achieve half-maximal activity. In contrast, mutants E523Q and D538N, with changes at amino acids further from Cys530, were unaltered in their hormone binding and transactivation activity by E or AE. Interestingly, the AEs 4-hydroxytamoxifen, LY 117018, U 23469M, and ICI 164384 were 15-30-fold more effective in inhibiting E2-stimulated transcription by mutants KKN-QQD and KK-QQ compared to the wild-type receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2171417006,"Twelve maternal effect genes (the dorsal group and cactus) are required for the establishment of the embryonic dorsal-ventral axis in the Drosophila embryo. Embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity is defined within the perivitelline compartment surrounding the embryo by the ventral formation of a ligand for the Toll receptor. Here, by transplantation of perivitelline fluid we demonstrate the presence of three separate activities present in the perivitelline fluid that can restore dorsal-ventral polarity to mutant easter, snake, and spätzle embryos, respectively. These activities are not capable of defining the polarity of the dorsal-ventral axis; instead they restore structures according to the intrinsic dorsal-ventral polarity of the mutant embryos. They appear to be involved in the ventral formation of a ligand for the Toll protein. This process requires serine proteolytic activity; the injection of serine protease inhibitors into the perivitelline space of wild-type embryos results in the formation of dorsalized embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2072682792,"Forensic scientists commonly assume that DNA fingerprint patterns are infrequent in the general population and that genotypes are independent across loci. To test these assumptions, the number of matching DNA patterns in two large databases from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and from Lifecodes was determined. No deviation from independence across loci in either database was apparent. For the Lifecodes database, the probability of a three-locus match ranges from 1 in 6,233 in Caucasians to 1 in 119,889 in Blacks. When considering all trios of five loci in the FBI database, there was only a single match observed out of more than 7.6 million comparisons. If independence is assumed, the probability of a five-locus match ranged from 1.32 x 10(-12) in Southeast Hispanics to 5.59 x 10(-14) in Blacks, implying that the minimum number of possible patterns for each ethnic group is several orders of magnitude greater than their corresponding population sizes in the United States. The most common five-locus pattern can have a frequency no greater than about 10(-6). Hence, individual five-locus DNA profiles are extremely uncommon, if not unique."
https://openalex.org/W1507526205,"The chloroplast-encoded D1 protein of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is a component of the photosystem II reaction center. Previously, we detected an electrophoretic variant of D1 which was generated in vivo in granal-localized reaction centers in a light dependent manner (Callahan, F.E., Ghirardi, M.L., Sopory, S.K., Mehta, A.M., Edelman, M., and Mattoo, A.K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15357-15360). In the present study, we identify this modified form as phosphorylated D1. The in vivo phosphorylation occurs on a threonine residue(s) localized within 1 kDa from the N terminus and is identical to the phosphorylation of D1 catalyzed in vitro by a redox-regulated thylakoid-bound protein kinase. While virtually all of the D1 protein present in thylakoids can be phosphorylated in vitro, the steady-state level of phosphorylated D1 in vivo varies with light intensity and did not exceed 20% of the total D1 under the conditions of this study."
https://openalex.org/W1585988293,"Ornithine delta-aminotransferase is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix enzyme which catalyzes the reversible interconversion of ornithine and alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate semialdehyde and glutamate. Inherited deficiency of ornithine delta-aminotransferase results in ornithine accumulation and a characteristic chorioretinal degeneration, gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina. We have surveyed the ornithine delta-aminotransferase genes of gyrate atrophy patients for mutations. Using a variety of techniques, we discovered and molecularly characterized 21 newly recognized ornithine delta-aminotransferase alleles. We determined the consequences of these and three previously described mutations on ornithine delta-aminotransferase mRNA, antigen, and enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts. The majority (20/24) of these alleles produce normal amounts of normally sized ornithine delta-aminotransferase mRNA. By contrast, only 2/24 had normal amounts of ornithine delta-aminotransferase antigen. Reproducing these mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and expressing the mutant ornithine delta-aminotransferase in Chinese hamster ovary cells confirms that several of these mutations inactivate ornithine delta-aminotransferase and cause gyrate atrophy in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W1616191186,"In order to assess the requirement for the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) consensus adhesion sequence in von Willebrand factor (vWF) for vWF binding to platelets and endothelial cells, point mutations were introduced into this sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. A glycine to alanine substitution yielded RADS-vWF, while an aspartate to glutamate substitution resulted in RGES-vWF. Recombinant RADS-vWF and RGES-vWF, purified from transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells, were compared with recombinant wild type vWF (WT-vWF) in functional assays with platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HU-VECs). High molecular weight RADS-vWF and RGES-vWF multimers inhibited binding of 125I-vWF to a mixture of insolubilized native type I and III collagen and competed effectively with 125I-vWF for binding to formalin-fixed platelets in the presence of ristocetin, indicating functional collagen and platelet glycoprotein Ib binding. However, RADS-vWF and RGES-vWF were unable to displace the binding of 125I-vWF to thrombin or ADP-activated platelets. The attachment of HUVECs to either RADS-vWF or RGES-vWF coated surfaces was reduced and spreading was almost completely inhibited, compared with WT-vWF. We conclude that point mutations of the RGDS sequence in vWF selectively impair binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and the HUVEC vitronectin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1542297760,"Tissue-specific carbohydrate structures are thought to result from the selective expression of specific terminal glycosyltransferases responsible for their synthesis. However, little is known about the regulation of the expression of these enzymes. Previous analysis of the distribution of one such enzyme, beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase, revealed that its expression is tissue restricted, with highest levels being found in the liver. Examination of the gene suggested that its expression is regulated at the level of transcription by multiple promoters, one of which is strongly active in the liver. In this present work, an analysis of the liver-restricted promoter was undertaken to identify the promoter elements necessary for liver-restricted expression. Footprinting studies, 5' deletion analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis identified two cis-elements which were potentially important in the tissue-specific expression of this promoter. One of these elements contains a consensus binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha, while the other is a consensus binding site for the liver-specific factors D-binding protein and liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein. Expression vectors containing cDNAs of these factors are capable of trans-activating transcription of the alpha 2,6ST promoter, demonstrating their ability to regulate transcription of this promoter. Together, these results suggest that tissue-specific glycosylation can be regulated at the level of transcription by the same factors involved in the expression of a number of other tissue-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1992658928,"The Schwann cell myelin protein (SMP), previously defined in quail and chick by a monoclonal antibody, is in vivo exclusively expressed by myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. The isolation of the complete nucleotide sequence of SMP is reported here. The predicted polypeptide chain reveals that SMP is a transmembrane molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily showing sequence similarities with several surface glycoproteins expressed in the nervous and immune systems. In spite of a 43.5% overall sequence identity between rat myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and quail SMP, SMP does not seem to be the avian homolog of MAG, since their expression, regulation, and functions are significantly different. Unusual sequence arrangements shared by SMP, MAG, and two lymphoid antigens suggest the existence of a particular subgroup in the immunoglobulin superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1490793506,"The role of thyroid hormone in regulating the expression of the flavoprotein NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase was studied in adult rats. Depletion of circulating thyroid hormone by hypophysectomy, or more selectively, by treatment with the anti-thyroid drug methimazole led to a 75-85% depletion of hepatic microsomal P450 reductase activity and protein in both male and female rats. Thyroxine substantially restored P450 reductase activity at a dose that rendered the thyroid-depleted rats euthyroid. Microsomal P450 reductase activity in several extrahepatic tissues was also dependent on thyroid hormone, but to a lesser extent than in liver (30-50% decrease in kidney, adrenal, lung, and heart but not in testis from hypothyroid rats). Hepatic P450 reductase mRNA levels were also decreased in the hypothyroid state, indicating that the loss of P450 reductase activity is not a consequence of the associated decreased availability of the FMN and FAD cofactors of P450 reductase. Parallel analysis of S14 mRNA, which has been studied extensively as a model thyroid-regulated liver gene product, indicated that P450 reductase and S14 mRNA respond similarly to these changes in thyroid state. In contrast, while the expression of S14 and several other thyroid hormone-dependent hepatic mRNAs is stimulated by feeding a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet, hepatic P450 reductase expression was not increased by this lipogenic diet. Injection of hypothyroid rats with T3 at a supraphysiologic, receptor-saturating dose stimulated a major induction of hepatic P450 reductase mRNA that was detectable 4 h after the T3 injection, and peaked at approximately 650% of euthyroid levels by 12 h. However, this same treatment stimulated a biphasic increase in P450 reductase protein and activity that required 3 days to reach normal euthyroid levels. T3 treatment of euthyroid rats also stimulated a major induction of P450 reductase mRNA that was maximal (12-fold increase) by 12 h, but in this case no major increase in P450 reductase protein or activity was detectable over a 3-day period. Together, these studies establish that thyroid hormone regulates P450 reductase expression by pretranslational mechanisms. They also suggest that other regulatory mechanisms, which may involve changes in P450 reductase protein stability and/or changes in the translational efficiency of its mRNA, are likely to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1569981033,"Prolonged incubation of rat adipocytes with (-)N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine (PIA) (an A1 adenosine receptor agonist) leads to down-regulation of each of the three subtypes of Gi (Green, A., Johnson, J. L., and Milligan, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5206-5210). To determine whether other inhibitors of adenylylcyclase would have similar actions, we incubated adipocytes in primary culture with PIA, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), or nicotinic acid. After various times cells were homogenized, and crude membrane fractions were analyzed on Western blots using antipeptide antisera to alpha- and beta-subunits of G-proteins (SG1 (which binds to alpha i1 and alpha i2), I3B (which binds to alpha i3), BN2 (binds to beta-subunits) and CS1 (recognizes forms of alpha s)). PIA and PGE1 caused approximately 90% down-regulation of alpha i1 and alpha i3, and about 50% loss of alpha i2 and beta-subunits. In contrast, nicotinic acid at concentrations up to 1 mM had no effect on levels of any of these Gi subtypes. None of the compounds altered levels of either a 43- or 47-kDa form of alpha s. PIA caused about a 50% decrease in binding of [3H]DPCPX (an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist), indicating adenosine receptor down-regulation; however, neither PGE1 nor nicotinic acid treatment altered [3H]DPCPX binding. None of the treatments affected the activity of adenylylcyclase when measured in the presence of 100 microM forskolin and 10 mM Mn2+, indicating that the catalytic subunit of adenylylcyclase is not altered. To determine whether Gi down-regulation results in heterologous desensitization, we incubated adipocytes with maximally effective concentrations of PIA (300 nM), PGE1 (3 microM), or nicotinic acid (1 mM) for 4 days. The cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 30 min with various concentrations of these compounds to determine their ability to inhibit lipolysis. PIA caused a (marked) decrease in the sensitivity of the cells to both PIA and PGE1, thus indicating heterologous desensitization. Similarly, PGE1 decreased the sensitivity of the cells to both PGE1 and PIA, again demonstrating heterologous desensitization. In contrast, prolonged incubation with nicotinic acid decreased the sensitivity of the cells to nicotinic acid but had no effect on the sensitivity of the cells to PIA. Adenylylcyclase in membranes from PGE1-treated cells showed decreased sensitivity to inhibition by PIA. In contrast, adenylylcyclase showed normal sensitivity to PIA in membranes from nicotinic acid-treated cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1498292868,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are a family of approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins initially identified by their ability to enhance cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in the presence of GTP. ARFs have been purified from both membrane and cytosolic fractions. ARF purified from bovine brain cytosol requires phospholipid plus detergent for high affinity guanine nucleotide binding and for optimal enhancement of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The phospholipid requirements, combined with a putative role for ARF in vesicular transport, suggested that the soluble protein might interact reversibly with membranes. A polyclonal antibody against purified bovine ARF (sARF II) was used to detect ARF by immunoblot in membrane and soluble fractions from rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cell homogenates. ARF was predominantly cytosolic but increased in membranes during incubation of homogenates with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), guanylyl-(beta gamma-imido)-diphosphate, and guanylyl-(beta gamma-methylene)-diphosphate, and to a lesser extent, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). GTP, GDP, GMP, and ATP were inactive. Cytosolic ARF similarly associated with added phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, or cardiolipin in GTP gamma S-dependent fashion. ARF binding to phosphatidylserine was reversible and coincident with stimulation of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. These observations may reflect a mechanism by which ARF could cycle between soluble and membrane compartments in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1606532905,"As a variety of eukaryotic cells age, the specific activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glu-6-PDH) declines as much as 50%. Because of the central role of this enzyme in metabolism, it is important to define factors responsible for this loss in enzyme activity. We report that Glu-6-PDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides is rapidly inactivated by micromolar concentrations of Fe2+ and H2O2. Inactivation correlated with the formation of one carbonyl functionality/enzyme subunit, indicating that inactivation is the result of site-specific oxidative modification. Our results suggest that Fe2+ binds to the glucose 6-phosphate binding site and that interaction of the enzyme-bound Fe2+ with H2O2 leads to the oxidative modification of amino acids essential for enzyme activity. Partially inactivated enzyme remained predominantly in the dimeric form, and no change in the apparent affinity of the remaining active subunits for substrate was observed. Partial inactivation did, however, lead to a decrease in the thermal stability of the remaining activity. This decrease in thermal stability could be largely overcome by the addition of glucose 6-phosphate. Thus, although exposure to H2O2 and Fe2+ results in the irreversible inactivation of Glu-6-PDH, the resulting modification is selective, leads to the formation of heterodimers of both active and inactive subunits, and does not appear to cause large scale structural changes. Our results demonstrate the inherent susceptibility of Glu-6-PDH from L. mesenteroides to modification by an oxidation system known to exist in vivo. An assessment of the physiological significance of Fe(2+)-catalyzed oxidation of Glu-6-PDH awaits extension of these studies to mammalian sources known to accumulate less active or inactive forms of the enzyme as a function of age."
https://openalex.org/W1534229002,"A steady-state model of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was constructed using a dynamic systems analysis computer program, METASIM. The model was based on radioactive tracer analyses which provided flux relationships and compartmented metabolite concentrations. Ten of the enzymes modeled were purified and characterized from Dictyostelium discoideum. Although experimentally determined enzyme mechanisms and constants were used in the model, Vmax values were found to be unreliable, i.e. they did not reflect enzyme activity in vivo. This value was therefore calculated as the only unknown in each enzyme kinetic equation and called Vvivo, to distinguish it from Vmax determined in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1560040935,"The penetration of phage T5 DNA into the Escherichia coli envelope takes place through ion channels (Boulanger, P., and Letellier, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3168-3172). To identify putative phage protein(s) involved in the formation of these channels, E. coli cells were infected at 37 degrees C with radioactively labeled phage and their envelopes were fractionated. After a flotation gradient, proteins belonging to the phage tail were recovered both in fractions containing the contact sites between the inner and outer membranes and in the outer membrane. The electrophoretic banding pattern of phage proteins indicates that the contact sites were enriched in the protein pb2. Moreover, infected cells were significantly enriched in contact sites as compared to intact cells. There was no enrichment of contact sites and very little radioactivity was found in this fraction and in the outer membrane when the cells were infected at 4 degrees C (i.e. under conditions where the phage does not inject its DNA). These results suggest that both contact sites and pb2 may play a central role in the translocation of phage T5 DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1969992168,"We have tested the hypothesis that cell lineage restriction boundaries define the borders between cytoarchitectonic areas in the cerebral cortex. Clonally related cells were identified using a retroviral marking technique, and the dispersion of neuronal clones was examined with respect to the transitions between cortical areas. We chose to study the hippocampal formation because we found that clones of hippocampal neurons, unlike those in neocortex, are compact and readily identifiable in the adult and that transitions between areas in the hippocampus are sharp relative to the spread of a typical clone. We conclude, contrary to the hypothesis, that clones of neurons transgress the boundaries between areas in the hippocampal formation, that bordercrossing clones are observed as frequently as would be expected if clones spread freely over the hippocampus with no constraint imposed by area borders, and that different types of pyramidal neurons, characteristic of different areas, may appear in a single clone."
https://openalex.org/W1515021757,"Human CD4, a monomeric T cell surface glycoprotein, is required for T helper cell activation and is also the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus. There have been conflicting reports as to whether glycosylation of CD4 is required for its cell surface expression. To clarify the effect of glycosylation on surface expression, folding, and intracellular sorting of CD4, we generated a series of mutant cDNAs in which one, the other, or both glycosylation recognition sites were eliminated. Using in vitro transcription and translation we confirmed that both potential glycosylation sites of CD4 were utilized. Transient expression of the mutants in HeLa cells demonstrated that glycosylation at either site was necessary and sufficient for cell surface expression. Finally, we showed that unglycosylated CD4 produced in HeLa cells was incorrectly folded and retained intracellularly, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1786757590,"Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of a serine protease. The NH2-terminal half of the molecule consists of a Ca(2+)-binding gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing module and two modules homologous to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor. To elucidate the role of these non-catalytic modules of factor IXa beta in factor X activation, we have isolated and characterized fragments of bovine factor IX, containing one or both of the EGF-like modules as well as these modules linked to the Gla module. The fragments were used as inhibitors of factor IXa beta-mediated factor X activation in a plasma clotting system and in systems with purified components of the Xase complex. Fragments consisting of either the two EGF-like modules of factor IX linked together or the NH2-terminal EGF-like module alone were found to inhibit factor Xa generation both in the presence and absence of the cofactor, factor VIIIa. Moreover, a fragment consisting of the corresponding modules of factor X had a similar effect. We therefore propose that factor IXa beta and factor X interact directly through their EGF-like modules on or in the vicinity of a phospholipid surface. We have also found that the isolated Gla module of factor IX inhibits the formation of factor Xa both in the presence and absence of phospholipid but not in the absence of factor VIIIa. Our results are compatible with a model of the Xase complex, in which both the serine protease part and the Gla module of factor IXa beta interact with factor VIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1540297453,"One of the basic features in allosteric regulation involves long range transduction of information. Based on crystallographic data on protein systems that are regulated by allosteric mechanisms, a global conformational change has always been observed. It is, therefore, important and useful to correlate the cooperativity of global structural change with the mode of binding of the regulatory ligand. Two systems were chosen for study, namely Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein and muscle pyruvate kinase, which show negative and positive cooperativity in the binding of allosteric ligands, respectively. Quantitative titration of the global structural change, monitored by a high precision analytical gel chromatography technique, was conducted as a function of allosteric effector concentration. The results obtained for cAMP receptor protein show that the protein undergoes contraction upon binding of cAMP. The decreases in Stokes radius associated with complex formation are 0.1 +/- 0.1 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 A when one and two cAMP-binding sites are filled, respectively. The results for the pyruvate kinase system show a concerted structural change that quantitatively match the predicted behavior based on equilibrium constants derived from the analysis of steady state kinetic data by a two-state model. Hence, for these two systems, these results show that negative and positive cooperativity are correlated with sequential and concerted modes of structural change, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2020855376,"The role of cellular interactions in determining the fates of two identified motoneurons in the embryonic zebrafish was investigated by transplanting individual motoneurons from labeled donor embryos to unlabeled hosts. The results suggest that although these cells normally adopt different fates, they form an equivalence group in which one fate is primary and the other is secondary. Both cells are able to adopt the primary fate. A cell that has adopted the secondary fate can be induced to switch to the primary fate by ablating the cell that has adopted the primary fate, even many hours after axogenesis. Although interactions between the two cells appear to regulate which cell adopts the secondary fate, these interactions seem to be independent of neuromuscular activity."
https://openalex.org/W1503643299,"Abstract A steady-state computer model of the tricarboxylic cycle in Dictyostelium discoideum was analyzed using metabolic control theory. The steady state had variations of less than 0.04% over the last half of the simulation for both metabolite concentrations and fluxes. Metabolite and flux control coefficients were determined by varying enzymatic activities within 2% of their initial values and simulating the responses of metabolite concentrations and fluxes to these changes. Under these conditions, summation properties were met for most metabolite and all flux control coefficients. Maximum flux control coefficients were found for succinate dehydrogenase (0.35), malic enzyme (0.24), and malate dehydrogenase (-0.18). Comparable control was found for the reaction supplying pyruvate (0.14) and for the sum of the input amino acids (0.43), which serve as an energy source for D. discoideum. The time-dependent processes by which a new steady state was established were examined after increasing malic enzyme or malate dehydrogenase activities. This provided a method for an analysis of the mechanisms by which the observed control coefficients were generated. In addition, the effects of increasing the stimuli within 5-20% of the original enzyme activity were examined. Under these conditions, more typical of experimental stimuli and measurable responses, the metabolic model failed to return to steady state, and thus summation properties were not met. Whether true steady states ever occur or whether metabolic control theory can be applied in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589756350,"We have constructed a mutant form of the RecBCD enzyme from Escherichia coli with a lysine to glutamine change in the consensus ATP-binding sequence in the RecD subunit (Korangy, F., and Julin, D.A. (1992a, 1992b) J. Biol. Chem., 1727-1732; 1733-1740). We compare here the kinetics of double-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the mutant (RecBCD-K177Q) and wild-type enzymes. We included heparin to trap enzyme not bound to DNA, or the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein from Escherichia coli to prevent the enzyme from binding to single-stranded DNA products and partially single-stranded reaction intermediates. The ATP hydrolysis kinetics in either case show a rapid burst phase followed by a slower second phase. The wild-type enzyme hydrolyzes an amount of ATP about equal to the DNA nucleotide concentration in the rapid phase. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed by the RecBCD-K177Q enzyme in the burst is about 8-10-fold lower than the wild-type, in the presence of either heparin or SSB. The burst magnitude of the wild-type enzyme with heparin is proportional to the size of the DNA from about 1,420 to 22,400 base pairs whereas that of the mutant is independent of the DNA size. The wild-type enzyme completely degrades a 6,250-base pair DNA substrate with no partially degraded molecules visible on agarose gels. RecBCD-K177Q enzyme reaction mixtures in the presence of SSB protein contain a heterogeneous mixture of partially degraded molecules of 2,000-5,000 base pairs. These results indicate that the RecBCD-K177Q enzyme is less processive than the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1596533231,"Tracheobronchial mucin samples from control and cystic fibrosis patients were purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-1000 and by density gradient centrifugation. Normal secretions contained high molecular weight (approximately 10(7] mucins, whereas the cystic fibrosis secretions contained relatively small amounts of high molecular weight mucin together with larger quantities of lower molecular weight mucin fragments. These probably represent products of protease digestion. Reducing the disulfide bonds in either the control or cystic fibrosis high molecular weight mucin fractions released subunits of approximately 2000 kDa. Treating these subunits with trypsin released glycopeptides of 300 kDa. Trypsin treatment of unreduced mucin also released fragments of 2000 kDa that could be converted into 300-kDa glycopeptides upon disulfide bond reduction. Thus, protease-susceptible linkages within these mucins must be cross-linked by disulfide bonds so that the full effects of proteolytic degradation of mucins remain cryptic until disulfide bonds are reduced. Since various combinations of protease treatment and disulfide bond reduction release either 2000- or 300-kDa fragments, these fragments must represent important elements of mucin structure. The high molecular weight fractions of cystic fibrosis mucins appear to be indistinguishable from control mucins. Their amino acid compositions are the same, and various combinations of disulfide bond reduction and protease treatment release products of identical size and amino acid composition. Sulfate and carbohydrate compositions did vary considerably from sample to sample, but the limited number of samples tested did not demonstrate a cystic fibrosis-specific pattern. Thus, tracheobronchial mucins from cystic fibrosis and control patients are very similar, and both share the same generalized structure previously determined for salivary, cervical, and intestinal mucins."
https://openalex.org/W1493974212,"Thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoic acid (RA) regulate gene transcription by binding to similar nuclear receptors. We have investigated the effects of RA, alone and in combination with T3, on a number of T3-responsive genes expressed in rat pituitary adenoma cells. Like T3, RA increased growth hormone gene expression in GH3 as well as in GH1 cells, and the effects of the hormones were additive. In contrast, RA alone had little effect on the expression of the beta 2 form of T3 receptor (TR beta 2), which is markedly decreased by T3. Remarkably, however, RA completely inhibited the down-regulation of TR beta 2 mRNA by T3. RA alone also had little effect on TR beta 1 mRNA, but its presence did not prevent the up-regulation of TR beta 1 mRNA by T3. The target-gene-specific antagonism of T3 action by RA was observed in both GH cell lines. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that the effect occurred at the level of TR beta 2 gene transcription, and the half-life of the TR beta 2 mRNA was unchanged by RA in the presence or absence of T3. The half-maximal RA dose required for these effects suggested that they were mediated by one or more of the nuclear receptors for RA. Indeed, GH3 cells contain mRNAs encoding the three distinct RA receptor subtypes, alpha, beta, and gamma, as well as retinoid X receptors. These results demonstrate that the effects of RA and T3 on gene expression are dependent on the nature of the target gene as well as on hormonal interactions, probably at the level of the receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1515866812,"After dissociation of cytosolic heteromeric glucocorticoid receptor complexes by steroid, salt, and other methods, only 35-60% of the dissociated receptors can bind to DNA-cellulose. The DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding forms of the dissociated receptors have the same Mr and are phosphorylated to the same extent (Tienrungroj, W., Sanchez, E. R., Housley, P. R., Harrison, R. W., and Pratt, W. B. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17347-17349). The basis for the different DNA-binding activities is unknown, but the DNA-binding fraction of the receptor has a more basic pI than the non-DNA-binding fraction (Smith, A. C., Elsasser, M. S., and Harmon, J. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13285-13292). We have separated the non-DNA-binding state of the receptor from the DNA-binding state and then cleaved it with trypsin and chymotrypsin. We find that the 15-kDa tryptic fragment derived from the non-DNA-binding state of the dissociated receptor is fully competent in binding DNA, whereas the 42-kDa chymotryptic fragment containing both the hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains does not bind DNA. Trypsin cleavage of the molybdate-stabilized untransformed receptor also yields a 15-kDa fragment that is fully competent in binding DNA. Reducing agents do not restore DNA-binding to the non-DNA-binding fraction of the receptor and the hormone-binding domain can be separated from the DNA-binding domain on nonreducing gel electrophoresis. These results argue that the two domains are not linked by disulfide bridges, and they are consistent with the proposal that there are two least energy states of folding after dissociation of hsp90. A significant portion of the receptors is misfolded in such a manner that the steroid binding domain is directly preventing DNA-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1530996779,"S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) was resolved into apoenzyme and NAD+ by acidic ammonium sulfate treatment. The apoenzyme was catalytically inactive, but could be reconstituted to active enzyme with NAD+. Reduced SAHase (ENADH) that was prepared by reconstitution of the apoenzyme with NADH was catalytically inactive. ENADH was oxidized by 3'-ketoadenosine to active SAHase. The recovery of activity paralleled the oxidation of enzyme-bound NADH. The association rate constant for ENADH and 3'-ketoadenosine was 6.1 x 10(2) M-1 s-1, and the dissociation rate constant was calculated to be 4 x 10(-7) s-1. This association rate constant was considerably smaller than the association rate constant for adenosine and SAHase (greater than 10(7) M-1 s-1). However, the observed pseudo first-order rate constant for reaction of 3'-ketoadenosine with ENADH (0.6 s-1 with 1 mM 3'-ketoadenosine) approached kcat for the hydrolytic reaction (1.2 s-1). Thus, bound 3'-ketoadenosine probably reacted sufficiently rapidly with ENADH to be considered a kinetically competent intermediate. The dissociation constants of SAHase for adenosine and 4',5'-dehydroadenosine, substrates for the enzyme, were 9 and 14 microM, respectively. In contrast, the dissociation constants of ENADH for 3'-ketoadenosine and 4',5'-dehydro-3'-ketoadenosine, intermediates of the catalytic reaction, were significantly lower with values of 600 and 300 pM, respectively. The equilibrium constant for reduction of enzyme-bound NAD+ in the absence of an adenosine analogue, as estimated from cyanide binding studies, was 10-fold more favorable than that for free NAD+. ENADH was highly fluorescent (emission maximum 428 nm, excitation 340 nm) with a quantum yield that was six times that of free NADH. Since SAHase reduced by adenosine was not highly fluorescent, enzyme-bound intermediates quenched the fluorescence of enzyme-bound NADH. Adenosine and adenine quenched the fluorescence of ENADH. Cyanide formed a complex with SAHase that was analogous to ENADH. Adenine stabilized this complex sufficiently that addition of 65 microM adenine and 25 mM cyanide to SAHase caused total complex formation with loss of over 95% of the catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1566165413,"Three endosomal compartments including the compartment for uncoupling receptor and ligand (CURL), multivesicular bodies (MVB), and a putative recycling fraction (retrosomes) were isolated from rat liver homogenates fifteen minutes after a bolus injection of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was delivered into a femoral vein. Assays for enzyme markers indicate a minimal contamination with either lysosomes or Golgi. The increase in specific activity of the radiolabeled ligand (VLDL) during the isolation procedure from homogenate to MVB, demonstrates a 200-250-fold purification of this organelle. All three fractions have the ability to catabolize triacylglycerol substrate both as triolein and as VLDL triacylglycerol. Furthermore, incubation of isolated endosomes following injection of endogenously labeled VLDL demonstrate their ability to hydrolyze VLDL triacylglycerol in situ. Three distinct lipolytic pH optima were found at pH 5.5, 7.1, and 8.6. The effects of serum, MgCl2, CaCl2, NaCl, sodium dodecyl sulfate, bile acids, and antibody to hepatic triacylglycerol lipase on the individual endosome fractions demonstrated distinct lipolytic activities in the different compartments. Results indicate that both an endosomal neutral lipase as well as hepatic triacylglycerol lipase make a significant contribution to lipolytic processing of endocytosed lipoproteins prior to their resecretion of further processing in hepatic lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1522202932,"A study of the activation of valproic acid (2-n-propylpentanoic acid) by a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria in the presence of ATP, CoASH, and MgCl2 revealed that, in addition to valproyl-CoA, an unknown UV-absorbing compound is formed which is the sole product when CoASH is omitted from the incubation mixture. The unknown compound, which was purified by high performance liquid chromatography, was identified as valproyl adenylate (valproyl-AMP) by mass spectrometry and by its enzymatic conversion to valproyl-CoA in the presence of CoASH. Valproyl-AMP exists, at least partially, in a free, not-enzyme-bound form. Its rate of formation is linear with time and increases 5-fold when the pH is decreased from 8 to 6.8. Valproyl-AMP was also identified when the metabolism of valproate was investigated with rat liver mitochondria and rat hepatocytes. Since the synthesis of valproyl-AMP is inhibited by octanoate, medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (EC. 6.2.1.2) may be responsible for its formation. This study establishes that during the activation of valproic acid to valproyl-CoA free valproyl-AMP is formed which is a novel cellular metabolite of valproic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1580375365,"The c-fgr proto-oncogene specifies a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, p55c-fgr, a member of the src family. In the present study, we have mutagenized c-fgr to mimic alterations found at the 3' end of the v-fgr oncogene and have investigated the biologic effects of normal and mutant p55c-fgr expression. Genes lacking 10 or 13 codons at the 3' end, as well as a gene encoding phenylalanine instead of tyrosine at codon 523, were potent oncogenes when transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Specific enzymatic activities of the more highly transforming gene products were 3-4-fold greater than that of p55c-fgr. In vivo, the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was directly proportional to potency in focus-forming assays. These findings are the first to identify highly transforming mutations of the c-fgr proto-oncogene. The proto-oncogene was also active in transforming assays, demonstrably greater than that of a kinase-deficient mutant. Foci arising in c-fgr-transfected cultures expressed abundant enzyme that was normal by a number of criteria. In addition, growth rates for cells expressing p55c-fgr were restricted, as compared with cells expressing a kinase-deficient protein or cells transformed by proteins with high specific enzymatic activities. Thus, enzymatically active p55c-fgr can simultaneously activate transforming and growth inhibitory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1548294832,"Abstract We developed a quantitative assay (homologous pairing gel assay) adequate for the purification of the activity promoting the formation of joint molecules, an intermediate of homologous recombination (homologous pairing). With this assay, one can measure the extent of homologous pairing between a single-stranded DNA and a strand of 3H-labeled double-stranded DNA by crude enzyme preparations. Since the total activity did not significantly change during the sporulation process, we tried to purify the activity from a whole cell extract of mitotic cells of a fission yeast, (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Through quantitative assaying of a single fraction or of mixed fractions, we obtained three fractions, all of which were required for the maximum level of the ATP-independent homologous pairing: Fractions 65, 100, and 30. In Fractions 100 and 30, polypeptides of approximately 100 and approximately 30 kDa (the 100- and 30-kDa polypeptides), respectively, were the sole detectable components. Fraction 65 contained a polypeptide of approximately 65 kDa (the 65-kDa polypeptide) as the major component and also small amounts of the 30- and 100-kDa polypeptides. Fraction 65 by itself promoted homologous pairing, but the reaction was saturated at a level of approximately 20% of the maximum level achieved with the recA protein. Even when added in excess, Fraction 30 or 100 alone did not promote detectable homologous pairing. A mixture of Fractions 65 and 100 at a rather strict optimum ratio only promoted homologous pairing, the level being 50-70% that with the recA protein, suggesting a stoichiometric complex of these polypeptides as the active form. Fraction 30 alone did not enhance the reaction with Fraction 65, but stimulated homologous pairing promoted by the optimum mixture of Fractions 65 and 100 to the maximum level achieved with the recA protein. Therefore, the homologous pairing-promoting protein from the fission yeast is likely to be a multicomponent protein."
https://openalex.org/W1608692320,"Aspartylglycosaminuria is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient activity of glycoasparaginase (EC 3.5.1.26), and it occurs with a high frequency among Finns. We have recently shown that the molecular defect in all Finnish aspartylglycosaminuria patients examined to date consists of two single base changes in the heavy chain of glycoasparaginase (Mononen, I., Heisterkamp, N., Kaartinen, V., Williams, J. C., Yates, J. R., III, Griffin, P. R., Hood, L. E., and Groffen, J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A. 88, 2941-2945). This is the first report on the identification of the molecular defect causing aspartylglycosaminuria in a patient of non-Finnish origin. Total RNA from fibroblasts of a black American aspartylglycosaminuria patient was isolated, first-strand cDNA was synthesized, and the cDNA encoding glycoasparaginase was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The patient's mRNA nucleotide sequence was different from the normal sequence by a deletion of 134 nucleotides at positions 807-940. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the normal glycoasparaginase gene demonstrated that the deletion corresponded precisely to a 134-base pair exon. Moreover, analysis of the splice sites demonstrated a single base change, G to T, that altered the donor splice site of the exon deleted in the patient's mRNA. This change led to an exon-skipping event resulting in a frame shift and generation of a stop codon."
https://openalex.org/W1572573898,"We recently showed that murine peritoneal macrophages cultured in vitro express potent prothrombinase activity (Lindahl, U., Pejler, G., Bogwald, J., and Seljelid, R. (1989) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 273, 180-188). In the present report, we demonstrate that the macrophages also express anticoagulant activity by inactivating the thrombin that is formed due to the action of the prothrombinase. Addition of exogenous purified thrombin to the macrophage cultures resulted in inactivation of the enzyme at a maximum rate of approximately 5 micrograms/h/10(6) cells. The inactivation appeared to be specific for thrombin, since neither Factor Xa, chymotrypsin, nor trypsin, three serine proteases exhibiting homology with thrombin, were inactivated by the macrophages. Thrombin-inactivating activity was not secreted into the culture medium. Inhibitors of endocytosis did not decrease the rate by which thrombin was inactivated, suggesting that internalization of the coagulation factor was not required. In contrast, the thrombin-inactivating activity was strongly inhibited by the polycation Polybrene. Anion-exchange chromatography of extracts obtained after Triton X-100-solubilization of the macrophages demonstrated that the thrombin-inactivating activity exhibited a high negative charge. Incubation of the thrombin-inactivating activity recovered after anion-exchange chromatography with unlabeled thrombin, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, showed that thrombin was proteolytically cleaved into defined fragments. Similar proteolytic fragments were obtained when 125I-labeled thrombin was added to macrophage cultures. Degradation of thrombin was blocked by phenylmethanesulfonic fluoride, an inhibitor of serine proteases, but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteases. Thrombin that had been chemically modified at its active site was degraded at the same rate by the macrophages as active thrombin. Taken together, these findings indicate that the murine macrophages express surface-bound serine protease activity that specifically inactivates thrombin by proteolytic cleavage. The significance of thrombin-inactivating activity in relation to the involvement of macrophage procoagulant activity in the immune response is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1493578275,"Proteoglycans of the human B lymphoblastoid cell line LICR-LON-HMy2 were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate. High-density fractions of 35S-labeled material separated by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation were further purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Two proteoglycans, isolated from cell lysates and culture supernatants, were characterized by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in combination with enzymatic degradation. Treatment with chondroitinase AC completely degraded the glycosaminoglycan moiety of the proteoglycans. Three to 4 chondroitin sulfate chains (average molecular mass = 26 kDa) were estimated for each of the two proteoglycans. Differences between the proteochondroitin sulfates (CSPG) were observed in the content of N-linked oligosaccharides. After chondroitinase AC treatment the resulting band in SDS-PAGE of the secreted CSPG was sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase F (Endo F) which further reduced the molecular mass from 30 to 21.5 kDa, whereas the band of the cellular CSPG after chondroitinase AC treatment (molecular mass = 30 kDa) remained resistant to Endo F treatment. The composition of amino acids was different in the protein cores, suggesting differences in the primary structure. Both CSPG contained a high percentage of glycine and serine. For both CSPG a molecular mass of approximately 135 kDa was deduced from the hydrodynamic sizes of the glycosaminoglycan chains obtained after alkaline/borohydride treatment and the migration of the protein/oligosaccharide complexes in SDS-PAGE. 75% of all [35S]sulfate-labeled molecules were found in the culture supernatant and 25% in the cellular fraction. 35S-Labeled material in the culture supernatant consisted exclusively of intact CSPG, whereas 35S-Labeled molecules in the cellular preparation consisted largely of free chondroitin sulfate chains. Only 8.3% of the cellular material, isolated from the microsomal fraction, was intact CSPG. In pulse-chase experiments maximal secretion of CSPG was found after 4 h, comprising approximately 40% of totally synthesized CSPG. From these experiments we tentatively conclude that a small proportion of CSPG synthesized by LICR-LON-HMy2 cells is membrane-associated, a larger portion is secreted, and another portion is intracellularly degraded."
