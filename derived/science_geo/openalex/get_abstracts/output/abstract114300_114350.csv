https://openalex.org/W2073125666,"We have used the caged calcium compound DM-nitrophen to investigate the kinetics of calcium-dependent secretion in bovine chromaffin cells. Perfusion with partially calcium-loaded nitrophen often caused a loading transient--slow secretion for up to 1 min due to displacement of Ca2+ by cytoplasmic Mg2+. Flash photolysis elicited 100 microM [Ca2+]i steps that evoked intense secretion, lasting a few seconds. In cells experiencing a loading transient, [Ca2+]i steps evoked an especially fast secretion. A persistent, slow secretion often followed these fast phases. Distinct kinetic components may reflect secretion from pools that are differentially capable of release. Both secretion and movement of vesicles between pools appear to be [Ca2+]i sensitive. Later [Ca2+]i steps sometimes evoked a rapid capacitance decrease, indicating a fast, [Ca2+]i-dependent phase of endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2087849583,"A low molecular weight intracellular tracer, Neurobiotin, was injected into single neurons in living slices of rat neocortex made at postnatal days 5–18. Between days 5 and 12, 66% of single-neuron injections labeled clusters of up to 80 neurons surrounding the injected cell. Coupling between neurons occurred primarily through dendrites. Injections done in the presence of halothane, a gap junction blocker, abolished the spread of tracer to surrounding neurons, implying that gap junctions mediate coupling. Injections done after day 16 resulted in little or no dye coupling. We conclude that transient local coupling via gap junctions in developing cortex may provide a pathway for communicating intercellular signals, including subthreshold electrical activity, and thereby enable temporal coordination of local neuronal ensembles during circuit formation."

https://openalex.org/W2069254216,"N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or non-NMDA receptor activation is sufficient to induce transcription of the immediate early gene c-fos in a calcium-requiring manner. We sought to determine whether the calcium-dependent mechanisms inducing c-fos transcription are identical following activation of these two receptor subtypes. We used in situ hybridization and fura-2 imaging to detect c-fos mRNA and intracellular calcium in individual dentate gyrus neurons maintained in vitro. Structurally distinct inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase abolished NMDA-but not kainic acid-induced increases of c-fos mRNA. Conversely, the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium markedly inhibited kainic acid- but not NMDA-mediated increases of c-fos mRNA. We propose that the dissociation in the mechanisms transducing the calcium influx signals to the nucleus following NMDA and non-NMDA receptor activation is due to spatially distinct sites of calcium entry, resulting in activation of different enzymes located at distinct sites in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1574489576,"The human p53 tumor suppressor gene product can activate transcription by RNA polymerase II in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as in human cells. Several viral transcriptional activator proteins have been shown to directly contact TBP, the TATA box-binding subunit of the general initiation factor, TFIID. In this report, we use protein affinity chromatography to show that the cellular transcription factor, p53, interacts directly and specifically with yeast TBP. The TBP binding domain of p53 was localized to its N-terminal 73 amino acids. This highly acidic portion of p53 functions as a transcriptional activation domain and is deleted in some tumors induced by the Friend leukemia virus. A human tumor-derived oncogenic point mutation of p53, which lies outside the activation domain of p53, but reduces its ability to activate transcription, greatly reduced the ability of p53 to bind yeast TBP in vitro. This mutation probably affects the overall conformation of the protein and indirectly interferes with the ability of p53 to contact TBP and activate transcription. In contrast, a mutated oncogenic form of p53 that is unaffected in its ability to activate transcription bound yeast TBP as well as wild type p53. The human TBP activity in a HeLa extract also bound to the activation domain of p53. Our data support a general model in which DNA-bound activator proteins activate transcription by interacting with TBP."
https://openalex.org/W1564179195,"The proenzyme activation peptides predicted from cDNAs encoding each of the granule serine proteases synthesized by cytotoxic lymphocytes and myeloid and mast cells are composed of 2 residues. The mechanism by which these amino-terminal dipeptides are cleaved to generate the active enzymes has not been elucidated. The comparable distribution of dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) and serine proteases and the ability of DPPI to hydrolyze relevant dipeptide sequences suggested a role for DPPI in the processing and activation of granule serine proteases. This study demonstrates that inhibition of DPPI activity is associated with impairment of the generation of granule serine protease activity in CD8(+) T cells, lymphokine-activated killer cells, P815 mastocytoma cells, and U-937 myeloid cells. Inhibition of DPPI resulted in impairment of the generation of cathepsin G enzymatic activity without reduction in the amount of immunoreactive cathepsin G produced. In U-937 cells pulsed with [3H]isoleucine, inhibition of DPPI activity was associated with the accumulation of the inactive proenzyme form of cathepsin G bearing an amino-terminal dipeptide extension to the isoleucine residue that normally occupies the amino terminus of the enzymatically active protein. These results indicate that DPPI plays a requisite role in the post-translational processing and activation of members of the family of granule serine proteases expressed in bone marrow-derived effector cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992064771,"GYKI 52466 is a benzodiazepine molecule that has muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties not attributable to a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-mediated mechanism. Here it is shown that GYKI 52466 exerts no blocking action at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, but acts noncompetitively to block ion currents and associated excitotoxicity, including ischemic neuronal degeneration, mediated through non-NMDA glutamate receptors. The inhibition of non-NMDA responses by GYKI 52466 is antagonized by cyclothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, and diazoxide, benzothiadiazide drugs that inhibit non-NMDA receptor desensitization. These results suggest that non-NMDA receptor-ion channel complexes may contain a novel benzodiazepine recognition site where receptor desensitization is regulated; this postulated site represents a promising new target for rational development of drugs to treat neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1587638614,"Guanosine 3‘,5‘-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) accumulates in bacteria in response to either amino acid or energy source starvation. Here we demonstrate that levels of ppGpp similar to those induced by amino acid starvation inhibit the rate of protein synthesis by 84-91%. The intracellular concentration of ppGpp is manipulated in our studies by increasing the expression of a truncated relA gene encoding a smaller but catalytically active peptide with ppGpp synthetase activity. We find that the intracellular activity of the truncated RelA peptide is insensitive to chloramphenicol, unlike the product of the wild-type relA gene, ppGpp synthetase I. Previously, this same ppGpp expression system was used (Schreiber, G., Metzger, S., Aizenman, E., Roza, S., Cashel, M., and Glaser, G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 226, 3760-3767) to demonstrate that increasing the ppGpp concentration inhibits growth and ribosomal RNA transcription, and they found suggestive evidence for ppGpp inhibition of protein synthesis. We further investigated the effect of ppGpp on protein synthesis and find that ppGpp is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis as well as glycerol accumulation but has no effect on transport of methionine, the amino acid used in measuring protein synthesis rates, or on uptake of alpha-methylglucoside, a non-metabolizable analogue of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2156639496,"Activation of platelets by thrombin results in a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on multiple cellular proteins (Ferrell, J. E., and Martin, G. S. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 3603-3610; Golden, A., and Brugge, J. S. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 901-905; Nakamura, S., and Yamamura, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7089-7091). However, none of the responsible protein-tyrosine kinase has been reported so far. We report here that p72syk, one of the non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases, is activated following thrombin stimulation in blood platelets. Washed porcine platelets were stimulated by thrombin, and the activation of p72syk was assessed in an immunoprecipitation kinase assay. The activity of p72syk increased within 5 s, reached a maximum at 10 s, and decreased to a basal level within 60 s after 0.5 unit/ml thrombin stimulation. The amount of immunoprecipitated p72syk was not altered throughout the time course. This activation was greatly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner and was completely canceled by the pretreatment of platelet suspension with hirudin, a specific antagonist of thrombin. In the Ca(2+)-depleted condition both extra- and intracellularly, the activation of p72syk was still persistent; in contrast, the deactivation process was completely abrogated even at 120 s after thrombin stimulation. In addition, the replenishment of Ca2+ resulted in a similar deactivation pattern as seen in the Ca(2+)-rich condition. Furthermore, this deactivation was also canceled by the pretreatment of platelets with W7, a calmodulin antagonist, as well as ML9, a myosin-light-chain kinase inhibitor. These results indicate that p72syk can be a responsible enzyme to the protein-tyrosine phosphorylation events following the platelet activation by thrombin and may be negatively regulated by Ca2+ in a calmodulin-dependent manner, inter alia myosin light-chain kinase, in thrombin-stimulated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1590372415,"The present study demonstrates that the human adenovirus (Ad) can augment transfer and expression of a gene within plasmid DNA unmodified by nonspecific linkers or by linker-ligand complexes. Following the transfection of COS-7 cells with pRSVL, a luciferase expression plasmid vector directed by the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter, luciferase activity in the target cells was 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold higher when the cells were also infected with Ad-CFTR, a replication-deficient recombinant Ad containing human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cDNA. The enhancement of luciferase gene expression in COS-7 cells was also observed with Ad-dl312 (a replication-deficient E1a deletion mutant Ad with no exogenous gene) and wild type Ad5. The efficiency of cell transfection with pRSVL in the presence of an Ad was achieved in a dose-dependent fashion with progressively higher luciferase activity in cells infected by increasing amounts of Ad-CFTR, Ad-dl312, or Ad5. The augmentation by Ad-CFTR of the transfer and expression of the luciferase gene in cells was similar to that of another transfection reagent, cationic liposomes. Further, when Ad-CFTR and liposomes were used in combination, 4- to 100-fold more efficient expression of the luciferase gene was achieved than with Ad-CFTR or liposomes alone. When COS-7, HeLa, and CV-1 cells were evaluated in parallel in the presence or absence of liposomes, Ad-mediated enhancement of luciferase activity was observed in all cell lines. Thus, exposure of target cells to replication-deficient or competent human Ad will markedly augment transfer and expression of the genes within plasmid DNA in mammalian cells in vitro without modifying the plasmid with linkers or linker-ligand complexes, a strategy that should be useful for in vitro and in vivo gene transfer applications."
https://openalex.org/W2011330893,"N-myc is a developmentally regulated proto-oncogene encoding a putative sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Previous studies on tissue distribution of N-myc transcripts indicated that one of the major sites of N-myc expression is the CNS and neural crest derivatives in developing embryos. We investigated N-Myc protein expression in embryonic neural tissues and found that the protein was usually localized in the nucleus, but accumulated in the cytoplasm upon differentiation of specific classes of neurons, e.g., retinal ganglion cells, neurons of spinal ganglia, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. The change of localization of N-Myc from the nucleus to the cytoplasm indicates a novel feature of regulation of myc family proteins and suggests functions of N-myc in the cytoplasm of maturing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1495517293,"We examined the effects of yeast actin NH2-terminal mutations on actomyosin interactions and the function of actin in vivo through measurements of actin-activated ATPase activity, cosedimentation with rabbit muscle myosin subfragment 1 (S-1), in vitro motility, and invertase secretion assays. As reported earlier (Cook, R. K., Blake, W., and Rubenstein, P. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9430-9436), elimination of NH2-terminal acidic residues from yeast actin results in an increased actin bundling, decreased actin-activated S-1 ATPase, and complete inhibition of actin filament sliding over myosin. Here we show that the addition of 2 new acidic residues to the NH2 terminus of yeast actin increased the Vmax value and the catalytic efficiency of the actin-activated ATPase activity of S-1. However, the binding of actin to S-1 in the presence of ATP and the velocities of actin sliding over myosin in the in vitro motility assays were not affected by this mutation. Thus, the number of actin NH2-terminal negative charges is important for actin activation of myosin S-1 ATPase activity, while only a minimum number of acidic residues is required for actin sliding over myosin in vitro. The number of actin NH2-terminal negative charges therefore appears to determine the efficiency with which the energy from ATP hydrolysis is converted to filament sliding."
https://openalex.org/W1606654234,"Coexpression of the yeast N-myristyltransferase with the murine catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in prokaryotic cells results in the N-myristylation of the recombinant catalytic subunit. The acylated recombinant catalytic subunit was purified following in vitro holoenzyme formation with a mutant form of the regulatory subunit and compared to the non-myristylated recombinant enzyme and to the mammalian porcine enzyme. All three enzymes are very similar in terms of their kinetic properties and their capacity to reassociate in vitro with the regulatory subunit to form holoenzyme. In contrast, the myristylated recombinant catalytic subunit is significantly more stable to thermal denaturation than the non-myristylated enzyme. Its thermal stability is now comparable to the mammalian enzyme. All three catalytic subunits are significantly more stable to thermal denaturation when they are part of the holoenzyme complex. Each shows an increase in T1/2 of 10 degrees C. This study demonstrates that one function for the myristic acid at the NH2 terminus of the catalytic subunit is to provide structural stability."

https://openalex.org/W1961430621,"Abstract Brefeldin A (BFA) rapidly blocks anterograde exocytotic transport through the Golgi complex. Sustained retrograde traffic induced by brefeldin A causes redistribution of constituents of the Golgi, but not the trans-Golgi network (TGN), to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the present study on HepG2 cells, we have observed a differential effect of BFA on transport from the TGN of two soluble proteins: alpha 1-antitrypsin as a representative of secretory proteins and cathepsin D as a prototype of lysosomal enzymes. The Golgi complex of HepG2 cells is sensitive to BFA, as within minutes after its addition nearly all activity of three resident Golgi enzymes was recovered in the ER as monitored by cell fractionation on sucrose density gradients. In accordance with this, high mannose-glycosylated alpha 1-antitrypsin was retained in or transported back to the ER. Complex-glycosylated alpha 1-antitrypsin was neither secreted into the medium nor transported back to the ER. Most of it was retained in vesicles with the buoyant density of Golgi. These vesicles contained the fluid phase endocytotic marker horseradish peroxidase when this was added to the culture medium prior to the BFA, suggesting that the vesicles derived from the TGN. After BFA addition, the compartment became inaccessible to endocytosed horseradish peroxidase. In contrast to blocking transport of complex alpha 1-antitrypsin, BFA did not affect processing of newly synthesized complex-glycosylated procathepsin D (53 kDa) to the mature 31-kDa form. Neither did it interfere with processing of endocytosed procathepsin D. That the mature cathepsin D had indeed reached the lysosomes was verified by Percoll density gradient fractionation. In conclusion, in HepG2 cells, BFA induces two blocks in the secretory pathway: one at the level of the ER-Golgi juncture and the other in the TGN. In contrast, transport from the Golgi complex to the lysosomes and from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes continued."
https://openalex.org/W2116033626,"The x-ray crystal structures of normal human transthyretin (prealbumin) and the amyloidogenic Val-30-Met variant have been refined at 1.7-A resolution to R-values of 0.168 and 0.179, respectively, for 19,882 and 20,362 reflections (Fobs > 2.0 sigma). Standard deviations for stereochemical parameters are 0.018 and 0.022 A for bond distances, 0.030 and 0.038 A for angle distances, and 0.035 and 0.070 A for planar 1-4 distances. The newly refined normal structure shows improvement over the original structure of Blake and Swan (Blake, C. C. F., and Swan, I. D. A. (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 61, 217-224) in stereochemistry and in the conformation of the loop regions. Residues Arg-103, Thr-123, Asn-124, and Pro-125 have now been resolved, and residues 1-9 and 126-127 have been modeled with the aid of simulated annealing refinement. The functional form of transthyretin is a tetramer, having a cylindrical cavity which will bind thyroxine and an exterior binding site for the complex of retinol with retinol-binding protein. The monomer is a beta barrel flattened to become more like a sandwich with residue 30 in the interior. The methionyl for valyl substitution forces the beta sheets of the monomer as much as 1 A apart, resulting in a distortion of the thyroxine-binding cavity, in agreement with the independent observations that the Met-30 variant has low affinity for thyroxine."
https://openalex.org/W1587930565,"The structure of the Ala-109–>Thr mutation of human transthyretin, a nonamyloidogenic variant with enhanced thyroxine binding, has been determined by x-ray diffraction to a resolution of 1.7 A. The model, including 175 solvent water molecules, has been refined by constrained least squares to an R-value of 0.157. The standard deviations for protein geometry are 0.016 A for bond distances, 0.5 degree for bond angles, 0.031 A for 1-4 distances, and 0.005 A for deviations of planar groups from their least squares plane. The estimated error in protein atomic coordinates is 0.12 A. Residue 109 extends inward between the two beta sheets which form the major component of the monomer, as does the side chain of residue 30 in the amyloidogenic Met-30 variant. Comparison of the Thr-109 structure with that of the normal shows that the extra atoms of the threonine fit into empty space between sheets and make no extensive changes to the molecular conformation. The substitution at 109 causes small local changes in the secondary structure of the A, G, and H strands resulting in a shift of residues 15-17, 108-110, and 117 in each monomer. The thyroxine-binding sites of the Thr-109 and Met-30 variants and of the normal protein are compared, and the results suggest that the variation in affinity for thyroxine between the three proteins may arise from differences in the size of the binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1627217318,"We have begun to study the structural requirements for the binding of formyl peptides to their specific receptors. As an initial approach, we constructed C5a-formyl peptide receptor chimeras. Unique (and identical) restriction sites were introduced within the transmembrane domains of these receptors that allowed for the exchange of specific areas. Four types of chimeric receptors were generated. 1) The C5a receptor was progressively substituted by the formyl peptide receptor. 2) The formyl peptide receptor was progressively substituted by the C5a receptor. 3) Specific domains of the C5a receptor were substituted by the corresponding domain of the formyl peptide receptor. 4) Specific domains of the formyl peptide receptor were replaced by the same corresponding domain of the C5a receptor. Wild type and chimeric receptors were transfected into COS 7 cells and their ability to bind formyl peptide determined, taking into account efficiency of transfection and expression of chimeric protein. Based on these results, a ligand binding model is presented in which the second, third, and fourth extracellular (and/or their transmembrane) domains together with the first transmembrane domain form a ligand binding pocket for formyl peptides. It is proposed that the amino-terminal domain plays a role by presumably providing a lid to the pocket. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail appears to modulate ligand binding by regulating receptor affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1532950149,"Abstract Development of inhibitors specific for the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine-linked sugar chains has been undertaken in the hopes that these compounds may serve as tools to elucidate the roles of complex carbohydrates in biological recognition events. We report here the first example of a glycosyltransferase acceptor analog in which strategic replacement of a nonreacting hydroxyl group with a larger substituent produces a molecule which is recognized by the enzyme but does not react because of a block to the glycosyl transfer reaction. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from the sugar nucleotide donor UDP-GlcNAc to the 6-OH group of mannose in the synthetic trisaccharide acceptor beta GlcNAc(1-->2)alpha Man(1-->6)beta Glc-O(CH2)7CH3 (Km = 23 +/- 2 microM; Vmax = 116 +/- 3 pmol/h) to form the tetrasaccharide beta GlcNAc(1-->2)(beta GlcNAc(1-->6))alpha Man(1-->6)beta Glc-O(CH2)7CH3. The acceptor analog produced by replacement of the adjacent nonreacting 4-OH group of the mannose residue with an O-methyl group was not a substrate for the enzyme but was found to be a good competitive inhibitor of GlcNAc transferase V with Ki = 14 +/- 2 microM. To test the theory that it was the presence of the large methyl group which prevented the glycosyl transfer reaction the 4'-deoxygenated analog was synthesized. It was found to be a good substrate with Km = 74 +/- 6 microM and an almost 5-fold higher kcat (Vmax = 535 +/- 13 pmol/h). NMR data show no evidence of important conformational differences between the trisaccharide analogs, and kinetic experiments detected no differences for the binding of UDP-GlcNAc in their presence. The conclusion was therefore reached that the large methyl group introduced on O-4' sterically prevented the formation of product even though both potential substrates were bound by the enzyme. This steric exclusion strategy offers potential for the design of inhibitors for that class of glycosyltransferases in which the reactive hydroxyl group is also an essential recognition element."
https://openalex.org/W1558921401,"Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used for the detailed characterization and quantification of the secondary structure of bovine rhodopsin in native disc membranes. FTIR spectra were obtained in aqueous media, both in 1H2O and in 2H2O. Analysis of spectra by means of Fourier self-deconvolution, complemented with maximum likelihood restoration and Fourier derivative, has allowed the characterization of major amide I secondary structure-sensitive component bands of structural relevance which had not been detected before. In consequence, we show a richer secondary structure for rhodopsin than previously described. Our results indicate a total regular helix content around 51%, which would include not only the main alpha 1-type helix but also 3(10)-like helix. The presence of distorted helicoid sequences might furthermore increase to a certain extent the total helix amount. It is also indicated that a significant proportion of the amino acid residues are involved in extended/beta-structures and in reverse turns, as well as in random segments, which had not been directly demonstrated before. 61 +/- 4% of rhodopsin is determined to be solvent-accessible, which is a substantially higher value than previously reported. Helices account for most of the inaccessible moiety."

https://openalex.org/W1558517979,"Yeast tRNA ligase possesses multiple activities which are required for the joining of tRNA halves during the tRNA splicing process: cyclic phosphodiesterase, kinase, adenylylate synthetase, and ligase. A deletion polypeptide of a dihydrofolate reductase-ligase fusion protein, designated DAC, was previously shown to join tRNA halves although ATP-dependent kinase activity was not measurable in the assay used. We describe here a characterization of the mechanism of joining used by DAC and the structure of the tRNA product. DAC produces a joined tRNA and a splice junction with a structure identical to that produced by DAKC, the full-length dihydrofolate reductase-ligase fusion. Furthermore, DAC can use GTP as the sole cofactor in the joining reaction, in contrast to DAKC, which can only complete splicing in the presence of ATP. Both enzymes exhibit GTP-dependent kinase activity at 100-fold greater efficiency than with ATP. These results suggest that a potential function for the center domain of tRNA ligase (missing in DAC) is to provide structural integrity and aid in substrate interactions and specificity. They also support the hypothesis that ligase may prefer to use two different cofactors during tRNA splicing."

One zinc appears to be involved in catalysis, as described for adenosine deaminase (Sharaff, A. J., Wilson, D. K., Chang, Z., and Quiocho, F. A. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 226, 917-921) and cytidine deaminase (Yang, C., Carlow, D., Wolfenden, R., and Short, S. A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 4168-4174). This thesis is supported by the finding that the enzyme loses about 80% of its activity in the presence of o-phenanthroline. It has also been found that zinc is released when the enzyme is denatured in the presence of the metallochromic indicator, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol. Renaturation of the deaminase to an active form occurred in the presence but not in the absence of zinc. The second atom of zinc is proposed to be located in a region of T4-dCMP deaminase that resembles a zinc finger. This region, which has the sequence His-X3-Cys-X14-His-X3-His, would represent a zinc-binding motif that has not been described previously."
https://openalex.org/W1511146279,"We have reported that the calcium pump in liver plasma membranes is coupled to Gs or a Gs-like protein. However, we show here that isoproterenol, which activated adenylyl cyclase via Gs, had no effect on the calcium pump, while human calcitonin, human parathyroid hormone, and mini-glucagon, which inhibited this system, did not affect adenylyl cyclase activity. In order to determine the nature of the G protein coupled to the calcium pump, we used the RM antibody, raised against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of Gs alpha, which antagonized adenylyl cyclase activation by isoproterenol or glucagon. The RM antibody specifically blocked calcium pump inhibition by mini-glucagon, calcitonin, or parathyroid hormone, while it did not affect guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) inhibition. Its effect was mimicked by the corresponding decapeptide RMHLRQYELL. The AS/7 antibody, reactive with Gt alpha, Gi 1 alpha, and Gi2 alpha, was ineffective. Complementation of liver plasma membranes with in vitro translated Gs alpha-2, the large form of Gs alpha, led to a 40% decrease in calcium pump activity, with a parallel 2-fold increase in adenylyl cyclase activity. In vitro translated Gi1 alpha did not affect the calcium pump activity, while it evoked a 40% inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. We conclude that a same Gs alpha may be coupled either to the calcium pump or to adenylyl cyclase. However, Gs is functionally specialized, since it does not ensure cross-talk between the two receptor-effector systems. These results point out the possible compartmentalization of Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1530747259,"We have studied the expression of the hepatic GSH transport system in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Injection of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA resulted in the functional expression of the GSH transport system determined as GSH efflux from GSH loaded oocytes. Expression required 3-5 days to process the liver mRNA. Methionine, cystathionine, and sulfobromophthalein (BSP)-GSH inhibited the efflux of GSH from liver mRNA-injected oocytes according to their known cis or transactions on hepatocytes, namely BSP-GSH from inside and methionine and cystathionine from outside. The expressed hepatic GSH transport system also mediated the uptake of intact GSH into the oocyte, consistent with the bidirectional operation of this facilitative transporter. The uptake of GSH into mRNA-injected oocytes was inhibited by BSP-GSH in chloride-free conditions. Finally, two different mRNA size fractions encoded for hepatic GSH transport activity (uptake or efflux): a 2.0-2.5-kilobase size class, which expressed GSH transport (uptake or efflux) completely inhibited by BSP-GSH (compatible with sinusoidal GSH transport), and a 3.5-4.0-kilobase size class, which expressed GSH transport (uptake or efflux) not inhibited by BSP-GSH. These results demonstrate that hepatic GSH transport can be expressed in Xenopus oocytes and mRNA of two distinct sizes encode for GSH transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1606253967,"Intronic transcriptional regulatory regions are found in several collagen genes. We demonstrate here the importance of two distinct cis-acting elements for the activity of a transcriptional enhancer located in the first intron of the mouse pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene. Enhancer subfragments were tested for their ability to stimulate a linked promoter following transient transfection into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. A 92-base pair subfragment retained significant enhancer activity. DNase I footprinting identified a binding site for a nuclear factor (designated CIBF-I) within this subfragment. Electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments demonstrated that an oligonucleotide containing 18 base pairs from the protected region was sufficient for specific binding of CIBF-I and suggested that CIBF-I may be related to a protein(s) that binds to the rat c-mos enhancer. A second cis-acting element, identified by electrophoretic mobility-shift and methylation interference experiments, bound affinity-purified Sp1 and an Sp1-like protein present in crude nuclear extracts. Small deletion mutations in either the CIBF-I or Sp1 site abolished factor binding in vitro and reduced enhancer activity in vivo. Our results represent the first identification of specific cis-acting elements required for full activity of the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen enhancer."

It constitutes a half-molecule of type V adenylylcyclase diverging at the end of the first cytoplasmic loop. Northern blotting study has revealed the presence of such a mRNA species (approximately 3.5 kilobases in size) in the heart. Genomic sequence analysis has revealed that type V-alpha is generated via usage of a polyadenylation signal located within an intronic sequence of type V adenylylcyclase gene. When type V-alpha is co-expressed with an artificially generated half-molecule constituting the latter half of type V adenylylcyclase, the catalytic activity in transfected cell membranes is significantly higher than that of controls. However, when either alone is overexpressed, no significant increase in catalytic activity results. These results indicate that a half-molecule of adenylylcyclase, i.e. a protein containing six-transmembrane spans followed by a single cytoplasmic domain, can be generated in vivo, but catalytic activity is lacking unless heterodimerization can occur. This finding identifies another potential mechanism for generating diversity within this enzyme family."

Recent evidence (Westaway, S.K., Belford, H.G., Apostol, B.L., Abelson, J., and Greer, C.L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2435-2443) demonstrated that the ligase-associated kinase activity is more efficient with GTP as cofactor than with ATP. Employing a ligase fusion construct with dihydrofolate reductase (Apostol, B.L., Westaway, S.K., Abelson, J., and Greer, C.L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7445-7455) for purposes of enzyme purification, we performed joining assays demonstrating that ATP and GTP are the most effective combination of cofactors. ATP was essential to the joining reaction, while UTP, CTP, or ATP replaced GTP inefficiently. Specific and functionally independent binding sites were confirmed for ATP and GTP by direct binding measurement. A third site was implicated in UTP- and CTP-ligase interactions. Comparison of binding constants with Kapp values determined for nucleotide-dependent joining suggested both that nucleotide triphosphate binding may be limiting in tRNA joining and that tRNA ligation occurs most efficiently using GTP for the kinase reaction and ATP as the adenylylate synthetase cofactor."

https://openalex.org/W1563646697,"Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP) is a potent inhibitor of fibrin polymerization. It also causes a concentration-dependent inhibition of the activation of plasminogen by t-PA when soluble desAABB-fibrinogen (fibrin II) or fibrinogen are used as promoters of t-PA. Fibrinogen has a much weaker promoter activity than does fibrin II. Experiments were undertaken to explain the mechanism of action of GPRP on plasminogen activation. Kinetic data indicated that when GPRP was present in the assay system, the fibrin(ogen)-GPRP complex was ineffective as a t-PA promoter. Only the free forms of fibrin II or fibrinogen were promoters of t-PA. GPRP specifically eluted t-PA, which was previously bound to a fibrin-Sepharose column, and also inhibited t-PA binding to fibrin-Sepharose in a concentration-dependent manner. These experiments were compared to those with other tetrapeptides: GHRP, GPGG, and GRGD. Only GHRP, which is known to bind more weakly to fibrin(ogen) than GPRP, had any effect. These results suggest that the GPRP binding site on the fibrin(ogen) molecule is important for t-PA activation and is a binding site for t-PA in the initial interaction between t-PA and fibrin. We propose that at or near the GPRP binding site on fibrin there is an initial binding site for t-PA. We hypothesize that kringle 1, which contains the sequence G128RRP, may be involved in the initial binding of t-PA to fibrin."
https://openalex.org/W2114482889,"Hydrolysis of phospholipids in biological membranes by phospholipase C (PLC) produces an important second messenger molecule, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), that is essential for the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). While the effects of DAG on model membranes have been investigated earlier, studies on physical properties of DAG introduced into phospholipid bilayers by PLC have been lacking. We present an NMR approach for studying structural and kinetic aspects of PLC-mediated hydrolysis of 13 carbonyl-enriched phospholipids in model membranes (small unilamellar vesicles). The product DAG is readily detected by 13C NMR, and its structural properties as well as those of the model membrane can be monitored continuously. PLC hydrolysis was limited to a low proportion of the model membrane by incorporating a small amount of ester phospholipid into a nonhydrolyzable ether-linked phospholipid matrix. Under these conditions, PLC (Bacillus cereus) hydrolyzed only the monolayer of phosphatidylcholine to which it was exposed (the outer monolayer). The 1,2-DAG product remained associated with the membrane bilayer and did not alter bilayer structure in any detectable way. From the chemical shift data, it is inferred that the DAG has an interfacial conformation similar to that of phosphatidylcholine. These results show that DAG could activate PKC by direct interaction with the enzyme rather than by perturbation of the membrane bilayer."

https://openalex.org/W1520381959,"By using site-directed mutagenesis and chemical analysis of phosphopeptides, a unique phosphorylation site has been shown at serine 73 in the amino acid sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae acidic ribosomal protein YP1 beta (L44'). The mutation in this position prevents in vitro phosphorylation by protein kinases that modify the wild-type polypeptide. The unphosphorylatable mutated protein is unable to bind to the ribosomes and to rescue the growth deficiency of yeast strains in which the corresponding original gene is inactivated by gene disruption. Sequencing of tryptic phosphopeptides has shown that acidic proteins YP1 alpha and YP2 alpha (L44) are also phosphorylated at positions near the carboxyl end. These results contrast with the data indicating that in the highly homologous protein YP2 beta, phosphorylation takes place at serine 19, close to the amino terminus. The results show that phosphorylation is definitely required for the biological activity of these ribosomal proteins. However, the differences in the phosphorylation sites suggest that the effect of this modification is not the same in all of them, confirming the heterologous role of these peculiar ribosomal components. In fact, the different context of the modification sites in the four polypeptides suggests the existence of more than one protein kinase specific for this set of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1500523318,"An ommochrome-binding protein (OBP) from the hemolymph of Manduca sexta has recently been purified and characterized. A cDNA clone was isolated from a fifth instar larval cDNA expression library utilizing antiserum against OBP. Northern blot analysis of total fat body RNA detected a transcript of approximately 1.2 kilobases in fifth instar wandering larvae RNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 905-base pair cDNA insert was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The OBP cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 274 residues with a predicted molecular weight of 30,580 and with one consensus N-linked glycosylation site. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of the mature protein and the cDNA sequence revealed a typical signal peptide of 18 amino acids. In wandering stage larvae, the OBP transcript appeared to be at least 250-fold less abundant than ribosomal RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1501141890,"The protein fluorescence of adenosine deaminase (ADA) was perturbed during the deamination of adenosine and four analogues of adenosine. The kinetics for the approach to the steady-state during turnover were monitored by fluorescence changes associated with formation of enzymatic intermediates. These kinetic data and the steady-state kinetic data were analyzed in terms of the kinetic scheme as follows. [formula: see text] The steady-state turnover number was assigned to k2, which was 244 s-1 for adenosine and 1.1 x 10(-3) s-1 for 6-methylamino-2-aminopurine arabinoside (aMDAP). Values for the association rate constants, k1, and the dissociation rate constants, k-1, were calculated from the kinetics for the approach to the steady state. k1 varied from 31 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 for adenosine to 2.8 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 for N-6-methyladenine arabinoside. k-1 varied from 500 s-1 for adenosine to 31 s-1 for aMDAP. The latter value was confirmed (22 s-1) by spectrofluorometrically monitoring the trapping of ADA by excess erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine as aMDAP.ADA dissociated. The ratio of k2 to k-1, which determines the commitment to catalysis, decreased from 0.49 for adenosine to 3.5 x 10(-5) for aMDAP. The Km values calculated from k1, k-1, and k2 were similar to the values determined from steady-state kinetic data. The spectrum of enzyme-bound aMDAP resembled protonated aMDAP."

https://openalex.org/W1911969728,"The transit peptide gene of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia was fused to the tentoxin-resistant beta-subunit gene of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) from Nicotiana tabacum via a linker sequence. The consequent fusion gene encodes the entire gene sequences of both the transit peptide and the beta-subunit of CF1 without a single change of amino acid residues. The fusion gene was in vitro expressed in a coupled transcription-translation system as a 62-kDa precursor and was imported into isolated intact chloroplasts of Nicotiana longiflora. The imported precursor was found to be processed to the expected mature beta-subunit size. Evidence is presented that radioactively labeled beta-subunit was incorporated into mature CF1 and not just nonspecifically associated with the thylakoid membranes. Since the fusion protein containing only the transit peptide sequence was imported and apparently correctly processed, it may not be necessary to include N-terminal amino acids of the mature small subunit for correct proteolytic cleavage in the chloroplast stroma."
