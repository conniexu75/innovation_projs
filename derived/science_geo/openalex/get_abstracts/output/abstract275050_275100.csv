https://openalex.org/W2046077873,"National increases in row crops at the expense of hay and pasture crops, particularly on steeper slopes, have made the control of erosion a difficult prospect. Management practices that fit the various field conditions are needed to accomplish effective erosion control. These measures should be selected on the basis of soil characteristics, landscape type, and the amount of ongoing erosion. The maintenance of a cropland base adequate to our needs must be a primary national goal."
https://openalex.org/W2039769235,Analyses of the clay mineralogy of samples from the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary layer at four localities show that the boundary clay is neither mineralogically exotic nor distinct from locally derived clays above and below the boundary. The significant ejecta component in the clay that is predicted by the asteroid-impact scenario was not detected.

https://openalex.org/W2072277412,"Depending on environmental conditions, the aquatic angiosperm Callitriche heterophylia can develop two different leaf types with distinctive morphological characteristics. Cellular turgor pressure seems to act as the biophysical mechanism responsible for the selection of leaf form in control conditions designed to mimic the natural habitat of this plant. The experimental induction of leaf form involves the ability of various treatments to mediate cell expansion through their effects on turgor pressure or wall extensibility."
https://openalex.org/W2125225368,The helium-4 solar wind flux during the Apollo 11 lunar surface excursion was (6.3 +/- 1.2) x 10(6) atoms per square centimeter per second. The solar wind direction and energy are essentially not perturbed by the moon. Evidence for a lunar solar wind albedo was found.
https://openalex.org/W1977534000,"It has been assumed that all of the nitrogen in oil shale from the Green River Formation is present as organic nitrogen and that the nitrogen in spent shale from retorting is present in the char or coke. In fact, from 41 to 84 percent of the nitrogen is present as ammonium fixed within silicate minerals in five samples of raw oil shale and between 46 and 69 percent of the nitrogen is similarly fixed in two samples of spent shale. Both organic nitrogen and fixed ammonium-nitrogen are lost during retorting by the Fischer assay procedure; the loss of organic nitrogen is greater."

https://openalex.org/W2005886312,"A moth egg assignable to the family Noctuidae (Lepidoptera) is described from 75-million-year-old sediments from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. This sample, which extends the fossil record of this farnily and modern heteroneuran moths back to the Cretaceous, may provide insight into the coevolution of moths and flowering plants, as well as have implications for the evolution of bats."

https://openalex.org/W2051841266,"The development of the principal uses of catalysis in industrial processes since the term was first defined in 1835 to the present are surveyed. The changing economic situation, particularly with relation to the changing types of petroleum resources being used, the increased use of coal as a starting material for various processes, and the need to import larger quantities of noble metals, is discussed as it has provided impetus for catalysis research. Three factors, increased funding, faster computers, and new surface science instruments, that have stimulated great progress in catalysis research are discussed at some length. Some of the surface characterization techniques are summarized in tabular form. (BLM)"

https://openalex.org/W2085489919,"Mariner Mark II is a concept for the next generation of deep-space missions. The project would provide limited, focused sets of Voyager- and Galileo-quality planetary observations at a fraction of the cost of the Voyager and Galileo projects. This article discusses Mariner Mark II's cost goals, scientific objectives, and mission requirements. Strategies for limiting costs include the use of a reconfigurable spacecraft, a multimission ground-support system, and selected new technologies."
