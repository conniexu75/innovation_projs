https://openalex.org/W2032656951,"ZIP8 (SLC39A8) belongs to the ZIP family of metal-ion transporters. Among the ZIP proteins, ZIP8 is most closely related to ZIP14, which can transport iron, zinc, manganese, and cadmium. Here we investigated the iron transport ability of ZIP8, its subcellular localization, pH dependence, and regulation by iron. Transfection of HEK 293T cells with ZIP8 cDNA enhanced the uptake of (59)Fe and (65)Zn by 200 and 40%, respectively, compared with controls. Excess iron inhibited the uptake of zinc and vice versa. In RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, ZIP8-mediated (55)Fe(2+) transport was saturable (K(0.5) of ∼0.7 μm) and inhibited by zinc. ZIP8 also mediated the uptake of (109)Cd(2+), (57)Co(2+), (65)Zn(2+) > (54)Mn(2+), but not (64)Cu (I or II). By using immunofluorescence analysis, we found that ZIP8 expressed in HEK 293T cells localized to the plasma membrane and partially in early endosomes. Iron loading increased total and cell-surface levels of ZIP8 in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. We also determined by using site-directed mutagenesis that asparagine residues 40, 88, and 96 of rat ZIP8 are glycosylated and that N-glycosylation is not required for iron or zinc transport. Analysis of 20 different human tissues revealed abundant ZIP8 expression in lung and placenta and showed that its expression profile differs markedly from ZIP14, suggesting nonredundant functions. Suppression of endogenous ZIP8 expression in BeWo cells, a placental cell line, reduced iron uptake by ∼40%, suggesting that ZIP8 participates in placental iron transport. Collectively, these data identify ZIP8 as an iron transport protein that may function in iron metabolism."

Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammasome signaling are critical for host responses against these pathogens, but how these pathways are integrated remains unclear. Here, we show that TLR4 and the TLR adaptor TRIF are required for inflammasome activation in macrophages infected with the enteric pathogens Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium. In contrast, TLR4 and TRIF were dispensable for Salmonella typhimurium-induced caspase-1 activation. TRIF regulated expression of caspase-11, a caspase-1-related protease that is critical for E. coli- and C. rodentium-induced inflammasome activation, but dispensable for inflammasome activation by S. typhimurium. Thus, TLR4- and TRIF-induced caspase-11 synthesis is critical for noncanonical Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in macrophages infected with enteric pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2079161657,"For cytosine (C) demethylation of vertebrate DNA, it is known that the TET proteins could convert 5-methyl C (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl C (5-hmC). However, DNA dehydroxymethylase(s), or enzymes able to directly convert 5-hmC to C, have been elusive. We present in vitro evidence that the mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not the maintenance enzyme DNMT1, are also redox-dependent DNA dehydroxymethylases. Significantly, intactness of the C methylation catalytic sites of these de novo enzymes is also required for their 5-hmC dehydroxymethylation activity. That DNMT3A and DNMT3B function bidirectionally both as DNA methyltransferases and as dehydroxymethylases raises intriguing and new questions regarding the structural and functional aspects of these enzymes and their regulatory roles in the dynamic modifications of the vertebrate genomes during development, carcinogenesis, and gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2003180569,"In the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is dense enough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading to continuous ""cooling flows"" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet no such cooling flow has been observed. The low observed star formation rates and cool gas masses for these ""cool core"" clusters suggest that much of the cooling must be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runaway cooling flow. Here we report X-ray, optical, and infrared observations of the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2344-4243 at z = 0.596. These observations reveal an exceptionally luminous (L_2-10 keV = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster which hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dM/dt = 3820 +/- 530 Msun/yr). Further, the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive starburst (740 +/- 160 Msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback source responsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may not yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large star formation rate implies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of this cluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than the current picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers."
https://openalex.org/W1998206477,"Apoptosis is an early event of liver damage in diabetes and oxidative stress has been linked to accelerate the apoptosis in hepatocytes. Therefore, the compounds that can scavenge ROS may confer regulatory effects on high-glucose induced apoptosis. In the present study, primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to high concentration (40 mM) of glucose. At this concentration decreased cell viability and enhanced ROS generation was observed. Depleted antioxidant status of hepatocytes under high glucose stress was also observed as evident from transcriptional level and activities of antioxidant enzymes. Further, mitochondrial depolarisation was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial integrity and altered expression of Bax and Bcl-2. Increased translocation of apoptotic proteins like AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) & Endo-G (endonuclease-G) from its resident place mitochondria to nucleus was also observed. Cyt-c residing in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria also translocated to cytoplasm. These apoptotic proteins initiated caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, increased apoptotic DNA content in glucose treated hepatocytes, suggesting mitochondria mediated apoptotic mode of cell death. Morin, a dietary flavonoid from Psidium guajava was effective in increasing the cell viability and decreasing the ROS level. It maintained mitochondrial integrity, inhibited release of apoptotic proteins from mitochondria, prevented DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and hypodiploid DNA upon exposure to high glucose. This study confirms the capacity of dietary flavonoid Morin in regulating apoptosis induced by high glucose via mitochondrial mediated pathway through intervention of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1974822696,"Multiple studies have indicated that the TET oxidases and, more controversially, the activation-induced cytidine deaminase/APOBEC deaminases have the capacity to convert genomic DNA 5-methylcytosine (MeC) into altered nucleobases that provoke excision repair and culminate in the replacement of the original MeC with a normal cytosine (C). We show that human APOBEC3A (A3A) efficiently deaminates both MeC to thymine (T) and normal C to uracil (U) in single-stranded DNA substrates. In comparison, the related enzyme APOBEC3G (A3G) has undetectable MeC to T activity and 10-fold less C to U activity. Upon 100-fold induction of endogenous A3A by interferon, the MeC status of bulk chromosomal DNA is unaltered, whereas both MeC and C nucleobases in transfected plasmid DNA substrates are highly susceptible to editing. Knockdown experiments show that endogenous A3A is the source of both of these cellular DNA deaminase activities. This is the first evidence for nonchromosomal DNA MeC to T editing in human cells. These biochemical and cellular data combine to suggest a model in which the expanded substrate versatility of A3A may be an evolutionary adaptation that occurred to fortify its innate immune function in foreign DNA clearance by myeloid lineage cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2066546505,"Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a recently discovered cytoplasmic heme-binding globin. Although multiple hemeproteins have been reported to function as nitrite reductases in mammalian cells, it is unknown whether Cygb can also reduce nitrite to nitric oxide (NO). The mechanism, magnitude, and quantitative importance of Cygb-mediated nitrite reduction in tissues have not been reported. To investigate this pathway and its quantitative importance, EPR spectroscopy, spectrophotometric measurements, and chemiluminescence NO analyzer studies were performed. Under anaerobic conditions, mixing nitrite with ferrous-Cygb triggered NO formation that was trapped and detected using EPR spin trapping. Spectrophotometric studies revealed that nitrite binding to ferrous-Cygb is followed by formation of ferric-Cygb and NO. The kinetics and magnitude of Cygb-mediated NO formation were characterized. It was observed that Cygb-mediated NO generation increased linearly with the increase of nitrite concentration under anaerobic conditions. This Cygb-mediated NO production greatly increased with acidosis and near-anoxia as occur in ischemic conditions. With the addition of nitrite, soluble guanylyl cyclase activation was significantly higher in normal smooth muscle cells compared with Cygb knocked down cells with Cygb accounting for ∼40% of the activation in control cells and ∼60% in cells subjected to hypoxia for 48 h. Overall, these studies show that Cygb-mediated nitrite reduction can play an important role in NO generation and soluble guanylyl cyclase activation under hypoxic conditions, with this process regulated by pH, oxygen tension, nitrite concentration, and the redox state of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015410269,"Increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass is a hallmark of airway remodeling in severe asthma. Th17-associated cytokines, particularly IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, have been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. To investigate the in vitro effect of Th17 cytokines on the proliferation and survival of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), human ASMCs from asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects were incubated with IL-17A, IL-17F, or IL-22. The aforementioned cytokines demonstrated an ability to promote proliferation and survival of ASMCs from asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects, which were mediated by selective activation of their corresponding receptors on ASMCs, including IL-17RA, IL-17RC, or IL-22R1, respectively. IL-17A and IL-17F-induced proliferation of ASMCs was dependent on ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, while IL-22-induced proliferation involved both ERK1/2 MAPK and NF-κB pathways. The involvement of signaling pathways was further confirmed by the inhibition of proliferation by knockdown of ERK1/2 MAPK or NF-κB p65 expression with pathway-specific siRNA. Together, our results show that Th17-associated cytokines promote proliferation and reduce the apoptotic rate of human ASMCs, raising the possibility that Th17 cytokines may contribute to increasing airway smooth muscle mass and airway remodeling in asthma.—Chang, Y., Al-Alwan, L., Risse, P.-A., Halayko, A.

https://openalex.org/W1965698612,"Using an organic molecular crystal as gain medium allows a maser to be operated in pulsed mode in air, at room temperature and in the terrestrial magnetic field, so avoiding many of the obstacles that have previously hindered the application of masers. The maser is the microwave-frequency precursor of the now ubiquitous laser — or 'optical maser', as it was once known. But it has had little technological impact compared with the laser, in large part because of inconvenience: masers typically require vacuum and/or low-temperature operating conditions. Overcoming these obstacles would pave the way for significant maser-based innovations, including drastically more sensitive measurements across a range of scientific disciplines, from molecular biology to radio astronomy. And, if the history of the laser is any indication, applications not yet dreamt of. Mark Oxborrow, Jonathan Breeze and Neil Alford have now developed a solid-state room-temperature maser, based on an organic molecular crystal, that should enhance the potential of the maser as a tool for science and technology. The invention of the laser has resulted in many innovations, and the device has become ubiquitous. However, the maser, which amplifies microwave radiation rather than visible light, has not had as large an impact, despite being instrumental in the laser’s birth1,2. The maser’s relative obscurity has mainly been due to the inconvenience of the operating conditions needed for its various realizations: atomic3 and free-electron4 masers require vacuum chambers and pumping; and solid-state masers5, although they excel as low-noise amplifiers6 and are occasionally incorporated in ultrastable oscillators7,8, typically require cryogenic refrigeration. Most realizations of masers also require strong magnets, magnetic shielding or both. Overcoming these various obstacles would pave the way for improvements such as more-sensitive chemical assays, more-precise determinations of biomolecular structure and function, and more-accurate medical diagnostics (including tomography) based on enhanced magnetic resonance spectrometers9 incorporating maser amplifiers and oscillators. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a solid-state maser operating at room temperature in pulsed mode. It works on a laboratory bench, in air, in the terrestrial magnetic field and amplifies at around 1.45 gigahertz. In contrast to the cryogenic ruby maser6, in our maser the gain medium is an organic mixed molecular crystal, p-terphenyl doped with pentacene, the latter being photo-excited by yellow light. The maser’s pumping mechanism exploits spin-selective molecular intersystem crossing10 into pentacene’s triplet ground state11,12. When configured as an oscillator, the solid-state maser’s measured output power of around −10 decibel milliwatts is approximately 100 million times greater than that of an atomic hydrogen maser3, which oscillates at a similar frequency (about 1.42 gigahertz). By exploiting the high levels of spin polarization readily generated by intersystem crossing in photo-excited pentacene and other aromatic molecules, this new type of maser seems to be capable of amplifying with a residual noise temperature far below room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2025328157,"RegIIIβ is a member of the C-type lectin family called RegIII. It is known to bind peptidoglycan, and its bactericidal activity shapes the interactions with commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria. However, little is known about its carbohydrate recognition specificity and the bactericidal mechanism, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we show that RegIIIβ can bind directly to LPS by recognizing the carbohydrate moiety of lipid A via a novel motif that is indispensable for its bactericidal activity. This bactericidal activity of RegIIIβ could be inhibited by preincubation with LPS, lipid A, or gentiobiose. The latter is a disaccharide composed of two units of β-(1→6)-linked d-glucose and resembles the carbohydrate moiety of lipid A. Therefore, this structural element may form a key target site recognized by RegIIIβ. Using point-mutated RegIIIβ proteins, we found that amino acid residues in two structural motifs termed ""loop 1"" and ""loop 2,"" are important for peptidoglycan and lipid A binding (Arg-135, Asp-142) and for the bactericidal activity (Glu-134, Asn-136, Asp-142). Thus, the ERN motif and residue Asp-142 in the loop 2 are of critical importance for RegIIIβ function. This provides novel insights into the carbohydrate recognition specificity of RegIIIβ and explains its bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1566384403,"The GABA transporters (GAT1, GAT2, GAT3, and BGT1) have mostly been discussed in relation to their potential roles in controlling the action of transmitter GABA in the nervous system. We have generated the first mice lacking the GAT2 (slc6a13) gene. Deletion of GAT2 (both mRNA and protein) neither affected growth, fertility, nor life span under nonchallenging rearing conditions. Immunocytochemistry showed that the GAT2 protein was predominantly expressed in the plasma membranes of periportal hepatocytes and in the basolateral membranes of proximal tubules in the renal cortex. This was validated by processing tissue from wild-type and knockout mice in parallel. Deletion of GAT2 reduced liver taurine levels by 50%, without affecting the expression of the taurine transporter TAUT. These results suggest an important role for GAT2 in taurine uptake from portal blood into liver. In support of this notion, GAT2-transfected HEK293 cells transported [(3)H]taurine. Furthermore, most of the uptake of [(3)H]GABA by cultured rat hepatocytes was due to GAT2, and this uptake was inhibited by taurine. GAT2 was not detected in brain parenchyma proper, excluding a role in GABA inactivation. It was, however, expressed in the leptomeninges and in a subpopulation of brain blood vessels. Deletion of GAT2 increased brain taurine levels by 20%, suggesting a taurine-exporting role for GAT2 in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2004879716,"The Janus kinase-2 (Jak2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway is critical for promoting an oncogenic and metastatic phenotype in several types of cancer including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma. This study describes two small molecule inhibitors of the Jak2-STAT3 pathway, FLLL32 and its more soluble analog, FLLL62. These compounds are structurally distinct curcumin analogs that bind selectively to the SH2 domain of STAT3 to inhibit its phosphorylation and dimerization. We hypothesized that FLLL32 and FLLL62 would induce apoptosis in RCC and melanoma cells and display specificity for the Jak2-STAT3 pathway. FLLL32 and FLLL62 could inhibit STAT3 dimerization in vitro. These compounds reduced basal STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3), and induced apoptosis in four separate human RCC cell lines and in human melanoma cell lines as determined by Annexin V/PI staining. Apoptosis was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis of caspase-3 processing and PARP cleavage. Pre-treatment of RCC and melanoma cell lines with FLLL32/62 did not inhibit IFN-γ-induced pSTAT1. In contrast to FLLL32, curcumin and FLLL62 reduced downstream STAT1-mediated gene expression of IRF1 as determined by Real Time PCR. FLLL32 and FLLL62 significantly reduced secretion of VEGF from RCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner as determined by ELISA. Finally, each of these compounds inhibited in vitro generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These data support further investigation of FLLL32 and FLLL62 as lead compounds for STAT3 inhibition in RCC and melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1965651809,"KCNMA1 encodes the α-subunit of the large conductance, voltage and Ca(2+)-activated (BK) potassium channel and has been reported as a target gene of genomic amplification at 10q22 in prostate cancer. To investigate the prevalence of the amplification in other human cancers, the copy number of KCNMA1 was analyzed by fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) in 2,445 tumors across 118 different tumor types. Amplification of KCNMA1 was restricted to a small but distinct fraction of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer with the highest prevalence in invasive ductal breast cancers and serous carcinoma of ovary and endometrium (3-7%). We performed an extensive analysis on breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) of 1,200 tumors linked to prognosis. KCNMA1 amplification was significantly associated with high tumor stage, high grade, high tumor cell proliferation, and poor prognosis. Immunofluorescence revealed moderate or strong KCNMA1 protein expression in 8 out of 9 human breast cancers and in the breast cancer cell line MFM223. KCNMA1-function in breast cancer cell lines was confirmed by whole-cell patch clamp recordings and proliferation assays, using siRNA-knockdown, BK channel activators such as 17ß-estradiol and the BK-channel blocker paxilline. Our findings revealed that enhanced expression of KCNMA1 correlates with and contributes to high proliferation rate and malignancy of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2046657713,"Compelling evidence from both human and animal studies suggests a physiological link between the circadian rhythm and metabolism but the underlying mechanism is still incompletely understood. We examined the role of PPARγ, a key regulator of energy metabolism, in the control of physiological and behavioral rhythms by analyzing two strains of whole-body PPARγ null mouse models. Systemic inactivation of PPARγ was generated constitutively by using Mox2-Cre mice (MoxCre/flox) or inducibly by using the tamoxifen system (EsrCre/flox/TM). Circadian variations in oxygen consumption, CO(2) production, food and water intake, locomotor activity, and cardiovascular parameters were all remarkably suppressed in MoxCre/flox mice. A similar phenotype was observed in EsrCre/flox/TM mice, accompanied by impaired rhythmicity of the canonical clock genes in adipose tissues and liver but not skeletal muscles or the kidney. PPARγ inactivation in isolated preadipocytes following exposure to tamoxifen led to a similar blockade of the rhythmicity of the clock gene expression. Together, these results support an essential role of PPARγ in the coordinated control of circadian clocks and metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2024656166,"Cancer cell invasion is a key element in metastasis that requires integrins for adhesion/de-adhesion, as well as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for focalized proteolysis. Herein we show that MMP-2 is up-regulated in resected colorectal tumors and degrades β1 integrins with the release of fragments containing the β1 I-domain. The β1 cleavage pattern is similar to that produced by digestion of α5β1 and α2β1 with MMP-2. Two such fragments, at 25 and 75 kDa, were identified after immunoprecipitation, with monoclonal antibody BD610468 reacting with the NH2-terminal I-like ectodomain followed by SDS-PAGE and microsequencing using electrospray (ISI-Q-TOF-Micromass) spectrometry. Cleavage of the β1 integrin can be abolished by inhibition of MMP-2 activity; it can be induced by up-regulation of MMP-2 expression, as exemplified by HT29 colon cancer cells transfected with pCMV6-XL5-MMP-2. Co-immunoprecipitation studies of colon cancer cells showed that the β1 integrin subunit is associated with MMP-2. The MMP-2-mediated shedding of the I-like domain from β1 integrins resulted in decreased adhesion of colon cancer cells to collagen and fibronectin, thus abolishing their receptivity. Furthermore, such cells showed enhanced motility as evaluated by a “wound healing-like” assay and time-lapse microscopy, indicating their increased invasiveness. Altogether, our data demonstrate that MMP-2 amplifies the motility of colon cancer cells, not only by digesting the extracellular matrix components in the vicinity of cancer cells but also by inactivating their major β1 integrin receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2026166853,"Interaction networks are central elements of ecological systems and have very complex structures. Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species (“niche forbidden links”), neutral processes create “neutral forbidden links” due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization."

In cancer cells, deregulation of the iron metabolism induces oxidative stress and drives tumor progression and metastasis; however, the molecular mechanisms of iron homeostasis are not fully understood.

Transfection of miR-210 decreases the uptake of transferrin by inhibiting the expression of TfR. In addition, inhibition of miR-210 by anti-miR-210 up-regulates ISCU expression.

https://openalex.org/W1991863474,"The flagellar motor is one type of propulsion device of motile bacteria. The cytoplasmic ring (C-ring) of the motor interacts with the stator to generate torque in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The C-ring is composed of three proteins, FliM, FliN, and FliG. Together they form the ""switch complex"" and regulate switching and torque generation. Here we report the crystal structure of the middle domain of FliM in complex with the middle and C-terminal domains of FliG that shows the interaction surface and orientations of the proteins. In the complex, FliG assumes a compact conformation in which the middle and C-terminal domains (FliG(MC)) collapse and stack together similarly to the recently published structure of a mutant of FliG(MC) with a clockwise rotational bias. This intramolecular stacking of the domains is distinct from the intermolecular stacking seen in other structures of FliG. We fit the complex structure into the three-dimensional reconstructions of the motor and propose that the cytoplasmic ring is assembled from 34 FliG and FliM molecules in a 1:1 fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1976859826,"The idea of a ‘pain matrix’ specifically devoted to the processing of nociceptive inputs has been challenged. Alternative views now propose that the activity of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI, SII), the insula and cingulate cortex may be related to a basic defensive system through which significant potentially dangerous events for the body's integrity are detected. By reviewing the role of the SI, SII, the cingulate and the insular cortices in the perception of nociceptive and tactile stimuli, in attentional, emotional and reward tasks, and in interoception and memory, we found that all these task-related networks overlap in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula and the dorsal medial thalamus. A thorough analysis revealed that the ‘pain-related’ network shares important functional similarities with both somatomotor-somatosensory networks and emotional-interoceptive ones. We suggest that these shared areas constitute the central part of an adaptive control system involved in the processing and integration of salient information coming both from external and internal sources. These areas are activated in almost all fMRI tasks and have been indicated to play a pivotal role in switching between externally directed and internally directed brain networks."
https://openalex.org/W2154845344,"Vibrio cholerae is the cause of the diarrheal disease cholera. V. cholerae produces RtxA, a large toxin of the MARTX family, which is targeted to the host cell cytosol, where its actin cross-linking domain (ACD) cross-links G-actin, leading to F-actin depolymerization, cytoskeleton rearrangements, and cell rounding. These effects on the cytoskeleton prevent phagocytosis and bacterial engulfment by macrophages, thus preventing V. cholerae clearance from the gut. The V. cholerae Type VI secretion-associated VgrG1 protein also contains a C-terminal ACD, which shares 61% identity with MARTX ACD and has been shown to covalently cross-link G-actin. Here, we purified the VgrG1 C-terminal domain and determined its crystal structure. The VgrG1 ACD exhibits a V-shaped three-dimensional structure, formed of 12 β-strands and nine α-helices. Its active site comprises five residues that are conserved in MARTX ACD toxin, within a conserved area of ∼10 Å radius. We showed that less than 100 ACD molecules are sufficient to depolymerize the actin filaments of a fibroblast cell in vivo. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that Glu-16 is critical for the F-actin depolymerization function. Co-crystals with divalent cations and ATP reveal the molecular mechanism of the MARTX/VgrG toxins and offer perspectives for their possible inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2102296441,"The aspartic protease cathepsin D, a poor prognostic indicator of breast cancer, is abundantly secreted as procathepsin D by human breast cancer cells and self-activates at low pH in vitro, giving rise to catalytically active cathepsin D. Due to a lower extracellular pH in tumor microenvironments compared to normal tissues, cathepsin D may cleave pathophysiological substrates contributing to cancer progression. Here, we show by yeast 2-hybrid and degradomics analyses that cystatin C, the most potent natural secreted inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, both binds to and is a substrate of extracellular procathepsin D. The amount of cystatin C in the extracellular environment is reduced in the secretome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably transfected with human cathepsin D. Cathepsin D extensively cleaved cystatin C in vitro at low pH. Cathepsin D secreted by breast cancer cells also processed cystatin C at the pericellular pH of tumors and so enhancing extracellular proteolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins.

To assess the importance of CDH23 mutations in non-syndromic hearing loss, two-step screening was applied and clinical characteristics of the patients with CDH23 mutations were examined in this study. As a first screening, we performed Sanger sequencing using 304 probands compatible with recessive inheritance to find the pathologic mutations. Twenty-six possible mutations were detected to be pathologic in the first screening. For the second screening, using the probes for these 26 mutations, a large cohort of probands (n = 1396) was screened using Taqman amplification-based mutation analysis followed by Sanger sequencing. The hearing loss in a total of 52 families (10 homozygous, 13 compound heterogygous, and 29 heterozygous) was found to be caused by the CDH23 mutations. The majority of the patients showed congenital, high frequency involved, progressive hearing loss. Interestingly, some particular mutations cause late onset moderate hearing loss. The present study is the first to demonstrate the prevalence of CDH23 mutations among non-syndromic hearing loss patients and indicated that mutations of the CDH23 gene are an important cause of non-syndromic hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W2101133174,"Deterioration of the immune and skeletal systems, each of which parallel obesity, reflects a fragile interrelationship between adiposity and osteoimmunology. Using a murine model of diet-induced obesity, this study investigated the ability of mechanical signals to protect the skeletal-immune systems at the tissue, cellular, and molecular level. A long-term (7 mo) high-fat diet increased total adiposity (+62%), accelerated age-related loss of trabecular bone (–61%), and markedly reduced B-cell number in the marrow (–52%) and blood (–36%) compared to mice fed a regular diet. In the final 4 mo of the protocol, the application of low-magnitude mechanical signals (0.2 g at 90 Hz, 15 min/d, 5 d/wk) restored both bone structure and B cells to those levels measured in control mice fed a regular diet. These phenotypic outcomes were achieved, in part, by reductions in osteoclastic activity and a biasing of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation toward the lymphoid B-cell lineage and away from a myeloid fate. These results emphasize that obesity undermines both the skeletal and immune systems, yet brief exposure to mechanical signals, perhaps as a surrogate to the salutary influence of exercise, diminishes the consequences of diabetes and obesity, restoring bone structure and normalizing B-cell populations by biasing of the fate of stem cells through mechanosensitive pathways.—Chan, M. E., Adler, B. J., Green, D. E., Rubin, C. T. Bone structure and B-cell populations, crippled by obesity, are partially rescued by brief daily exposure to low-magnitude mechanical signals.

This report is the first to identify a mechanistic role for a TGFβ-inducible KLF in the silencing of FOXP3 and colitis susceptibility with a particular focus on discovering novel chromatin coupling events that regulate these processes. Our investigation focuses on Polycomb-mediated responses. The Polycomb group chromatin-modifying protein complex (PcG) is a key chromatin remodeling complex, the role for which in lymphocyte gene regulation and biology remains to be fully understood. As opposed to the dynamic regulation of transcription by the activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases, PcG proteins lead to permanent silencing through the activity of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) (15Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in Polycomb-group silencing.Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that site-specific recruitment of PcG to promoters occurs at least in part through Polycomb response elements. Polycomb response elements (PREs) have been defined extensively in Drosophila, but only recently in humans (16Brown J.L. Grau D.J. DeVido S.K. Kassis J.A.

Interestingly, KLF binding sites are present in most well characterized PREs (16Brown J.L. Grau D.J. DeVido S.K. Kassis J.A.

We have extended the recent observation that animals carrying a disruption in a KLF transcription factor (KLF10) are impaired in FOXP3 activation (19Venuprasad K. Huang H. Harada Y. Elly C.

Moreover, we characterize at least one mechanism for reversing this process through antagonism by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), a HAT recruited by KLF10 to the FOXP3 PRE imparting inducibility to this gene and the appropriate capacitation of Treg cells. The biological relevance of these mechanisms is underscored by the discovery that the KLF10-deficient animal is impaired in adaptive FOXP3+ Treg cell generation and develops severe experimentally induced colitis. Collectively, these results increase our understanding of the chromatin pathways key to the function of inducible genes in the immune system and specifically of mechanisms critical to the normal biology of adaptive Treg cells. Gene expression and ChIP-seq data were curated from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, data set GSE14254 (21Wei G. Wei L. Zhu J. Zang C. Hu-Li J. Yao Z. Cui K. Kanno Y. Roh T.Y. Watford W.T. Schones D.E.

CpG island prediction was performed using EMBOSS CPGPLOT at default values (22Larsen F. Gundersen G. Lopez R. Prydz H.

Male mice were used for all experiments related to H3K27 methylation because of concerns regarding random inactivation of the X chromosome in females and the X-linked FOXP3 gene. Murine naïve CD4+ splenocytes were isolated using a combination of magnetic separation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). Sequential use of the CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell isolation kit and the CD4+CD62L+ T cell isolation kit resulted in naïve FOXP3-negative T cells used for in vitro induction of FOXP3. When using the B6.Cg-FOXP3tm2Tch/J mouse, flow cytometry was performed to sort for FOXP3-expressing cells. The cells were sorted on either a FACS Aria cell sorter running with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) or a FACS Vantage SE cell sorter running with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Human naïve CD4+ cells were isolated from anonymous healthy blood donors also using a combination of Miltenyi Biotec beads. Once the CD4+ cells were negatively selected, a positive selection of the CD45RA+ cells yielded the naïve population of T cells. In vitro activation of the isolated T cells followed similar conditions among the different cell types. Anti-CD3, OKT3 (eBioscience) for the Jurkat cells, 145-2C11 (BD Biosciences) for the mouse T cells, and UCHT1 (BD Biosciences) for the human T cells was plate-bound at 2 μg/ml. Soluble anti-CD28 (BD Biosciences) at 2 μg/ml plus 100 units/ml IL-2 was added to the cultures throughout the incubation period. Human TGFβ-1 recombinant (AUSTRAL) at a concentration of 5 ng/ml was used to generate adaptive Treg cells. Total RNA was isolated using the manufacturer protocol in the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 0.5–1 μg of total RNA with random primers using SuperScript® kit III First-Strand (Invitrogen). Two μl reverse transcription products were used for each real time PCR. PCRs were in 20 μl of total volume that contained primers and 10 μl of Express SYBR green ER quantitative PCR Supermaster mixes (Invitrogen). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, genes of interest were amplified under the following conditions: initial denaturation, 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 34 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. All the PCR products were visualized by running 1.5% agarose gels electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining for the pictures. The human FOXP3 (NCBI AF235097) core promoter containing −511 bp from the transcription start site was amplified by PCR using FOXP3 promoter sequence-specific primers from position −511 to +176. The genomic DNA extracted from CD4+ T cells of a healthy donor was used as a template. The PCR product was subcloned in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Similarly, the FOXP3 core promoter plus the first enhancer (E1) in a continuous fragment containing −511 bp to +2738 was also amplified by PCR and subcloned in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Flp-In system (Invitrogen) was used for the generation of a stable human FOXP3 core promoter and FOXP core +E1 promoter Flp-In-Jurkat. Flp-In-Jurkat cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with FOXP3 core or FOXP3 core+E1 in pcDNA5/FLP recombination target vector and the FLP-recombinase vector (pOG44) (pOG44:FOXP3 core or FOXP3 core+E1/pcDNA5/FLP recombination target ratio = 9:1) resulting in a stable integration of the gene of interest at the FLP recombination target site in the genome. For the selective growth test, individual cells were grown in 24-well plates. The culture medium was supplemented with hygromycin at 250 or 100 μg/ml. An additional PRE deletion mutant was generated through deletion of the FOXP3 core element (−511 to +176, supplemental Fig. S1) from the FOXP3 core and FOXP3 core + E1 constructs and rederivation of Flp-In-Jurkat cell lines (Table 1).TABLE 1FOXP3 ChIP Primers ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP isolation kit (Millipore). One to two million Jurkat cells, or 1 × 105 to 5 × 105 murine or human naïve T cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link histones to DNA. Fixed cells were sonicated to yield chromatin fragments of 200–1000 bp. Antibodies used in the ChIP assays included H3K27me3, p300, and acetyl-Histone H4 (Millipore) plus PCAF and CBP (Abcam). DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation with the addition of an inert carrier. Options for critically relevant control samples include total IgG or pre-enriched chromatin (input). We chose to control with pre-enriched chromatin because nonspecific IgG frequently does not control adequately for nonspecific cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the chromatin input generates a more accurate estimation of biases introduced through sonication of chromatin and subsequent PCR (24Northrup D.L. Zhao K. Application of ChIP-Seq and related techniques to the study of immune function.Immunity. 2011; 34: 830-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two million FOXP3 core and FOXP3 core+E1 Flp Jurkat cells were transfected using the Amaxa cell line nucleofector kit V for Jurkat cells according to the optimized protocol provided with the kit. Two μg of plasmid DNA for EZH2, Suz12, and EED were used in the nucleofection procedure. Luciferase assays were done following the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). For siRNA experiments, 600 nm total siRNA was used (300 nm scrambled + 300 nm targeted, ON-TARGET plus siRNA; Thermo Scientific Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Naïve T cells isolated from the CAR transgenic Balb/cJ[Tg]CARdelta1-[Tg]DO11.10 mice were activated for 48 h with either EV or EZH2 at a multiplicity of infection of 250. The cells were activated under the typical stimulation conditions for 7 days and processed through ChIP to determine methylation of H3K27 marks at the FOXP3 core promoter. Standard molecular biology techniques were used to clone full-length EZH2, SUZ12, and EED into pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing at the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility. Epitope-tagged (6XHis-XpressTM) EZH2, as well as empty vector (Ad5CMV), was generated as recombinant adenovirus in collaboration with the Gene Transfer Vector Core at the University of Iowa. C57BL/6J and B6.Cg-FOXP3tm2Tch/J mice (“FOXP3-EGFP mice” co-express EGFP and FOXP3 under the control of the endogenous promoter) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The CAR transgenic mouse was obtained through the NIAID Exchange Program of the National Institutes of Health: Balb/cJ[Tg]CARdelta1-[Tg]DO11.10 mouse line 4285 (25Wan Y.Y. Leon R.P. Marks R.

The mice were age-matched in experiments comparing wild type with KLF10−/−. All animal work was done in accordance with the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were given water supplemented with 3% dextran sulfate sodium salt for 5 days. The water was then replaced with normal drinking water for 3 more days prior to the mice being sacrificed for tissue removal for histology. Flow cytometry was utilized to look at levels of FOXP3 expression within the CD4+ population. Intracellular staining procedures for FOXP3 were followed using the application notes from Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse/rat/human FOXP3 (BioLegend). The mice were weighed daily, and their colon lengths were determined during autopsy. The degree of colitis was quantified using three outcome variables: weight loss, colon histology, and a disease activity index. The disease activity index is an established clinical index of colitis severity encompassing clinical signs of colitis (wasting and hunching of the recipient mouse and the physical characteristics of stool) and an ordinal scale of colonic involvement (thickness and erythema) (27Faubion W.A.

The histologic activity index (maximal score = 10) includes: ulcer (0–1), crypt abscess (0–3), neutrophilic infiltrate (0–3), and thickening of the lamina propria (0–3) (27Faubion W.A. De Jong Y.P.

Statistical analyses were performed using JMP version 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Descriptive analyses including means and standard deviations were performed in normally distributed data. t tests were used to compare means between two groups. Paired t tests were used to compare means between paired samples. A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Brown et al. (16Brown J.L. Grau D.J. DeVido S.K. Kassis J.A.

The mammalian DNA-binding, zinc finger transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), is the vertebrate orthologue to Drosophila Pho, which is one of the few pieces of Polycomb recruitment machinery conserved from fly to human. An additional binding element for GAGA factor has been demonstrated to cooperate with Pho at the PRE (28Mahmoudi T. Zuijderduijn L.M. Mohd-Sarip A. Verrijzer C.P. GAGA facilitates binding of Pleiohomeotic to a chromatinized Polycomb response element.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4147-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analysis of the first 1000 bp upstream from the transcription start site within the mouse FOXP3 promoter reveals consensus sequences for YY1, GAGA factor, and Sp1/KLF binding motifs (Fig. 1). Functional PREs tend to be flanked by YY1 binding sites and in association with CpG islands that also potentially influence recruitment of PcG complexes. CpG island analysis reveals the presence of a putative CpG island within ∼5 kb from the transcription start site of the mouse FOXP3 promoter (data not shown). Pairwise alignment demonstrates a high degree of conservation between the mouse and human core promoter. Taken together, the combined predictive value of these multiple bioinformatic comparisons (pairwise alignment, cis-regulatory element analysis, and CpG prediction) led us to subsequently test the hypothesis that the PcG complex binds and potentially regulates FOXP3 and Treg adaptive responses. Because PcG works at the epigenetic level, we created a T cell line with the putative FOXP3-associated PRE module integrated into the genome to test whether this region specifically recruits PcG proteins and silences reporter expression in this nonepisomal state. Using the FLP-recombinase system (FLP cell line; see “Experimental Procedures”) to allow genomic integration of a luciferase reporter construct, we generated a Jurkat FLP cell line expressing luciferase under the control of the CMV promoter either with (JFOXP3-FLP) or without (J-FLP) the putative FOXP3-associated PRE. The CMV promoter allows a basal level of expression on which to perform repression studies in a similar manner to the widely used Gal4-based reporter, an episomal repression system not optimal for epigenetic studies. Given the established role for a conserved nucleotide sequence downstream of the core promoter in the TGFβ-mediated induction of Treg cells (Enhancer 1) and the known role for KLF10 in this pathway (29Tone Y. Furuuchi K. Kojima Y. Tykocinski M.L. Greene M.I. Tone M. Smad3 and NFAT cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer.Nat.

To investigate the capacity for PcG complexes to silence the putative FOXP3-associated PRE, we transfected the FLP cell lines with the HMT, Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2). EZH2 is the HMT most commonly associated with Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and mediates repressor function through the trimethylation of histone 3 at the lysine 27 position (H3K27me3) (15Cao R.

Transfection of EZH2 alone and particularly in conjunction with its obligate PRC2 complex partners (EZH2, Suz12, and EED) resulted in significant repression of luciferase activity in JFOXP3-E1 FLP (percentage of repression = 45 ± 22.4% and 66 ± 13.7%, mean and S.D., respectively) but not J-FLP cells in which the PRE element has been deleted (percentage of repression = −15 ± 35.8% and 10 ± 14.6%, mean and S.D. respectively) (Fig. 2a). Similar results were seen in the JFOXP3-FLP cell line lacking the E1 region (supplemental Fig. S2). Overexpression of Brahma and BRG1 (Brahma-related gene 1), both members of the chromatin remodeling Trithorax SWI/SNF family associated with gene activation and PRC antagonism, did not affect luciferase expression in this system and thus serve as relevant control chromatin modifying proteins (supplemental Fig. S2). Seven days post-transfection (three cell division cycles), genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to ChIP to confirm the presence of H3K27me3 marks correlating with the functional outcome of reduced luciferase expression. Fig. 2b demonstrates H3K27me3 marks occupying the FOXP3 core promoter region upon overexpression of the PRC2 complex (2.6-fold change over cells transfected with empty vector; Fig. 2b). Thus, using a human lymphocyte cell line, we demonstrate that the FOXP3 PRE-like module recruits the PRC2 complex and silences FOXP3 gene expression. Together, these experiments demonstrate that the FOXP3 promoter has the functional properties expected of a PRE. Although the mechanistic novelty of a PRE-like module on the inducible FOXP3 promoter is clear, we sought to extend these important observations to primary T cells. To evaluate the role of the HMT EZH2 in the regulation of FOXP3 expression in primary T cells, we utilized an adenoviral expression system transduced into a mouse line transgenically expressing the adenoviral receptor (CAR transgenic mouse; Taconic, model 4285). Naïve CD4+ splenocytes were isolated from the CAR transgenic mouse and infected with EZH2 or control empty virus. In these experiments, EZH2 overexpression leads to increased levels of H3K27 methylation at the FOXP3 core promoter (Fig. 2c). Importantly, primary naïve murine CD4+ lymphocytes transduced with EZH2 do not express FOXP3 upon stimulation when compared with cells transduced with empty vector (7.6% FOXP3+ cells versus 72.4% FOXP3+ cells; Fig. 2d), indicating that recruitment of EZH2 to the FOXP3 core promoter results in specific and persistent silencing of FOXP3 expression. Thus, these data demonstrate that the FOXP3 promoter displays both structural and functional properties similar to the well characterized Drosophila KLF-containing PRE sites including the ancestral relative forkhead. As the overexpression system of Fig. 2 suggested the PRC2 complex to be one mechanism of FOXP3 gene silencing, we aimed to validate these results in vivo using an established FOXP3 reporter mouse. We initially examined the chromatin landscape of the FOXP3 gene and the differentiation of adaptive Treg cells for evidence of histone marks that reflect an operational PRC2 methyltransferase system. Primary T cell populations isolated from the spleen of the FOXP3-EGFP expressing mouse were sorted for CD62L and FOXP3 (on the basis of EGFP expression). Both naïve (CD62L high) and antigen experienced (CD62L low) populations of FOXP3-negative T cells displayed an enrichment of H3K27me3 marks on the FOXP3 promoter (1.8 ± 0.4 and 2.5 ± 0.7-fold difference in optical density over FOXP3-expressing CD62L high and CD62L low cells, respectively; mean/S.D.; Fig. 3a, left panel). These data suggest that H3K27me3 marks the silenced state of the inducible gene FOXP3. To test this model in vitro, we isolated naïve FOXP3− T cells and induced FOXP3 gene transcription. Fourteen days post-induction FOXP3-expressing (EGFP-positive) or FOXP3-negative (EGFP-negative) cells were isolated by FACS. DNA from each cell population was subjected to ChIP assay using specific antibodies against the H3K27me3 mark and the HMT, EZH2. Congr"

Smc3 acetylation is catalyzed by members of the Eco family of acetyltransferases, although the mechanism by which acetylation is regulated and how it promotes cohesion are largely unknown. In vertebrates, the cohesin complex binds to chromatin during mitotic exit and is converted to a functional form during or shortly after DNA replication. The conserved proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting protein box motif in yeast Eco1 is required for function, and cohesin is acetylated during the S phase. This has led to the notion that acetylation of cohesin is stimulated by interaction of Eco1 with the replication machinery. Here we show that in vertebrates Smc3 acetylation occurs independently of DNA replication. Smc3 is readily acetylated before replication is initiated and after DNA replication is complete. However, we also show that functional acetylation occurs only in association with the replication machinery: disruption of the interaction between XEco2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen prevents cohesion establishment while having little impact on the overall levels of Smc3 acetylation. These results demonstrate that Smc3 acetylation can occur throughout interphase but that only acetylation in association with the replication fork promotes sister chromatid cohesion. These data reveal how the generation of cohesion is limited to the appropriate time and place during the cell cycle and provide insight into the mechanism by which acetylation ensures cohesion.

Recently a new derivative of stilbene compound, isorhapontigenin (ISO), was isolated from this Chinese herb. In the present study, we examined the potential of ISO in anti-cancer activity and the mechanisms involved in human cancer cell lines. We found that ISO exhibited significant inhibitory effects on human bladder cancer cell growth that was accompanied by marked apoptotic induction as well as down-regulation of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Further studies have shown that ISO down-regulation of XIAP protein expression was only observed in endogenous XIAP, but not in constitutionally exogenously expressed XIAP in the same cells, excluding the possibility of ISO regulating XIAP expression at the level of protein degradation. We also identified that ISO down-regulated XIAP gene transcription via inhibition of Sp1 transactivation. There was no significant effect of ISO on apoptosis and colony formation of cells transfected with exogenous HA-tagged XIAP. Collectively, current studies, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, identify ISO as a major active compound for the anti-cancer activity of G. cleistostachyum by down-regulation of XIAP expression and induction of apoptosis through specific targeting of a SP1 pathway, and cast new light on the treatment of the cancer patients with XIAP overexpression.

Gnetum cleistostachyum, a Chinese herb that grows in the YunNan province of Southwestern of China, has been used for treatment of arthritis, bronchitis, cardiovascular system disease, and several cancers including bladder cancer for hundreds of years (1Huang K.S.

ISO is a new derivative of stilbene, recently isolated from the Gnetum cleistostachyum (2Huang K.S. Zhou S. Lin M. Wang Y.H.

Increasing attention has been given to elucidating anti-cancer activity of natural oligostilbenes in the last 20 years because more and more of their multifaceted biological properties are being identified. For example, through attenuating the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) pathway, ISO exhibits the inhibitory effect on oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced proliferation and mitogenesis of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (3Liu Y. Liu G. Isorhapontigenin and resveratrol suppress oxLDL-induced proliferation and activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells.Biochem.

ISO also inhibits cardiac hypertrophy by antioxidative activity and attenuates oxidative stress-mediated signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)-AKT-GSK3/p70S6K pathway (4Li H.L.

Our most recent studies also demonstrate that there is a novel XIAP function that acts as a crucial regulator for controlling cancer cell motility and invasion via its RING domain interaction with the RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), and subsequent negative modulation of RhoGDI SUMOylation at Lys-138 (7Liu J.

The subdiploid DNA peak, immediately adjacent to the G0/G1 peak, represented apoptotic cells and was quantified by histogram analyses. ChIP was performed using the EZ-CHIP kit (Millipore Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described in our previous publication (21Song L. Gao M. Dong W. Hu M. Li J. Shi X.

Briefly, T24T cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO only or 60 μm ISO for 12 h. Then genomic DNA and the proteins were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. The cross-linked cells were pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer, and sonicated to generate 200–500-bp chromatin DNA fragments. After centrifugation, the supernatants were diluted 10-fold and then incubated with anti-SP1 antibody or the control rabbit IgG at overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex was captured by protein G-agarose saturated with salmon sperm DNA, then eluted with the elution buffer. DNA-protein cross-linking was reversed by heating overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified and subjected to PCR analysis. To specifically amplify the region containing the putative responsive elements on the human XIAP promoter, PCR was performed with the following pair of primers: 5′-TTTTACTTTATGACTTGAATGATG TGG-3′ (from −214 to −187) and 5′–TTCCTTATTGATGTCTGCAGGT-3′ (from +39 to +60). The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide, the images were then scanned with a UV light. Student's t test was utilized to determine the significance of differences between different groups. The differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. The chemical structure of ISO is 4-methoxyresveratrol (Fig. 1A), with a molecular weight of 258. We first examined the effects of cell proliferation and colony formation by ISO on bladder cancer cells. The T24T bladder cancer cell line was selected for further experiments due to its genetic background and strong tendency of migration. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, ISO significantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth (colony formation) in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). These data demonstrate the anti-cancer effects of ISO on human bladder cancer cells. To assess the effect of ISO on cell viability, T24T was cultured with a range of ISO doses (20–60 μm) for 48 h. Cell viability of these cells was analyzed using the ATPase assay. A significant reduction of cell viability was observed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The IC50 of T24T cell lines was 55.2 ± 2.3 μm (n = 3). To determine whether ISO could inhibit cell viability due to apoptosis, the DNA cycle of T24T cells were examined. The T24T bladder cells were treated with ISO in concentrations of 0, 20, 40, and 60 μm for 48 h. High-resolution flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei revealed a substantial increase in sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic peak) at 48 h compared with cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (v/v) as a negative control (Fig. 2B). PARP cleavage is often associated with apoptosis and has served as one of the hallmarks of apoptosis and caspase activation. Therefore, we determined whether induction of T24T cell apoptosis by ISO was mediated through activation of CASPASE-3 and cleavage of PARP proteins. Treatment of T24T with ISO for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent increased cleavage of CASPASE-3 and PARP proteins compared with the DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 2C). Because the IC50 of the T24T cell line was 55.2 ± 2.3 μm, 60 μm ISO was used in the following experiments. The ISO-induced activation of CASPASE-3 and PARP were also determined and confirmed in a time-dependent manner from 3 to 36 h, with pre-treatment with ISO (Fig. 2D). Additionally, we determined the obvious cleavage of PARP in a dose-dependent manner with pre-treatment with ISO for 24 h in the other 3 cancer cell lines, RT112 bladder cancer (Fig. 2E), UMUC3 bladder cancer cell (Fig. 2F), and HCT116 colon cancer cell (Fig. 2G). These results indicated reproducible apoptotic effects of ISO on different human cancer cells lines. Having established that ISO could induce the apoptosis of T24T and other cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner, we next focused on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by ISO. It has been reported that ISO exhibits anti-inflammation, antioxidant effects through suppressing the ERKs, p38, PKCα, NF-κB, and the PI3K/AKT pathway (4Li H.L. Wang A.B. Huang Y. Liu D.P. Wei C. Williams G.M. Zhang C.N. Liu G. Liu Y.Q. Hao D.L. Hui R.T. Lin M. Liang C.C. Isorhapontigenin, a new resveratrol analog, attenuates cardiac hypertrophy via blocking signaling transduction pathways.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The activation and protein expression levels of those proteins upon ISO treatment were evaluated in T24T cells. As shown as Fig. 3A, there were no significant changes observed, indicating that these pathways may not be implicated in the anti-cancer activity of this ISO compound. IAPs family and BCL-2 family members are known to be regulators of CYTOCHROME c releasing from mitochondria during apoptosis. In addition to the BCL-2 family, IAP family proteins also regulate CASPASE activity, thus affecting apoptosis. Therefore, the expression of three IAP family proteins, XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2, were determined. ISO treatment down-regulated the XIAP protein level in dose- and time-dependent manners. However, it did not significantly affect cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 proteins, nor did it have a significant effect on BCL-2 family proteins, such as Bax, BCL-2, and BCL-Xl (Fig. 3, B and C). To elucidate the mechanism leading to XIAP down-regulation upon ISO treatment, the N terminally HA-tagged XIAP were transfected into RT112 and HCT116 XIAP−/− cells, respectively. The pEBB empty vector was transfected at the same time as the control. As shown as Fig. 4A, the exogenous HA-tagged XIAP inhibited the endogenous XIAP expression in RT112 (HA-XIAP) cells. Meanwhile, the results also showed that treatment with ISO did not affect the reconstituted expression of HA-tagged XIAP in RT112 (HA-XIAP) (Fig. 4A) and HCT116 XIAP−/− (HA-XIAP) cells (Fig. 4B), whereas it attenuated endogenous XIAP expression in the RT112 (vector) and HCT116 (vector) cells. These results strongly excluded the possibility that ISO regulated XIAP protein expression at the degradation level. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of ISO down-regulation of XIAP protein expression, we examined mRNA levels of XIAP in comparison to CIAP-1 and CIAP-2. Consistent with the results obtained at protein levels, ISO treatment led to marked reductions of XIAP mRNA in dose- and time-dependent manners, whereas it did not affect the CIAP-1 and CIAP-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 4, C and D). The results indicated that ISO treatment attenuated XIAP expression at the mRNA level. We further carried out experiments to confirm that XIAP was not down-regulated at mRNA stability by ISO using actinomycin D. The result showed that ISO did not affect the XIAP mRNA level in actinomycin D-treated T24T cells, whereas it reduced XIAP mRNA expression in T24T cells in the absence of actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 4E), suggesting that ISO did not regulate XIAP mRNA stability. We further compared the endogenous XIAP mRNA and exogenous HA-XIAP mRNA levels in both RT112 (HA-XIAP) and HCT116 XIAP−/−(HA-XIAP) cells. The results indicated that the exogenous HA-XIAP mRNA showed no observable changes after ISO treatment, whereas the endogenous XIAP mRNA was remarkably down-regulated in RT112 (Vector) and HCT116 (Vector) cells upon ISO treatment (Fig. 4, F and G). These results indicate that ISO regulated XIAP protein expression at the transcriptional level, rather than mRNA stability. This notion was fully supported by the results obtained from T24T stably transfected with the XIAP promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Treatment of T24T XIAP promoter-luciferase cells with ISO resulted in inhibition of XIAP promoter transcription activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4H). To identify the transcription factor responsible for ISO down-regulation of XIAP transcription, TFANSFAC® Transcription Factor Binding Sites Software (Biological Database, Wolfenbüttel, Germany) was used for bioinformatics analysis of the XIAP promoter region. The results revealed that the promoter region of the human XIAP gene contains the putative DNA-binding site of cellular oncogene Fos (c-FOS), c-JUN, FOS-related antigen-1 (FRA-1), heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), Jun-D, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and specific proteins 1 (SP1) (Fig. 5A). We next examined changes in the nuclear translocation of related transcription factors upon ISO treatment for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 5B, inhibition of SP1 protein expression clearly occurred in the nuclear protein extract pretreated with 60 μm ISO for 12 h. In contrast, there was no significant suppression of the transcription factors of c-FOS, c-JUN, FRA-1, HSF-1, JUN-D, NF-AT, and NF-κB. To further confirm the mechanism of down-regulation of SP1 by ISO, we tested the effects of ISO on the protein and mRNA levels of SP1 in T24T cells. The results indicated that the SP1 mRNA level was not reduced even though its protein level was profoundly down-regulated upon ISO treatment (Fig. 5, C and D), suggesting that ISO regulates SP1 protein expression at levels of either protein translation and/or degradation. To confirm that down-regulation of XIAP by ISO was mediated by SP1, we tested the effects of ISO on SP1 transactivation in T24T cells stably transfected with SP1-luciferase reporter containing three SP1 consensus binding sites. The results, as expected, showed that ISO treatment significantly blocked SP1 transactivation in a time-dependent manner in T24T cells (Fig. 5E). To study whether down-regulation of the SP1 level by ISO is associated with SP1 sites in the XIAP promoter in vitro, we performed a CHIP assay with T24T cells followed by PCR with primers specifically targeting the SP1 binding region from −214 to +60 in the XIAP promoter. As shown in Fig. 5F, compared with the DMSO control, ISO treatment could suppress the binding of SP1 to the XIAP promoter region between −214 and +60 (Fig. 5F). Considering that there are two SP1 binding sites between −214 and +60 (−144 and −25) and that the previous report (11Lee T.J. Jung E.M. Lee J.T. Kim S. Park J.W. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2737-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that XIAP promoter activity is significantly decreased by double mutation of two SP1 sites at −144 and −25, we suggest that ISO down-regulation of XIAP transcription is med"
https://openalex.org/W2073914999,"The copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B has a dual intracellular localization: the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and cytosolic vesicles. Changes in copper levels, kinase-mediated phosphorylation, and mutations associated with Wilson disease alter the steady-state distribution of ATP7B between these compartments. To identify a primary molecular event that triggers ATP7B exit from the TGN, we characterized the folding, activity, and trafficking of the ATP7B variants with mutations within the regulatory N-terminal domain (N-ATP7B). We found that structural changes disrupting the inter-domain contacts facilitate ATP7B exit from the TGN. Mutating Ser-340/341 in the N-ATP7B individually or together to Ala, Gly, Thr, or Asp produced active protein and shifted the steady-state localization of ATP7B to vesicles, independently of copper levels. The Ser340/341G mutant had a lower kinase-mediated phosphorylation under basal conditions and no copper-dependent phosphorylation. Thus, negative charges introduced by copper-dependent phosphorylation are not obligatory for ATP7B trafficking from the TGN. The Ser340/341A mutation did not alter the overall fold of N-ATP7B, but significantly decreased interactions with the nucleotide-binding domain, mimicking consequences of copper binding to N-ATP7B. We propose that structural changes that specifically alter the inter-domain contacts initiate exit of ATP7B from the TGN, whereas increased phosphorylation may be needed to maintain an open interface between the domains."
https://openalex.org/W2134456202,"Red blood cells (RBCs) present unique reversible shape deformability, essential for both function and survival, resulting notably in cell membrane fluctuations (CMF). These CMF have been subject of many studies in order to obtain a better understanding of these remarkable biomechanical membrane properties altered in some pathological states including blood diseases. In particular the discussion over the thermal or metabolic origin of the CMF has led in the past to a large number of investigations and modeling. However, the origin of the CMF is still debated. In this article, we present an analysis of the CMF of RBCs by combining digital holographic microscopy (DHM) with an orthogonal subspace decomposition of the imaging data. These subspace components can be reliably identified and quantified as the eigenmode basis of CMF that minimizes the deformation energy of the RBC structure. By fitting the observed fluctuation modes with a theoretical dynamic model, we find that the CMF are mainly governed by the bending elasticity of the membrane and that shear and tension elasticities have only a marginal influence on the membrane fluctations of the discocyte RBC. Further, our experiments show that the role of ATP as a driving force of CMF is questionable. ATP, however, seems to be required to maintain the unique biomechanical properties of the RBC membrane that lead to thermally excited CMF."
https://openalex.org/W1980209363,"We and others have previously shown that the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) are hepatoprotective in a number of circumstances, including endotoxemia. In vitro, hepatocytes are protected from tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced apoptosis via cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent mechanisms. We have shown that the cGMP-dependent protective mechanisms involve the inhibition of death-inducing signaling complex formation. We show here that LPS-induced iNOS expression leads to rapid TNF receptor shedding from the surface of hepatocytes via NO/cGMP/protein kinase G-dependent activation and surface translocation of TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17). The activation of TACE is associated with the up-regulation of iRhom2 as well as the interaction and phosphorylation of TACE and iRhom2, which are also NO/cGMP/protein kinase G-dependent. These findings suggest that one mechanism of iNOS/NO-mediated protection of hepatocytes involves the rapid shedding of TNF receptor 1 to limit TNFα signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2012099384,"CLCuD in southern Asia is caused by a complex of multiple begomoviruses (whitefly transmitted, single-stranded [ss]DNA viruses) in association with a specific ssDNA satellite; Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB). A further single ssDNA molecule, for which the collective name alphasatellites has been proposed, is also frequently associated with begomovirus-betasatellite complexes. Multan is in the center of the cotton growing area of Pakistan and has seen some of the worst problems caused by CLCuD. An exhaustive analysis of the diversity of begomoviruses and their satellites occurring in 15 Gossypium species (including G. hirsutum, the mainstay of Pakistan's cotton production) that are maintained in an orchard in the vicinity of Multan has been conducted using φ29 DNA polymerase-mediated rolling-circle amplification, cloning and sequence analysis. The non-cultivated Gossypium species, including non-symptomatic plants, were found to harbor a much greater diversity of begomoviruses and satellites than found in the cultivated G. hirsutum. Furthermore an African cassava mosaic virus (a virus previously only identified in Africa) DNA-A component and a Jatropha curcas mosaic virus (a virus occurring only in southern India) DNA-B component were identified. Consistent with earlier studies of cotton in southern Asia, only a single species of betasatellite, CLCuMuB, was identified. The diversity of alphasatellites was much greater, with many previously unknown species, in the non-cultivated cotton species than in G. hirsutum. Inoculation of newly identified components showed them to be competent for symptomatic infection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The significance of the findings with respect to our understanding of the role of host selection in virus diversity in crops and the geographical spread of viruses by human activity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2146676060,"The molecular initiators of infection-associated pain are not understood. We recently found that uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) elicited acute pelvic pain in murine urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI pain was due to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its receptor, TLR4, but pain was not correlated with inflammation. LPS is known to drive inflammation by interactions between the acylated lipid A component and TLR4, but the function of the O-antigen polysaccharide in host responses is unknown. Here, we examined the role of O-antigen in pain using cutaneous hypersensitivity (allodynia) to quantify pelvic pain behavior and using sacral spinal cord excitability to quantify central nervous system manifestations in murine UTI. A UPEC mutant defective for O-antigen biosynthesis induced chronic allodynia that persisted long after clearance of transient infections, but wild type UPEC evoked only acute pain. E. coli strains lacking O-antigen gene clusters had a chronic pain phenotype, and expressing cloned O-antigen gene clusters altered the pain phenotype in a predictable manner. Chronic allodynia was abrogated in TLR4-deficient mice, but inflammatory responses in wild type mice were similar among E. coli strains spanning a wide range of pain phenotypes, suggesting that O-antigen modulates pain independent of inflammation. Spinal cords of mice with chronic allodynia exhibited increased spontaneous firing and compromised short-term depression, consistent with centralized pain. Taken together, these findings suggest that O-antigen functions as a rheostat to modulate LPS-associated pain. These observations have implications for an infectious etiology of chronic pain and evolutionary modification of pathogens to alter host behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2057938042,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) provides a rendezvous between proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix and integrin-mediated adhesion to vitronectin. These processes are, however, tightly linked because the high affinity binding of urokinase regulates the binding of uPAR to matrix-embedded vitronectin. Although crystal structures exist to define the corresponding static bi- and trimolecular receptor complexes, it is evident that the dynamic property of uPAR plays a decisive role in its function. In the present study, we combine small angle x-ray scattering, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and surface plasmon resonance to develop a structural model describing the allosteric regulation of uPAR. We show that the flexibility of its N-terminal domain provides the key for understanding this allosteric mechanism. Importantly, our model has direct implications for understanding uPAR-assisted cell adhesion and migration as well as for translational research, including targeted intervention therapy and non-invasive tumor imaging in vivo."

The HOXC6 and Bcl-2 gene were identified as being overexpressed in HNSCC tissue and cell lines. Transfection assays demonstrated that HOXC6 increased the levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein. A luciferase reporter assay suggested that HOXC6 induced activity of the Bcl-2 promoter. A series of Bcl-2 promoter deletion mutants were examined and the minimal HOXC6-responsive region was identified to be in the TAAT motif (-420 bp) of the Bcl-2 promoter. Interestingly, the inhibition of HOXC6 using siRNA led to the repression of Bcl-2 expression and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis; overexpression of HOXC6 in HNSCC cells increased the resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2169094718,"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cryptococcus binding and invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) is a prerequisite for transmigration across the blood-brain barrier. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the cryptococcal blood-brain barrier traversal is poorly understood. In this study we examined the signaling events in HBMEC during interaction with C. neoformans. Analysis with inhibitors revealed that cryptococcal association, invasion, and transmigration require host actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Rho pulldown assays revealed that Cryptococcus induces activation of three members of RhoGTPases, e.g. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, and their activations are required for cryptococcal transmigration across the HBMEC monolayer. Western blot analysis showed that Cryptococcus also induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ezrin, and protein kinase C α (PKCα), all of which are involved in the rearrangement of host actin cytoskeleton. Down-regulation of FAK, ezrin, or PKCα by shRNA knockdown, dominant-negative transfection, or inhibitors significantly reduces cryptococcal ability to traverse the HBMEC monolayer, indicating their positive role in cryptococcal transmigration. In addition, activation of RhoGTPases is the upstream event for phosphorylation of FAK, ezrin, and PKCα during C. neoformans-HBMEC interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1996132538,"Twin arginine transport (Tat) systems transport folded proteins using proton-motive force as sole energy source. The thylakoid Tat system comprises three membrane components. A complex composed of cpTatC and Hcf106 is the twin arginine signal peptide receptor. Signal peptide binding triggers assembly of Tha4 for the translocation step. Tha4 is thought to serve as the protein-conducting element, and the topology it adopts during transport produces the transmembrane passageway. We analyzed Tha4 topology and conformation in actively transporting translocases and compared that with Tha4 in nontransporting membranes. Using cysteine accessibility labeling techniques and diagnostic protease protection assays, we confirm an overall N(OUT)-C(IN) topology for Tha4 that is maintained under transport conditions. Significantly, the amphipathic helix (APH) and C-tail exhibited substantial changes in accessibility when actively engaged in protein transport. Compared with resting state, cysteines within the APH became less accessible to stromally applied modifying reagent. The APH proximal C-tail, although still accessible to Cys-directed reagents, was much less accessible to protease. We attribute these changes in accessibility to indicate the Tha4 conformation that is adopted in the translocase primed for translocation. We propose that in the primed translocase, the APH partitions more extensively and uniformly into the membrane interface and the C-tails pack closer together in a mesh-like network. Implications for the mode by which the substrate protein crosses the bilayer are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2042697339,"Background Varanidae is a clade of tiny (<20 mm pre-caudal length [PCL]) to giant (>600 mm PCL) lizards first appearing in the Cretaceous. True monitor lizards (Varanus) are known from diagnostic remains beginning in the early Miocene (Varanus rusingensis), although extremely fragmentary remains have been suggested as indicating earlier Varanus. The paleobiogeographic history of Varanus and timing for origin of its gigantism remain uncertain. Methodology/Principal Findings A new Varanus from the Mytilini Formation (Turolian, Miocene) of Samos, Greece is described. The holotype consists of a partial skull roof, right side of a braincase, partial posterior mandible, fragment of clavicle, and parts of six vertebrae. A cladistic analysis including 83 taxa coded for 5733 molecular and 489 morphological characters (71 previously unincluded) demonstrates that the new fossil is a nested member of an otherwise exclusively East Asian Varanus clade. The new species is the earliest-known giant (>600 mm PCL) terrestrial lizard. Importantly, this species co-existed with a diverse continental mammalian fauna. Conclusions/Significance The new monitor is larger (longer) than 99% of known fossil and living lizards. Varanus includes, by far, the largest limbed squamates today. The only extant non-snake squamates that approach monitors in maximum size are the glass-snake Pseudopus and the worm-lizard Amphisbaena. Mosasauroids were larger, but exclusively marine, and occurred only during the Late Cretaceous. Large, extant, non-Varanus, lizards are limbless and/or largely isolated from mammalian competitors. By contrast, our new Varanus achieved gigantism in a continental environment populated by diverse eutherian mammal competitors."
https://openalex.org/W1981569049,"Mapracorat is a novel selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist (SEGRA), structurally distinct from corticosteroids. In preclinical studies, mapracorat potently inhibits the production of a variety of inflammatory mediators including cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), with limited side effects associated with traditional corticosteroids. The objective of this study was to delineate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of mapracorat. We found that mapracorat potently inhibited the production of GM-CSF and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 macrophages. Mapracorat also substantially attenuated the expression of COX-2 and the production of PGE(2). The inhibition of mapracorat on the inflammatory response was dose-dependent, and substantially inhibitory effects were observed at concentrations in the 10-100 nm range. Examination of the activation kinetics of p38 and its downstream target MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK-2) revealed a shortened activation course after LPS stimulation in cells pretreated with mapracorat. Supporting the notion that mapracorat augments a feedback control mechanism restraining the p38 pathway, we found that mapracorat enhanced the expression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a critical negative regulator of MAPKs that drive the production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. While mapracorat alone did not stimulate MKP-1 expression, it markedly enhanced the expression of MKP-1 in cells stimulated by LPS, in a similar manner and potency to the augmenting effect of dexamethasone. Blocking MKP-1 expression by triptolide also abolished the accelerating effects of mapracorat on p38 and MK-2 deactivation, further supporting a role of MKP-1 in the anti-inflammatory mechanism of mapracorat. Taken together, these results indicate that mapracorat exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, at least in part, by augmenting MKP-1 expression."

We show both nuclear and cytosolic localization for ASR1 (the most studied member of the family) in histological plant samples by immunodetection, typically found in small proteins readily diffusing through nuclear pores. Indeed, a nuclear localization was expected based on sorting prediction software, which also highlight a monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the primary sequence. However, here we prove that such an “NLS” of ASR1 from tomato is dispensable and non-functional, being the transport of the protein to the nucleus due to simple diffusion across nuclear pores. We attribute such a targeting deficiency to the misplacing in that cryptic NLS of two conserved contiguous lysine residues. Based on previous in vitro experiments regarding quaternary structure, we also carried out live cell imaging assays through confocal microscopy to explore dimer formation in planta. We found homodimers in both the cytosol and the nucleus and demonstrated that assembly of both subunits together can occur in the cytosol, giving rise to translocation of preformed dimers. The presence of dimers was further corroborated by means of in vivo crosslinking of nuclei followed by SDS-PAGE."
https://openalex.org/W2089887219,"Inositol phosphates (IPs) regulate vital processes in eukaryotes, and their production downstream of phospholipase C activation is controlled through a network of evolutionarily conserved kinases and phosphatases. Inositol phosphate multikinase (IPMK, also called Ipk2 and Arg82) accounts for phosphorylation of IP(3) to IP(5), as well as production of several other IP molecules. Here, we report the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana IPMKα at 2.9 Å and find it is similar to the yeast homolog Ipk2, despite 17% sequence identity, as well as the active site architecture of human IP(3) 3-kinase. Structural comparison and substrate modeling were used to identify a putative basis for IPMK selectivity. To test this model, we re-engineered binding site residues predicted to have restricted substrate specificity. Using steady-state kinetics and in vivo metabolic labeling studies in modified yeast strains, we observed that K117W and K117W:K121W mutants exhibited nearly normal 6-kinase function but harbored significantly reduced 3-kinase activity. These mutants complemented conditional nutritional growth defects observed in ipmk null yeast and, remarkably, suppressed lethality observed in ipmk null flies. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that IPMK 6-kinase activity and production of Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4) are critical for cellular signaling. Overall, our studies provide new insights into the structure and function of IPMK and utilize a synthetic biological approach to redesign inositol phosphate signaling pathways."

Several proteolytic molecular checkpoints occur throughout their assembly and transit to the micronemes. Proteolytic processing of MICs also occurs after their release onto the parasite surface, and this is essential for successful invasion. TgSUB1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored microneme protein that shows subtilisin-like serine protease activity. Lagal et al. (15Lagal V. Binder E.M. Huynh M.H. Kafsack B.F. Harris P.K.

Using gene knock-out and proteome profiling Brydges et al. (16Brydges S.D. Zhou X.W. Huynh M.H. Harper J.M. Mital J. Adjogble K.D. Däubener W. Ward G.E. Carruthers V.B. Targeted deletion of MIC5 enhances trimming proteolysis of Toxoplasma invasion proteins.Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that the protease activity of TgSUB1 is negatively regulated by another microneme protein, TgMIC5. TgMIC5 is expressed as a preproprotein, which is proteolytically processed to a proprotein by the signal peptidase before being further processed in a post-Golgi compartment to the mature protein (17Brydges S.D. Sherman G.D. Nockemann S. Loyens A. Däubener W. Dubremetz J.F. Carruthers V.B. Molecular characterization of TgMIC5, a proteolytically processed antigen secreted from the micronemes of Toxoplasma gondii.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although Brydges et al. did not determine the precise nature of TgSUB1 regulation by TgMIC5, they suggested two possible mechanisms. First, they proposed that TgMIC5 could inhibit TgSUB1 activity directly, possibly by binding to and occluding the active site. Second, they proposed that TgMIC5 associates with the substrates of TgSUB1 on the parasite surface, thereby protecting them from overdigestion by TgSUB1. The latter model was favored in part because TgMIC5 showed no amino acid sequence similarity to any protease inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation experiments failed to identify partners of TgMIC5, thus limiting further mechanistic insight of its role in regulating TgSUB1 proteolysis (16Brydges S.D. Zhou X.W. Huynh M.H. Harper J.M. Mital J. Adjogble K.D. Däubener W. Ward G.E. Carruthers V.B. Targeted deletion of MIC5 enhances trimming proteolysis of Toxoplasma invasion proteins.Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Combining atomic resolution studies with data from biochemical and parasite studies, we reveal that TgMIC5 is a subtilisin propeptide mimic and a potent inhibitor of TgSUB1. We discuss the implications of this inhibitory activity in the context of infection by T. gondii. Our work could also provide the inspiration for novel therapeutics design to target parasite proteases. The RH strain of T. gondii, which is a type I strain that is highly pathogenic for all laboratory mice, was used in all experiments. Parasite tachyzoites (RH, RHΔmic5, and RHΔsub1) were grown in human foreskin fibroblast cells and harvested as described previously (18Harper J.M. Huynh M.H. Coppens I. Parussini F. Moreno S. Carruthers V.B. A cleavable propeptide influences Toxoplasma infection by facilitating the trafficking and secretion of the TgMIC2-M2AP invasion complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4551-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) MIC5 was expressed using the pTYB2 plasmid (New England Biolabs) in BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain (Stratagene) in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The protein expression was induced with 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C, and protease inhibitors were absent. The cells were lysed using the Cell Disruptor TS5 (Constant Cell Disruption Systems) coupled to a Haake TC200 chiller (Thermo Electron Corporation). WT MIC5 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using chitin resin (New England Biolabs). The resin was equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of column buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The bound intein tag was cleaved using a cleavage buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The chitin resin column was flushed with 3 bed volumes of cleavage buffer and allowed to sit for 16 h. Pure WT MIC5 was recovered in the flow-through. To facilitate the production of mutant and truncated proteins, WT MIC5 was cloned onto pET30 Xa/LIC plasmid (Novagen). The mutated proteins were generated using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). All five mutated/truncated proteins were expressed using a pET30 Xa/LIC plasmid in BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml kanamycin. The cultures were initially grown at 37 °C and followed by a temperature adjustment for 1 h at 18 °C before inducing with 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h. The mutated and truncated proteins were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The resin was equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). Bound proteins were washed with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer, wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) and eluted with 10 bed volumes of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using an AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences) in combination with a preparative SuperdexTM 75 column. All samples were exchanged into identical buffer conditions (25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl). The protein fractions were pooled together, concentrated to ∼500 μm, and exchanged into an NMR buffer (25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl). 15N,13C-labeled samples of WT MIC5 were produced in minimal medium containing 0.07% 15NH4Cl and 0.2% 13C6-glucose. Backbone and side chain assignments were completed using our in-house, semiautomated assignment algorithms and standard triple-resonance assignment methodology (19Marchant J. Sawmynaden K. Saouros S. Simpson P. Matthews S. Complete resonance assignment of the first and second apple domains of MIC4 from Toxoplasma gondii, using a new NMRView-based assignment aid.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2008; 2: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hα and Hβ assignments were obtained using HBHA (CBCACO)NH. The side chain assignments were completed using HCCH total correlation (TOCSY) spectroscopy and (H)CC(CO)NH TOCSY. Three-dimensional 1H-15N/13C NOESY-HSQC (mixing time 100 ms at 800 MHz) experiments provided the distance restraints used in the final structure calculation. The ARIA protocol (20Rieping W. Habeck M. Bardiaux B. Bernard A. Malliavin T.E. Nilges M. ARIA2: automated NOE assignment and data integration in NMR structure calculation.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) was used for completion of the NOE assignment and structure calculation. The frequency window tolerance for assigning NOEs was ±0.04 ppm and ±0.06 ppm for direct and indirect proton dimensions and ±0.6 ppm for both nitrogen and carbon dimensions. The ARIA parameters p, Tv, and Nv were set to default values. 144 dihedral angle restraints derived from TALOS were also implemented (21Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). The 10 lowest energy structures had no NOE violations >0.5 Å and dihedral angle violations >5º. Although structure calculations readily converged without the introduction of manual assignments, a systematic check of automatically assigned NOEs was carried out. The structural statistics are presented in Table 1. The heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE data were measured as described previously (22Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G.

Open table in a new tab Filter-purified RH parasites were washed three times with ice-cold D1 medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 2 mm l-glutamine). Parasites were resuspended at 3 × 108 ml−1 in D1, and 90 μl of parasite resuspension was pipetted into the wells of a 96-well round bottom plate containing 10 μl of inhibitors (recombinant TgMIC5 or ALLN) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Parasites were pelleted twice at 4 °C by centrifugation. Supernatants were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting as described below. Recombinant WT and mutant TgMIC5 proteins were tested at concentrations of 8.2 × 10−3 μm, 2.5 × 10−2 μm, 7.4 × 10−2 μm, 2.2 × 10−1 μm, 6.7 × 10−1 μm, 2.0 μm, 6.0 μm, and 18.0 μm. ALLN was tested at concentrations of 4.6 × 10−2 μm, 1.4 × 10−1 μm, 4.1 × 10−1 μm, 1.2 μm, 3.7 μm, 11.1 μm, 33.3 μm, and 100.0 μm. Intensities of the TgMIC450 band were quantified with LI-COR image studio software and plotted against the corresponding concentrations of inhibitors using Prism 5 software to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Due to the low ratio of TgMIC450 to TgMIC470, the optimal laser power for detecting TgMIC450 oversaturated the TgMIC470 band, as indicated by the white region in its middle. Lysozyme was included as a negative control because its size and globular nature are similar to TgMIC5. Parasite excreted-secreted antigen (ESA) fractions or cell lysates were mixed with 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration) and boiled for 5 min before resolving on 10% or 12.5% minigels. For qualitative blots, proteins were semidry-transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore), blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% skim milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.05% Triton X-114, and incubated with primary antibodies. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. For quantitative blots, proteins were semidry-transferred to PVDF-FL membrane (Millipore). Blots were treated with blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) and sequentially probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-TgMIC4 (23Brecht S. Carruthers V.B. Ferguson D.J. Giddings O.K. Wang G. Jakle U. Harper J.M. Sibley L.D. Soldati D. The toxoplasma micronemal protein MIC4 is an adhesin composed of six conserved apple domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4119-4127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with IRDye 800CW (LI-COR Biosciences). Blots were air-dried and imaged by LI-COR Odyssey CLx instrument. To assess the surface distribution of proteins during invasion, tachyzoites were filter-purified, washed, and resuspended in “Endo” buffer (44.7 mm K2SO4, 10 mm MgSO4, 106 mm sucrose, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm Tris-H2SO4, 3.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 8.2, a potassium-rich buffer that arrests parasite motility) (24Endo T. Tokuda H. Yagita K. Koyama T. Effects of extracellular potassium on acid release and motility initiation in Toxoplasma gondii.J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at 3 × 107 ml−1 at room temperature. Two hundred microliters of parasite resuspension was added to overnight-grown human foreskin fibroblast cells in 8-well chamber slides. The parasites were allowed to settle for 15 min at room temperature before the medium was replaced with prewarmed invasion medium (DMEM with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 3% FBS, and 2 mm l-glutamine) containing 1% ethanol. Parasites were allowed to invade for 2 min at 37 °C prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Parasites were stained with mouse monoclonal (mAb) B3.90 anti-TgAMA1 (25Donahue C.G. Carruthers V.B. Gilk S.D. Ward G.E. The Toxoplasma homolog of Plasmodium apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) is a microneme protein secreted in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-TgMIC5 (17Brydges S.D. Sherman G.D. Nockemann S. Loyens A. Däubener W. Dubremetz J.F. Carruthers V.B. Molecular characterization of TgMIC5, a proteolytically processed antigen secreted from the micronemes of Toxoplasma gondii.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), or rabbit anti-Plasmodium falciparum SUB1 (PfSUB1). To assess the subcellular distribution TgMIC5 and TgSUB1 within parasites, these proteins were stained with the aforementioned antibodies along with TgAMA1 in overnight replicated parasites permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Mowiol was used as the mounting medium. Images were captured digitally with an AxioCAM MRm camera equipped Zeiss Axiovert Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope at room temperature with a 100×, 1.3 NA oil objective lens and processed using Zeiss Axiovision 4.3 software. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS5 programs were used to assemble the final images. RH, RHΔmic5, and RHΔsub1 parasites were harvested and resuspended in the invasion medium at 3 × 107 ml−1 at room temperature. Parasites were induced with invasion medium containing 1% ethanol for 2 min to stimulate release of ESAs, followed by the addition of an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde and the incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Fixed parasites were pelleted and blocked with 10% FBS in PBS for 10 min and immunostained with rabbit anti-PfSUB1 and rat anti-TgMIC5. Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and goat anti-rat IgG antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin were used as secondary antibodies. Intensities of FITC and phycoerythrin dyes were measured using a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer and recorded using BD FACSDiva software. Quantification was performed and plotted using FlowJo software version 9.1. Sequence analysis revealed that TgMIC5 bears no significant sequence similarity (E value > 0.001) with any structurally characterized protein. To provide insight to the mechanism of TgMIC5 regulation of TgSUB1 processing, we determined the solution structure of recombinant TgMIC5 using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. After completion of backbone assignments it became apparent that the relaxation properties of the first 54 amino acids were characteristic of high dynamics and displayed no evidence for stable secondary structure. After their removal, the NMR spectra of the globular domain remained unchanged. The NMR side chain resonance assignments and full structure calculations were continued using this construct. The structure revealed an open-sandwich antiparallel-α/antiparallel-β fold, comprising two α-helices, α1 and α2, and a four-stranded β-sheet, β1–β4 (Fig. 1, A–C). The heteronuclear 15N NOE showed that NOE values for the C-terminal six residues are significantly lower than for the main globular domain (Fig. 1D). Regions that undergo internal motion faster than overall tumbling showed a decreased NOE intensity relative to the average. This indicates that the C-terminal peptide is flexible (Fig. 1E). A search for protein structure similarities using programs DALI (26Holm L. Sander C. DALI: a network tool for protein structure comparison.Trends Biochem.

Acta. 2000; 1477: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Prodomains can serve as intramolecular chaperones as well as transient inhibitors to prevent premature enzymatic activity. For these metalloproteinases, the prodomains are N-terminal extensions that function as a gatekeeper by preventing substrate access to the catalytic site. The globular part of the prodomain contacts the entrance to the active site. Activation occurs through proteolysis of the connecting helical linker, which makes further interactions with the enzymatic domain and contains the cleavage site for activation. TgMIC5 does not possess these features, but is terminated with a sequence that displays significant flexibility in the solution structure (Fig. 1D). This region also possesses three hydrophobic residues (DSEVKLA; Fig. 1E) together with four charged groups (Asp, Glu, Lys, and C terminus) that could contribute to a protein-protein interaction site. Further manual analysis of similar structures revealed that the structure of TgMIC5 is also shared by prodomains of the subtilisin-like family of proteases (Z-score = 3.4 for PDB ID code 3CNQ; Fig. 2B) (31Nakagawa M. Ueyama M. Tsuruta H. Uno T. Kanamaru K. Mikami B. Yamagata H. Functional analysis of the cucumisin propeptide as a potent inhibitor of its mature enzyme.J. Biol.

Engineering substrate preference in subtilisin: structural and kinetic analysis of a specificity mutant.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6628-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this case the C-terminal junction point lies directly within the active site and inhibits activity. Subtilisin prodomains can be used in trans as soluble inhibitors of their cognate enzymes, as well as inhibit those from other family members (33Fugère M. Limperis P.C. Beaulieu-Audy V. Gagnon F. Lavigne P. Klarskov K. Leduc R. Day R. Inhibitory potency and specificity of subtilase-like pro-protein convertase (SPC) prodomains.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7648-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of subtilisin prodomains is essential for enzymatic inhibition. Furthermore, a small hydrophobic surface is formed between the β-sheet surface of the prodomains and two helices from the catalytic domain (Fig. 2, A and B). The similarity with subtilisin-like prodomains raises the question of whether TgMIC5 acts in a fashion similar to that of an inhibitor of TgSUB1. The catalytic domain of TgSUB1 shows sequence identities of ∼30% to the closest nonapicomplexan subtilisins, which enables a homology model of this domain to be generated reliably. The model of TgSUB1 was calculated with SWISSmodel (34Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL workspace: a web-based environment for protein structure homology modelling.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6025) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of proteinase K from Refs. 35Helland R.

A striking feature of this model is that the flexible C terminus (EVLKA) could extend into the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 2C). We reasoned that if the mechanism of action of TgMIC5 is similar to that of a subtilisin propeptide then the flexible C-terminal peptide should contain amino acids that are conserved in the corresponding region of subtilisin propeptides. Alignment of TgMIC5 with the propeptides of TgSUB1 and SUB1 sequences from other apicomplexans revealed strict conservation of Asp132 and Val135, suggesting that these residues are important for the mechanism of action (Fig. 2D). Based on this alignment and the assignment of residues relative to the Plasmodium SUB1 propeptide cleavage site, Val135 occupies the P4 position and Asp132 resides in the P7 position. The docking model between TgMIC5 and the active site of TgSUB1 suggested a possible mechanism in which the flexible C terminus of TgMIC5 ext"
https://openalex.org/W2028484374,"While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies--the addition of energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries--can affect consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited.

https://openalex.org/W1965642774,"Tumor necrosis factor α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered a promising cancer therapeutic agent due to its ability to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, while sparing normal cells. However, many human tumors including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are partially or completely resistant to monotherapy with TRAIL, limiting its therapeutic utility. Therefore, identification of factors that contribute to TRAIL resistance may facilitate future development of more effective TRAIL-based cancer therapies. Here, we report a previously unknown role for WT1 in mediating TRAIL resistance in leukemia. Knockdown of WT1 with shRNA rendered TRAIL-resistant myeloid leukemia cells sensitive to TRAIL-induced cell death, and re-expression of shRNA-resistant WT1 restored TRAIL resistance. Notably, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in WT1-silenced cells was largely due to down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Moreover, WT1 expression strongly correlated with overexpression of Bcl-xL in AML cell lines and blasts from AML patients. Furthermore, we found that WT1 transactivates Bcl-xL by directly binding to its promoter. We previously showed that WT1 is a novel client protein of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in reduced WT1 and Bcl-xL expression leading to increased sensitivity of leukemia cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest that WT1-dependent Bcl-xL overexpression contributes to TRAIL resistance in myeloid leukemias.

TRAIL induces apoptosis through binding its two proapoptotic receptors, DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), followed by recruitment of an adaptor molecule (Fas-associated death domain) and initiator caspases (caspase-8/10) to the death-inducing signaling complex and subsequent activation of downstream effector caspases (3Ashkenazi A.

The apoptotic signals at the death receptors can cross-talk with the mitochondrial pathway through the caspase-8 cleavage of Bid. The truncated Bid translocates to mitochondria, triggers cytochrome c release, and amplifies the apoptotic signal (4Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

The mouse monoclonal anti-WT1 and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Millipore and Sigma, respectively. All other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. HeLa and human myeloid leukemia cell lines K562, THP-1, and MV4-11 were purchased from ATCC and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixtures (Invitrogen) antibiotics. K562 cells with stable WT1 knockdown has been described previously (27Bansal H. Bansal S. Rao M. Foley K.P. Sang J. Proia D.A. Blackman R.K. Ying W. Barsoum J. Baer M.R. Kelly K. Swords R.

Peripheral blood mononuclear blasts were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient from deidentified AML patient samples obtained from the Institution Review Board-approved biorepository at the Texas Transplant Institute. The control and Bcl-xL shRNA vectors (Open Biosystems), and the plasmid harboring full-length Bcl-xL cDNA were received as a kind gift from Dr. Salvatore Oliviero (29Salameh A. Galvagni F. Anselmi F. De Clemente C. Orlandini M. Oliviero S. Growth factor stimulation induces cell survival by c-Jun: ATF2-dependent activation of Bcl-xL.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23096-23104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The full-length Bcl-xL cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primer pair 5′-AACGAATTCGACCATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGAG-3′). The PCR product was cloned via EcoRI/XhoI sites into pcDNA3.1 (+) vector. The human Bcl-xL promoter-reporter construct (Bcl-xL-Luc) was generated by amplifying the promoter sequence (from nucleotides −635 to +15 relative to transcription start site) from K562 cell genomic DNA and cloned into SacI/HindIII sites of promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Western blotting of whole cell protein extracts from cells and AML blasts was performed as described previously (27Bansal H. Bansal S. Rao M. Foley K.P. Sang J. Proia D.A. Blackman R.K. Ying W. Barsoum J. Baer M.R. Kelly K. Swords R. Tomlinson G.E. Battiwalla M. Giles F.J. Lee K.P. Padmanabhan S. Heat shock protein 90 regulates the expression of Wilms tumor 1 protein in myeloid leukemias.Blood. 2010; 116: 4591-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well and transiently co-transfected with a constant amount of a Bcl-xL promoter luciferase reporter (Bcl-xL-Luc;100 ng) and Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK; 10 ng) together with or without the WT1 expression plasmid (250 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For all transfections, the total DNA amounts were kept constant (500 ng) using empty parental plasmid (pcDNA 3.1). Luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Results represent an average firefly luciferase value after normalization to Renilla luciferase signal, and the -fold activation was obtained by setting the value of control as 1.0. All transfections were carried out in triplicate. Apoptosis was measured using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BioVision) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. The shRNA-resistant WT1 (WT1SR) expression construct was generated by introducing four silent mutations into the cDNA sequence that is targeted by WT1 shRNA without changing the amino acid sequence. All mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The resulting WT1 cDNA was sequenced to verify the presence of silent mutations and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. For WT1 rescue experiments, WT1 knockdown K562 cells were transfected with control (vector) or WT1SR plasmid, and stable cells with WT1 overexpression were generated by G418 sulfate selection. ChIP assays were performed using the HighCell# ChIP kit (Diagenode) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, K562 cells were cross-linked by formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%, and cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. After cross-linking, the chromatin DNA was sheared into 200–500-bp fragments by sonication using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). The sheared chromatin was incubated with WT1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG (as a negative control) at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein-A magnetic beads. After reversing the cross-link, the purified DNA was used as template for 40 cycles of PCR amplification with 5′-GCCAAGGGGCGTGCAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-GAGGGATGCGACGACCCGGC-3′ primer set. The amplified PCR fragments were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA miniprep kit (Agilent Technologies). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR was performed using AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. β-Actin was used as an internal control for gene expression. The following gene-specific primers were used for PCR: Bcl-xL, 5′-ATGGCAGCAGTAAAGCAAGCG-3′ and 5′-TCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGA-3′; WT1, 5′-TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA-3′ and 5′-GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT-3′; and β-actin, 5′-AGCGAGCATCCCCCAAAGTT-3′ and 5′-GGGCACGAAGGCTCATCATT-3′. The PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The results are representative of at least three independent experiments and are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate samples. Data were analyzed using the Student's t test and analysis of variance with the Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences are considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been reported to be associated with overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins (30Malhi H. Gores G.J. TRAIL resistance results in cancer progression: a TRAIL to perdition?.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7333-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether WT1, which is frequently overexpressed in leukemia cells, is associated with TRAIL resistance. Human myeloid leukemia K562 cells are resistant to TRAIL (31Hietakangas V. Poukkula M. Heiskanen K.M. Karvinen J.T. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. Erythroid differentiation sensitizes K562 leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by down-regulation of c-FLIP.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1278-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and shRNA-mediated silencing of WT1 expression in these cells significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis when compared with cells transfected with nonsilencing (NS) shRNA (Fig. 1A). To confirm that TRAIL-induced cell death in WT1-depleted cells occurs through an apoptotic pathway, we evaluated the effects of WT1 knockdown and TRAIL on several molecules involved in apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1B, co-treatment with TRAIL and WT1 shRNA elicited the activation of initiator caspase-8/-9 and effector caspase-3 and also induced Bax expression, consistent with induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1B). Bax promotes apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which in turn facilitates caspase activation via apoptosome (32Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, more cytochrome c release was observed after TRAIL treatment in WT1 knockdown (WT1KD) cells than in control cells (Fig. 1B). Because TRAIL resistance in cancers has been attributed to attenuated expression of the TRAIL death receptors DR4 and DR5 or overexpression of the decoy receptors DcR1 and DcR2 (11Riccioni R. Pasquini L. Mariani G. Saulle E. Rossini A. Diverio D. Pelosi E. Vitale A. Chierichini A. Cedrone M. Foà R. Lo Coco F. Peschle C. Testa U. TRAIL decoy receptors mediate resistance of acute myeloid leukemia cells to TRAIL.Haematologica. 2005; 90: 612-624PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the expression of these receptors in WT1-depleted cells. Interestingly, WT1 knockdown cells did not display significant differences in the expression of DRs and DcRs as assessed by Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, our data suggest that WT1 does not regulate death-inducing signaling complex by modulating the expression levels of TRAIL receptors. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of increased susceptibility of WT1KD cells to TRAIL, the expression of various antiapoptotic molecules that interfere with TRAIL signaling was also examined. As shown in Fig. 1C, WT1 down-regulation did not affect expression of FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIPL), Mcl-1, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). In contrast, the protein levels of Bcl-xL were remarkably reduced by shRNA-mediated suppression of WT1. Because the overexpression of Bcl-xL has been implicated in TRAIL resistance (12Kim I.K. Jung Y.K. Noh D.Y. Song Y.S. Choi C.H. Oh B.H. Masuda E.S. Functional screening of genes suppressing TRAIL-induced apoptosis: distinct inhibitory activities of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2.Br. J.

TRAIL promotes metastasis of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7434-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), our data suggest that WT1 knockdown induced a decrease of Bcl-xL expression, thus predisposing leukemia cells to apoptosis-inducing effects of TRAIL. In addition, the induction of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-xL in WT1 knockdown cells thus presumably increased the Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, which, in turn resulted in activation of caspase-3 and -9 and potentiation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. These findings are consistent with the earlier reports that the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL is considered critical for apoptosis induction (34Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. Bax-induced caspase activation and apoptosis via cytochrome c release from mitochondria is inhibitable by Bcl-xL.J. Biol.

Bax directly induces release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that results obtained by WT1 knockdown were due to RNAi-mediated off-target effects, we generated an shRNA-resistant WT1 cDNA (WT1SR) and performed rescue experiments. The ectopic expression of WT1SR restored Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 1D) and reversed the TRAIL-sensitizing effect of shRNA-induced WT1 knockdown (Fig. 1E). These findings confirmed that the observed WT1 shRNA-induced sensitization of leukemia cells to TRAIL was caused by specific suppression of WT1 rather than by unforeseen effects of the WT1 shRNA on other genes. Next, we investigated the involvement of Bcl-xL in mediating TRAIL resistance. We found that knockdown of Bcl-xL by shRNA enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1F) and phenocopied the effects of WT1 knockdown in K562 cells. To directly assess the functional contribution of Bcl-xL in WT1-mediated TRAIL resistance, we examined whether ectopic expression of Bcl-xL in WT1-depleted cells restores TRAIL resistance. Interestingly, exogenous Bcl-xL could rescue cells from undergoing TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1G). These results demonstrate that Bcl-xL is a key downstream mediator contributing to WT1-dependent TRAIL resistance. Bcl-xL has been reported to act downstream of caspase-8 activation, and Bcl-xL has been shown to prevent Fas- and TNFα-induced apoptosis by inhibiting downstream caspase activation (36Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Bcl-xL acts downstream of caspase-8 activation by the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex.J. Biol.

We also observed that overexpression of Bcl-xL protected WT1 knockdown cells against TRAIL by blocking the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (data not shown). These observations are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that Bcl-xL promotes TRAIL resistance through inhibition of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways (38Bai J. Sui J.

Next, we analyzed whether myeloid leukemia cells show varied susceptibility to TRAIL and whether WT1 levels correlate with TRAIL sensitivity. Indeed, we found that the levels of WT1 were comparatively lower in MV4-11 cells than in THP-1 and K562 cells (Fig. 2A), and this was associated with differences in TRAIL sensitivity (Fig. 2G; untreated versus TRAIL bars). Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between the levels of WT1 and Bcl-xL transcripts and proteins in myeloid leukemia cell lines (Fig. 2A) and leukemic blasts of AML patients (Fig. 2B). The above experiments suggest that WT1 might be a positive regulator of Bcl-xL and prompted us to examine possible WT1 binding sites in Bcl-xL gene promoter. Our in silico analysis using Genomatix MatInspector software identified two potential WT1 binding sites on Bcl-xL promoter. To evaluate whether endogenous WT1 can bind within a chromatin environment to the Bcl-xL promoter region containing the in silico identified putative binding sites, we performed ChIP assays in K562 cells, which express significant amounts of endogenous WT1 and Bcl-xL. WT1 occupancy of the Bcl-xL promoter was detectable in anti-WT1 and not in control IgG precipitates (Fig. 2C). To assess whether forced expression of WT1 could alter the endogenous levels of Bcl-xL, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with empty or WT1 expression vector. The expression of Bcl-xL and WT1 was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. We observed a significant increase in Bcl-xL mRNA and protein levels in WT1-transfected cells when compared with cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 2D). To address whether the Bcl-xL promoter could respond to WT1, we generated a luciferase reporter construct Bcl-xL-Luc. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Bcl-xL-Luc together with or without the expression plasmid for WT1. As shown in Fig. 2E, simultaneous expression of WT1 significantly increased the luciferase activity driven by Bcl-xL promoter. Taken together, these results strongly argue that WT1 up-regulates the expression of Bcl-xL at the transcriptional as well as translational level. We have previously shown that Hsp90 inhibition down-regulated WT1 and its target proteins in leukemia cells in vitro as well as in vivo in tumor xenografts (27Bansal H. Bansal S. Rao M. Foley K.P.

Heat shock protein 90 regulates the expression of Wilms tumor 1 protein in myeloid leukemias.Blood. 2010; 116: 4591-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We wanted to investigate whether or not WT1 down-regulation induced by inhibition of Hsp90 is also associated with reduced levels of Bcl-xL. A dose-dependent reduction of WT1 and Bcl-xL protein levels was observed in cells treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG (Fig. 2F). Similarly, 17-AAG treatment resulted in reduced expression of WT1 and Bcl-xL in K562 cell xenograft tumors (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of WT1 is crucial for Bcl-xL expression in leukemia cells. Numerous studies have shown that TRAIL resistance can be overcome by the combined application of chemotherapeutic drugs and natural products (40Shankar S. Srivastava R.K.

Dihydroflavonol BB-1, an extract of natural plant Blumea balsamifera, abrogates TRAIL resistance in leukemia cells.Blood. 2006; 107: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the importance of WT1 down-regulation by Hsp90 inhibition in potentiating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells. As shown in Fig. 2G, K562 leukemia cells when compared with THP-1 and MV4-11 cells were relatively resistant to TRAIL or 17-AAG treatment. However, apoptosis was greatly enhanced in all three cell lines when 17-AAG was combined with TRAIL. The results obtained with WT1 shRNA, in conjunction with data that Hsp90 inhibition markedly reduces WT1 expression and sensitizes leukemia cells to TRAIL, further suggest that induction of WT1 loss by 17-AAG is responsible, at least in part, for the elimination of TRAIL resistance. In conclusion, we identified WT1 as a new determinant of TRAIL resistance in leukemia cells. Therefore, TRAIL in combination with agents that inhibit WT1 expression such as Hsp90 inhibitors might have a clinical applicability for the treatment of TRAIL-insensitive leukemia cells. In addition, these findings may provide a novel framework for overcoming TRAIL resistance of other cancer cells that show aberrant overexpression of WT1. Future preclinical work including analysis of TRAIL-induced apoptosis and WT1/Bcl-xL expression in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant AML is warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2155023397,"For vaccine-preventable infections, immunization generally needs to be supplemented by palliative care of individuals missed by the vaccination. Costs and availability of vaccine doses and palliative care vary by disease and by region. In many situations, resources for delivery of palliative care are independent of resources required for vaccination; however we also need to consider the conservative scenario where there is some trade-off between efforts, which is of potential relevance for resource-poor settings. We formulate an SEIR model that includes those two control strategies – vaccination and palliative care. We consider their relative merit and optimal allocation in the context of a highly efficacious vaccine, and under the assumption that palliative care may reduce transmission. We investigate the utility of a range of mixed or pure strategies that can be implemented after an epidemic has started, and look for rule-of-thumb principles of how best to reduce the burden of disease during an acute outbreak over a spectrum of vaccine-preventable infections. Intuitively, we expect the best strategy to initially focus on vaccination, and enhanced palliative care after the infection has peaked, but a number of plausible realistic constraints for control result in important qualifications on the intervention strategy. The time in the epidemic when one should switch strategy depends sensitively on the relative cost of vaccine to palliative care, the available budget, and . Crucially, outbreak response vaccination may be more effective in managing low- diseases, while high scenarios enhance the importance of routine vaccination and case management."
https://openalex.org/W1994279427,"The application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-based mass spectrometry (MS) to the proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue presents significant technical challenges. In situ enzymatic digestion is frequently used to unlock formalin-fixed tissues for analysis, but the results are often unsatisfactory. Here, we report a new, simplified in situ pretreatment method for preparing tissue sections for MS that involves heating with vapor containing acetonitrile in a small airtight pressurized space. The utility of the novel method is shown using FFPE tissue of human colon carcinoma. The number and intensity of MALDI peaks obtained from analysis of pretreated tissue was significantly higher than control tissue not subjected to pretreatment. A prominent peak (m/z 850) apparently specific to cancerous tissue was identified as a fragment of histone H2A in FFPE tissue pretreated using our method. This highly sensitive treatment may enable MALDI-MS analysis of archived pathological FFPE samples, thus leading to the identification of new biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2003345584,"Background Neuroblastoma is thought to originate from neural crest-derived cells. CD57 defines migratory neural crest cells in normal development and is expressed in neuroblastoma. Methodology and Principal Findings We investigated the role of CD57 expression in neuroblastoma cells ex situ and in situ. Compared to CD57low U-NB1 neuroblastoma cells, CD57high cells developed tumors with decreased latency after orthotopic transplantation into adrenal glands of mice. In addition, CD57high U-NB1 and SK-N-BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells were also more clonogenic, induced more spheres and were less lineage-restricted. CD57high cells attached better to endothelial cells and showed enhanced invasiveness. While invasion of U-NB1 cells was inhibited by blocking antibodies against CD57, neither invasion of SK-N-BE(2)-C cells nor adhesion of U-NB1 and SK-N-BE(2)-C cells was attenuated. After tail vein injection only CD57high cells generated liver metastases, while overall metastatic rate was not increased as compared to CD57low cells. In stroma-poor neuroblastoma of patients CD57high cells were associated with undifferentiated tumor cells across all stages and tended to be more frequent after chemotherapy. Conclusion Strong expression of CD57 correlates with aggressive attributes of U-NB1 and SK-N-BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells and is linked with undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2170192351,"Defining appropriate policies for controlling the spread of fungal disease in agricultural landscapes requires appropriate theoretical models. Most existing models for the fungicidal control of plant diseases do not explicitly include the dynamics of the fungicide itself, nor do they consider the impact of infection occurring during the host growth phase. We introduce a modelling framework for fungicide application that allows us to consider how ""explicit"" modelling of fungicide dynamics affects the invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. Specifically, we show that ""explicit"" models exhibit bistability zones for values of the basic reproductive number (R0) less than one within which the invasion and persistence threshold depends on the initial infection levels. This is in contrast to classical models where invasion and persistence thresholds are solely dependent on R0. In addition if initial infection occurs during the growth phase then an additional ""invasion zone"" can exist for even smaller values of R0. Within this region the system will experience an epidemic that is not able to persist. We further show that ideal fungicides with high levels of effectiveness, low rates of application and low rates of decay lead to the existence of these bistability zones. The results are robust to the inclusion of demographic stochasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1989655470,"We examine the environmental, climatic and geographical controls on tropical ostracod distribution in the marine Ordovician of North America.Analysis of the inter-regional distribution patterns of Ordovician Laurentian ostracods, focussing particularly on the diverse Late Ordovician Sandbian (ca 461 to 456 Ma) faunas, demonstrates strong endemicity at the species-level. Local endemism is very pronounced, ranging from 25% (e.g. Foxe basin) to 75% (e.g. Michigan basin) in each basin, a pattern that is also reflected in other benthic faunas such as brachiopods. Multivariate (ordination) analyses of the ostracod faunas allow demarcation of a Midcontinent Province and a southern Marginal Province in Laurentia. While these are most clearly differentiated at the stratigraphical level of the bicornis graptolite biozone, analyses of the entire dataset suggest that these provinces remain distinct throughout the Sandbian interval. Differences in species composition between the provinces appear to have been controlled by changes in physical parameters (e.g. temperature and salinity) related to water depth and latitude and a possible regional geographic barrier, and these differences persist into the Katian and possibly the Hirnantian. Local environmental parameters, perhaps operating at the microhabitat scale, may have been significant in driving local speciation events from ancestor species in each region.Our work establishes a refined methodology for assessing marine benthic arthropod micro-benthos provinciality for the Early Palaeozoic."
https://openalex.org/W2038317691,"General anaesthesia is associated with hypothermia, oxidative stress, and immune depression. Uncoupling Protein (UCP2) is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family present in many organs including the spleen, the lung and the brain. A role of UCP2 in the activation of the inflammatory/immune cells, in the secretion of hormones, and in the excitability of neurons by regulating the production of reactive oxygen species has been discussed. Because of the side effects of anaesthesia listed above, we aimed to question the expression and the function of UCP2 during anaesthesia. Induction of anaesthesia with ketamine (20 mg/kg) or isoflurane (3.6%) and induction of sedation with the α2 adrenergic receptor agonist medetomidine (0.2 mg/kg) stimulated infiltration of immune cells in the lung and increased UCP2 protein content in the lung, in both immune and non-immune cells. UCP2 content in the lung inversely correlated with body temperature decrease induced by medetomidine treatment. Challenge of the Ucp2(-/-) mice with isoflurane and medetomidine revealed an earlier behavioral recovery phenotype. Transponder analysis of body temperature and activity showed no difference between Ucp2(-/-) and control mice in basal conditions. However, upon an acute decrease of body temperature induced by medetomidine, Ucp2(-/-) mice exhibited increased locomotion activity. Together, these results show that UCP2 is rapidly mobilized during anaesthesia and sedation in immune cells, and suggest a role of UCP2 in locomotion."
