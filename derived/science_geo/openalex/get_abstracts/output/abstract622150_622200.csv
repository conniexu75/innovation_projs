https://openalex.org/W2901560247,"This research expands efforts to understand differences in NIH funding associated with the self-identified race and ethnicity of applicants. We collected data from 2,397 NIH Biographical Sketches submitted between FY 2003 and 2006 as part of new NIH R01 Type 1 applications to obtain detailed information on the applicants' training and scholarly activities, including publications. Using these data, we examined the association between an NIH R01 applicant's race or ethnicity and the probability of receiving an R01 award. The applicant's publication history as reported in the NIH biographical sketch and the associated bibliometrics narrowed the black/white funding gap for new and experienced investigators in explanatory models. We found that black applicants reported fewer papers on their Biosketches, had fewer citations, and those that were reported appeared in journals with lower impact factors. Incorporating these measures in our models explained a substantial portion of the black/white funding gap. Although these predictors influence the funding gap, they do not fully address race/ethnicity differences in receiving a priority score."
https://openalex.org/W2900627007,"Background Prognostication is an essential tool for risk adjustment and decision making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Research into prognostication in ICU has so far been limited to data from admission or the first 24 hours. Most ICU admissions last longer than this, decisions are made throughout an admission, and some admissions are explicitly intended as time-limited prognostic trials. Despite this, temporal changes in prognostic ability during ICU admission has received little attention to date. Current predictive models, in the form of prognostic clinical tools, are typically derived from linear models and do not explicitly handle incremental information from trends. Machine learning (ML) allows predictive models to be developed which use non-linear predictors and complex interactions between variables, thus allowing incorporation of trends in measured variables over time; this has made it possible to investigate prognosis throughout an admission. Methods and findings This study uses ML to assess the predictability of ICU mortality as a function of time. Logistic regression against physiological data alone outperformed APACHE-II and demonstrated several important interactions including between lactate & noradrenaline dose, between lactate & MAP, and between age & MAP consistent with the current sepsis definitions. ML models consistently outperformed logistic regression with Deep Learning giving the best results. Predictive power was maximal on the second day and was further improved by incorporating trend data. Using a limited range of physiological and demographic variables, the best machine learning model on the first day showed an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.883 (σ = 0.008), compared to 0.846 (σ = 0.010) for a logistic regression from the same predictors and 0.836 (σ = 0.007) for a logistic regression based on the APACHE-II score. Adding information gathered on the second day of admission improved the maximum AUC to 0.895 (σ = 0.008). Beyond the second day, predictive ability declined. Conclusion This has implications for decision making in intensive care and provides a justification for time-limited trials of ICU therapy; the assessment of prognosis over more than one day may be a valuable strategy as new information on the second day helps to differentiate outcomes. New ML models based on trend data beyond the first day could greatly improve upon current risk stratification tools."
https://openalex.org/W2951725148,"For many disease-causing virus species, global diversity is clustered into a taxonomy of subtypes with clinical significance. In particular, the classification of infections among the subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a routine component of clinical management, and there are now many classification algorithms available for this purpose. Although several of these algorithms are similar in accuracy and speed, the majority are proprietary and require laboratories to transmit HIV-1 sequence data over the network to remote servers. This potentially exposes sensitive patient data to unauthorized access, and makes it impossible to determine how classifications are made and to maintain the data provenance of clinical bioinformatic workflows. We propose an open-source supervised and alignment-free subtyping method (Kameris) that operates on k-mer frequencies in HIV-1 sequences. We performed a detailed study of the accuracy and performance of subtype classification in comparison to four state-of-the-art programs. Based on our testing data set of manually curated real-world HIV-1 sequences (n = 2, 784), Kameris obtained an overall accuracy of 97%, which matches or exceeds all other tested software, with a processing rate of over 1,500 sequences per second. Furthermore, our fully standalone general-purpose software provides key advantages in terms of data security and privacy, transparency and reproducibility. Finally, we show that our method is readily adaptable to subtype classification of other viruses including dengue, influenza A, and hepatitis B and C virus."
https://openalex.org/W2901640576,"Objective The primary objective of this study was to determine the correlation between procalcitonin values and illness severity by evaluating the degree of end organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, length of stay and the severity of sepsis (sepsis alone vs. septic shock), The hypothesis that procalcitonin values would be higher in sicker patients was formulated before data collection began. Secondary outcomes studied in relation to procalcitonin levels included infection characteristics such as the site of infection, microbial agent and dialysis dependent CKD. Design Unblinded retrospective cohort study. September 2014-December 2016. Setting 364 patients with a diagnosis of sepsis or severe sepsis who were admitted to the general medical ward and ICU at Methodist Medical Center and Proctor Hospital in Peoria, Illinois, USA. Results This study demonstrates the following: Weak positive correlation between procalcitonin and SOFA score. Negligible correlation with length of stay. Higher values in patients who died than in patients who survived to discharge (p = 0.058). Sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin for septic shock was 63 and 65% respectively. Sites typically infected by gram negative bacteria have higher procalcitonin values than sites infected by gram positive bacteria (p = 0.03). Higher procalcitonin in bacteremia than non-bacteremic infections (p = 0.004). Higher procalcitonin in dialysis-dependent CKD patients (p = 0.020). Conclusions Procalcitonin has a higher specificity for bacterial infections than other acute phase reactants. Although initial procalcitonin value may be helpful in the determination of illness severity, it is not always a reliable prognostic indicator and carries little significance as a standalone value. Procalcitonin values may be influenced by preexisting comorbid conditions such as chronic kidney disease, which are associated with higher procalcitonin values at baseline. Procalcitonin can provide invaluable information when viewed as one piece of a clinical puzzle, and is most powerful when the interpreting physician is aware of how values are influenced by the different clinical scenarios presented in this article."
https://openalex.org/W2900508424,"College-bound young people experience sexual assault, both before and after they enter college. This study examines historical risk factors (experiences and exposures that occurred prior to college) for penetrative sexual assault (PSA) victimization since entering college.A cross-sectional study, including an online population-based quantitiative survey with undergraduate students was conducted in spring 2016. Bivariate analyses and multivariable regressions examined risk and protective factors associated with ever experiencing PSA since entering college. Concurrently-collected in-depth ethnographic interviews with 151 students were reviewed for information related to factors identified in the survey.In bivariate analyses, multiple historical factors were significantly associated with PSA in college including adverse childhood experiences and having experienced unwanted sexual contact before college (for women) and initiation of alcohol, marijuana, and sexual behaviors before age 18. Significant independent risk factors for college PSA included female gender, experiencing unwanted sexual contact before college, first oral sex before age 18, and ""hooking up"" (e.g., causual sex or sex outside a committed partnership) in high school. Receipt of school-based sex education promoting refusal skills before age 18 was an independent protective factor; abstinence-only instruction was not. In the ethnographic interviews, students reported variable experiences with sex education before college; many reported it was awkward and poorly delivered.Multiple experiences and exposures prior to college influenced the risk of penetrative sexual assault in college. Pre-college comprehensive sexuality education, including skills-based training in refusing unwanted sex, may be an effective strategy for preventing sexual assault in college. Sexual assault prevention needs to begin earlier; successful prevention before college should complement prevention efforts once students enter college."
https://openalex.org/W2901374334,"Streptomyces species 1-14 isolated from cassava rhizosphere soil were evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race 4 (FOC4). Of the 63 strains tested, thirteen exhibited potent antibacterial properties and were further screened against eight fungal pathogens. The strain that showed maximum inhibition against all of the test pathogens was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Streptomyces sp. 1-14, was selected for further studies. Through the propagation of Streptomyces sp. 1-14 in soil under simulated conditions, we found that FOC4 did not significantly influence the multiplication and survival of Streptomyces sp. 1-14, while indigenous microorganisms in the soil did significantly influence Streptomyces sp. 1-14 populations. To achieve maximum metabolite production, the growth of Streptomyces 1-14 was optimized through response surface methodology employing Plackett-Burman design, path of steepest ascent determinations and Box-Behnken design. The final optimized fermentation conditions (g/L) included: glucose, 38.877; CaCl2•2H2O, 0.161; temperature, 29.97°C; and inoculation amount, 8.93%. This optimization resulted in an antibacterial activity of 56.13% against FOC4, which was 12.33% higher than that before optimization (43.80%). The results obtained using response surface methodology to optimize the fermentation medium had a significant effect on the production of bioactive metabolites by Streptomyces sp. 1-14. Moreover, during fermentation and storage, pH, light, storage temperature, etc., must be closely monitored to reduce the formation of fermentation products with reduced antibacterial activity. This method is useful for further investigations of the production of anti-FOC4 substances, and could be used to develop bio-control agents to suppress or control banana fusarium wilt."
https://openalex.org/W2901097916,"Sleep loss is a widespread problem with serious physical and economic consequences. Music can impact upon physical, psychological and emotional states, which may explain anecdotal reports of its success as an everyday sleep aid. However, there is a lack of systematic data on how widely it is used, why people opt for music as a sleep aid, or what music works; hence the underlying drivers to music-sleep effects remain unclear. We investigated music as a sleep aid within the general public via a mixed methods data online survey (n = 651) that scored musicality, sleep habits, and open text responses on what music helps sleep and why. In total, 62% of respondents stated that they used music to help them sleep. They reported fourteen musical genres comprising 545 artists. Linear modelling found stress, age, and music use as significant predictors of sleep quality (PSQI) scores. Regression tree modelling revealed that younger people with higher musical engagement were significantly more likely to use music to aid sleep. Thematic analysis of the open text responses generated four themes that described why people believe music helps sleep: music offers unique properties that stimulate sleep (Provide), music is part of a normal sleep routine (Habit), music induces a physical or mental state conducive to sleep (State), and music blocks an internal or external stimulus that would otherwise disrupt sleep (Distract). This survey provides new evidence into the relationship between music and sleep in a population that ranged widely in age, musicality, sleep habits and stress levels. In particular, the results highlight the varied pathways of effect between music and sleep. Diversity was observed both in music choices, which reflected idiosyncratic preferences rather than any consistent musical structure, and in the reasons why music supports good sleep, which went far beyond simple physical/mental relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2900558267,"Introduction Neural tube defects are the major causes of fetal loss and considerable disabilities in infants. Currently, there is no significant research on the incidence of Neural tube defects in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Objective To determine the incidence and clinical pattern of the Neural Tube Defects. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2016 to June 2017. All pregnancy outcomes were examined for any externally visible birth defects and neurological integrity by trained midwives under the supervision of senior obstetrics and gynecology and a neurosurgeon. Data were collected using a survey tool to collect maternal and newborn demographic data and a checklist developed to capture newborns with Neural Tube Defects. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. The prevalence of NTDs was calculated per 10,000 births. Result Out of the 14,903 births during the study period, a total of 195 infants were born afflicted with Neural Tube Defects. The burden of infants with anencephaly and spina bifida was 66.4 and 64.4 per 10, 000 births, respectively. The overall incidence rate of NTDs in this study was 131 per 10, 000 births of which 23% were liveborn and 77% were stillborn. The highest burden of Neural Tube Defects was observed in Adigrat Hospital from Eastern Zone of Tigray (174 per 10,000 births) and Lemlem Karl Hospital from Southern Zone of Tigray (304 per 10,000 births) compared to Kahsay Abera Hospital from Western Zone (72.8 per 10,000 births) and Sihul Hospital from North Western Zone of Tigray (69.8 per 10,000 births). Conclusion and recommendation Assuming that the non folic acid preventable rate should be 5 per 10,000 births, our prevalence rate is 131 per 10,000 births, and then we have a rate or an epidemic that is 26 times what it should be. This just emphasizes the urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all of folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent 96% (125/130) of spina bifida and anencephaly in the Tigray Provence."
https://openalex.org/W2900725639,"Introduction The common hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius L. is a vulnerable species that requires efficient methods to monitor its populations for conservation purposes. Rapid evolution of civil drones provides new opportunities but survey protocols still need development. This study aims to determine the optimal flight parameters for accurate population estimates. A second objective is to evaluate the effects of three environmental factors: wind speed, sun reflection and cloud cover. Method We estimated the population of two main hippo schools (Dungu and Wilibadi II) located in Garamba National Park in Democratic republic of Congo. Eight observers reviewed 252 photos taken over the Dungu school, representing a total of 2016 experimental units. A detection rate and a level of certainty were associated with each experimental unit, and five parameters were related to each count: flight height, three environmental parameters (sun reflection on water surface, cloud cover, and wind speed), and observers’ experience. Results Flight height reduced the observers’ confidence in their detection ability, rather than the detection itself. For accurate counts of large groups an average height of 150 m was shown to be a good compromise between animal detection without zooming in and the area covered in one frame. Wind speed had little influence on the counts, but it affected the performance of the UAS. Sun reflection reduced the detection rate of hippos and increased level of certainty, while cloud cover reduced detection rates slightly. Therefore, we recommend flying when the sun is still low on the horizon and when there is little cloud, or when cloud cover is light and even. This last point reinforces our recommendation for flights early in the day. The counts also showed large differences between groups of inexperienced and experienced observers. Experienced observers achieved better detection rates and were generally more confident in their detection. Experienced observers detected 86.5% of the hippos on average (confidence interval = ±0.76%). When applied to data from the second site, the detection was 84.3% (confidence interval = ±1.84%). Two correction factors were then calculated, as the inverse of the detection rate, based on the estimated number of hippos present during one flight (Factor 1) or in the general population respectively (Factor 2). Factor 2 especially was consistent with previous studies using traditional aerial counts (1.22 vs 1.25). Factor 2 was found to be appropriate for use by experienced observers. These results confirm the use of correction factor 2 for hippo surveys, regardless of the study site, as it accounts for hippo behavior. Optimum counting and cost efficiency were achieved with two trained observers counting 7 pictures. Conclusion This study is a promising approach for routine surveys of the hippopotamus which is a species usually ignored in wildlife counts. Drone technology is expected to improve rapidly; therefore UAS could become a very useful and affordable survey tool for other species requiring specific monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2901471644,"Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients is of prognostic value in determining short- and mid-term outcomes. Inflammatory biomarkers, such as platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), have been proposed as predictive factors of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Currently, there are no studies in Colombian patients reporting the role of inflammatory biomarkers as response predictors in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, in this study we performed a cross-sectional study and analyzed the association between inflammatory biomarkers and pCR (pathological complete response) in patients diagnosed with breast cancer–of different molecular subtypes- and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 288 patients were included in the study, with a median age of 51 years old. Disease was locally advanced in 83% of the participants, and 77.7% had compromised lymph nodes. In our cohort, the most frequent tumor molecular subtype was luminal B/Her2- (27.8%) followed by triple negative [TN] (21.5%), luminal B/Her2+ (19.8%), Her2-enriched (16%) and luminal A (13.5%). PLR was not associated with age, menopausal status, baseline tumor size, histologic grade, axillary lymph node involvement, disease stage, estrogen receptor status, or Ki67; however, complete pathological response was significantly higher in the low PLR group (PLR<150) compared with the high PLR group (35.1% Vs. 22.2%, p = 0.03). In addition, Her2-enriched tumors achieved the highest pCR rates (65%), followed by TN (34%) tumors. Our results suggest that breast cancer patients with low platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR <150), treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieve higher complete pathological response, independently of primary tumor molecular subtype."

Data on foetal characteristics such as birth weight, and sex and maternal age, parity, maternal education, marital status, ethnicity, religious affiliation and socio-economic characteristics were collected and described. Tests of means, proportions and Chi-squares are employed in bivariate analysis, and adjusted logistic regression models fitted to control for potential confounding variables. All tests were two-sided and test of significance was set at p-value of < 0.05.There were 8,263 live births (44.9% females) with an overall average birth weight of 2.85 kg (2.9 kg for males and 2.8 kg for females). The average maternal age was 28 years, median parity 2, maternal literacy rate was about 70% and 83% of mothers were married. The prevalence of low birth weight was 13.8% 95%CI [13.10, 14.6] and more in female babies than in males (15.5% vs 12.2%; p<0.0001). Determinants of low birth-weight after controlling for confounding factors were sex of neonate (OR = 1.32, 95%CI [1.14,1.52]; p<0.0001), maternal age (p = 0.004), and mothers who are not married (OR = 1.44 [1.19, 1.74]; p<0.0001).Female neonates in this population were likely to present with low birth weight and maternal factors such as younger age, lower socio-economic status and single parenthood were major determinants of low birth weight. Effective and adequate antenatal care should therefore target women with these risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2901115420,"Implantable-cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) detect and terminate life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia with electric shocks after they occur. This puts patients at risk if they are driving or in a situation where they can fall. ICD's shocks are also very painful and affect a patient's quality of life. It would be ideal if ICDs can accurately predict the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and then issue a warning or provide preventive therapy. Our study explores the use of ICD data to automatically predict ventricular arrhythmia using heart rate variability (HRV). A 5 minute and a 10 second warning system are both developed and compared. The participants for this study consist of 788 patients who were enrolled in the ICD arm of the Sudden Cardiac Death-Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT). Two groups of patient rhythms, regular heart rhythms and pre-ventricular-tachyarrhythmic rhythms, are analyzed and different HRV features are extracted. Machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM), are trained on these features to classify the two groups of rhythms in a subset of the data comprising the training set. These algorithms are then used to classify rhythms in a separate test set. This performance is quantified by the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. Both RF and SVM methods achieve a mean AUC of 0.81 for 5-minute prediction and mean AUC of 0.87-0.88 for 10-second prediction; an AUC over 0.8 typically warrants further clinical investigation. Our work shows that moderate classification accuracy can be achieved to predict ventricular tachyarrhythmia with machine learning algorithms using HRV features from ICD data. These results provide a realistic view of the practical challenges facing implementation of machine learning algorithms to predict ventricular tachyarrhythmia using HRV data, motivating continued research on improved algorithms and additional features with higher predictive power."

Stability of these clusters was assessed and supervised random forest analysis verified the clusters' reproducibility. Clinical relevance of the clusters was assessed through multivariable analysis, comparing differences in risk for a composite outcome (macrovascular and microvascular outcomes, hypoglycemic events, and all-cause mortality) at HbA1c thresholds for each cluster.Among 60,423 patients, three clusters of HbA1c trajectories were generated: stable (n = 45,679), descending (n = 6,084), and ascending (n = 8,660) trends, which were reproduced with 99.8% accuracy using a random forest model. In the clinical relevance assessment, HbA1c levels demonstrated a J-shape association with the risk for outcomes. HbA1c level thresholds for minimizing outcomes' risk differed by cluster: 6.0-6.4% for the stable cluster, <8.0% for the descending cluster, and <9.0 for the ascending cluster.By applying unsupervised machine learning to longitudinal HbA1c trajectories, we have identified clusters of patients who have distinct risk for diabetes-related complications. These clusters can be the basis for developing individualized models to personalize glycemic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2901659139,"Blood lactate concentration rises exponentially during graded exercise when muscles produce more lactate than the body can remove, and the blood lactate-related thresholds are parameters based on this curve used to evaluate performance level and help athletes optimize training. Many different concepts of describing such a threshold have been published. This study aims to compare concepts for their repeatability and predictive properties of endurance performance.Forty-eight well-trained male cyclists aged 18-50 performed 5 maximal graded exercise tests each separated by two weeks. Blood lactate-related thresholds were calculated using eight different representative concepts. Repeatability of each concept was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and intra-subject CV and predictive value with 45 minute time trial tests and a road race to the top of Mont Ventoux was evaluated using Pearson correlations.Repeatability of all concepts was good to excellent (Cronbach's alpha of 0.89-0.96), intra-subject CVs were low with 3.4-8.1%. Predictive value for performance in the time trial tests and road race showed significant correlations ranging from 0.65-0.94 and 0.53-0.76, respectively.All evaluated concepts performed adequate, but there were differences between concepts. One concept had both the highest repeatability and the highest predictability of cycling performance, and is therefore recommended to be used: the Dmax modified method. As an easier to apply alternative, the lactate threshold with a fixed value of 4 mmol/L could be used as it performed almost as well.Dutch Trial Registry NTR5643."
https://openalex.org/W2901240129,"Background Motivation to participate in exercise among people with dementia has not been well studied. The symptoms of dementia, including apathy, may lead to low motivation to participate in exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate the motivation of older people with dementia to participate in a high-intensity exercise program compared with motivation of those participating in a social group activity. Methods The Umeå Dementia and Exercise Study (UMDEX) was a cluster-randomized controlled intervention trial including 186 people (mean age; 85, 75% female) with dementia in nursing homes. Participants were randomized to participate in the High-Intensity Functional Exercise (HIFE) Program (n = 93) or a seated social group activity (n = 93). The activities were conducted in groups of 3–8 participants for 45 minutes, five times per two-week period, for 4 months (40 sessions in total). Participants’ motivation to go to and during activity sessions were assessed by the activity leaders and nursing homes staff using a five-point Likert scale. Data were analyzed using cumulative link mixed models. Results Motivation was high or very high during 61.0% of attended sessions in the exercise group and 62.6% in the social activity group. No overall significant difference between groups was observed, but motivation increased over time in the exercise group and decreased in the social activity group (p < 0.05). Motivation during the sessions was significantly higher than motivation to go to the sessions, especially in the exercise group [OR 2.39 (95% CI 2.38–2.40) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.32–1.70), respectively]. Conclusions Among older people with dementia in nursing homes, motivation to participate in a high-intensity functional exercise program seems to be high, comparable to motivation to participate in a social activity, and increase over time. Since motivation during activity sessions was higher than motivation to go to sessions the promotion of strategies to encourage people with dementia to join exercise groups is of great importance."

https://openalex.org/W2901948074,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a type of conserved molecular chaperone. They exist extensively in plants and greatly contribute to their survival under heat stress. The transcriptional regulation factor heat shock factor (HSF) is thought to regulate the expression of Hsps. In this study, a novel gene designated BcHsfA1 was cloned and characterized from Brassica campestris. Bioinformatic analysis implied that BcHsfA1 belongs to the HsfA gene family and is most closely related to HsfA1 from other plants. Constitutive overexpression of BcHsfA1 significantly improved heat tolerance of tobacco seedlings by affecting physiological and biochemical processes. Moreover, the chlorophyll content of transgenic tobacco plants was significantly increased compared with wild type after heat stress, as were the activities of the important enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. BcHsfA1 overexpression also resulted in decreased malondialdehyde content and comparative electrical conductivity and increased soluble sugar content in transgenic tobacco plants than wild-type plants exposed to heat stress. Furthermore, we identified 11 candidate heat response genes that were significantly up-regulated in the transgenic lines exposed to heat stress. Together, these results suggested that BcHsfA1 is effective in improving heat tolerance of tobacco seedlings, which may be useful in the development of new heat-resisitant B. campestris strains by genetic engineering."

This study aims to evaluate the validity of the Arabic version of the DT in Saudi cancer patients, to define the optimal cutoff point of the Arabic DT for detecting clinically significant distress and to determine whether there is any correlation between clinically significant distress and other demographic and Problem List variables.The original form of the DT was translated to Arabic using a forward and backward translation method. Then, a group of 247 cancer patients who were followed up at the Outpatient Oncology Clinic at King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, completed a socio-demographic and clinical status questionnaire, the DT and the Problem List scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses picked out an area under the curve of 0.76 when compared with a HADS cutoff score of 15. The DT had the best sensitivity (0.70) and specificity (0.63) with cutoff score of 4. A DT score of 4 or more was found to have a statistically significant correlation with female gender, advanced cancer stages and most of the Problem List items, including child care, work or school, treatment decision, dealing with children and partners, depression, fears, nervousness, sadness, loss of interest in usual activity, religious concerns, appearance, bathing/dressing, breathing, diarrhea, fatigue, feeling swollen, fever, getting around, indigestion, memory and concentration, nausea, dry nose, pain, and sexual problems. In contrast, a multivariate regression analysis confirmed only advanced cancer stages, treatment decision, depression, fear, sadness, worry, breathing, feeling swollen, fever, indigestion, memory and concentration, dry nose and congestion, pain and sleep as independent factors associated with distress in cancer patients.We found the Arabic version of the DT to be a valid instrument for screening distress in Saudi patients with cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2900888449,"Autophagy has been identified as a catabolic mechanism in cells but its' role in cancer remains controversial. Autophagy has been characterized either as tumor suppressor or inducer mechanism in many tumor types. Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR (cetuximab and panitumumab) represent a major step in the treatment of mCRC. Several studies propose that cetuximab and panitumumab trigger autophagy which reveals a potential resistance mechanism to these agents. The last years immunotherapy appears to be a novel promising strategy for the treatment of patients with solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) antibodies have already been developed and applied in mCRC patients with MSI-H phenotype. The association between mtBRAF and autophagy or MSI status has already been characterized. In our study, we identify the autophagy initiation through anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal carcinoma cell lines according to microsatellite status. The combination of autophagy inhibition, anti-EGFR antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors as well as autophagy targeting, MEK inhibition and anti-EGFR antibodies or checkpoint inhibitors appears to be the best treatment approach for microsatellite instability high and stable colorectal cancer cell lines, respectively. Both combinatorial approaches reduce cell viability through the induction of apoptotic cell death.

The ruminal concentration of isobutyric acid increased in animals fed on diets supplemented with Yeast and MOS, whereas isovaleric acid increased with Yeast and decreased with MOS supplementation. Dietary supplementation with Yeast and MOS increased pH and decreased ammonia concentration in the rumen. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations in the rumen and duodenal fluid were not influenced by the additives. However, both Yeast and MOS decreased the plasma levels of LPS and serum amyloid A (SAA). In conclusion, when high-concentrate diets fed to beef cattle are supplemented with either Yeast or MOS, ruminal pH is increased, LPS translocation into the blood stream is decreased, and blood SAA concentration is decreased. These factors reduce the inflammation caused by consumption of grain-based diets, and either supplement could be used to improve the rumen environment in beef cattle susceptible to ruminal subacute acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2901809737,"Introduction Pharmacist provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) through collaborative practice agreements with physicians could expand access to people at risk for HIV. We characterized pharmacists’ familiarity with and willingness to provide PrEP services in Nebraska and Iowa. Methods An invitation to complete an 18-question survey was emailed to 1,140 pharmacists in Nebraska and Iowa in June and July of 2016. Descriptive analyses and Pearson chi-square tests were used to determine to what extent demographics, familiarity and experience were associated with respondent willingness to provide PrEP. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests compared ages and years of experience between groups of respondents. Results One hundred forty pharmacists (12.3%) responded. Less than half were familiar with the use of PrEP (42%) or the CDC guidelines for its use (25%). Respondents who were older (p = .015) and in practice longer (p = .005) were less likely to be familiar with PrEP. Overall, 54% indicated they were fairly or very likely to provide PrEP services as part of a collaborative practice agreement and after additional training. While familiarity with PrEP use or guidelines did not affect respondents’ willingness to provide PrEP, respondents were more likely to provide PrEP with prior experience counseling HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (OR 2.43; p = 0.023) or PrEP (OR 4.67; p = 0.013), and with prior HIV-related continuing education (OR 2.77; p = 0.032). Conclusions Pharmacist respondents in Nebraska and Iowa had limited familiarity and experience with PrEP, but most indicated willingness to provide PrEP through collaborative practice agreements after additional training. Provision of PrEP-focused continuing education may lead to increased willingness to participate in PrEP programs."
https://openalex.org/W2900550002,"Background End of life care (EOLC) for people with dementia can present a multitude of challenges and difficult decisions for practitioners. These challenges may include assessment and management of difficulties with eating and swallowing, responding to agitation, treating pain, and managing recurrent infections. Practitioners sometimes lack both confidence in making end of life decisions and guidance. This study developed an alternative to lengthy guidelines, in the form of heuristics which were tested in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to test the usability and acceptability of a set of heuristics which could be used by practitioners providing EOLC for people with dementia in a variety of clinical and care settings. Methods A three phase co-design process was adopted: 1) Synthesis of evidence and outputs from interviews and focus groups with family carers and practitioners, by a co-design group, to develop heuristics; 2) Testing of the heuristics in five clinical or care settings for six months; 3) Evaluation of the heuristics at three and six months using qualitative individual and group interviews. Results Four heuristics were developed covering: eating and swallowing difficulties, agitation and restlessness, reviewing treatment and interventions at the end of life, and providing routine care. The five sites reported that the heuristics were simple and easy to use, comprehensive, and made implicit, tacit knowledge explicit. Four themes emerged from the qualitative evaluation: authority and permission; synthesis of best practice; providing a structure and breaking down complexity; and reassurance and instilling confidence. Conclusion Use of heuristics is a novel approach to end of life decision making in dementia which can be useful to both experienced and junior members of staff making decisions. Heuristics are a practical tool which could overcome a lack of care pathways and direct guidance in end of life care for people with dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2810321196,"We introduce a new agent-based model of opinion dynamics in which binary opinions of each agent can be measured and described regarding both pre- and post-influence at both of two levels, public and private, vis-à-vis the influence source. The model combines ideas introduced within the q-voter model with noise, proposed by physicists, with the descriptive, four-dimensional model of social response, formulated by social psychologists. We investigate two versions of the same model that differ only by the updating order: an opinion on the public level is updated before an opinion on the private level or vice versa. We show how the results on the macroscopic scale depend on this order. The main finding of this paper is that both models produce the same outcome if one looks only at such a macroscopic variable as the total number of the individuals with positive opinions. However, if also the level of internal harmony (viz., dissonance) is measured, then significant, qualitative differences are seen between these two versions of the model. All results were obtained simultaneously within Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations. We discuss the importance of our studies and findings from three points of view: the theory of phase transitions, agent-based modeling of social systems, and social psychology."

So far, the prevalence of NAFLD in underweight individuals with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is insufficiently enlightened. In this cross-sectional age, gender and disease-matched case-control study, underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5 T/3 T with fat-saturated fast-spin-echo imaging from 10/2005-07/2018 were analysed (control-to-case-ratio 1:1, n = 130). All patients were additionally investigated for duration, history of surgery, medical treatment, laboratory values, liver and spleen diameters. On MRI, liver fat was quantified by two observers based on the relative signal loss on T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images with fat saturation compared to images without fat saturation. The prevalence of NAFLD/liver steatosis, defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, was significantly higher in underweight IBD patients than in normal weight patients (87.6% versus 21.5%, p<0.001). Compared to the cases, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced by -0.19 units on average (-19%; 95%Cl: -0.20; -0.14). Similar results were obtained for the subgroup of non-IBD individuals (n = 12; -0.25 units on average (-25%); 95%Cl: -0.35; -0.14). Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI <17.5 kg/m2) showed the highest liver fat content (+0.15 units on average (+15%) compared to underweight patients with a BMI of 17.5-18.5 kg/m2 (p<0.05)). Furthermore, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters. There were no indications of significant differences in disease duration, type of medications or surgery between cases and controls and also, there were no significant differences between observers or field strengths (p>0.05). The prevalence of liver steatosis was higher among underweight IBD and non-IBD patients compared to normal weight controls. Also, underweight patients showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters, hinting at initial metabolic disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2901802817,"Two chemotypes were examined in vitro with CYPs 3A4 and 2C19 by molecular docking, metabolic profiles, and intrinsic clearance deuterium isotope effects with specifically deuterated form to assess the potential for enhancement of pharmacokinetic parameters. The results show the complexity of deuteration as an approach for pharmacokinetic enhancement when CYP enzymes are involved in metabolic clearance. With CYP3A4 the rate limiting step was chemotype-dependent. With one chemotype no intrinsic clearance deuterium isotope effect was observed with any deuterated form, whereas with the other chemotype the rate limiting step was isotopically sensitive, and the magnitude of the intrinsic clearance isotope effect was dependent on the position(s) and extent of deuteration. Molecular docking and metabolic profiles aided in identifying sites for deuteration and predicted the possibility for metabolic switching. However, the potential for an isotope effect on the intrinsic clearance cannot be predicted and must be established by examining select deuterated versions of the chemotypes. The results show how in a deuteration strategy molecular docking, in-vitro metabolic profiles, and intrinsic clearance assessments with select deuterated versions of new chemical entities can be applied to determine the potential for pharmacokinetic enhancement in a discovery setting. They also help explain the substantial failures reported in the literature of deuterated versions of drugs to elicit a systemic enhancement on pharmacokinetic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2900695204,"Background Pain is a universal issue and is of particular concern in mechanically ventilated patients, as they require intensive nursing care and multiple invasive procedures, while being unable to communicate verbally. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of music on pain experienced by mechanically ventilated patients during morning bed bathing. Methods Of the 60 mechanically ventilated patients enrolled in this single-center pilot study between March 2013 and October 2015, the first 30 received no music and the next 30 the music intervention, during the morning bed bath. The Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) score was determined during and at the end of the bath then 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the bath. BPS score changes over time were assessed and the proportions of bath times spent with a BPS score ≥5 and with the maximal BPS score were determined. Results At baseline, no patient had pain (defined as a BPS score <5) and the median BPS score was 3 [IQR, 3;3] in both groups (P = 0.43). After bed bath initiation, 88% of patients experienced pain. The maximum BPS value during the bath was lower in the music group (5 [5;6.7] vs. 7 [5;7]). Proportions of total bath time spent with BPS≥5 and with the maximum BPS were significantly lower in the music group than in the control group (2.0 [0.3;4.0] vs. 10 [4.3;18.0]; P < .0001 and 1.5 [0;3.0] vs. 3.5 [2.0;6.0]; P = .005; respectively). Two hours after the end of the bath, the BPS values had returned to baseline in both groups. Conclusion In our population, music significantly decreased pain intensity and duration during the morning bed bath in mechanically ventilated patients. These results warrant further assessment in a large multicenter randomized controlled trial. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02883959"
https://openalex.org/W2901058826,"Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of a wide range of cardiovascular diseases and is often linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. Our earlier study reported the formation of a functional heterodimer between bradykinin receptor 2 (B2R) and dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) that may modulate cell responses, dependent on intracellular signaling. Here, for the first time, we showed a cooperative effect of these receptors on the modulation of processes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in endothelial cells. Sumanirole, a specific D2R agonist, was shown to diminish the excessive production of reactive oxygen species induced by bradykinin, a proinflammatory B2R-activating peptide. This effect was accompanied by modified activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leading to enhance NO production. In turn, endothelial cell co-stimulation with B2R and D2R agonists inhibited the release of interleukin-6 and endothelin-1 and modulated the expression of apoptosis markers, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and caspase 3/7 activity. All these observations argue that the D2R agonist counteracts the pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic effects induced through B2R, finally markedly improving endothelial functions."
https://openalex.org/W2901361928,"Species with large geographic distributions present a challenge for phylogeographic studies due to the logistic difficulties of obtaining adequate samples. Daphnia O.F. Müller (Anomopoda: Daphniidae) is a model genus for evolutionary biology and ecology, but many regions such as the remote areas of Siberia, remain poorly studied. Here we examined genetic polymorphism in the ribosomal 12S and the protein-coding ND2 mitochondrial genes of three closely related taxa of the Daphnia (Daphnia) longispina complex, namely D. galeata Sars, D. longispina O.F. Müller and D. dentifera Forbes. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships among these taxa based on a concatenated alignment of these two genes. Using sequences from the present study and those available in GenBank, we investigated the geographic distributions of the mitochondrial haplotypes of these species and proposed an evolutionary scenario for each taxon. Network structures, haplotype distribution patterns, and FST values indicated significant differences in the evolutionary history of the examined species. Our analysis of D. galeata populations confirmed its recent and fast expansion, without a previous phase of a strong population disconnection. In contrast, the high haplotype diversity in D. dentifera and D. longispina could be explained by the survival of different phylogroups in several glacial refugia located in different geographic regions. For all studied species, maximum haplotype diversity was recorded in the remote regions of Siberia-lakes of the Yenisei River and Transbaikalia. Our study is an important step in our understanding of the evolutionary history of the Daphnia longispina group and provides further evidence of the biogeographic significance of Siberia for freshwater taxa."

Methods We analysed data from a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents aged 12–18 years (n = 65,528). We investigated the risks of depressive symptoms, suicide ideation, plan and attempt in adolescent non-daily smokers using multiple logistic regression analyses after adjusting for confounding factors. Taking into account the trajectory of smoking patterns in adolescents, we assessed all analyses with stratification by early (aged 12–15) and late (aged 16–18) adolescents. Results Among early adolescents, non-daily smokers were more likely to have depressive symptoms, suicide ideation and plan compared with never smokers and even more likely to have depressive symptoms compared with daily smokers. Among late adolescents, non-daily smokers had higher risks of depressive symptoms, suicide ideation, plan and attempt than never smokers, whereas the risk for suicide attempts was lower than daily smokers. Conclusions Our findings suggest that non-daily smoking in adolescents was associated with risks for depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviours, and the association was more prominent in early adolescents. Careful attention on the mental health of adolescent non-daily smokers is needed because this is an increasing and easily overlooked group."
https://openalex.org/W2901089351,"In spite of its importance for education, the relationship between learning behaviors (LB), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms (ADHD) and executive functioning (EF) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has hardly been explored. The first objective of the present study was to compare children with ASD without intellectual disability and children with typical development (TD) on ADHD symptoms and learning behaviors: Motivation/competence, attitude toward learning, persistence on the task, and strategy/flexibility. The second objective was to analyze the mediator role of behavioral regulation and metacognition components of EF between ADHD symptoms and learning behaviors in children with ASD. Participants were 89 children between 7 and 11 years old, 52 with ASD and 37 with TD, matched on age and intelligence. Their teachers filled out questionnaires assessing executive functioning as well as learning behaviors. Parents and teachers reported on inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity behaviors. Compared to children with TD, children with ASD presented significantly more ADHD symptoms and poorer learning behaviors. In addition, there were significant mediation effects of the behavioral regulation index (BRI) and metacognition index (MI) of EF, indicating that both are part of the route through which ADHD symptoms impact to learning behaviors of children with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2901921108,"Telomeres protect against chromosomal damage. Accelerated telomere loss has been associated with premature aging syndromes such as Werner’s syndrome and Dyskeratosis Congenita, while, progressive telomere loss activates a DNA damage response leading to chromosomal instability, typically observed in cancer cells and senescent cells. Therefore, identifying mechanisms of telomere length maintenance is critical for understanding human pathologies. In this paper we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causal role in telomere shortening. Furthermore, hnRNPA2, a mitochondrial stress responsive lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) acetylates telomere histone H4at lysine 8 of (H4K8) and this acetylation is associated with telomere attrition. Cells containing dysfunctional mitochondria have higher telomere H4K8 acetylation and shorter telomeres independent of cell proliferation rates. Ectopic expression of KAT mutant hnRNPA2 rescued telomere length possibly due to impaired H4K8 acetylation coupled with inability to activate telomerase expression. The phenotypic outcome of telomere shortening in immortalized cells included chromosomal instability (end-fusions) and telomerase activation, typical of an oncogenic transformation; while in non-telomerase expressing fibroblasts, mitochondrial dysfunction induced-telomere attrition resulted in senescence. Our findings provide a mechanistic association between dysfunctional mitochondria and telomere loss and therefore describe a novel epigenetic signal for telomere length maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2883126209,"Moral psychology has relied nearly exclusively on text stimuli in the development and testing of theories. However, text stimuli lack the rich variety of morally-relevant social and contextual cues available in everyday interactions. A consequence of this pervasive ecological invalidity may be that moral psychological theories are mischaracterized by an overreliance on cue-impoverished moral stimuli. We address this limitation by developing a cue-rich Moral and Affective Film Set (MAAFS). We crowd-sourced videos of moral behaviours, using previously validated text stimuli and definitions of moral foundations as a guide for content. Crowd-sourced clips were rated by 322 American and 253 Australian participants on a range of moral and affective dimensions, including wrongness, moral foundation relevance, punishment, arousal, discrete emotion-relevance, clarity, previous exposure, and how weird/uncommon the moral acts were. The final stimulus set contained sixty nine moral videos. Ratings confirmed that the videos are reliably rated as morally wrong and feature a variety of moral concerns. The validation process revealed features that make the MAAFS useful for future research: (1) the MAAFS includes a range of videos that depict everyday transgressions, (2) certain videos evoke negative emotions at an intensity comparable to mood induction films, (3) the videos are largely novel: participants had never seen more than 90% of the videos. We anticipate the MAAFS will be a particularly valuable tool for researchers in moral psychology who seek to study morality in scenarios that approximate real-life. However, the MAAFS may be valuable for other fields of psychology, for example, affective scientists may use these videos as a mood induction procedure.

https://openalex.org/W2900991328,"The presence of mainstream medicine in local medical systems inserts a set of external treatments and concepts that generate adjustments in the local conceptions of health and disease. What points in the system are most receptive to change? Who are the residents most likely to adopt these external treatments to deal with diseases? To answer these questions, this work used a study model consisting of the simultaneous use of medicinal plants and modern medicine, testing whether diseases that require greater treatment efforts are the main targets of adherence to modern medicine and if socioeconomic characteristics of residents can cause intracultural variation in relation to simultaneous use. To obtain socioeconomic data on the knowledge of medicinal plants and simultaneous use of these resources with modern medicine, semistructured interviews were conducted in a rural community that has easy access to modern medicine. Participatory workshops were held to access the local perceptions about the frequency of occurrence and severity of illnesses. A multilevel logistic regression model was applied for data analysis. We found that chronic, severe and frequently occurring diseases in the community tended to show greater simultaneous use locally. Among the socioeconomic factors, we determined that high educational levels positively influenced the combined use of plants and modern medicine. The need to ensure the cure of frequent, severe and chronic diseases is a factor that leads residents to seek a greater number of possible treatments, stimulating the combined use of plants and modern medicine. Residents with higher educational levels were more likely to use a combination of treatments than those with lower educational levels, demonstrating that more participation in formal education may facilitate the combined use of medicinal plants and modern medicine."

In the current study, the data of rice yield from a total of 76 experiments were collected in 2008 and 2009 in Chongqing, southwest China. For each location, two treatments with fertilizer and without fertilizer were carried out, each treatment was performed with three replications, and yield gap was calculated using fertilized yield minus unfertilized yield. Seventeen influencing-factors including variety, fertilization, climate, terrain, and soil properties were obtained at each location. Regression tree (RT) model were employed to investigate relative important of influencing-factors to rice yield gap variability. The result of Pearson correlation analysis suggested yield gap of rice was positively correlated with sunshine hours, phosphorous and potassium fertilizers, while negatively correlated with soil available nitrogen content. The results of RT showed that the selected influencing-factors explained about 74.1% of rice yield gap variation. Meanwhile, the result also indicated variety followed by others had more influence on rice yield gap variation. Our findings analyzed by regression model at a regional scale suggested that more precise fertilization recommendation should be formulated based on comprehensive factors (e.g., soil, climate, terrain, variety), which reasonably guided farmer and government for rice production."
https://openalex.org/W2900454269,"Increased re-hospitalization due to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a modern issue in cardiology. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for re-hospitalization due to worsening heart failure, and the effect of tolvaptan (TLV) on decreasing the number of re-hospitalizations. This was a multicenter, retrospective study. The re-hospitalization factors for 1191 patients with ADHF were investigated; patients receiving continuous administration of TLV when they were discharged from the hospital (n = 194) were analyzed separately. Patients were classified into 5 risk groups based on their calculated Preventing Re-hospitalization with TOLvaptan (Pretol) score. The total number of patients re-hospitalized due to worsening heart failure up to one year after discharge from the hospital was 285 (23.9%). Age ≥80 years, duration since discharge from the hospital after previous heart failure <6 months, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin <10 g/dl, uric acid >7.2 mg/dl, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, left atrial volume index (LAVI) >44.7 ml/m2, loop diuretic dose ≥20 mg/day, hematocrit <31.6%, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <50 ml/min/1.73m2 were independent risk factors for re-hospitalization for worsening heart failure. There was a significant reduction in the re-hospitalization rate among TLV treated patients in the Risk 3 group and above. In conclusions, age, duration since previous heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin, uric acid, LVEF, LAVI, loop diuretic dose, hematocrit, and eGFR were all independent risk factors for re-hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Long-term administration of TLV significantly decreases the rate of re-hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with a Pretol score of 7."

Nevertheless, due to their inherent erratic nature, NHC data are plagued by several biases. Understanding these biases is a major issue, particularly because ecological niche models (ENMs) are based on the assumption that data are not biased. Based on it, a recent body of research have focused on searching adequate methods for dealing with biased data and proposed the use of filters in geographical and environmental space. Although the strength of filtering in environmental space has been shown with virtual species, nothing has yet been tested with a real dataset including field validation. In order to contribute to this task, we explore this issue by comparing a dataset from NHC to a recent targeted sampling of the cockroach genus Monastria Saussure, 1864 in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We showed that, despite strong similarities, the area modeled with NHC data was much smaller. These differences were due to strong climate biases, which increased model’s specificity and reduced sensitivity. By applying two forms of rarefaction in the environmental space, we showed that deleting points at random in the most biased climate class is a powerful way for increasing model’s sensitivity, so making predictions more suitable to the reality."
https://openalex.org/W2900857647,"Gravitational stress occurs during space flights or certain physical activities including extreme sports, where the change in experienced gravitational acceleration can reach large magnitudes. These changes include reduction and increase in the physical forces experienced by the body and may potentially induce pathogenic alterations of physiological processes. The immune system is known to regulate most functions in the human organism and previous studies suggest an impairment of the immune function under gravitational stress. However, systematic studies aiming to investigate the effect of gravitational stress on cellular immune response in humans are lacking. Since parabolic flights are considered as feasible model to investigate a short-term impact of gravitational changes, we evaluated the influence of gravitational stress on the immune system by analyzing leukocyte numbers before and after parabolic flight maneuvers in human blood. To correct for circadian effects, samples were taken at the corresponding time points on ground the day before the flight. The parabolic flight maneuvers led to changes in numbers of different leukocyte subsets. Naïve and memory T and B cell subsets decreased under gravitational stress and lower numbers of basophils and eosinophils were observed. Only circulating neutrophils increased during the parabolic flight. The observed changes could not be attributed to stress-induced cortisol effects, since cortisol levels were not affected. Our data demonstrate that the gravitational stress by parabolic flights can affect all parts of the human immune system. Consequently, it is possible that gravitational stress can have clinically relevant impacts on the control of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2901654647,"Mannitol, one of the sugar alcohols, is often used as a low-calorific carbohydrate by animals. In some insects, mannitol acts as a cryoprotectant to endure coldness, but also become a poisonous agent. Adults of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum were shown to recognize mannitol as a factor stimulating their feeding behavior, but it remains unclear whether T. castaneum can utilize mannitol as a source of nutrition, because the enzymes needed to metabolize mannitol are unknown in this species. This study shows that T. castaneum utilizes mannitol as a nutrient in a dietary assay based on a sole carbon source added to artificial gypsum diet. The amount of mannitol excreted was less than that ingested, suggesting that it is absorbed in the insect body. The hemolymph of T. castaneum contained no mannitol but contained trehalose, a known blood sugar in insects, even after being fed mannitol. This study also revealed that dietary mannitol was metabolized to triglyceride, the main component of the fat body, forming lipid droplets. It was found that metabolites of a mannitol-supplemented diet extend the lifespan of T. castaneum, compared with those obtained by metabolizing a mannitol-free diet. Given that the insects presented transcriptional changes upon being fed carbohydrates, it might be possible to identify specific genes related to mannitol-specific metabolism by their upregulation upon mannitol intake in T. castaneum. The present study investigated mannitol-responsive gene expression using RNA-Seq. Twenty-eight genes, including those encoding trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and fatty acid synthase, were differentially expressed between beetles that were fed or not fed mannitol. The identification of upregulated genes provides us with important insights into the molecular events following mannitol intake."
https://openalex.org/W2900863076,"A tuberculosis (TB) model that accounts for heterogeneity in host susceptibility to tuberculosis is proposed, with the aim of investigating the implications this may have for the effectiveness of public health interventions. The model examines the possibility that recovered individuals treated from active TB and individuals treated with preventive therapy acquire different levels of immunity. This contrasts with recent studies that assume the two cohorts acquire the same level of immunity, and therefore both groups are reinfected at the same rate. The analysis presented here examines the impact of this assumption when designing intervention strategies. Comparison of reinfection rates between cohorts treated with preventive therapy and recovered individuals who were previously treated for active TB provides important epidemiological insights. It is found that the reinfection rate of the cohort treated with preventive therapy is the one that plays the key role in qualitative changes in TB dynamics. By contrast, the reinfection rate of recovered individuals (previously treated from active TB) plays a minor role. Moreover, the study shows that preventive treatment of individuals during early latency is always beneficial regardless of the level of susceptibility to reinfection. Further, if patients have greater immunity following treatment for late latent infection, then treatment is again beneficial. However, if susceptibility increases following treatment for late latent infection, the effect of treatment depends on the epidemiological setting. That is: (i) in (very) low burden settings, the effect on reactivation predominates and the burden declines with treatment; (ii) in moderate to high burden settings the effect of reinfection predominates and burden increases with treatment. The effect is most dominant between the two reinfection thresholds, RT2 and RT1, respectively associated with individuals being treated with preventive therapy and individuals with untreated late latent TB infection."

The system is well suited for measuring oxygen partial pressures in the 0–100 μbar range, with the maximum potentially usable upper range limit at around 10 mbar, depending on experimental conditions. The sensor has a limited drift and its detectability limit for oxygen is at 0.02 μbar for short timescale measurements. Each sensor can connect to a Wi-Fi network and send the logged data either over the Internet or to a local server, enabling a large number of parallel unattended experiments. Designs are also provided for attaching the sensor to various commercially available containers used in laboratories. The design files are released under an open source license, which enables other laboratories to build, customize, and use these sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2901685077,"The mechanisms of host shift in phytophagous insects are poorly understood. Among the many proposed processes involved, sexual selection via semiochemicals has recently been suggested. This hypothesizes that sexual communication using pheromones is modified as a result of development on a new host, and such plant-induced phenotypic divergence in mate recognition cues can lead to reproductive isolation between host lines. We tested this hypothesis on Acanthoscelides obtectus, an oligophagous bruchid of Phaseolus vulgaris beans worldwide, which also develops in acceptable non-hosts, such as chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Male sex pheromone blends of the bean, chickpea and chickpea/bean host lines during artificially induced host shifts showed different composition. Bean-reared females did not distinguish between blends, whereas chickpea and chickpea/bean females preferred the chickpea male pheromone. However, electrophysiological (EAG) responses to male odour of antennae of the three female host lines were similar, all preferring bean-reared males. Egg-laying choice tests revealed a uniform preference for bean seeds across female host lines, even after multiple generations, whereas larvae did not distinguish between bean and chickpea seeds. We conclude that the development of divergent chemical signalling systems during host shifts does not facilitate the evolution of host races in A. obtectus, because oviposition preferences remain unaffected."

However, it is more reasonable to invest differently according to individual investment preference. In this paper, an extended public goods game, in which cooperators contribute to the groups according to the investment preference, is developed. The investment preference of a cooperator is characterized by the fraction of the cooperator from his/her own memory about a group and the intensity of investment preference is represented by a tunable parameter α. The well-mixed population and the structured population are analyzed under this mechanism. It is shown that the investment preference can give rise to coordination. Moreover, the extensive numerical simulation results show that with the increasing of investment preference density or memory length, the proportion of cooperation can increase monotonously. This is because the investment preference could help cooperators resist the invasion from defectors. Compared with the basic version, the new mechanism is able to promote cooperation effectively. Our research may provide a valuable insight for further exploring the nature of cooperation in the real world."
https://openalex.org/W2900525493,"Barley malting quality depends on seed characteristics achieved during grain development and germination. One important parameter is protein accumulation in the mature seed, which may vary between cultivars. Here we conducted a protein pattern analysis in the range of pI 4–7 of mature grains from five Mexican barley cultivars, commonly used for malt and beer production. Reproducibly distinct protein spots, separated by 2D SDS PAGE, were identified by mass spectrometry and considered as potential markers for cultivars with distinct seed protein accumulation. The expression patterns of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI1-1) were followed at transcript level during grain development for three independent growth cycles to establish whether differences between cultivars were reproducible. Quantitative determination of PDI1-1 protein levels by ELISA confirmed a reproducibly, distinctive accumulation and post-translational modifications between cultivars, which were independent of plant growth regimes. According to its impact on differential storage protein accumulation, we propose the PDI1-1 protein as potential biomarker for Mexican malting barley cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2900537636,"Alien chromosome introgression is used for the transfer of beneficial traits in plant breeding. For temperate forage grasses, much of the work in this context has focused on species within the ryegrasses (Lolium spp.) and the closely related fescues (Festuca spp.) particularly with a view to combining high forage quality with reliability and enhanced environmental services. We have analysed a L. perenne (perennial ryegrass) population containing the majority of a F. pratensis (meadow fescue) genome as introgressed chromosome segments to identify a) marker-trait associations for nutrient use and abiotic stress response across the family, and b) to assess the effects of introgression of F. pratensis genomic regions on phenotype. Using container-based assays and a system of flowing solution culture, we looked at phenotype responses, including root growth, to nitrogen and phosphorus status in the growing medium and abiotic stresses within this festulolium family. A number of significant marker/trait associations were identified across the family for root biomass on chromosomes 2, 3 and 5 and for heading date on chromosome 2. Of particular interest was a region on chromosome 2 associated with increased root biomass in phosphorus-limited conditions derived from one of the L. perenne parents. A genotype containing F. pratensis chromosome 4 as a monosomic introgression showed increased tiller number, shoot and root growth and genotypes with F. pratensis chromosome segment introgressions at different ends of chromosome 4 exhibited differential phenotypes across a variety of test conditions. There was also a general negative correlation between the extent of the F. pratensis genome that had been introgressed and root-related trait performances. We conclude that 1) the identification of alleles affecting root growth has potential application in forage grass breeding and, 2) F. pratensis introgressions can enhance quantitative traits, however, introgression can also have more general negative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2901552171,"Cells are under the influence of multiple forms of mechanical stimulation in vivo. For example, a cell is subjected to mechanical forces from tissue stiffness, shear and tensile stress and transient applied strain. Significant progress has been made in understanding the cellular mechanotransduction mechanisms in response to a single mechanical parameter. However, our knowledge of how a cell responds to multiple mechanical inputs is currently limited. In this study, we have tested the cellular response to the simultaneous application of two mechanical inputs: substrate compliance and transient tugging. Our results suggest that cells within a multicellular spheroid will restrict their response to a single mechanical input at a time and when provided with two mechanical inputs simultaneously, one will dominate. In normal and non-metastatic mammary epithelial cells, we found that they respond to applied stimulation and will override substrate compliance cues in favor of the applied mechanical stimulus. Surprisingly, however, metastatic mammary epithelial cells remain non-responsive to both mechanical cues. Our results suggest that, within our assay system, metastatic progression may involve the down-regulation of multiple mechanotransduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2950183962,"The development and application of concepts is a critical component of cognition. Although concepts can be formed on the basis of simple perceptual or semantic features, conceptual representations can also capitalize on similarities across feature relationships. By representing these types of higher-order relationships, concepts can simplify the learning problem and facilitate decisions. Despite this, little is known about the neural mechanisms that support the construction and deployment of these kinds of higher-order concepts during learning. To address this question, we combined a carefully designed associative learning task with computational model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were scanned as they learned and made decisions about sixteen pairs of cues and associated outcomes. Associations were structured such that individual cues shared feature relationships, operationalized as shared patterns of cue pair-outcome associations. In order to capture the large number of possible conceptual representational structures that participants might employ and to evaluate how conceptual representations are used during learning, we leveraged a well-specified Bayesian computational model of category learning [1]. Behavioral and model-based results revealed that participants who displayed a tendency to link experiences in memory benefitted from faster learning rates, suggesting that the use of the conceptual structure in the task facilitated decisions about cue pair-outcome associations. Model-based fMRI analyses revealed that trial-by-trial integration of cue information into higher-order conceptual representations was supported by an anterior temporal (AT) network of regions previously implicated in representing complex conjunctions of features and meaning-based information."
https://openalex.org/W2900926641,"Cestodes of the order Trypanorhyncha can frequently be found infecting the muscles of several marine fish species, and lead to a repugnant aspect of the fish and rejection by consumers. The Brazilian sardinella, Sardinella brasiliensis, occurs from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to northern Uruguay. In southeastern Brazil, fishing for the species is very intensive since it generates significant revenue as one of the most commonly consumed fish and an important element of the canned fish industry. The aims of the present study were to identify and report the occurrence of tiny cestodes (3 mm-6.6 mm) in the musculature of Brazilian sardinella that were purchased in the São Pedro fish market in the municipality of Niterói, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From October 2013 to November 2016, 75 specimens of S. brasiliensis were investigated. The trypanorhynch cestodes encountered were identified as plerocerci of Callitetrarhynchus gracilis using morphological, morphometric and molecular data. Parasitic indices were calculated, and the cestodes infection of the musculature of Brazilian sardinella had the following values: prevalence, 40%; mean intensity, 3.47; mean abundance, 1.39; and range of infection, 1-18, specimens. The presence of this trypanorhynch cestode in the musculature of Brazilian sardinella is an important indicator of fish hygiene."
https://openalex.org/W2901844376,"The use of corifollitropin alfa (CA) in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles is dependent on the antral follicle count and body weight of patients. The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of using 100μg of CA in predicted excessive responders based on serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level. The results of 381 ART cycles stimulated by CA versus daily recombinant follicle-stimulation hormone (rFSH) in patients with low (<1.0 ng/mL; n = 38 vs. n = 90), moderate (1.0-3.36 ng/mL; n = 38 vs. n = 95), and high (> 3.36 ng/mL; n = 48 vs. n = 72) serum AMH levels, were analyzed. Pregnancy and live birth rates did not significantly differ between CA and daily rFSH groups. In the patients with high AMH levels, serum progesterone (P4) levels on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection were significantly lower in the CA group than in the rFSH group (0.93 ± 0.55 vs. 1.16 ± 0.64 ng/mL). Furthermore, serum P4 levels on the day of hCG injection were negatively correlated with baseline AMH levels in the CA group, but not in the rFSH group, in the patients with high AMH levels. In conclusion, the use of 100 μg of CA in patients with high AMH levels is safe and effective and is associated with a lower P4 level on the day of hCG injection compared with the use of daily rFSH."
https://openalex.org/W2901233434,"This study presents first test results of a new performance-based, psychomotor method to measure anger expression and control, based on voice expression and physical force production in directional movement of arms and legs, called the Method of Stamp Strike Shout (MSSS). Recorded are the standardized impact of stamping on a force plate, hitting a punching bag, and the amplitude of shouting in a microphone at various force levels. The premise is, that these body behaviours stand for the ‘urge to act or shout’ that belongs to anger-related emotions. The MSSS is meant to be applied in addition to potentially biased self-report questionnaires and has been designed for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes in clinical practice. First, this paper focusses on the instrumentation, internal structure and reliability of the MSSS. An explorative study in a student sample (n = 104) shows correlation patterns between increasing and decreasing levels of force production within each subtest (Stamp, Strike and Shout) and between the three subtests. We found excellent internal consistency of the three subtests and high test-retest reliability. The parameters of increasing and decreasing force levels form the slopes of what we call a force pyramid. To adjust for the clustering within persons, aggregated outcomes were calculated: sum scores per subtest as an indication of total force produced, two linear contrast scores to indicate the rate of increase / decrease, and two quadratic contrast scores as measures of the curvature of the slopes. On all subtests, all aggregated scores showed differences between men and women, also when controlled for weight. To test the validity of the MSSS, the second part of the paper examines the relationship between force parameters and anger coping style, measured by the Self-Expression and Control Scale (SECS). The results suggest that the Shout subtest was the most sensitive indicator for anger coping style, showing negative correlations with Anger In, for women as well as men. For women, higher amplitude was also associated with higher Anger Out and lower amplitude with higher Anger Control. The Stamp subtest showed weak positive correlations with the Anger In subscales, whereas no correlations were found on the Strike subtest. Further, a more robust comparison was made between two groups of participants who reported to have an internalizing versus an externalizing anger coping style. Results indicated that internalizing women as well as men used less force than externalizing participants on all three subtests, especially on the Shout subtest. This was confirmed by lower mean sum scores on the Shout subtest for internalizing women compared with externalizing women. No differences in linear contrast scores were shown between internalizing and externalizing participants. The quadratic contrast scores suggested differences of the curvation of the slopes between women with more or less anger control when stamping, and men with more or less anger control when striking. As this is an explorative study, findings should be interpreted with caution."
