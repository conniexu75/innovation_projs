https://openalex.org/W1533793715,"Abstract The heterogeneous catalysis of pancreatic phospholipase A (EC 3.1.1.4) is studied by kinetics on monomolecular layers of short chain phospholipids. Under certain conditions long induction times are observed experimentally which can be related with a slow reversible penetration of the enzyme into the monolayer. The influence of surface pressure, pH, sodium chloride, and Ca2+ ions on this penetration step is reported. Based on a proposed two-dimensional Michaelis model, steady state and presteady state equations are derived and together with computer analysis show a good fit with the experimental results. A quantitative comparison between enzyme kinetics obtained by monolayer and bulk techniques is attempted using a common definition of the quality of the lipid-water interface. Possible implications of the concept of a penetration site on the enzyme are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1527704924,"The use of Fe3+ salts to saturate apotransferrin in buffer solutions and serum is often found in basic research and clinical procedures, despite a lack of adequate documentation. We have investigated the reaction of Fe3+ salts with apotransferrin using the absorption peak of Fe3+-transferrin at 470 nm to monitor the reaction. While titration of apo-transferrin with Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid gives a linear function and clear end point, titration with FeCl3 results in a sigmoidal-shaped curve and no clear end point is reached. The spectral data indicate that only 5 to 25% of the iron becomes bound when 1 eq of FeCl3 is added to apotransferrin at neutral pH. The remaining sites of the protein are vacant and available for reaction with Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid. Several methods for separating unbound FeCl3 from transferrin were attempted. They were, however, all unsuccessful and often gave misleading results. A stoichiometric reaction of Fe3+ salts with apotransferrin is only obtained when the reactants are initially mixed at a low pH and then carefully adjusted to neutrality. A method is also described for obtaining fully saturated, chelate-free Fe3+-transferrin, using Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid as the iron reagent. In view of the poor reactivity of Fe3+ salts with apotransferrin at neutral pH, proton release studies have been re-examined with Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid. A value close to 2.6 H+ released per Fe3+ bound was obtained by two methods."
https://openalex.org/W1579619707,"Abstract Cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells were synchronized by isoleucine starvation. Thymidine was added either during G1 or during S-phase and deoxyribonucleotide pools and the rate of DNA synthesis were measured. Addition of 1 mm thymidine to G1 cells did not appreciably influence the entry of the cells into S-phase but inhibited the rate of DNA synthesis up to 90%. The pools of dTTP, dGTP, and dATP increased about 25-, 10-, and 2-fold, respectively, while the dCTP pool decreased to about 10% of the controls. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was completely prevented when 5 µm deoxycytidine was added together with thymidine. The dCTP pool was then almost of normal size while the other three pools were expanded. Addition of 1 mm thymidine to cells in S-phase gave similar changes in pool sizes and also inhibited DNA synthesis. The decline in the rate of DNA synthesis was correlated in time with the decrease of the dCTP pool. Addition of 5 µm deoxycytidine to thymidine-inhibited cells normalized both DNA synthesis and the dCTP pool without affecting the other three pools. These results, as well as earlier data concerning pool sizes of deoxynucleoside triphosphates in synchronized cell populations, suggest the possibility that the size of the dCTP pool may have a regulatory function for the rate of DNA synthesis. Moreover, our present results show that allosteric mechanisms shown with a purified enzyme (ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase) operate in intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1582330931,"Treatment of calf thymus DNA with sodium bisulfite gave no deamination of cytosine to uracil, under conditions where 68% of the cytosines of heat-denatured DNA were converted to uracil. This implies that the mutagenic properties of bisulfite are due to reaction with single-stranded DNA. Similarly, poly(I)·poly(C) was unreactive to bisulfite under conditions where poly(C) reacted readily. It was established by ultraviolet and circular dichroism studies that the initial step of the deamination sequence, the addition of bisulfite to the 5-6 double bond of cytosine, was inhibited in double-helical polynucleotides. In accord with this, it was found that, at 25°, bisulfite did not react with the uracils of poly(A)·poly(U) and poly(A)·2 poly(U), under conditions where it added to the 5-6 double bond of the uracils of free poly(U). At higher temperatures below the melting temperature, a slow reaction of poly(A)·2 poly(U) was observed. A number of factors may contribute to the resistance of multiple-helical polynucleotides to reaction with bisulfite. These include the inability of the modified base to take part in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to the approach of the reagent in a multiple helix."

https://openalex.org/W1539213659,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of calf thymus histone III has been established by studies on the tryptic peptides from the maleylated protein and on chymotryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides from the S-carboxymethylated protein. Calf thymus histone III has 135 residues in a single polypeptide chain with NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal alanine and a molecular weight of 15,324. The NH2-terminal region (residues 1 to 53) of the protein is strongly basic, having a net positive charge of +18 and containing lysine residues 14 and 23 which are e-N-acetylated in a fraction of the molecules, as well as lysine residues 9 and 27 which are partially e-N-methylated. All three e-N-methyl derivatives, e-N-monomethyllysine, e-N-dimethyllysine, and e-N-trimethyllysine, are present at each site. This is the first time that the trimethyl derivative has been identified at specific sites in histones. The COOH-terminal region (residues 54–135) is only slightly basic (net charge of +4), has a 29-residue acidic sequence that lacks a basic residue and contains most of the hydrophobic residues of the protein. Histone III is the only histone in calf thymus which contains cysteine, both residues of which are in the nonbasic region at positions 96 and 110. There are some indications of sequence similarities between histones III and IV."

https://openalex.org/W1548495896,"Abstract Glucose oxidation of isolated white fat cells in the presence or absence of insulin was abolished by as little as 3 µm cytochalasin B in medium containing 0.2 mm glucose. This agent inhibited fat cell d-[1-14C]glucose conversion to CO2 half-maximally at 0.2 µm, which was about 700 and 30 times as effective as phlorizin and phloretin, respectively. Inhibitory effects of 3 µm cytochalasin B and 1 mm phlorizin were not observed when fat cells were incubated with 20 or 80 mm glucose, indicating that intracellular enzymes were unaffected. Fat cells which were incubated with 3 µm cytochalasin B or 1 mm phlorizin for 15 min, then washed and reincubated in the absence of inhibitors, oxidized glucose to to the same extent as controls. 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]glucose uptake in fat cell ghosts was studied in an attempt to determine definitively a locus of the cytochalasin B effect. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose uptake in fat cell ghosts was linear for 1 to 2 min, temperature-dependent, and markedly inhibited in the presence of unlabeled glucose. Analysis of the label accumulated by the ghosts by chromatography on Dowex 1 anion exchange columns indicated that all the label accumulated during the 1st min of incubation was recovered as free sugar. A significant amount of labeled anionic material which was retained by Dowex was accumulated by ghosts incubated for 5 or 15 min. Cytochalasin B at 0.3 and 3 µm markedly inhibited the net uptake of 2-deoxy[3H]glucose at 1, 2, 5, and 15 min. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the net accumulation of label during 1 min in the presence of 0.05, 0.2, and 1 mm 2-deoxyglucose, with and without 3 µm cytochalasin B, suggested noncompetitive inhibition. These data indicate that cytochalasin B interacts with a fat cell plasma membrane component (or components) which results in an inhibition of the d-glucose transport system."

https://openalex.org/W1589223082,Abstract The present paper presents the complete sequence of the 500-residue polypeptide chain of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. The two missing overlapping peptides were obtained by cleavage of a mixture of large cyanogen bromide peptides. In one case cleavage at a unique Asn-Gly bond was accomplished with hydroxylamine. In the second case the bromine adduct of 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methylindole was used to produce scission at the COOH group of a tryptophanyl residue. Other studies have resulted in completion of additional parts of the sequence and some correction of an earlier tentative sequence.
https://openalex.org/W2147332104,"Abstract The work with Ehrlich ascites tumor cells presented in this report shows that all the smaller (40 S) ribosomal subunits found free in the cytoplasm are combined with substantial amounts of exchangeable, nonribosomal protein. This combination represents a specific high affinity interaction, for the subunit-associated protein, after release by 0.5 m KCl, will recombine quantitatively with the subunit when the salt concentration is lowered, and this recombination occurs even in the presence of a large excess of cytoplasmic protein. The amount of the subunit-associated protein is sufficient to permit separating the free (native) 40 S subunits on the basis of their buoyant density from those derived by dissociating ribosomes. In CsCl equilibrium density gradients the native particles appear as two heterodisperse bands centered at densities 1.49 and 1.40 g per cm3, whereas the derived subunits form a single narrow band at 1.51 g per cm3. Calculations from these values, confirmed by direct measurement, indicate that the 1.49 and 1.40 native particles contain about 1 x 105 and 7 x 105 daltons of associated protein, respectively. During alterations in rate of protein synthesis, significant changes in numbers of native subunits occur, although these are small compared with the many-fold fluctuations in monomeric ribosomes that one observes. When peptide chain initiation is slowed relative to chain completion and ribosome runoff, the number of density 1.49 subunits increases immediately, without appreciable change in the 1.40 class, and approaches a maximum when the monomer fraction is just beginning to rise. This early increase in the 1.49 subunits is consistent with the concept that direct coupling of the larger and smaller subunits following runoff is blocked by combination of the smaller subunits with protein factor (or factors) and that monomers accumulate when the limited supply of free factor (or factors) has all been bound. The subunit-associated proteins have not yet been isolated and characterized. However, acrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified native 40 S particles reveals a small number of prominent bands in the molecular weight range 50,000 to 200,000 (all bands of the derived subunit being less than 50,000)."

https://openalex.org/W1498025902,Abstract Surface monolayer techniques have been applied to the study of lipoprotein lipase from lipid-free bovine milk. Lipoprotein lipase activity was determined by measurement of the decrease in surface radioactivity as a result of enzymic hydrolysis of a glyceryl tri[1-14C]octanoate monolayer. The rate of hydrolysis was enhanced 5-fold by 10 nm apolipoprotein glutamic acid from human very low density lipoprotein. The activator protein and the enzymic activity were shown to associate as a stable surface film in the absence of lipid.

https://openalex.org/W1557198056,"Abstract This report presents evidence bearing on the function of the nonribosomal protein that we find associated with the smaller ribosomal subunits found free in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. In our previous work, two forms of these native 40 S subunits have been identified, both containing more protein than the corresponding subunits isolated from ribosomes. Treating the native 40 S subunits with 0.5 m KCl removes the associated proteins, yielding particles that couple readily with derived larger subunits, whereas the native forms remain dissociated. Since bacterial initiation factors bind to the smaller subunit, are removed by 0.5 m KCl, and serve as dissociation factors, we have sought to determine whether the mammalian 40 S subunit-associated proteins might also be initiation factors. Although the 40 S subunit-associated proteins have not yet been purified sufficiently to permit direct comparison with mammalian initiation factors, we have obtained indirect evidence indicating that the two groups of proteins have functional properties in common. (a) A crude preparation containing the mammalian initiation factors (the KCl wash fraction) contains proteins which bind specifically to 40 S subunits and convert ribosome-derived 40 S subunits to forms having the same amounts of extra protein as the two native forms. (b) Removal from the KCl wash of the proteins which bind to the 40 S subunit largely inactivates the wash with respect to its ability to stimulate initiation. (c) The subunit-associated protein confers upon the subunit the ability to bind a synthetic mRNA, poly(U), a property that one would expect to be conferred by an initiation factor. It appears likely, then, that the 40 S subunit-associated factors are initiation factors, which combine with the smaller subunits released at peptide chain termination, thereby blocking direct coupling with the larger subunit and promoting initiation complex formation."

https://openalex.org/W1576773728,"Abstract Various spectral properties (circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion, and ultraviolet denaturation difference spectroscopy) of a glycosylated bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase B') have been measured. This glycoprotein contains an average of 1 mole of glucosamine and 2 to 3 moles of mannose per mole of protein. The amino acid composition of RNase B' is identical with that of ribonuclease A (RNase A), and the amino acid sequence of the two proteins is believed to be identical. The CD spectrum of RNase B' was resolved into Gaussian bands, and assignments were made to optically active side chain chromophores and peptide groups. The rotational strength of each transition was determined and found to be essentially the same as the corresponding value for RNase A. The ORD spectrum of RNase B' was also virtually identical with that of RNase A. The denaturation difference spectrum indicated about three buried tyrosyl groups in RNase B', in agreement with the structure and spectrum of RNase A. These spectral results, which reflect different portions of the protein, strongly suggest that the secondary and tertiary structure of the glycoprotein is identical with that of the nonglycosylated protein, RNase A. Consequently, the carbohydrate moiety has no effect on the conformation of the protein. Kinetic studies of unfolding and refolding also indicated no appreciable effect of the oligosaccharide on the rate constants. Evidence is presented which shows that RNase B' unfolds and refolds in guanidine hydrochloride at neutral pH via the two-state mechanism, as does RNase A. Thus, the equilibrium spectral parameters, measured at various denaturant concentrations, could be converted to the free energy for the reaction, native protein → unfolded protein, which does not involve an appreciable concentration of stable intermediates. From these data, the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, ΔG0, was obtained by means of various extrapolation methods. The average value found for ΔG0 was 15.3 Cal per mole, which is only several hundred calories per mole greater than that of RNase A, i.e. the carbohydrate moiety has only a small stabilizing effect on the protein. The acid-induced unfolding of RNase B, like that of RNase A, was quite complicated and difficult to interpret quantitatively. The data do, however, suggest that several masked carboxyl groups are responsible for the acid transition. Herein, we have emphasized how spectral data, in particular near ultraviolet CD spectroscopy, can be quantitatively analyzed to permit very detailed comparisons on the conformation and stability of similar proteins."

https://openalex.org/W66751870,"Abstract Two vitamin B12-binding proteins, designated hog intrinsic factor and hog nonintrinsic factor, have been isolated from hog gastric mucosa. Affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose resulted in the removal of the bulk of protein present in a crude extract of hog gastric mucosa. The two vitamin B12-binding proteins were separated subsequently by a method of selective affinity chromatography with an affinity adsorbent containing covalently bound derivatives of vitamin B12 that lack the nucleotide portion of the native vitamin. Under appropriate conditions hog nonintrinsic factor was adsorbed to a column of this material, while hog intrinsic factor was not. After additional purification both proteins were isolated in homogeneous form based on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hog intrinsic factor (24 µg) corrected vitamin B12 malabsorption when given to a patient with pernicious anemia, while hog nonintrinsic factor (49 µg) had no effect. Hog intrinsic factor binds 30.3 µg of vitamin B12 per mg of protein. Molecular weight values of 52,300 to 58,600 were obtained by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and amino acid and carbohydrate analysis. The protein contains 17.5% carbohydrate which accounts for the elevated molecular weight values (66,000 to 75,000) obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. In the presence of vitamin B12 hog intrinsic factor aggregates to form dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers. Hog nonintrinsic factor binds 25.1 µg of vitamin B12 per mg of protein. Molecular weight values of 61,000 to 66,000 were obtained by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and amino acid and carbohydrate analysis. The protein contains 35.5% carbohydrate which accounts for the elevated molecular weight values (100,000 to 130,000) obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. Hog nonintrinsic factor retains its monomeric form in the presence of vitamin B12 under conditions in which hog intrinsic factor aggregates. Hog intrinsic factor and hog nonintrinsic factor differ significantly from each other in their amino acid and carbohydrate composition. These differences, together with differences in other parameters, demonstrate that these two proteins are distinct and separate species."
https://openalex.org/W2019581870,"Kinetics of the catecholainine uptake process in brain were altered by fighting. Significant increases in the apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for the uptake of norepinephrine into cerebral cortical homnogenates and significant increases in the inhibition constant (Ki) for d-amphetamnine inhibition of this uptake occurred in group-caged mice living under chronic attack from aggressive cage mates. Also, significant increases in the apparent Km and maximum velocity (Vmax) for norepinephrine uptake were observed 18 to 20 hours after the last of a series of short intense daily fights between male mice previously made aggressive by long-term individual caging. These results suggest that the natural stress of fighting leads to (i) lowered affinity for reuptake of norepinephrine into nerve endings of the cerebral cortex, (ii) an increase in the number of uptake sites, and (iii) lowered affinity for d-amphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W1497445092,"Abstract DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was extracted from nuclei of Dictyostelium discoideum at two stages in the life cycle: during exponential growth and during differentiation into fruiting bodies. The activity from both stages could be resolved into several fractions which differed in sensitivity to α-amanitin and in ionic requirements. No significant change in the proportions of the various fractions was found during development. Both polymerases I and II, isolated from either growing or differentiating cells, were found to prefer double-strand DNA of D. discoideum but could also use DNA from a variety of organisms to a lesser extent. No change in template specificity was observed during development. Polymerase II was purified to apparent homogeneity from both growing and differentiating cells and the subunit composition determined by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. Five protein subunits were consistently observed with approximate molecular weights of 170,000, 150,000, 28,00o, 21,000, and 15,000. Although a 190,000 molecular weight subunit was observed in certain preparations from growing cells, it was not found to be an obligatory component of the enzyme. These studies suggest that the change in the pattern of transcription which occurs during development in D. discoideum may depend on factors other than alteration of RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1491721419,"Abstract The histidine ring proton nuclear magnetic resonance titration curves of chemical shift versus pH of ribonuclease S and ribonuclease A are almost identical. This indicates a close similarity in the electronic environments of the histidine residues in these two enzymes. In addition to the main inflection in these curves due to the imidazole group titration, an acid inflection in the pH range 4 to 5 was observed in three of the four NMR titration curves of ribonuclease S. Similar inflections have previously been observed in ribonuclease A. Addition of phosphate ion to ribonuclease A results in changes in the NMR titration curves of the two imidazole C2 proton resonances, which are thought to correspond to the two active site histidine residues. The apparent pKa values of these two imidazole groups increase with addition of phosphate, while the pKa values of the acid inflections in these curves decrease slightly. These changes produce an increased separation of the imidazole and acid inflections and result in a pronounced asymmetry in the NMR titration curves. The pKa values determined for the acid inflection do not correspond to an ionization of the phosphate group. The effects of sulfate ion are similar to those of phosphate. The results support the hypothesis that the acid perturbations in these NMR titration curves arise from intramolecular interactions of the imidazole groups with nearby carboxyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W2125902991,Mouse L cells lacking the cytoplasmic thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21) retain a mitochondrial specific thymidine kinase. This results in exclusive labeling of mitochondrial DNA when the cells are grown in the presence of radioactive thymidine. Pulse-labeling experiments demonstrate that the replicating forms of mitochondrial DNA contain a substantial fraction of pulse-label. A surprisingly large fraction of the pulse-label is contained in nonreplicating closed circular DNA and is not covalently bound to the closed circular molecules. This suggests a repetitive synthesis of the initiation sequence in mitochondrial DNA replication.

https://openalex.org/W2158241904,Abstract A tryptic digest of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-inactivated chicken liver glutamate dehydrogenase has yielded peptides accounting for 399 residues of the 503 residues in the subunit. A single peptide was isolated that contained pyridoxallysine. This peptide had a composition identical with that isolated from the bovine enzyme that was similarly treated. Cyanogen bromide peptides were isolated and used to cover those regions of the sequence for which no tryptic peptides were obtained and to obtain overlapping peptides. Data from these studies and comparisons of the sequence to that in the bovine enzyme have provided enough evidence to account for the complete amino acid sequence of chicken glutamate dehydrogenase. There are 30 differences in sequence between the bovine and chicken enzymes with most of these being conservative in nature. The most pronounced difference between the two enzymes is at the NH2 terminus where 3 additional residues occur in the chicken enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1603698504,"Abstract Cyanoferrimyoglobins of harbor seal and sperm whale were carboxymethylated with enriched [2-13C] bromoacetate. The enriched adducts were readily observed by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. Resonances were identified by comparison with enriched adducts to appropriate small molecules, and T1 values were determined under various conditions. In addition to the expected adducts to the NH2-terminal residues and to histidine and lysine, an alkali-labile glycolate ester product was observed. Denatured forms were obtained by carboxymethylation in 8 m urea which led to complete conversion of all histidine residues to the dicarboxymethyl form. By carrying out carboxymethylation in stages it was possible to limit the labeling to either the normally external or the normally internal set of histidine residues. Treatment under denaturing conditions led to carboxymethylation of both methionine residues. The T1 values place some limits on the interpretation of the degrees of mobility of the adduct carbon nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1593857501,"Abstract The specificity and properties of anomalous AMP incorporation catalyzed by rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase were studied. A single AMP residue could be added to the 3' terminus of a variety of RNA molecules, including rRNA and 5 S RNA. In addition, tRNA molecules containing 1 or 3 terminal CMP residues, tRNA-C and tRNA-C-C-C, were also active as acceptors. The rate of AMP incorporation into these anomalous substrates was considerably more rapid if the RNA acceptor contained a terminal CMP residue. Thus, the rate of AMP incorporation into tRNA-C-C was about 20-fold more rapid than into tRNA-C-A and tRNA-C-U. Nevertheless, at high levels of enzyme it was possible to convert almost completely the latter molecules to tRNA-C-A-A and tRNA-C-U-A. All the anomalous reactions were stimulated by the presence of Mn2+, as much as 10-fold in the case of 5 S RNA, whereas normal AMP incorporation was inhibited. Under optimal conditions, wheat germ 5 S RNA was as active a substrate as tRNA-C-C. Furthermore, the two RNA acceptors had similar apparent Km values. These results are discussed in terms of the recognition site on the RNA acceptors and the importance of the 3'-terminal residue. Evidence is also presented that the 3'-terminal moiety of wheat germ 5 S RNA is predominantly CMP. In addition, an improved method for determining the location of nucleotide residues incorporated into RNA is described."
https://openalex.org/W2103499011,"SUMMARY A new affinity labeling method is presented which may be used for enzyme-catalyzing reactions in the presence of magnesium. This method uses the substrate-cobalt(III) analog of the substrate-magnesium complex as a covalent label of the active site. The specific case of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b, which has been covalently labeled with a AMP-Co(II1) derivative at the allosteric site, is discussed. The stoichiometry and the extinction coefficient of the label have been determined. The association of this cobaltic complex to the enzyme is stable. The label destroys the activity on the subunit where it is bound; it slightly afl[ects the binding of orthophosphate and it changes the response to the glycogen substrate from a noncooperative pattern to a cooperative binding. This shows that the label has an effect on the quaternary structure of phosphorylase b. In addition to the covalent binding of the label to the allosteric site, it is shown that its association can be reversed at will, i.e. it can be removed by the addition of small molecules containing thiol groups."
https://openalex.org/W1484524571,"Abstract The properties of the poly(C) polymerase activity associated with rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase were examined. The anomalous activity co-purified with tRNA nucleotidyltransferase throughout a 25,000-fold purification and was associated with both forms of the latter enzyme. Both activities also co-migrated during isoelectric focusing, and had similar, but not identical, heat inactivation profiles. The poly(C) polymerase reaction was identical with the normal CMP-incorporating activity of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase with regard to pH and temperature optima, requirements for a divalent cation and an RNA acceptor, and nonlinear double reciprocal plots with respect to varying CTP concentrations. However, the poly(C) polymerase activity also differed in several properties, including its response to divalent cations, ATP, salt, and organic solvents. Normal CMP incorporation into tRNA-C was most active with Mg2+, was stimulated by ATP and salt, and was inhibited by a variety of organic solvents. In contrast, the poly(C) polymerase reaction was most active with Mn2+, was inhibited by ATP and salt, and was stimulated by organic solvents. The poly(C) polymerase activity utilized intact tRNA-C-C-A, tRNA-C-C, 5 S RNA, and rRNA as acceptors for CMP incorporation. In the presence of Mg2+ the rate of the anomalous reaction was generally only a few per cent of CMP incorporation into the presumed normal acceptor, tRNA-C, although 5 S RNA was 15% as active. In all cases, the poly(C) polymerase reaction was stimulated 2- to 3-fold by 1 mm Mn2+ and the normal reaction was inhibited, so that under these conditions the best substrate was 5 S RNA. Extended nucleotide incorporation into tRNA-C-C-A or rRNA was found only in the presence of CTP, whereas incorporation of AMP and UMP was limited or nonexistent. These data indicate that liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, like several other enzymes which synthesize phosphodiester bonds, can also act as a homopolymer polymerase. The relation of this activity to other known poly(C) polymerases and its possible mechanism of action are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561374609,"Abstract Proton-decoupled Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance of natural abundance 13C was used to obtain spectra of cyanoferrimyoglobins of harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and sperm whale (Physeter catodon). These spectra were compared with those of hen egg white lysozyme and of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A to show differences reflecting gross composition as well as differences tentatively attributable to more subtle conformational constraints. The cyanoferrimyoglobin spectra were much alike but not identical. Carboxymethylation of the native seal protein produced barely detectable changes at the chemical shift positions of the major adducts but no systematic alterations elsewhere in the spectrum. However, extensive modification of histidine and methionine residues by carboxymethylation of seal apomyoglobin in the presence of 8 m urea yielded a denatured product, judged by circular dichroism measurements, for which the 13C spectrum was sharp and characteristic of a denatured protein. This spectrum was used to tabulate tentative assignments. Partially relaxed spectra were used to obtain spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) for certain carbon types. These values are compared for the various myoglobin preparations mentioned above. The similarities between the native forms are striking. The denatured preparation gives many evidences of increased segmental mobility, especially for those nuclei that appear relatively restrained in the native state."

https://openalex.org/W1502514213,"Abstract Bovine prothrombin can be labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate to produce a fluorescent proenzyme which maintains up to 85% of native prothrombin-specific activity. Other proteins labeled similarly were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, and it was found that the chromophores did not affect the molecular weights as determined by the electrophoretic system. Sodium citrate activation of both labeled and unlabeled prothrombin produced molecular weight species consistent with our previously proposed model (Mann, K. G., Heldebrant, C. M., and Fass, D. N. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6106–6114): prothrombin (72,000), Intermediate 1 (65,000), Intermediate 2 (39,000), and Intermediate 3 (25,000). The thrombins are produced from Intermediate 2 and consist of multichain disulfide-linked structures; α-thrombin (33,000 + 6,000), β-thrombin (18,000 + 10,000), and γ-thrombin (14,000 + 10,000 + 4,000). An analog of the physiological coagulation system was constructed using serum and a phospholipid source. Labeled prothrombin when activated in this mixture yielded products which, by virtue of their fluorescence, could be distinguished from the serum proteins. All precursors of thrombin which are produced during citrate activation are also produced during serum activation. The large thrombin, α-thrombin, is composed of 33,000- and 6,000-dalton chains in both activating systems. These results indicate that prothrombin activation in biological systems produces intermediates and products identical with those formed in highly purified synthetic activation systems. Our studies also indicate that the kinetics of the activation process in serum is demonstrably different from that previously described in highly purified systems."
https://openalex.org/W1517505826,"Abstract Certain histidine residues in bovine pancreatic ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease react with iodoacetate about 1000 times faster than free histidine reacts. The mechanisms of these facilitated, active-site-directed reactions were investigated by study of the kinetics of carboxymethylation with reagents with varied leaving groups: chloride, bromide, iodide, and tosylate. With ribonuclease, the rate of reaction gave hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of reagent. The data fit a Michaelis-Menten mechanism, with dissociation constants of 8 to 24 mm for the various reagents. The similar magnitudes of the constants lead to the conclusion that the reagents bind (reversibly) in a common way to the enzyme. The pseudo bimolecular rate constants for reaction (after correction for the differing inherent reactivities of the reagents) were also similar, indicating that the leaving group is not very important in the mechanism. These studies support the proposal that the reaction of haloacetates with ribonuclease is facilitated by ionic attraction of the carboxylate ion by a protonated imidazole while an unprotonated imidazole displaces the halide ion. In contrast, the kinetics of carboxymethylation of the Cu2+-Tris complex of deoxyribonuclease showed that the reagents bound loosely, with dissociation constants of 130 mm or larger. Furthermore, the corrected, pseudo bimolecular rate constants increased as the size of the leaving group decreased. The larger groups may be more sterically hindered in the reaction; alternatively, the smaller groups may be attracted more to the electrophilic Cu2+. In either case, during carboxymethylation, both the carboxylate ion and the leaving group interact with DNase. While the carboxymethylation of RNase may be facilitated by the precise orientation of the reagent, the carboxymethylation of DNase may be facilitated by electrophilic catalysis. Tosylglycolate (carboxymethyl p-toluenesulfonate) was prepared and tested as an analog of the haloacetates. The reagent was about one-eighth as reactive as iodoacetate with a pyridine base and reacted with the —SH group of cysteine. It carboxymethylated histidines 119 and 12 of ribonuclease with more preference for histidine 119 than did iodoacetate."
https://openalex.org/W1515355188,"Abstract Eighteen tryptic peptides, varying from 2 to 33 residues, plus free arginine and alanine were isolated from N-maleylated calf thymus histone III. The amino acid sequences of 17 of the peptides were established completely, but the sequence of a 33-residue peptide was only partially determined. Together, these peptides account for 135 residues, including the 2 cysteinyl residues which are present in histone III but not in other histones of calf thymus. Two lysyl residues are partially e-N-acetylated. In this study 1 lysyl residue was found to be e-N-methylated. In a more comprehensive investigation (DeLange, R. J., Hooper, J. A. and Smith, E. L. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3261) 2 lysyl residues were modified at the e-amino group as the mono-, di-, and trimethyl derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1578571554,"Abstract Development of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, is fueled in part by endogenous reserves of protein. Several enzymes of amino acid metabolism have previously been found to be synthesized during the early stages of development. We have now found that cells of D. discoideum contain two distinct threonine deaminase enzymes (EC 4.2.1.16); one is sensitive to feedback inhibition by isoleucine and is most likely a biosynthetic enzyme, while the other is insensitive to isoleucine and may function catabolically. The two enzymes also differ in thermosensitivity and stability to freezing and thawing. The isoleucine-sensitive enzyme is synthesized in growing cells but is inactivated shortly after the initiation of development. The isoleucine-insensitive enzyme accumulates during the aggregation and pseudoplasmodial stages of development. The accumulation requires concomitant protein synthesis and a prior period of RNA synthesis. The enzyme of differentiating cells is able to catalyze the breakdown of serine as well as threonine and thus may be involved in catabolism of both of these amino acids. The period of accumulation of threonine deaminase is modified in a pair of temporally deranged mutant strains which complete morphogenesis in two-thirds or three times the normal time, respectively. Thus it appears that differentiation threonine deaminase is a developmentally regulated enzyme of D. discoideum."
https://openalex.org/W1525634180,Abstract The preparation of a new stable and active form of chymotrypsin is described. The enzyme possesses threonine-147 instead of alanine-149 as the NH2-terminal group of the C chain and has been called α1-chymotrypsin. The conformational transition that affects chymotrypsins at alkaline pH was investigated and compared with that of α- and δ-chymotrypsins by studying the kinetic constants and their pH dependencies for the hydrolysis of various specific ester substrates. The κcat values obtained with α1-chymotrypsin are similar to those of α- and δ-chymotrypsins. The Km values showed a progressive increase toward the alkaline pH region. The shape of the Km-pH profiles closely resemble those of δ-chymotrypsin and differ considerably from the behavior of α-chymotrypsin. The results strongly implicate the participation of the alanine-149 amino group in the reversible inactivation of α-chymotrypsin at high pH.
https://openalex.org/W1541331710,"Abstract The pH dependence of the rate of glutamate oxidation by bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase has been determined in the absence and presence of allosteric modifiers. In the range of pH 7 to 9 where the enzyme was saturated by substrate, the degree of activation by ADP or inhibition by GTP did not vary substantially with pH. The pH dependence of chicken liver glutamate dehydrogenase measured in the absence and presence of allosteric modifiers was nearly identical with that of the bovine enzyme. In studies of the bovine enzyme, nitration of tyrosine-406 had no significant effect on the activity or the pH dependence of the enzyme activity in the absence of allosteric modifier or in the presence of the activator ADP. However, nitration decreased the inhibitory effect of GTP evenly over the entire pH range and the extent of loss of GTP inhibition was dependent on the extent of nitration. It is concluded that the effect of nitration of tyrosine-406 on the loss of inhibition by GTP is to alter the relationship of the binding site of GTP to the catalytic site in a pH-independent manner. This result is probably a consequence of the introduction of the steric bulk of the nitro group into the tertiary structure of the protein."
