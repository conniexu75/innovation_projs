https://openalex.org/W2897700601,"CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity to infectious nucleic acids and are widely employed as genome editing tools. These tools use RNA-guided Cas proteins whose large size (950 to 1400 amino acids) has been considered essential to their specific DNA- or RNA-targeting activities. Here we present a set of CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated archaea that contain Cas14, a family of exceptionally compact RNA-guided nucleases (400 to 700 amino acids). Despite their small size, Cas14 proteins are capable of targeted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage without restrictive sequence requirements. Moreover, target recognition by Cas14 triggers nonspecific cutting of ssDNA molecules, an activity that enables high-fidelity single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (Cas14-DETECTR). Metagenomic data show that multiple CRISPR-Cas14 systems evolved independently and suggest a potential evolutionary origin of single-effector CRISPR-based adaptive immunity."

This expectation is based on (well-founded) conjectures in computational complexity theory, but rigorous comparisons between the capabilities of quantum and classical algorithms are difficult to perform. Bravyi et al. proved theoretically that whereas the number of “steps” needed by parallel quantum circuits to solve certain linear algebra problems was independent of the problem size, this number grew logarithmically with size for analogous classical circuits (see the Perspective by Montanaro). This so-called quantum advantage stems from the quantum correlations present in quantum circuits that cannot be reproduced in analogous classical circuits.

https://openalex.org/W2896596723,"Single-crystal metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-crystal metals are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2896381746,"Modern genotyping techniques, such as SNP analysis and genotyping by sequencing (GBS), are hampered by poor DNA quality and purity, particularly in challenging plant species, rich in secondary metabolites. We therefore investigated the utility of a pre-wash step using a buffered sorbitol solution, prior to DNA extraction using a high salt CTAB extraction protocol, in a high throughput or miniprep setting. This pre-wash appears to remove interfering metabolites, such as polyphenols and polysaccharides, from tissue macerates. We also investigated the adaptability of the sorbitol pre-wash for RNA extraction using a lithium chloride-based protocol. The method was successfully applied to a variety of tissues, including leaf, cambium and fruit of diverse plant species including annual crops, forest and fruit trees, herbarium leaf material and lyophilized fungal mycelium. We consistently obtained good yields of high purity DNA or RNA in all species tested. The protocol has been validated for thousands of DNA samples by generating high data quality in dense SNP arrays. DNA extracted from Eucalyptus spp. leaf and cambium as well as mycelium from Trichoderma spp. was readily digested with restriction enzymes and performed consistently in AFLP assays. Scaled-up DNA extractions were also suitable for long read sequencing. Successful RNA quality control and good RNA-Seq data for Eucalyptus and cashew confirms the effectiveness of the sorbitol buffer pre-wash for high quality RNA extraction."
https://openalex.org/W2896359189,"Collective cell chemotaxis, the directed migration of cell groups along gradients of soluble chemical cues, underlies various developmental and pathological processes. We use neural crest cells, a migratory embryonic stem cell population whose behavior has been likened to malignant invasion, to study collective chemotaxis in vivo. Studying Xenopus and zebrafish, we have shown that the neural crest exhibits a tensile actomyosin ring at the edge of the migratory cell group that contracts in a supracellular fashion. This contractility is polarized during collective cell chemotaxis: It is inhibited at the front but persists at the rear of the cell cluster. The differential contractility drives directed collective cell migration ex vivo and in vivo through the intercalation of rear cells. Thus, in neural crest cells, collective chemotaxis works by rear-wheel drive."
https://openalex.org/W2897935835,"Previous studies have reported that miR-27a-3p is down-regulated in the serum of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but the implication of miR-27a-3p down-regulation in post-ICH complications remains elusive. Here we verified miR-27a-3p levels in the serum of ICH patients by real-time PCR and observed that miR-27a-3p is also significantly reduced in the serum of these patients. We then further investigated the effect of miR-27a-3p on post-ICH complications by intraventricular administration of a miR-27a-3p mimic in rats with collagenase-induced ICH. We found that the hemorrhage markedly reduced miR-27a-3p levels in the hematoma, perihematomal tissue, and serum and that intracerebroventricular administration of the miR-27a-3p mimic alleviated behavioral deficits 24 h after ICH. Moreover, ICH-induced brain edema, vascular leakage, and leukocyte infiltration were also attenuated by this mimic. Of note, miR-27a-3p mimic treatment also inhibited neuronal apoptosis and microglia activation in the perihematomal zone. We further observed that the miR-27a-3p mimic suppressed the up-regulation of aquaporin-11 (AQP11) in the perihematomal area and in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Moreover, miR-27a-3p down-regulation increased BMEC monolayer permeability and impaired BMEC proliferation and migration. In conclusion, miR-27a-3p down-regulation contributes to brain edema, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuron loss, and neurological deficits following ICH. We conclude that application of exogenous miR-27a-3p may protect against post-ICH complications by targeting AQP11 in the capillary endothelial cells of the brain.

Hence, management of brain edema is recommended as part of neurointensive care for patients with ICH (2Balami J.S. Buchan A.M.

MicroRNAs, 18–22 nucleotides in length, are a class of noncoding RNAs that play fundamental roles in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (9Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431 (15372042): 350-35510.1038/nature02871Crossref PubMed Scopus (9046) Google Scholar). By binding to mRNAs specifically at the 3′ UTR through perfect or imperfect complementation, miRNAs induce either translational repression or RNA degradation in cells (9Ambros V.

Thus, serum miRNAs are considered to be potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis, and they may be useful for the development of targeted therapies. Previously, an miRNA array revealed a group of miRNAs that were up- or down-regulated in the serum of ICH patients, and miR-27a-3p was one of the down-regulated miRNAs (14Zhu Y. Wang J.L. He Z.Y. Jin F. Tang L. Association of altered serum microRNAs with perihematomal edema after acute intracerebral hemorrhage.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26207814)e013378310.1371/journal.pone.0133783PubMed Google Scholar). However, the implications of miR-27a-3p down-regulation in the pathogenesis of post-ICH complications are unclear. Interestingly, a reduced level of miR-27a-3p was also observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and miR-27a-3p reduction was more prominent in those with vasospasm (15Stylli S.S. Adamides A.A. Koldej R.M. Luwor R.B. Ritchie D.S. Ziogas J. Kaye A.H. miRNA expression profiling of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.J. Neurosurg. 2017; 126 (27128592): 1131-113910.3171/2016.1.JNS151454Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential function of miR-27a-3p in the maintenance of cerebrovascular structure and function following hemorrhage. In this study, an miR-27a-3p mimic was administrated into the brain ventricle of rats with ICH to investigate the role of miR-27a-3p in post-ICH pathogenesis. The effects of miR-27a-3p on post-ICH brain edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, neuronal apoptosis, and microglia activation in the perihematomal zone as well as animal behaviors were assessed. Furthermore, a potential miR-27a-3p target, aquaporin-11 (AQP11), was found to be up-regulated in the perihematomal area, and the specific targeting was verified in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). To verify previous miRNA array data (14Zhu Y. Wang J.L. He Z.Y. Jin F. Tang L. Association of altered serum microRNAs with perihematomal edema after acute intracerebral hemorrhage.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26207814)e013378310.1371/journal.pone.0133783PubMed Google Scholar), serum levels of miR-27a-3p in ICH patients and healthy subjects were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, the level of miR-27a-3p in ICH patients was 31.6% lower compared with that in healthy subjects. This result confirmed down-regulation of miR-27a-3p in the serum of ICH patients, but it may not be specific for ICH. To investigate the implications of miR-27a-3p down-regulation in post-ICH pathogenesis, an miR-27a-3p mimic was given to rats with collagenase-induced ICH by intracerebroventricular administration. Behavioral assessment was conducted 24 h after ICH induction and miRNA treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, animals with ICH showed a markedly increased frequency of right turns (Fig. 2A) and a lower limb placement score (Fig. 2B) compared with the sham-operated animals, presenting typical post-ICH behavioral deficits. Following ICH, rats administered the miR-27a-3p mimic showed significant improvements in the corner test and limb placement test compared with miR-NC-treated rats, implying that the miR-27a-3p mimic could alleviate ICH-induced neurological deficits. The levels of miR-27a-3p in the serum and perihematomal and hematomal areas of four groups of rats were measured by real-time PCR. The results showed that the levels of miR-27a-3p dropped significantly in the serum and perihematomal and hematomal masses 24 h after ICH (Fig. 3A). Intracerebroventricular administration of the miR-27a-3p mimic achieved successful delivery to the perihematomal and hematomal areas and also maintained the serum level of miR-27a-3p after ICH (Fig. 3A). Brain edema and BBB permeability in ICH rats with or without administration of the miR-27a-3p mimic were examined. Compared with the sham group, ICH markedly increased the brain water content, whereas ICH-induced brain edema was significantly attenuated by treatment with the miR-27a-3p mimic (Fig. 3B). An Evans blue extravasation assay revealed that vascular leakage in the ICH group was significantly higher than in the sham group, whereas the miR-27a-3p mimic significantly reduced cerebrovascular permeability after ICH (Fig. 3C). In addition, leukocyte infiltration to the perihematomal zone was examined by immunofluorescent staining with MPO. The number of MPO-positive cells in the perihematomal tissue of ICH rats was profoundly increased compared with normal brain parenchyma of sham-operated rats (426 ± 88 versus 39 ± 8). By contrast, administration of the miR-27a-3p mimic significantly reduced the number of infiltrated leukocytes (192 ± 48) (Fig. 4, A and B). These results demonstrated that intracerebral administration of the miR-27a-3p mimic decreased edema formation and protected BBB function following ICH. Apoptotic cells in the perihematomal area were detected by TUNEL assay. ICH led to a markedly increased rate of apoptotic cells in the perihematomal area (32.41% ± 8.52%), whereas the miR-27a-3p mimic significantly reduced the apoptotic rate in perihematomal tissue (20.47% ± 5.85%) (Fig. 5, A and D). Degenerating neurons were labeled with Fluoro-Jade B stain. The number of positively stained neurons was significantly increased in the perihematomal area of ICH rats (189 ± 39), whereas the miR-27a-3p mimic reduced the number of dying neurons adjacent to the hematoma (62 ± 14) (Fig. 5, B and E). In addition, microglia activation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining with OX-42. The number of OX-42-positive microglia in the perihematomal area was remarkably elevated in the ICH group (226 ± 56), and it was significantly reduced by miR-27a-3p mimic treatment (121 ± 46) (Fig. 5, C and F). Overall, these results indicated that the miR-27a-3p mimic reduced neuronal apoptosis and microglia activation in the perihematomal area. Next we explored potential miR-27a-3p targets that were involved in the pathological changes following ICH. The expression of AQP11 was found to be significantly increased at both the mRNA and protein levels in the perihematomal region of ICH rats compared with sham-operated brain parenchyma (Fig. 6, A and B). Compared with miR-NC, the miR-27a-3p mimic significantly attenuated the elevation of AQP11 in perihematomal tissue, suggesting that AQP11 may be a target of miR-27a-3p. We also found that the expression of AQP1 was basically unchanged (Fig. S1). As AQP11 is highly expressed in the endothelium of brain capillaries (16Koike S. Tanaka Y. Matsuzaki T. Morishita Y. Ishibashi K. Aquaporin-11 (AQP11) expression in the mouse brain.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17 (27258268): E861Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), BMECs were isolated to verify the inhibitory effect of miR-27a-3p on AQP11 expression. In BMECs, the expression levels of AQP11 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased by the miR-27a-3p mimic and increased by an miR-27a-3p inhibitor (Fig. 6, C and D), which was consistent with in vivo findings. Based on the bioinformatics analysis, AQP11 may be a target of miR-27a-3p (Fig. 6, E–G). Furthermore, a Dual-Luciferase assay was performed in BMECs to validate the direct targeting of miR-27a-3p on the 3′ UTR of AQP11 mRNA. Compared with miR-NC, the miR-27a-3p mimic significantly reduced luciferase activity in AQP11_3′-UTR_WT but not AQP11_3′ UTR_mut (Fig. 6H), confirming direct targeting of AQP11 by miR-27a-3p. To investigate the impact of miR-27a-3p down-regulation on BMECs as in the context of ICH, BMECs were transfected with an miR-27a-3p inhibitor for the evaluation of cellular behavior. As shown in Fig. 7A, down-regulation of miR-27a-3p significantly increased the passage of dextran 20 through the BMEC monolayer, suggesting a critical role of miR-27a-3p in the maintenance of endothelial layer permeability. In addition, an MTT assay indicated that the miR-27a-3p inhibitor significantly suppressed proliferation of BMECs in vitro (Fig. 7B). Moreover, a scratch wound assay showed that the motility of BMECs was greatly impaired when miR-27a-3p was inhibited (Fig. 7C). Thus, inhibition of miR-27a-3p increased the permeability of the BMEC monolayer and reduced the proliferative and migratory abilities of BMECs. In this study, we first validated the down-regulation of miR-27a-3p in the serum of patients with ICH. Previous studies have reported that miR-27a is also down-regulated in other brain diseases, including Huntington’s disease and traumatic brain injury; however, its elevation exerts a cerebrally protective effect (17Ban J.J.

Further studies will be taken into consideration to address this query. Moreover, in a rat ICH model, miR-27a-3p was down-regulated in the serum and hematoma and perihematomal tissues, and intracerebroventricular administration of an miR-27a-3p mimic alleviated ICH-induced brain edema, BBB disruption, neuronal apoptosis, and neurologic deficits. These observations indicate that down-regulation of miR-27a-3p is not a random event following ICH. Instead, miR-27a-3p is critical in the maintenance of brain homeostasis post-ICH. Previous studies have clarified the origin of circulating miRNAs (20Zhou S.S. Jin J.P. Wang J.Q. Zhang Z.G. Freedman J.H. Zheng Y. Cai L. miRNAS in cardiovascular diseases: potential biomarkers, therapeutic targets and challenges.Acta Pharmacol.

In brief, primary miRNAs with a 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail are transcribed in the nucleus and then cleaved by Drosha into precursors. Precursor miRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm to form mature miRNAs. Finally, mature miRNAs are transported into the bloodstream by binding to RNA-binding proteins, microvesicles, exosomes, or multivesicular bodies. Corsten et al. (22Corsten M.F. Dennert R. Jochems S.

Based on this evidence, the increase in miR-27a-3p may originate from injured brain tissues and not from blood cells. The BBB is a physical and physiological barrier between the blood and brain, and disruption of BBB integrity is a well-documented cause of brain edema following a variety of brain injuries (23Betz A.L. Iannotti F. Hoff J.T. Brain edema: a classification based on blood-brain barrier integrity.Cerebrovasc. Brain Metab. Rev. 1989; 1 (2701373): 133-154PubMed Google Scholar). After ICH, BBB permeability increases remarkably in the tissue surrounding the clot prior to the occurrence of significant edema, resulting in severe acute edema around the hemorrhage (24Yang G.Y. Betz A.L. Chenevert T.L. Brunberg J.A. Hoff J.T. Experimental intracerebral hemorrhage: relationship between brain edema, blood flow, and blood-brain barrier permeability in rats.J. Neurosurg. 1994; 81 (8207532): 93-10210.3171/jns.1994.81.1.0093Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased BBB permeability facilitates the infiltration of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators to the perihematomal zone, leading to the activation of resident microglia and secondary neuronal injury (25Gong C. Hoff J.T. Keep R.F. Acute inflammatory reaction following experimental intracerebral hemorrhage in rat.Brain Res. 2000; 871 (10882783): 57-6510.1016/S0006-8993(00)02427-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Activated microglia, in turn, aggravate ICH-induced brain injury and neurobehavioral deficits (26Wang J. Rogove A.D. Tsirka A.E. Tsirka S.E. Protective role of tuftsin fragment 1–3 in an animal model of intracerebral hemorrhage.Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54 (14595655): 655-66410.1002/ana.10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, maintaining the integrity of the BBB is crucial for minimizing secondary brain injury after ICH. In this study, restoration of cerebral miR-27a-3p after ICH reduced BBB leakage, brain edema, leukocyte infiltration, microglia activation, and neuronal apoptosis in the perihematomal area and also improved behavioral performance in rats. Musto et al. (27Musto A. Navarra A. Vocca A. Gargiulo A. Minopoli G. Romano S. Romano M.F. Russo T. Parisi S. miR-23a, miR-24 and miR-27a protect differentiating ESCs from BMP4-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 (25476774): 1047-105710.1038/cdd.2014.198Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have found that miR-27a-3p protects differentiating embryonic stem cells from BMP4-induced apoptosis by targeting Smad5. In addition, Chen et al. (28Chen Q. Xu J. Li L. Li H. Mao S. Zhang F. Zen K. Zhang C.Y. Zhang Q. MicroRNA-23a/b and microRNA-27a/b suppress Apaf-1 protein and alleviate hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 (24651435)e1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that miR-27a-3p alleviates hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis through inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). In this study, we hypothesized that miR-27a-3p might suppress neuronal apoptosis through modulation of its target genes. Future studies are required to further verify our hypothesis. Furthermore, the in vitro permeability assay demonstrated that antagonism of miR-27a-3p in BMECs increased leakage of the BMEC monolayer. Thus, our data suggest a protective role of miR-27a-3p after ICH against post-ICH complications, at least partly through the maintenance of BBB integrity and function. miRNAs have been demonstrated to play important roles in the regulation of endothelial cell function and angiogenesis (29Urbich C.

It has been shown that inhibition of miR-27a reduces endothelial cell sprouting, induces endothelial cell repulsion in vitro, and impairs embryonic vasculogenesis in zebrafish (32Urbich C. Kaluza D.

These previous findings demonstrate a supportive role of miR-27a in endothelial cell function and vessel formation. By contrast, Young et al. (33Young J.A. Ting K.K. Li J. Moller T. Dunn L. Lu Y.

In our study, down-regulation of miR-27a-3p was associated with increased BBB permeability, whereas restoration of miR-27a-3p significantly reduced BBB permeability. Moreover, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that the miR-27a-3p inhibitor impaired the proliferation of BMECs, which is in line with the pro-proliferative role of miR-27a in endothelial cells (8Yang J.

In addition, inhibition of miR-27a-3p also weakened the motility of BMECs. Thus, our data substantiate the supportive role of miR-27a-3p in normal endothelial cell activity and BBB integrity after ICH.

The Government of Ethiopia is rolling out community based health insurance to protect the rural community from high out of pocket health expenditure and improve health service utilization. We investigated the effect of community based health insurance on catastrophic health expenditure in Northeast Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross sectional study was conducted. A Multi stage sampling technique was used to get a total of 454 (224 insured and 230 uninsured) households. The data were entered using EPI info version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 20 and STATA version 13 for binary logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching analysis respectively. Wealth status of the households was computed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify the predictors of catastrophic health expenditure. Propensity score matching analysis was used to determine the effect of community based health insurance on catastrophic health expenditure. The average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) was calculated to compare the means of outcomes across insured and uninsured households. Results A total of 454 household heads were included in the study, making a response rate of 91.2%.The total level of catastrophic health expenditure was found to be 20%. Among the households with catastrophic health expenditure, 4.41% were insured, whereas the remaining 15.64% were noninsured. Insured households (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.11–0.34), rich households (AOR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.07–3.66), having member with chronic illness (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.01–4.51) and having member encountered any illness during the past 3 months (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.35–4.40) were statistically associated with catastrophic health expenditure. Community based health insurance contributed to 23.2% (t = -5.94) (95% CI: -0.31_-0.15) reduction of catastrophic health expenditure. Conclusion The overall level of catastrophic health expenditure was high among noninsured households. Community based health insurance has significant financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure in northeast Ethiopia. Thus, the government need to scale up community based health insurance to protect the noninsured households from catastrophic health expenditure."

However, the reasons behind the increased expressions of KRT5, KRT14, KRT17 and decreased expressions of PGR, ESR1, and ERBB2 in TNBCs are not fully understood. Here we show that, expression of chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC) specifically marks human TNBCs. Low REST and high CEBPB correlate with expression of C19MC, KRT5, KRT14, and KRT17 and enhancers of these genes/cluster are regulated by CEBPB and REST binding sites. The C19MC miRNAs in turn can potentially target REST to offer a positive feedback loop, and might target PGR, ESR1, ERBB2, GATA3, SCUBE2, TFF3 mRNAs to contribute towards TNBC phenotype. Thus our study demonstrates that C19MC miRNA expression marks TNBCs and that C19MC miRNAs and CEBPB might together determine the TNBC marker expression pattern."

Repeated measurements were performed under the same conditions on two separate days, and the area of the FAZ was determined and analyzed using the above devices. Results All three devices showed a high ICC and there was no significant difference between the ICCs (pairwise comparison) of the three devices (Optovue–Canon (p = 0.66); Canon–Heidelberg (p = 0.21); Heidelberg–Optovue (p = 0.37). Agreement analysis of the three devices revealed a significant elevation of FAZ area values with the Heidelberg device and a slight underestimation of the FAZ area with the Canon device. Nevertheless, overall we found a high level of agreement between all of the three devices (ICC ≥ 0.958 (0.905–0.982)). Conclusions Good reproducibility and repeatability were observed for all three devices. However, the agreement analysis revealed slight, but significant differences, which might limit alternating use of these devices for clinical research and follow-up examinations."

Studying samples up to seven layers thick, they found that in all of them, electronic correlations caused a phase transition at a nonzero critical temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2896423219,"Iron is critical for virtually all organisms, yet major questions remain regarding the systems-level understanding of iron in whole cells. Here, we obtained Mossbauer and EPR spectra of Escherichia coli cells prepared under different nutrient iron concentrations, carbon sources, growth phases, and O2 concentrations to better understand their global iron content. We investigated WT cells and those lacking Fur, FtnA, Bfr, and Dps proteins. The coarse-grain iron content of exponentially growing cells consisted of iron-sulfur clusters, variable amounts of nonheme high-spin FeII species, and an unassigned residual quadrupole doublet. The iron in stationary-phase cells was dominated by magnetically ordered FeIII ions due to oxyhydroxide nanoparticles. Analysis of cytosolic extracts by size-exclusion chromatography detected by an online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer revealed a low-molecular-mass (LMM) FeII pool consisting of two iron complexes with masses of ∼500 (major) and ∼1300 (minor) Da. They appeared to be high-spin FeII species with mostly oxygen donor ligands, perhaps a few nitrogen donors, and probably no sulfur donors. Surprisingly, the iron content of E. coli and its reactivity with O2 were remarkably similar to those of mitochondria. In both cases, a composed of membrane-bound iron-rich respiratory complexes may protect the LMM FeII pool from reacting with O2 When exponentially growing cells transition to stationary phase, the shield deactivates as metabolic activity declines. Given the universality of oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic biology, the iron content and respiratory shield in other aerobic prokaryotes might be similar to those of E. coli and mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2897703617,"Preoperative progesterone intervention has been shown to confer a survival benefit to breast cancer patients independently of their progesterone receptor (PR) status. This observation raises the question how progesterone affects the outcome of PR-negative cancer. Here, using microarray and RNA-Seq-based gene expression profiling and ChIP-Seq analyses of breast cancer cells, we observed that the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase gene (SGK1) and the tumor metastasis-suppressor gene N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) are up-regulated and that the microRNAs miR-29a and miR-101-1 targeting the 3'-UTR of SGK1 are down-regulated in response to progesterone. We further demonstrate a dual-phase transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of SGK1 in response to progesterone, leading to an up-regulation of NDRG1 that is mediated by a set of genes regulated by the transcription factor AP-1. We found that NDRG1, in turn, inactivates a set of kinases, impeding the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In summary, we propose a model for the mode of action of progesterone in breast cancer. This model helps decipher the molecular basis of observations in a randomized clinical trial of the effect of progesterone on breast cancer and has therefore the potential to improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients receiving preoperative progesterone treatment."

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ZEB1 depletion did not impede neural fate commitment, but prevented hESC-derived neural precursors from differentiating into neurons, indicating that ZEB1 is required for neuronal differentiation. ZEB1 overexpression not only expedited neural differentiation and neuronal maturation, which ensured safer neural cell transplantation, but also facilitated the generation of excitatory cortical neurons, which were valuable for managing certain neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

https://openalex.org/W2896101019,"The pendulum test is a sensitive clinical assessment of spasticity where the lower leg is dropped from the horizontal position and features of limb motion are recorded. Three key kinematic features are associated with the degree of severity of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy: decreased initial limb excursion, reduced number of limb oscillations, and a non-vertical resting limb angle. While spasticity is attributed to increased velocity-dependent resistance to motion, prior models simulating increased sensorimotor feedback of muscle velocity fail to explain the key pendulum test kinematic outcomes in spastic individuals. Here we hypothesized that increased muscle tone, causing a transient increase in muscle force, i.e. short-range stiffness, could account for reduced first swing excursion and non-vertical resting limb angle. We further hypothesized that hyperreflexia modeled based on muscle fiber force, and not velocity, feedback would be necessary to reduce the number of oscillations because of its interaction with transiently increased muscle force due to short-range stiffness. We simulated the lower leg as a torque-driven single-link pendulum. Muscle tone was modeled as a constant baseline joint torque, short-range stiffness torque was dependent on the level of muscle tone, and delayed sensory feedback torque to simulate reflex activity was based on either muscle velocity or force. Muscle tone and transient short-range stiffness were necessary to simulate decreased initial swing excursion and non-vertical resting leg angle. Moreover, the reduction in the number of oscillations was best reproduced by simulating stretch reflex activity in terms of force, and not velocity, feedback. Varying only baseline muscle torque and reflex gain, we simulated a range of pendulum test kinematics observed across different levels of spasticity. Our model lends insight into physiological mechanisms of spasticity whose contributions can vary on an individual-specific basis, and potentially across different neurological disorders that manifest spasticity as a symptom."

https://openalex.org/W2897161194,"Assessing algal nutrient limitation is critical for understanding the interaction of primary production and nutrient cycling in streams, and nutrient diffusing substrate (NDS) experiments are often used to determine limiting nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Unexpectedly, many experiments have also shown decreased algal biomass on NDS P treatments compared to controls. To address whether inhibition of algal growth results from direct P toxicity, NDS preparation artifacts, or environmental covariates, we first quantified the frequency of nutrient inhibition in published experiments. We also conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether heterotrophic microbial competition or selective grazing could explain decreases in algal biomass with P additions. We then deployed field experiments to determine whether P-inhibition of algal growth could be explained by P toxicity, differences in phosphate cation (K vs. Na), differences in phosphate form (monobasic vs. dibasic), or production of H2O2 during NDS preparation. We found significant inhibition of algal growth in 12.9% of published NDS P experiments as compared to 4.7% and 3.6% of N and NP experiments. The meta-analysis linear models did not show enhanced heterotrophy on NDS P treatments or selective grazing of P-rich algae. Our field experiments did not show inhibition of autotrophic growth with P additions, but we found significantly lower gross primary productivity (GPP) and biomass-specific GPP of benthic algae on monobasic phosphate salts as compared to dibasic phosphate salts, likely because of reduced pH levels. Additionally, we note that past field experiments and meta-analyses support the plausibility of direct P toxicity or phosphate form (monobasic vs. dibasic) leading to inhibition of algal growth, particularly when other resources such as N or light are limiting. Given that multiple mechanisms may be acting simultaneously, we recommend practical, cost-effective steps to minimize the potential for P- inhibition of algal growth as an artifact of NDS experimental design."

VO2peak and VO2 at the first (VT1) and second (VT2) ventilatory thresholds were determined during an incremental maximal exercise test on a motorized treadmill.

Scaling exponents suggested linearity for all combinations between size descriptors and physiological variables, except between log-transformed values of VT1 and body mass (mL·kg-0.801·min, 95%CI: 0.649 to 0.952). Early maturing players attained greater values than players classified as “on-time” in skeletal maturity for the three ventilatory parameters expressed in absolute terms (d ranged from 0.65 to 0.71).

The results suggested significant variability between maturity groups when moving from VT1 to maximal metabolic conditions expressed by unit of stature (VT1: t = -2.413, p = 0.02, d = 0.60; VT2: t = -2.488, p = 0.02, d = 0.65; VO2peak: t = -2.475, p = 0.02, d = 0.65). Skeletal maturity status and associated variation in overall body size affects VT1, VT2 and VO2peak. The observed scaling of ventilatory outputs for body size may be related to the better running economy and smaller body size of average maturing athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2897201669,"Protected areas (PAs) are a prominent approach to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. A critical question for safeguarding these resources is how PA governance processes and management structures influence their effectiveness. We conduct an impact evaluation of 12 PAs in three Central American countries to assess how processes in management restrictions, management capacity, and decentralization affect the annual change in the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI varies with greenness that relates to plant production, biomass, and important ecosystem functions related to biodiversity and ecosystem services such as water quality and carbon storage. Any loss of vegetation cover in the form of deforestation or degradation would show up as a decrease in NDVI values over time and gains in vegetation cover and regeneration as an increase in NDVI values. Management restriction categories are based on international classifications of strict versus multiple-use PAs, and capacity and decentralization categories are based on key informant interviews of PA managers. We use matching to create a counterfactual of non-protected observations and a matching estimator and regression to estimate treatment effects of each sub-sample. On average, strict and multiple-use PAs have a significant and positive effect on NDVI compared to non-protected land uses. Both high and low decentralized PAs also positively affect NDVI. High capacity PAs have a positive and significant effect on NDVI, while low capacity PAs have a negative effect on NDVI. Our findings advance knowledge on how governance and management influence PA effectiveness and suggest that capacity may be more important than governance type or management restrictions in maintaining and enhancing NDVI. This paper also provides a guide for future studies to incorporate measures of PA governance and management into impact evaluations."

https://openalex.org/W2896634100,"Background Concurrent alcohol and medication use can result in significant problems especially in mid to later life. Alcohol is often used instead of medication for a number of health-related conditions. This novel qualitative study explored concurrent alcohol and medication use, as well as the use of alcohol for medicinal purposes, in a sample of individuals in mid to later life. Methods Twenty-four interviews (12 men/12 women, ages 51–90 years) and three focus groups (n = 27, 6 men/21 women, ages 50–95 years) from three branches of Age UK and two services for alcohol problems in North East England. Results Older people in this study often combined alcohol and medication, frequently without discussing this with their family doctor. However, being prescribed medication could act as a motivating factor to stop or reduce alcohol consumption. Participants also used alcohol to self-medicate, to numb pain, aid sleep or cope with stress and anxiety. Some participants used alcohol to deal with depression although alcohol was also reported as a cause of depression. Women in this study reported using alcohol to cope with mental health problems while men were more likely to describe reducing their alcohol consumption as a consequence of being prescribed medication. Conclusions As older people often combine alcohol and medication, health professionals such as family doctors, community nurses, and pharmacists should consider older patients’ alcohol consumption prior to prescribing or dispensing medication and should monitor subsequent drinking. In particular, older people should be informed of the dangers of concurrent alcohol and medication use."

A deeper understanding of factors contributing to their job satisfaction, in this context, may help improve quality and continuity of care. The purpose of this study was to identify variables associated with job satisfaction for 315 MH professionals in Quebec (Canada) after implementation of wide-ranging MH reforms. Job satisfaction was measured with the Job Satisfaction Survey. Independent variables were conceptualized within five domains: 1) Professional Characteristics, 2) Team Attributes, 3) Team Processes, 4) Team Emergent States, and 5) Organizational Culture. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Job satisfaction was significantly associated with absence of team conflict, stronger team support, better team collaboration, greater member involvement in the decision-making process (Team Processes), Affective commitment toward the team (Team Emergent States), as well as lack of a market/rational culture (Organizational Culture). Job satisfaction was strongly related to team processes and, to a lesser extent, team emergent states."
https://openalex.org/W2896054231,"Legionella spp. are the cause of a severe bacterial pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease (LD). In some cases, current genetic subtyping methods cannot resolve LD outbreaks caused by common, potentially endemic L. pneumophila (Lp) sequence types (ST), which complicates laboratory investigations and environmental source attribution. In the United States (US), ST1 is the most prevalent clinical and environmental Lp sequence type. In order to characterize the ST1 population, we sequenced 289 outbreak and non-outbreak associated clinical and environmental ST1 and ST1-variant Lp strains from the US and, together with international isolate sequences, explored their genetic and geographic diversity. The ST1 population was highly conserved at the nucleotide level; 98% of core nucleotide positions were invariant and environmental isolates unassociated with human disease (n = 99) contained ~65% more nucleotide diversity compared to clinical-sporadic (n = 139) or outbreak-associated (n = 28) ST1 subgroups. The accessory pangenome of environmental isolates was also ~30-60% larger than other subgroups and was enriched for transposition and conjugative transfer-associated elements. Up to ~10% of US ST1 genetic variation could be explained by geographic origin, but considerable genetic conservation existed among strains isolated from geographically distant states and from different decades. These findings provide new insight into the ST1 population structure and establish a foundation for interpreting genetic relationships among ST1 strains; these data may also inform future analyses for improved outbreak investigations."

Those that are best studied are the type II TA systems, in which both toxins and antitoxins are proteins. The HicAB system is one of the prototypic TA systems, found in many bacterial species. Complex interactions between the protein toxin (HicA), the protein antitoxin (HicB), and the DNA upstream of the encoding genes regulate the activity of this system, but few structural details are available about how HicA destabilizes the HicB–DNA complex. Here, we determined the X-ray structures of HicB and the HicAB complex to 1.8 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively, and characterized their DNA interactions. This revealed that HicB forms a tetramer and HicA and HicB form a heterooctameric complex that involves structural reorganization of the C-terminal (DNA-binding) region of HicB. Our observations indicated that HicA has a profound impact on binding of HicB to DNA sequences upstream of hicAB in a stoichiometric-dependent way. At low ratios of HicA:HicB, there was no effect on DNA binding, but at higher ratios, the affinity for DNA declined cooperatively, driving dissociation of the HicA:HicB:DNA complex.

https://openalex.org/W2896463477,"Determining the magnitude and causes of intrinsic variability is a main issue in the analysis of bivalve growth. Inter-individual variability in bivalve growth has been attributed to differences in the physiological performance. This hypothesis has been commonly tested comparing the physiological rates of fast and slow growers after size differentiation has occurred. This experimental design may detect a link between growth and physiological performance, but we cannot interpret the posterior physiological performance as a driver for the prior growth variability. Considering these limitations, this work introduces a new methodological framework for the analysis of bivalve growth variability. We have conducted sequential measurements of size and physiological performance (feeding, digestion and metabolic rates) in even-sized mussels growing under homogeneous environmental conditions. This experimental design allows us to distinguish between changes over time within individuals, i.e. growth and trends in the physiological rates, from differences between individuals with respect to a baseline level. In addition, Functional Data Analysis provides powerful tools to summarize all the information obtained in the exhaustive sampling scheme and to test whether differences in the physiological performance enhance growth dispersion. Our results report an increasing dispersion in both size and physiological performance over time. Although mussels grew during the experiment, it is difficult to detect any increasing or decreasing temporal pattern in their feeding, digestion and metabolic rates due to the large inter-individual variability. Comparison between the growth and physiological patterns of mussels with final size above (fast growers) and below (slow growers) the median found that fast growers had larger feeding and digestion rates and lower metabolic expenditures during the experimental culture than mussels with slow growth, which agrees with the hypothesis of a physiological basis for bivalve growth variability."

Here, we investigated whether peripheral blood expression of type 1 interferon (IFN)-inducible genes may be of use to stratify QFT-positive patients with uveitis into groups of high versus low risk of having active TB-associated uveitis. We recruited all new uveitis patients in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia for one year. We included 12 patients with uveitis and clinically diagnosed active pulmonary TB, 58 QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause, 10 newly diagnosed sputum-positive active pulmonary TB patients without uveitis and 23 QFT-negative healthy controls. Expression of 35 type 1 IFN-inducible genes was measured in peripheral blood cells from active pulmonary TB patients without uveitis and healthy controls. Differentially expressed genes were identified and used for further clustering analyses of the uveitis groups. A type-1 IFN gene signature score was calculated and the optimal cut-off value for this score to differentiate active pulmonary TB from healthy controls was determined and applied to QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause. Ten type 1 IFN-inducible genes were differentially expressed between active pulmonary TB and healthy controls. Expression of these 10 genes in QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause revealed three groups: 1); patients resembling active pulmonary TB, 2); patients resembling healthy controls, and 3); patients displaying an in-between gene expression pattern. A type 1 IFN gene signature score ≥5.61 displayed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (91%) for identification of active TB. Application of this score to QFT-positive patients with uveitis of unknown cause yielded two groups with expected different likelihood (high vs. low) of having active-TB uveitis, and therefore may be useful in clinical management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2896184743,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphisms are associated with reduced eNOS activity and nitric oxide (NO) production leading to an increase in blood pressure (BP). Regular exercise is the main strategy to minimize the deleterious effects of polymorphisms. However, due to the differences that physical exercise can be performed, some controversial results are found. Therefore it seems reasonable to evaluate the training status (TS). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association of eNOS gene haplotypes and different levels of TS on nitrite concentrations (NO2-) and BP values in older adult. 424 elderly performed the following assessments: General Functional Fitness Index (GFFI) to estimate TS, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), blood collection for analysis of NO2- and g.-786T>C, intron 4b/a (VNTR) and 894G>T polymorphisms. Multivariate logistic regression showed that NO2- was influenced by GFFI and 4b/4a Intron 4. Regarding BP, GFFI influenced SBP and DBP, and just intron 4 was associated with variations in DBP. It can be observed that GFFI affected the NO2-, SBP and DBP independently of haplotypes. Therefore, maintenance of good level of TS can overcome the negative influence of genetics factors (intron 4) by increasing NO2- concentration and decreasing BP values."

Transcription factors either bind directly to their target DNA or are tethered to it by other proteins. The transcription factor Sp2 serves as a paradigm for indirect genomic binding. It does not require its DNA-binding domain for genomic DNA binding and occupies target promoters independently of whether they contain a cognate DNA-binding motif. Hence, Sp2 is strikingly different from its closely related paralogs Sp1 and Sp3, but how Sp2 recognizes its targets is unknown. Here, we sought to gain more detailed insights into the genomic targeting mechanism of Sp2. ChIP-exo sequencing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed genomic binding of Sp2 to a composite motif where a recognition sequence for TALE homeoproteins and a recognition sequence for the trimeric histone-fold domain protein nuclear transcription factor Y (Nf-y) are separated by 11 bp. We identified a complex consisting of the TALE homeobox protein Prep1, its partner PBX homeobox 1 (Pbx1), and Nf-y as the major partners in Sp2–promoter interactions. We found that the Pbx1:Prep1 complex together with Nf-y recruits Sp2 to co-occupied regulatory elements. In turn, Sp2 potentiates binding of Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y. We also found that the Sp-box, a short sequence motif close to the Sp2 N terminus, is crucial for Sp2's cofactor function.

Transcription factors typically contain a DNA-binding domain, which mediates binding to specific DNA sequences in regulatory regions of genes in vivo. However, only a small fraction of DNA-binding motifs in the genome are occupied by the corresponding transcription factor raising the question of what determines binding. Chromatin accessibility and cooperative protein–protein–DNA interactions are generally believed to mediate context-specific binding (1Slattery M. Zhou T. Yang L. Dantas Machado A.C. Gordân R. Rohs R.

With the expansion of genome-wide transcription factor binding data, there is an increase in evidence that transcription factors occupy promoters and enhancers that lack the corresponding DNA-binding motifs.

Significantly, the most enriched motif in the Sp2-binding regions is not the GC box but the CCAAT motif, which is the recognition sequence for the trimeric histone-fold domain protein Nf-y. Our knockdown studies revealed that Nf-y is critical for recruitment of Sp2. We also provided a mechanistic insight into binding site selection of Sp2 in vivo; the glutamine-rich, positively charged N-terminal region of Sp2 is sufficient for recruitment of Sp2 to its target promoters, whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding domain is entirely dispensable (6Völkel S.

Here, we report DNA binding–independent genomic loading of Sp2 to a composite motif (DECAext motif), which is bound by the dimeric TALE transcription factor Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y. Binding of Pbx1:Prep1 is strongly reduced in Sp2ko cells indicating that Sp2 potentiates Pbx1:Prep1 binding at shared sites. Expression of Sp2 mutants in Sp2ko cells revealed that the zinc finger DNA-binding domain is dispensable, and the Sp-box is required for potentiating genomic binding of Pbx1:Prep1. Mutational analysis of selected Sp2 target promoters identified sequence constraints required for the formation of the Sp2–Pbx1:Prep1–Nf-y complex on DECAext motifs. Both, the Pbx1:Prep1 and the Nf-y binding motifs as well as their spacing of 11 nucleotides is required for loading of Sp2. Finally, biochemical analysis revealed that Sp2 interacts directly with DNA-bound Pbx1:Prep1–Nf-y through its most N-terminal domain. Together our results provide further mechanistic insight into the role of Sp2 as an important cofactor and clearly illustrate how the interplay of different transcription factors determines their genomic binding. To increase the resolution of Sp2 ChIP-seq peaks we mapped the genomic Sp2-binding sites in MEFs using the ChIP-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) technology (19Rhee H.S. Pugh B.F. Comprehensive genome-wide protein-DNA interactions detected at single-nucleotide resolution.Cell. 2011; 147 (22153082): 1408-141910.1016/j.cell.2011.11.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Stringent filtering of uniquely mapped reads (≥30 tags and ≥3-fold enrichment over the Sp2 knockout control) yielded >1000 high-confidence binding sites. The vast majority of the Sp2 ChIP-exo peaks (99%) overlapped with our previously published Sp2-binding sites (11Terrados G. Finkernagel F. Stielow B. Sadic D. Neubert J. Herdt O. Krause M. Scharfe M. Jarek M. Suske G. Genome-wide localization and expression profiling establish Sp2 as a sequence-specific transcription factor regulating vitally important genes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22684502): 7844-785710.1093/nar/gks544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Compared with the classical ChIP protocol, ChIP-exo resulted in sharper peak summits (Fig. 1C), which allowed us to map more precisely the Sp2-binding sites. A de novo sequence motif analysis (using the MEME Suite (20Bailey T.L. Boden M. Buske F.A. Frith M. Grant C.E. Clementi L. Ren J. Li W.W. Noble W.S.

Zambelli F. Pavesi G. Mantovani R.

Bruckmann C. Penkov D. Dardaei L. A tale of TALE, PREP1, PBX1, and MEIS1: interconnections and competition in cancer.BioEssays. 2017; 3910.1002/bies.20160024510.1002/bies.201600245Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the GC box (Sp1/Sp3-binding site) (8Suske G. The Sp-family of transcription factors.Gene. 1999; 238 (10570957): 291-30010.1016/S0378-1119(99)00357-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The GC box was not enriched at a particular position (not shown); and the CCAAT motif exhibited a symmetrical bimodal distribution (Fig. 1E), which is in line with our previous analysis of the Sp2-binding regions (6Völkel S. Stielow B. Finkernagel F. Stiewe T. Nist A. Suske G. Zinc finger independent genome-wide binding of Sp2 potentiates recruitment of histone-fold protein Nf-y distinguishing It from Sp1 and Sp3.PLOS Genet. 2015; 11 (25793500): e100510210.1371/journal.pgen.1005102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Significantly, the Pbx1:Prep1 recognition sequence was enriched exactly at the center of the Sp2 peaks (Fig. 1E). By adjusting the motif search to motif widths between 20 and 30 bp we found that the Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y recognition sequences were tightly linked to each other (Fig. 1F). In two-thirds (400 out 600) of the top Sp2-binding sites, the Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y recognition sequences were found to be separated by exactly 11 nucleotides (GANNGAC(N)11CCAAT; Fig. 1, F and G). Hence, a large fraction of the top Sp2-binding sites are characterized by a previously unrecognized composite motif containing recognition sequences for TALE factors and Nf-y. That a large fraction of the Sp2-binding sites is not only characterized by the presence of Nf-y-binding sites (CCAAT motifs) but also by a recognition motif of Pbx1:Prep1, prompted us to test whether Pbx1 and Prep1 were bound at these Sp2 target sites, and, if so, whether genomic binding of Pbx1, Prep1, Sp2, and Nf-y impinge on each other. We mapped genomic Pbx1 and Prep1-binding sites in WT MEFs by ChIP-seq. The vast majority of the Pbx1 peaks overlapped with Prep1 peaks (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the association of Pbx1 and Prep1 in a stable dimeric complex (23Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. Prep1, a novel functional partner of Pbx proteins.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (9482739): 1423-143310.1093/emboj/17.5.1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Longobardi E.

Dyn. 2014; 243 (23873833): 59-7510.1002/dvdy.24016Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There is also a markedly high fraction of 671 Prep1-specific peaks suggesting the existence of Pbx1-independent Prep1-binding sites. Alternatively, the absence of Pbx1 peaks at these sites could be due to a less efficient Pbx1 ChIP. Comparison of the Pbx1:Prep1-binding sites with high-confidence Sp2- and Nf-y-binding sites (6Völkel S. Stielow B. Finkernagel F. Stiewe T. Nist A. Suske G. Zinc finger independent genome-wide binding of Sp2 potentiates recruitment of histone-fold protein Nf-y distinguishing It from Sp1 and Sp3.PLOS Genet. 2015; 11 (25793500): e100510210.1371/journal.pgen.1005102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Terrados G.

A de novo sequence analysis of the shared Pbx1:Prep1–Sp2 binding regions essentially yielded the same sequence motifs as the Sp2 peaks with a high occurrence of the composite Pbx1:Prep1–Nf-y motif (Fig. 2D, left panel). Remarkably, a very similar motif, named DECAext, was reported in a previous ChIP-seq study of Pbx1- and Prep1-binding sites in E11.5 mouse embryos (25Penkov D. Mateos San Martin D. Fernandez-Díaz L.C. Rosselló C.A. Torroja C. Sánchez-Cabo F. Warnatz H.J. Sultan M. Yaspo M.L. Gabrieli A. Tkachuk V. Brendolan A. Blasi F. Torres M. Analysis of the DNA-binding profile and function of TALE homeoproteins reveals their specialization and specific interactions with Hox genes/proteins.Cell Rep. 2013; 3 (23602564): 1321-133310.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, we will refer to the composite Pbx1:Prep1–Nf-y motif from here on as the DECAext motif. Of note, sites that were bound by Pbx1:Prep1 but not by Sp2, contained also the GANNGAC motif but lacked the CCAAT motif (Fig. 2D, right panel). We determined whether there are specific functional features shared among promoters bound by Sp2 and Pbx1:Prep1. Genes co-bound by Sp2 and Pbx1:Prep1 were highly enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to transcriptional regulation. GO terms associated with genes bound by Sp2 but not by Pbx1:Prep1 were particularly associated with cell cycle, DNA repair, replication, and translation (Fig. 2E). This finding suggests that promoters, which are co-bound by Pbx1:Prep1 and Sp2, and promoters that are bound by Sp2 alone regulate distinct gene sets involved in different cellular processes. Colocalization of Sp2 and Pbx1:Prep1 at DECAext motifs led us to ask whether Pbx1:Prep1 is necessary for recruitment of Sp2 to these genomic sites. We simultaneously knocked down both isoforms of Pbx1 (Pbx1a and Pbx1b) and Prep1 by RNAi (Fig. 3A), and analyzed the binding of Pbx1, Prep1, Sp2, and Nf-yb to a panel of target promoters (Sp2, Osbp, Amd1, and Rplp0). Knockdown of Pbx1:Prep1 resulted in reduced binding of Sp2 and Nf-yb (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the protein levels of Sp2 and Nf-y were not affected upon knockdown of Pbx1 and Prep1 (Fig. 3A). This finding suggests that Pbx1:Prep1 is necessary for recruitment of Sp2. Reduced binding of Nf-yb upon Pbx1:Prep1 knockdown suggests that Pbx1:Prep1 may promote also binding of Nf-y to the adjacent CCAAT box within the DECAext motif. In parallel to the ChIP-seq analysis in WT MEFs, we performed ChIP-seq analysis of Pbx1 and Prep1 in Sp2ko MEFs and in Sp2ko MEFs expressing FLAG-tagged Sp2 (Sp2ko–FL–Sp2 cells). The expression levels of Pbx1 and Prep1 were similar in WT, Sp2ko, and FLAG–Sp2-expressing Sp2ko cells (Fig. 4A). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the interaction of Pbx1 with Prep1 was similar in WT and Sp2ko cells (Fig. S1). However, heat map and genome browser track views of the binding densities revealed that occupancy of Pbx1 and Prep1 at shared Pbx1:Prep1–Sp2–Nf-y sites was greatly reduced in Sp2ko cells, and was restored in Sp2ko MEFs expressing FLAG-tagged Sp2 (Fig. 4, B–D). Of note, consistent with what we observed earlier, binding of Nf-y was also reduced in Sp2ko MEFs at a subset of Sp2–Nf-y target regions (Fig. 4, B and D) (6Völkel S. Stielow B. Finkernagel F. Stiewe T. Nist A. Suske G. Zinc finger independent genome-wide binding of Sp2 potentiates recruitment of histone-fold protein Nf-y distinguishing It from Sp1 and Sp3.PLOS Genet. 2015; 11 (25793500): e100510210.1371/journal.pgen.1005102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reduced binding of Pbx1 and Prep1 in Sp2ko MEFs suggests that Sp2 potentiates binding of Pbx1:Prep1 at shared sites. To further substantiate this conclusion, we probed a panel of Pbx1:Prep1–Sp2 target promoters by conventional ChIP-qPCR using independent chromatin preparations. These experiments validated strongly reduced binding of Pbx1 and Prep1 in Sp2ko cells and almost WT levels of Pbx1 and Prep1 binding in Sp2ko cells expressing FLAG–Sp2 (Fig. 4E). Finally, we expressed tagged versions of Pbx1 and Prep1 (FLAG–Pbx1 and FLAG–Prep1) in WT MEFs and in Sp2ko MEFs, and subsequently analyzed binding to selected promoters (Sp2, Osbp, Amd1, and Rplp0). We observed significantly lower binding levels of FLAG–Pbx1 and FLAG–Prep1 in Sp2ko cells than in WT cells (Fig. S2). Together, these results show that Sp2 potentiates genomic binding of Pbx1:Prep1 at shared sites. The most striking feature of Sp2 is its capacity to bind its target promoters in the absence of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain as efficiently as full-length Sp2 (6Völkel S. Stielow B. Finkernagel F. Stiewe T. Nist A. Suske G. Zinc finger independent genome-wide binding of Sp2 potentiates recruitment of histone-fold protein Nf-y distinguishing It from Sp1 and Sp3.PLOS Genet. 2015; 11 (25793500): e100510210.1371/journal.pgen.1005102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test whether the zinc fingers are necessary to potentiate Pbx1:Prep1 binding, we examined binding of Pbx1 and Prep1 in Sp2ko cells expressing zinc finger-deficient Sp2 mutants (Fig. 5, A and B). Binding of Pbx1 and Prep1 was fully restored in Sp2ko cells expressing the Sp2(1–525) mutant lacking the zinc finger domain, and by the Sp2(1–506) mutant lacking in addition the Btd-box (Fig. 5C). Thus, both the Sp2 zinc finger domain as well as the Btd-box are dispensable for potentiation of Pbx1:Prep1 binding. We went on to identify domains of Sp2 that are necessary to potentiate Pbx1:Prep1 binding, and stably expressed a panel of additional C-terminal Sp2 deletion mutants in Sp2ko cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Attachment of a nuclear localization signal ensured nuclear localization of all Sp2 mutants (Fig. S3). The Sp2 deletion mutants Sp2(1–447), Sp2(1–375), and Sp2(1–300) bound to the selected target promoters ∼2–3-fold less efficiently. Concomitantly, WT levels of Pbx1:Prep1 binding were only partly restored (Fig. 5C). The Sp2(1–200) mutant still bound to the Sp2 target promoters albeit at an ∼10-fold reduced level than full-length Sp2. Despite low level binding of the Sp2(1–200) fragment, binding of Pbx1 and Prep1 to the Sp2, Osbp, and Amd1 promoters was still markedly increased compared with Sp2ko cells (compare “mock” with “1–200” in Fig. 5C). The N-terminal 200-amino acid Sp2 fragment contains the Sp-box, a hallmark of the Sp transcription factor family members, at position 33–46 (SPLALLAATCSKIG) (7Suske G. Bruford E. Philipsen S. Mammalian SP/KLF transcription factors: bring in the family.Genomics. 2005; 85 (15820306): 551-55610.1016/j.ygeno.2005.01.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Moreover, the most 94 N-terminal amino acids of Sp2 are required for binding of Sp2 in vivo (Fig. 5D) (6Völkel S. Stielow B. Finkernagel F. Stiewe T. Nist A. Suske G. Zinc finger independent genome-wide binding of Sp2 potentiates recruitment of histone-fold protein Nf-y distinguishing It from Sp1 and Sp3.PLOS Genet. 2015; 11 (25793500): e100510210.1371/journal.pgen.1005102Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test whether the Sp-box contributes to chromatin binding, we deleted the Sp-box in the context of full-length Sp2 (Sp2ΔSp-box) (Fig. 5, A and B). The Sp2ΔSp-box mutant bound to the selected target promoters ∼10-fold less efficiently. Importantly, the binding level of Pbx1:Prep1 at the Sp2 and Osbp promoters in Sp2ΔSp-box expressing cells was similar as in Sp2ko cells (Fig. 5D) suggesting an important function of the Sp-box in potentiating binding of the Pbx1:Prep1 complex. Together, we conclude that a large part of the capacity of Sp2 to potentiate genomic binding of Pbx1:Prep1 resides in the most N-terminal 200 amino acids. We sought to determine in detail the DNA sequence constraints, which are necessary for genomic loading of Sp2. We employed Flp-InTM NIH-3T3 cells, which contain a single Flp recombination target (FRT) site in their genome. We introduced several Sp2 target promoters (Amd1, Sp2, Pdia6, Rplp0, and Ptpn18) into the FRT site of Flp-InTM NIH-3T3 cells by homologous recombination (Fig. 6A and Fig. S4) and subsequently tested whether endogenous Sp2, Pbx1, Prep1, and Nf-y were bound to these transgenic promoters. These analyses revealed that Sp2, Pbx1, Prep1, and Nf-y were also bound to the transgenic promoters (Fig. 6B) demonstrating that Sp2 is recruited to its target promoters when present at different genomic loci. Thus, only the promoter sequence and not the exact genomic position determines genomic loading of Sp2. Next, we tested whether binding of Sp2 to the transgenic promoters is also mediated by its N-terminal region. We expressed FLAG-tagged full-length Sp2 (Sp2FL), the Sp2 mutant lacking the zinc fingers (Sp2(1–525) in Fig. 6C), or the Sp2 zinc finger domain on its own (Sp2(449–612)) in Flp-InTM NIH-3T3 cells carrying the transgenic Sp2 promoter. The Sp2(1–525) mutant but not the Sp2(449–612) mutant bound to the transgenic Sp2 promoter (Fig. 6C) suggesting that binding of Sp2 to the transgenic promoters is also independent of the zinc finger domain. To determine the sequence elements, which are required for genomic loading of Sp2, we analyzed the murine Amd1 promoter by mutagenesis. The Amd1 promoter contains a single DECAext element and a GC box, the prototypical Sp1-binding motif (Fig. 6D and Fig. S4). Sp2, Nf-yb, Pbx1, and Prep1 still bound to an Amd1 promoter mutant where the GC box is destroyed (GGGCGGG to GGTTTGG in the Amd1 M1 mutant) unambiguously demonstrating that genomic loading of Sp2 to the Am"

We conducted experiments in two fields in the Great Basin, USA, which differed in cultivation history and fertility. We tested the effects of different levels of functional diversity (planting grasses and shrubs together, vs. planting shrubs alone), seed source (cultivars, local or distant wild-collections), and irrigation regime (spring or fall and spring) on restoration outcomes. We sowed either: 1) grasses and shrubs in year one, 2) shrubs only, in year one, 3) grasses in year one with herbicide, shrubs in year two, or 4) shrubs alone in year two, after a year of herbicide. We irrigated for two years and monitored for three years. Shrub emergence was highest in the lower fertility field, where increasing functional diversity by seeding grasses had a neutral or facilitative effect on shrub emergence. In the higher fertility field, increasing functional diversity appeared to have a neutral to competitive effect. After declines in shrub densities after irrigation ceased, these effects did not persist. Grasses initially suppressed or had a neutral effect on weeds relative to an unseeded control, but had neutral or facilitative effects on weeds relative to shrub-only seeding. Initially, commercial grasses were either equivalent to or outperformed wild-collected grasses, but after irrigation ceased, commercial grasses were outperformed by wild-collected grasses in the higher fertility field. Local shrubs initially outperformed distant shrubs, but this effect did not persist. Fall and spring irrigation combined with local shrubs and wild-collected grasses was the most successful strategy in the higher fertility field, while in the lower fertility field, irrigation timing had fewer effects. Superior shrub emergence and higher grass persistence indicated that the use of wild and local seed sources is generally warranted, whereas the effects of functional diversity and irrigation regime were context-dependent. A bet-hedging approach that uses a variety of strategies may maximize the chances of restoration success."
https://openalex.org/W2896574543,"Mutations at position K171 in the kinase activation loop of Inhibitor of κB kinase beta (IKKβ) occur in multiple myeloma, spleen marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Previously, we demonstrated that these result in constitutive kinase activation and stimulate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). This work also identified K147 as a site of K63-linked regulatory ubiquitination required for activation of signaling pathways. We now present a more detailed analysis of ubiquitination sites together with a comprehensive examination of the signaling pathways activated by IKKβ K171E mutants. Downstream activation of STAT3 is dependent upon the activity of: UBE2N, the E2 ubiquitin ligase involved in K63-linked ubiquitination; TAK1 (MAP3K7), or TGFβ Activated Kinase, which forms a complex required for NFκB activation; JAK kinases, involved proximally in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors in response to inflammatory cytokines; and gp130, or IL-6 Receptor Subunit Beta which, upon binding IL-6 or other specific cytokines, undergoes homodimerization leading to activation of associated JAKs, resulting in STAT activation. We further demonstrate, using an IL-6-responsive cell line, that IKKβ K171E mutants stimulate the release of IL-6 activity into conditioned media. These results show that IKKβ K171E mutants trigger an autocrine loop in which IL-6 is secreted and binds to the IL-6 receptor complex gp130, resulting in JAK activation. Lastly, by examining the differential abundance of proteins associated with K63-only-ubiquitinated IKKβ K171E, proteomic analysis demonstrates the global activation of proliferative responses. As cancers harboring K171-mutated IKKβ are likely to also exhibit activated STAT3 and p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), this suggests the possibility of using MAPK (Erk1/2) and JAK inhibitors, or specific ubiquitination inhibitors. K63-linked ubiquitination occurs in other kinases at sites homologous to K147 in IKKβ, including K578 in BRAF V600E, which serves as an oncogenic driver in melanoma and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2896363734,"Adipose tissue, which is conserved in higher eukaryotes, plays central roles in controlling the body's energy balance, including excess energy storage and energy expenditure during starvation. In adipogenesis, intranuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a key molecule, and PPARγ agonists can promote adipogenesis. Many studies on the in vitro screening of PPARγ agonists with compounds derived from various materials have been reported; however, in vivo assays for quick examination of these feeding effects have not been established. In this study, we developed a technique using a lipophilic fluorescent reagent, Nile red to quantitatively estimate the adipose tissue volumes by using Japanese rice fish, medaka (Oryzias latipes) and studied effects of dietary soy sauce oil (SSO), which is a discarded by-product from Japanese traditional food and is known to have PPARγ-agonistic activity, on adipogenesis. We found that SSO feeding increased the adipose tissue volumes, and the expression levels of adipogenesis-related genes increased in these medaka larvae. These results suggest that SSO feeding increases the adipose tissue volumes through adipogenesis promotion by PPARγ-agonistic activity in medaka, and medaka is a powerful model for studying adipogenesis. Furthermore, our study also demonstrates the availability of SSO as a dietary additive for farmed fish."

I still wasn't convinced I was a great student (even though I was near the top of my class), and staying seemed like the safe option. It allowed me to remain close to friends, and I was familiar with the department, which put me in a good position to pick my supervisor wisely. A few years later, as I was considering a postdoc, I was tempted to once again stay close to home, in the comfort of my Ph.D. lab. My experience there had been very positive, and previous doctoral students had stayed on, so why shouldn't I? It would have been so easy. But I hope to run my own lab one day, and I knew that seeing a different approach to science would be valuable.

> “I knew that seeing a different approach to science would be valuable.” 

I heard about a fellowship program in Japan that sounded like a good fit. I had always been interested in Japan, and the flexibility of the program appealed to me. I could choose the institution where I would work, the research I would conduct, and how long I would be there—from as little as a month to as much as a year.

I decided that, if I were accepted, I would stay for 3 months—long enough to experience a new place, learn, and get some research done, but short enough to make the prospect less intimidating. I thought of it almost as a holiday, somewhat like going to a conference in an interesting far-off place.

But when I was accepted, the head of the group I was going to join wanted me to stay for the full year. I hesitated. I was excited about the research and the opportunity to learn and experience a new environment. But the thought of being so far from home for so long made me anxious. I didn't speak any Japanese. I wouldn't know anyone. Would I be miserable?

After much deliberation, I worked up my courage and signed on for the year—knowing that, if things went badly, I could come home earlier.

Almost everything was different from what I was used to. Even commuting to lab and shopping for groceries were so unfamiliar that I found myself constantly taking out my phone to snap pictures, like a tourist. In the lab, too, the practices and culture were new to me. The expected working hours were different. Lab technicians did much of the work that I was accustomed to doing myself. In group meetings, questions were restricted to the end, as opposed to the more open structure of my old lab. Many of my new colleagues were not native English speakers and came to me for language help, which was a new experience for me.

But getting used to these differences was easier than I had expected. One of my favorite new routines was going out to lunch with my labmates. Back in the United Kingdom, going out was too expensive, so I usually packed my lunch and ate it in my office. In Japan, on the other hand, eating out is common and offers a great bonding opportunity.

My new co-workers came from all over the world, primarily across Asia. My previous lab had also been international, but most of my colleagues there were from Europe and China. Talking with my new colleagues about their experiences conducting research and garnering funding in other countries and scientific cultures helped open my eyes to new ways of doing things.

After my fellowship, I thought I would leave Japan to do a postdoc elsewhere. But when my fellowship adviser offered me a longer-term position in his lab, I couldn't say no. This time, though, it wasn't because I was afraid to go somewhere new. It was because I wanted to take advantage of an exciting opportunity. After the leap I took with my fellowship, I now feel I can do anything.

We compared the 3-year in-operam (work in progress) period (i.e. 2003–2005, when all infrastructures needed for the organization were built) with the periods before (ante-operam) and after (post-operam): 2000–2002 and 2006–2008, respectively. In particular, we analyzed the concentrations of the primary pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, PM10) in Turin and Milan. In this way, we could use the measurements from Milan as a control dataset for comparison with the atmospheric pollution conditions in Turin. We found that infrastructural work for the Olympic Games in Turin affected NO2 and PM10 atmospheric concentrations, determining a peak in the average values during the in-operam period (probably due to caterpillar tractor emissions and excavation). This pattern did not emerge from the Milan data, where a decreasing trend can be seen between the ante-operam and the post-operam periods. On the other hand, a negative effect on CO levels was not observed: the decreasing trend, more evident in Turin compared to Milan, can be linked to the expansion during the same period of limited traffic areas created to facilitate the infrastructural work."
