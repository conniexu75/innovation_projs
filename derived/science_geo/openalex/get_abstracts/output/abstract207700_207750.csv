https://openalex.org/W2095149452,"THE structure of the vitamin B12 coenzyme1 has been determined recently by X-ray crystallography2. It seemed possible (cf. ref. 3) that a synthesis of this compound, which contains a 5′-deoxyadenosyl group attached direct to the cobalt atom by a cobalt–carbon bond, could be achieved from reduced hydroxocobalamin and a suitably 5′-substituted adenosine derivative. 5′-Tosyladenosine is known4 to cyclize easily to the tosylate of cycloadenosine but the 5′-tosyl-2′,3′-isopropylidene derivative of adenosine can be prepared without difficulty4. Hydroxocobalamin was reduced in aqueous or ethanolic solution with sodium borohydride and reacted with this adenosine derivative. A product which had the properties expected of an isopropylidene derivative of the coenzyme was isolated from the reaction mixture in poor to moderate yield. Following a suggestion from Dr. V. M. Clark, whom we thank for his interest, we then attempted to reduce the cobalamin not just to the brown vitamin B12r (ref. 5), believed to be a cobalt II derivative, but to the grey-green compound containing cobalt in a lower oxidation state6. This compound can be prepared under anaerobic conditions from hydroxocobalamin with sodium borohydride, chromous acetate in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid buffer at pH. 9.5, or with zinc dust and dilute acetic acid. Under acid or alkaline conditions it reacts rapidly with a range of alkylating agents to give good yields of coenzyme analogues. In contrast, vitamin B12r, the exclusive product obtained from hydroxocobalamin and chromous acetate at pH 5, is quite unreactive."

This information can be applied to structure determination of Nε peptides of lysine."

Virus was seen and quantitated in all the samples taken from five vesicles. Specimens from human lesions can be prepared and examined within 3 hours, permitting rapid presumptive identification of herpesvirus."

It has been recommended1 that the time or gas volume between the injection point and the emergence of the air peak should be taken as the gas hold-up. Moreover, when using detectors which do not respond to atmospheric gases the use of methane has been suggested2."

https://openalex.org/W2031118538,"THE sympathetic ganglion cells in the cat are heterogeneous with respect to acetylcholinesterase (AcChE) activity when stained histochemically with the thiocholine method1,2. Only a limited number possess high AcChE activity (heavy staining) comparable with that of anterior horn cells and other accepted cholinergic cells. The majority of the sympathetic ganglion cells show very faint or no activity. Some cells are intermediate with respect to staining intensity. There has been recent discussion whether the outstandingly ‘AcChE-rich’ cells are correlated to a peripheral cholinergic function1–3; but definite proof for such a hypothesis has been lacking until now. In an earlier paper2 it was shown that the stellate ganglion is especially rich in cells with high AcChE-activity compared with the superior cervical ganglion and the prevertebral ganglia. This communication explains that finding."

In 7 of these, re-examined after several months, the abnormal hæmoglobin had disappeared. In 4 babies, aged from 5 to 10 months, an evident microcythæmic (or thalassæmia) hæmatological picture appeared; in three others, still very young, the hæmatological characters were still uncertain with regard to microcythæmia (or thalassæmia). Examination of the parents, carried out in 8 families, has revealed, in all, the absence of abnormal hæmoglobins; however, in 7 families, one of the two parents showed the hæmatological characters, either pronounced or slight, of microcythæmia; only in one family were the hæmatological characters normal, with the exception of very slight erythrocytic morphological alterations in the mother. In our previous communication, we had observed this family only and another one, in which the mother showed rather slight deviations and therefore, we thought that we could exclude the existence of any relationship between hæmoglobin Bart's and micro-cythæmia however, it must now be that such a relationship exists."

Among these oxalic acid plays an important part. In 2 per cent and 1 per cent dilutions it is applied as a stabilizer of synthetic ascorbic acid in various solutions and of ascorbic acid in biological material."

A significant and substantial effect upon equation was demonstrated."
