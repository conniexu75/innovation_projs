https://openalex.org/W1563804626,"Spring temperatures in temperate regions have increased over the past 20 years, and many organisms have responded to this increase by advancing the date of their growth and reproduction. Here we show that adaptation to climate change in a long-distance migrant is constrained by the timing of its migratory journey. For long-distance migrants climate change may advance the phenology of their breeding areas, but the timing of some species' spring migration relies on endogenous rhythms that are not affected by climate change. Thus, the spring migration of these species will not advance even though they need to arrive earlier on their breeding grounds to breed at the appropriate time. We show that the migratory pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca has advanced its laying date over the past 20 years. This temporal shift has been insufficient, however, as indicated by increased selection for earlier breeding over the same period. The shift is hampered by its spring arrival date, which has not advanced. Some of the numerous long-distance migrants will suffer from climate change, because either their migration strategy is unaffected by climate change, or the climate in breeding and wintering areas are changing at different speeds, preventing adequate adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W1593322865,"Speciation is facilitated if ecological adaptation directly causes assortative mating, but few natural examples are known. Here we show that a shift in colour pattern mimicry was crucial in the origin of two butterfly species. The sister species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno recently diverged to mimic different model taxa, and our experiments show that their mimetic coloration is also important in choosing mates. Assortative mating between the sister species means that hybridization is rare in nature, and the few hybrids that are produced are non-mimetic, poorly adapted intermediates. Thus, the mimetic shift has caused both pre-mating and post-mating isolation. In addition, individuals from a population of H. melpomene allopatric to H. cydno court and mate with H. cydno more readily than those from a sympatric population. This suggests that assortative mating has been enhanced in sympatry."

https://openalex.org/W1592718458,"Abstract Volatiles, most notably CO 2 , are recycled back into the Earth's interior at subduction zones 1,2 . The amount of CO 2 emitted from arc volcanism appears to be less than that subducted, which implies that a significant amount of CO 2 either is released before reaching the depth at which arc magmas are generated or is subducted to deeper depths. Few high-pressure experimental studies 3,4,5 have addressed this problem and therefore metamorphic decarbonation in subduction zones remains largely unquantified, despite its importance to arc magmatism, palaeoatmospheric CO 2 concentrations and the global carbon cycle 6 . Here we present computed phase equilibria to quantify the evolution of CO 2 and H 2 O through the subduction-zone metamorphism of carbonate-bearing marine sediments (which are considered to be a major source for CO 2 released by arc volcanoes 6 ). Our analysis indicates that siliceous limestones undergo negligible devolatilization under subduction-zone conditions. Along high-temperature geotherms clay-rich marls completely devolatilize before reaching the depths at which arc magmatism is generated, but along low-temperature geotherms, they undergo virtually no devolatilization. And from 80 to 180 km depth, little devolatilization occurs for all carbonate-bearing marine sediments. Infiltration of H 2 O-rich fluids therefore seems essential to promote subarc decarbonation of most marine sediments. In the absence of such infiltration, volatiles retained within marine sediments may explain the apparent discrepancy between subducted and volcanic volatile fluxes and represent a mechanism for return of carbon to the Earth's mantle."
https://openalex.org/W1636667730,Biogeochemical cycles are shaped by events that follow soil drying and rewetting. Here we show that the process of drying and rapidly rewetting soil increases the amount of water-soluble phosphorus present and that this is predominantly in organic form after having been released from the soil microbial biomass. This effect could not only significantly affect phosphorus pollution of waterbodies but might also corrupt results from analyses involving water extraction of dried soils.

https://openalex.org/W1969855284,"Epithelial gene expression in the lung is thought to be regulated by the coordinate activity of several different families of transcription factors including the Fox family of winged-helix/forkhead DNA-binding proteins. In this report, we have identified and characterized two members of this Fox gene family, Foxp1 and Foxp2, and show that they comprise a new subfamily of Fox genes expressed in the lung. Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at high levels in the lung as early as E12.5 of mouse development with Foxp2 expression restricted to the airway epithelium. In addition, Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at lower levels in neural, intestinal, and cardiovascular tissues during development. Upon differentiation of the airway epithelium along the proximal-distal axis, Foxp2 expression becomes restricted to the distal alveolar epithelium whereas Foxp1 expression is observed in the distal epithelium and mesenchyme. Foxp1 and Foxp2 can regulate epithelial lung gene transcription as was demonstrated by their ability to dramatically repress the mouse CC10 promoter and, to a lesser extent, the human surfactant protein C promoter. In addition, GAL4 fusion proteins encoding subdomains of Foxp1 and Foxp2 demonstrate that an independent and homologous transcriptional repression domain lies within the N-terminal end of the proteins.

Further development through a process termed branching morphogenesis results in a primitive epithelial lined tubular structure by E12.5. Additional differentiation of this primitive epithelial lining along the proximal-distal axis during the pseudoglandular stage of development results in highly differentiated airway epithelial cells capable of surfactant protein expression and gas exchange essential for postnatal lung function. The molecular mechanisms regulating the process of branching morphogenesis and proximal-distal patterning of the lung epithelium are poorly understood. However, recent reports have indicated that lung-specific gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1Warburton D. Schwarz M. Tefft D. Flores-Delgado G.

Several transcription factors have been implicated in this transcriptional program including the homeodomain protein Nkx2.1/TTF-1, the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA-6, and members of the winged-helix/forkhead (Fox) family of transcription factors (3Ray M.K.

The Fox family of transcription factors is a large group of proteins that share a common DNA binding domain termed a winged-helix or forkhead domain after the founding member of this group, theforkhead gene in Drosophila (for review see Ref.11Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Several Fox genes are expressed in the lung and have been implicated as important regulators of lung gene transcription including Foxa1, Foxa2, Foxf1, Foxf2, and Foxj1. These Fox family members are expressed in a variety of different lung cell lineages including ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract (Foxj1), lung mesenchyme (Foxf1 and Foxf2), and airway epithelium (Foxa1 and Foxa2) (12Aitola M.

Several of these Fox genes have been shown to regulate multiple lung-specific promoters including the human surfactant protein B (SP-B)1 promoter, the mouse and rat CC10 promoters, and the Nkx2.1/TTF-1 promoter (4Sawaya P.L.

In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of two cDNAs encoding Foxp1 and Foxp2 that define a new subfamily of winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain transcription factors. We show that both Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at high levels in embryonic and adult mouse lung with Foxp2 expression in the lung restricted to the distal epithelium. In addition, Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed in defined neural, intestinal, and cardiovascular cell types during embryogenesis. Both Foxp1 and Foxp2 contain a divergent winged-helix domain that is significantly different from that of other Fox transcription factors expressed in the lung. Foxp1 and Foxp2 share a high level of protein similarity within the winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain and in regions N- and C-terminal to this domain. Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed as at least three different mRNA messages. We show that Foxp1 and Foxp2 act as transcriptional repressors that are able to repress the mouse CC10 and human SP-C promoters to differing degrees. Moreover, we show that Foxp1 and Foxp2 contain an independent and homologous transcriptional repression domain that contains a novel zinc-finger motif that is located N-terminal to the winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain. Together, these data suggest that the Foxp1 and Foxp2 subfamily of transcriptional regulators plays an important role in spatially restricting the expression of certain target genes such as CC10 in the lung and, in turn, regulates the proximal versus distal epithelial cell differentiation process in mid to late lung development. An adult mouse lung cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with a cDNA probe corresponding to the forkhead DNA binding domain of the mouse hepatic nuclear factor-3β (Foxa2) cDNA (bp 590–875; GenBankTM accession number X74937) under low stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 37 °C). Of the 32 clones obtained, all but 5 corresponded to known forkhead DNA-binding proteins. Of these 5 clones, 4 corresponded to Foxp1 and 1 to Foxp2. To obtain full-length Foxp1 and Foxp2 cDNAs, the same lung cDNA library was rescreened with the 5′ ends of the partial cDNAs derived from the low stringency screen. Several clones for both Foxp1 and Foxp2 were obtained from these additional screens. Multiple cDNA clones for Foxp1 and Foxp2 were sequenced in both sense and antisense directions. The full-length open reading frames of Foxp1 and Foxp2 were cloned into the pCMVTag2B vector (Stratagene) at the EcoRI and XhoI sites to produce the pCMV/Foxp1 and pCMV/Foxp2 constructs. 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed on 2 µg of poly(A)+ lung RNA using a commercially available kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the following nested primers for Foxp1 and Foxp2: Foxp1 5′ RACE, 5′-CTGGATGGCTGATCCGTTAC-3′; Foxp1 5′ RACE-nested, 5′-GTCTCAGACCCAGATTCTTG-3′; Foxp1 3′ RACE, 5′-CCATGACAGAGATTACGAAGACG-3′; Foxp1 3′ RACE-nested, 5′-CCAGTAAATGAGGACATGGAG-3′; Foxp2 5′ RACE, 5′-CATTTTGATTCATTGAACTGTTGC-3′; Foxp2 5′ RACE-nested, 5′-GTCTCTGTCACAGATTCCTG-3′; Foxp2 3′ RACE, 5′-GTTAGAAGATGACAGAGAGATTGAG-3′; Foxp2 3′ RACE-nested, 5′-GAGCCTTTATCTGAGGACCTGG-3′. Northern blot analysis of adult tissue total RNA was performed essentially as described (18Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 µg of total RNA from the indicated tissues was resolved on a 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted to a Hybond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled probes for Foxp1 (encoding aa 597–705 of isoform A representing the 3′ coding region called probe A) and Foxp2 (encoding aa 629–714 representing the 3′ coding region).In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described using 35S-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes corresponding to the same cDNA sequence as the Northern probes (19Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Alternative spliced region-specific riboprobes and Northern blot probes representing the spliced isoforms of Foxp1 were generated by PCR that correspond to the unique 5′ untranslated region of isoform C (probe B; bp 56–459; GenBankTM accession number AF339105) and the C-terminal region of the winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain (probe C; encoding aa 539–602 of isoform A). The pGL2/SP-C construct was generated by ligating the 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter (20Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) into the HindIII site of pGL2basic (Promega). The pGL2/CC10 construct was generated by PCR amplifying the −804-bp mouse CC10 promoter from mouse genomic DNA using the following primers: sense, 5′-CCGTACCGGTAAGGCCTGGGAATGGCTAAC-3′; antisense, 5′-CCCTCGAGGGGTATGTGTGGGTGTGTGGC-3′; and cloning the resulting DNA fragment into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pGL2basic. NIH-3T3 and H441 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. MLE-15 cells were cultured as described previously (21Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). MLE-15 cells were transfected with 0.5 µg of the pGL2/SP-C vector, 2.5 µg of pCMV/Foxp1 or Foxp2 expression vectors, and 0.5 µg of the pMSVβgal control vector using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). H441 cells were transfected with 2.5 µg of pGL2/CC10, 12.5 µg of pCMV/Foxp1 or pCMV/Foxp2, and 1 µg of pMSVβgal, along with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using commercially available kits (Promega). The β-galactosidase values were used to normalize for transfection efficiency. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and data shown are mean ± S.E. To identify putative repression domains in Foxp1 and Foxp2, a series of expression plasmids containing GAL4/Foxp1 or GAL4/Foxp2 chimeric proteins were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pGAL4 vector, which contains the 147-amino acid GAL4 DNA binding domain (22Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, the pGAL4/P1aa1–250, pGAL4/P1aa251–490, pGAL4/P1aa491–602, and pGAL4/P1aa603–705 represent subdomains of the Foxp1 protein whereas pGAL4/P2aa1–259, pGAL4/P2aa260–500, pGAL4/P2aa501–613, and pGAL4/P2aa614–714 represent subdomains of Foxp2 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with 0.5 µg of the pGAL4SV40.luc reporter vector, which contains four copies of the GAL4 DNA binding sequence upstream of the highly active SV40 viral promoter (23Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), 2.5 µgs of the pGAL4 expression construct, and 0.5 µg of the pMSVβgal reference plasmid using Fugene 6. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described above. To screen for new Fox family members in the mouse lung, low-stringency hybribization utilizing the Foxa2 forkhead DNA binding domain was performed on a mouse lung cDNA library. 32 different clones were isolated and sequenced. All except five corresponded to previously described winged-helix/forkhead genes including Foxa1, Foxa2, Foxf1, Foxf2, and Foxj1 (data not shown). The other five cDNA clones represented two distinct but highly related cDNAs. Four cDNA clones were identical to the previously described partial Foxp1 cDNA whereas the other clone belonged to a related but distinct gene now designated Foxp2. Analysis of the 5′ ends of the Foxp1 and Foxp2 cDNAs revealed that none of the cDNAs contained a consensus initiation codon suggesting that they were not full-length. Therefore, the lung cDNA library was rescreened with the 5′-most regions of the Foxp1 and Foxp2 cDNAs, and several additional cDNAs for both genes were obtained that contained consensus initiation codons. In addition, 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to isolate additional sequences in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. A combination of cDNA library screening and 5′ and 3′ RACE revealed three distinct types of Foxp1 cDNAs, with the longest, encoding an open reading frame of 705 amino acids, which contains a glutamine-rich region (aa 55–230), a putative zinc-finger domain (aa 336–359), and a winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain (aa 485–573) (Fig. 1 A). The longest Foxp2 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 714 amino acids that also had a glutamine-rich region (aa 102–230), a putative zinc-finger domain (aa 347–370), and a winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain at the C terminus (aa 495–583) (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of the protein sequences of Foxp1 and Foxp2 demonstrated 62% amino acid identity between the two proteins with the highest level of identity located in the conserved winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 A). As stated above, three distinct types of Foxp1 cDNA clones were identified (Fig. 1 B). The Foxp1A cDNAs contained an open reading frame of 705 amino acids with the long glutamine-rich (Q-rich) region at the N-terminal end (Fig. 1 B, A). Of note, glutamine-rich regions such as these have been implicated as transcriptional activation/repression domains in other transcription factors (24Gerber H.P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Hofferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 25Xiao H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

Hanna-Rose W. Reddy J.C. English M.A. Ro M. Grossel M. Shaknovich R. Hansen U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4057-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Foxp1B cDNAs contained the glutamine-rich region but lacked the C-terminal portion of the winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding domain between aa 539 and 602 (Fig. 1 B,B). Finally, Foxp1C cDNAs contained an alternative but longer 5′ untranslated region and alternative initiation codon resulting in an N-terminally truncated Foxp1 protein (Fig. 1,B and C). Of note, reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of adult lung cDNA confirms the expression of the three different Foxp1 isoforms (data not shown). Interestingly, all of the Foxp2 cDNA clones isolated from the lung library corresponded to the structure of Foxp1A. To determine how similar Foxp1 and Foxp2 were to other Fox genes expressed in the lung, an alignment of the proteins sequences containing the forkhead/winged-helix DNA binding domains of Foxp1 and Foxp2 was performed to those of Foxa2, Foxf1, and Foxj1 (Fig.2 A). This analysis shows that although Foxp1 and Foxp2 are similar to other Fox genes expressed in the lung, they comprise a distinct subfamily of Fox transcription factors as judged by their amino acid sequence. To determine whether Foxp1 and Foxp2 were conserved through evolution, we performed a computer-assisted search of the Drosophila melanogaster genomic data base for possible orthologues. This search revealed a single orthologue (GenBankTMaccession number AE003684), which contains a highly related forkhead DNA binding domain (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that Foxp1 and Foxp2 comprise an ancient subfamily of winged-helix/forkhead DNA binding transcription factors. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the complexity and pattern of expression of Foxp1 and Foxp2 in adult mouse tissues. The Foxp1 3′ coding region cDNA probe (Fig. 1 B, probe A) hybridized to three different transcripts of ∼7.5, 3.0, and 1.8 kb (Fig. 3 A, arrows). The highest level of expression was observed in the lung, brain, and spleen with lower expression observed in other tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, small intestine, and liver. All three messages were expressed in similar proportion in all tissues with the exception of heart and brain, which appeared to contain lower levels of the 1.8-kb transcript and higher levels of the 7.5-kb transcript, respectively. A probe specific for the Foxp1C isoform Fig.1 B, probe B) hybridized to the same three transcripts in all Foxp1-expressing tissues except small intestine (Fig. 3 B). However, decreased hybridization to the 1.8-kb transcript was observed with this probe whereas an increase in the intensity of the 7.5-kb band was observed with liver RNA (Fig.3 B). These data show that the Foxp1C isoform is expressed in all Foxp1-expressing adult tissues except the small intestine. In addition, probe A, B, and a probe encompassing the C-terminal portion of the winged-helix/forkhead domain, which is deleted in Foxp1B (Fig.1 B, probe C), did not exhibit differential hybridization patterns during embryonic development when analyzed byin situ hybridization analysis (data not shown). Of note, only probe B is specific for a single isolated Foxp1 isoform (Foxp1C) whereas probes A and C can hybridize to at least two Foxp1 isoforms. Hybridization of the same Northern blot with a probe derived from the 3′ coding region of the Foxp2 cDNA demonstrated that the Foxp2 gene is expressed as three transcripts of ∼9.0, 3.5, and 2.0 kb (Fig.3 C). As with Foxp1, the highest level of Foxp2 mRNA expression was observed in the lung with lower expression levels observed in spleen, small intestine, skeletal muscle, brain, and kidney. Kidney and small intestine appeared to express lower levels of the 9.0-kb transcript, whereas brain expressed higher levels of this Foxp2 transcript. The original Foxp1A, B, and C cDNAs isolated from the lung cDNA library were 2.2, 2.0, and 2.0 kb in size, respectively, and they all contained an identical 38-base pair 3′ untranslated sequence (data not shown). Addition of 5′ and 3′ sequences isolated using RACE procedures increased the overall size of the known Foxp1A, B, and C transcripts to 3.0, 2.8, and 2.8 kb (data not shown). The data obtained with both probe A and probe B suggests that these transcripts correlate in size to the 3.0-kb band observed on the adult tissue Northern blot (Fig. 3). The longer 7.5-kb band observed with these probes is likely because of an alternative polyadenylation site. It is also likely that the ∼1.8-kb band on the Northern blot corresponds to the same Foxp1A, B, and C coding regions described above but with the much shorter 38-base pair 3′ untranslated sequence that was present in all of the Foxp1 cDNAs isolated in the cDNA library screen. Thus, the similarity in size of the different Foxp1 isoforms may preclude the identification of differential hybridization in Northern blot analysis using probes A and B. The genomic locus for Foxp1 is highly complex and consists of at least nine exons extending over more than 150 kilobases. 2W. Shu and E. E. Morrisey, unpublished observations. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of lung cDNA and comparison to the deduced genomic structure of Foxp1 reveal that the sequences deleted in Foxp1B correspond to the loss of two exons in the Foxp1 transcript whereas the alternate 5′ untranslated region and translational start site for Foxp1C are the result of a splicing event 27 base pairs upstream of the initiating new start codon in Foxp1C.2 Taken together, these data suggest that Foxp1 is spliced in a complex manner and that full characterization of the Foxp1 genomic locus may be required to resolve the complex transcript pattern of Foxp1. To characterize the expression pattern of Foxp1 and Foxp2 during embryonic development, in situ hybridization was performed on staged mouse embryos at days E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 using radiolabeled riboprobes derived from the Foxp1 or Foxp2 cDNA sequences, respectively. During gestation in the mouse, the highest levels of Foxp1 and Foxp2 expression are observed in the developing lung. Additional sites of expression include neural, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular tissues. In the lung, Foxp1 and Foxp2 are both expressed in the airway epithelium starting at E12.5 (Fig.4, A and D,arrowheads). Expression of Foxp1 in the lung continues through E16.5 both in the epithelium and in the surrounding mesenchyme (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, Foxp2 expression is restricted to the airway epithelium from E12.5 through E16.5 (Fig.4, D–F). Coincident with the differentiation of the pulmonary epithelium along the proximal-distal axis, which produces distinct epithelial cell lineages capable of gas exchange and surfactant protein expression, Foxp2 expression becomes restricted to the distal alveolar epithelium and is no longer expressed in the proximal airways (Fig. 4 F, arrowhead). Of note, this pattern of expression is similar to the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA-6 and of surfactant proteins A and C (14Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Fox gene that is expressed exclusively within the distal epithelium of the lung during pulmonary development. Together, these data suggest that Foxp1 and/or Foxp2 may regulate lung epithelial-specific gene transcription, particularly in the distal epithelium, during embryonic development. Expression of Foxp1 and Foxp2 is also observed within the developing nervous system. In the spinal cord at E12.5, Foxp1 expression is observed in the developing motor neurons in a pattern reminiscent of Hoxa-2 and islet-1 (Fig. 5 A,yellow arrowhead) (29Hao Z. Yeung J. Wolf L. Doucette R. Nazarali A. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Ericson J. Thor S. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Yamada T.

Foxp1 and Foxp2 are also expressed in a subset of interneurons dorsal to the motor neurons in a pattern similar to that of the engrailed-1 transcription factor (Fig.5, A and C, red arrowhead) (32Matise M.P. Joyner A.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7805-7816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At E16.5, expression of Foxp1 and Foxp2 in the brain is observed in the neopallial cortex where the future cerebral cortex develops. Foxp1 is expressed in the outer cortical plate (Fig. 5 B, black arrow) whereas Foxp2 expression is observed in the inner intermediate zone of the neopallial cortex (Fig. 5 D,white arrow). Foxp1 and Foxp2 expression is also observed in the developing cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 5, B andD, asterisk). In the gastrointestinal system, Foxp1 is expressed in the mesodermal layer (Fig.6, A and B,white arrowhead), as well as the epithelial layer of the developing intestine (Fig. 6, A and B,yellow arrowhead). Foxp2 expression is observed in the outer mesodermal layer but is absent form the developing epithelium of the intestine (Fig. 6, C and D). Although Foxp1 is expressed in the adult heart (Fig. 3 A), only Foxp2 was expressed in the developing cardiovascular system during embryogenesis. At E14.5, expression of Foxp2 is observed in the outflow tract region of the developing heart (Fig.7 A). By E16.5, Foxp2 expression is observed in the outflow tract and the atrium of the heart but not the ventricles (Fig. 7 B, bracket). These data suggest that Foxp1 and Foxp2 may play important roles in developing neural, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular tissues.Figure 6Foxp1 and Foxp2 expression in the developing intestine. Radioactive in situ hybridization was performed on E12.5 (A and C) and E16.5 (B and D) mouse embryos using gene-specific riboprobes for Foxp1 (A and B) and Foxp2 (C and D). Specific expression for Foxp1 is observed in the outer mesodermal layer (A and B,white arrowhead) and the inner epithelium (A andB, yellow arrowhead) of the developing intestine.

In the present study, we have analyzed the oligomeric state of VR1. Co-immunoprecipitation of differently tagged VR1 molecules indicated that VR1 can form oligomers. Using two different heterologous VR1 expression systems as well as endogenous VR1 expressed in dorsal root ganglion cells, we analyzed oligomer formation using perfluoro-octanoic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results were confirmed both with chemical cross-linking agents as well as through endogenous cross-linking mediated by transglutaminase. Our results clearly show that VR1 forms multimers in each of the expression systems with a homotetramer as a predominant form. The oligomeric structure of VR1 may contribute to the complexity of VR1 pharmacology. Finally, differences in glycosylation between the systems were observed, indicating the need for caution in the use of the heterologous expression systems for analysis of VR1 properties.

Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in hot peppers, and structurally related vanilloids such as the ultrapotent irritant resiniferatoxin (RTX)1 bind to specific receptors on nociceptors (1Szolcsanyi J.

Prolonged or repeated exposure to capsaicin leads to pronounced tachyphylaxis and desensitization, in which nociceptors become insensitive to capsaicin and to other noxious stimuli. This phenomenon underlies the seemingly paradoxical use of capsaicin as an analgesic agent in the treatment of various painful disorders (4Szolcsanyi J. Anton F. Reeh P.W. Handwerker H.O.

Both when expressed endogenously in cultured dorsal root ganglion cells or when expressed heterologously in transfected human cells or frog oocytes, VR1 can be activated by vanilloids and by noxious heat (>43 °C) and can be activated or potentiated by protons (extracellular pH <6) (6Caterina M.J.

Elde R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 10Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Prinjha R. Harries M.H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Br. J.

It is a nonselective cation channel with high Ca2+ permeability and belongs to the superfamily of cation channels with six transmembrane segments including the Shaker-related voltage-gated K+ channels, the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels, the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels, the polycystin channels and the transient receptor potential (Trp) family of ion channels. These proteins all contain six transmembrane domains, a pore-forming loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains, and cytoplasmic C- and N-terminal domains (6Caterina M.J.

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Within this superfamily, VR1 is most closely related to the Trp family of ion channels. These channels include DrosophilaTrp and TrpL, which play crucial roles in phototransduction, and the mammalian homologues TrpC1–7, which are candidates for store-operated calcium channels. Understanding of the function, gating, regulation and quaternary structure of Trp family members is emerging rapidly. TheDrosophila Trp and TrpL have been shown to form heteromultimeric channels associated in a signaling complex with a receptor (rhodopsin), an effector (phospholipase C), regulators (protein kinase C and calmodulin), and the scaffolding protein INAD (12Xu X.-Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similarly, hTrp1 is localized in a caveolin-scaffolding lipid raft domain in plasma membrane, where it interacts directly or indirectly with a complex of Ca2+ signaling proteins such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and Gαq/11 (13Lockwick T.P.

Trp3 and Trp1 form hetero-oligomers with nonselective cation permeability (14Xu X.-Z.S. Li H.-S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldstezer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol.

Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schrots G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Florckerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23965-23972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, their actual subunit organization has not been determined. More distant members of the superfamily, e.g. voltage-gated K+ channels or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, are known to form tetramers of the same or different subunits (17Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The first direct experiments evaluating the quaternary structure of VR1 were performed by Szallasi and Blumberg (18Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using radiation inactivation analysis. This technique, which gives the functional size of a receptor, yielded a value for the vanilloid receptor, detected by [3H]RTX binding, of 270 ± 25 kDa; this value compares with a monomer mass for VR1 of 92 kDa, strongly arguing for a functional size greater than the monomer. Further evidence for oligomerization is the dominant negative behavior of a mutant VR1 which does not respond to capsaicin (19Oxford G.S. Kuzhikandathil E.V. Szabo T. Wang H. Blumberg P.M. Abstracts of the 2000 Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting, November 4–9, New Orleans, LA, Abstract 632.11. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2000: 1689Google Scholar). Finally, a Hill-coefficient of ∼2 is found for VR1 interaction with different agonists, indicating positive cooperativity (6Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Together with the similarities in molecular structure between the members of the six transmembrane domain channel superfamily, it thus seems highly probable that the active VR1 channel is composed of more than one subunit, forming homomultimeric or heteromultimeric ion channels (16Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schrots G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Florckerzi V. J. Biol.

The goal of the present paper is to evaluate the native quaternary structure of VR1, as the complex structure of the active channel could provide insights into channel regulation and the design of new analgesic agents. Using three different biochemical approaches, we clearly show that the VR1 channel forms multimers both in DRGs and in heterologous expression systems, with a tetramer as a predominant form. Cos7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cos7 cells were transiently transfected with VR1ε plasmid and/or VR1eGFP plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. VR1ε and VR1eGFP plasmids were constructed as described previously (22Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol.

The selected stable CHO cell clone expressing pUHG102 VR1 and pTet-Off Regulator plasmids (Tet-Off induced CHO-VR1 cells) is the generous gift of James E. Krause and Daniel N. Cortright (Neurogen Corp., Branford, CT). These cells were cultured in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 500 µg/ml Geneticin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 µg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). For the optimal level of VR1 expression the cells were cultured in tetracycline-free medium containing 10 µm sodium butyrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 36–48 h. The cell cultures were rinsed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 tablet/10 ml of PBS) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and sonicated. Protein content was measured by a micromethod using the Bio-Rad protein assay. SDS-PAGE was performed on a mini-slab apparatus using precast 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) by the method of Laemmli. Twenty µg of lysates were mixed to equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). For immunostaining, anti-eGFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 0.4 µg/ml concentration, anti-VR1 polyclonal antibody was diluted 1:1000 and anti-PKCε polyclonal antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) was diluted 1:1000. The anti-VR1 polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbits against the extreme C terminus of rat VR1, namely peptide E824-K838 (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) and showed specific recognition of VR1. Nonspecific binding of antibodies to the membranes was blocked by a 60-min incubation with 5% milk in PBS. The membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with the different antibodies diluted in 5% milk in PBS. Following the incubation, the membranes were washed three times for 10 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). After the membranes were rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, immunostaining was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BenchMark prestained Protein Ladder (Life Technologies Inc.) was used as molecular size marker. Plasmids encoding VR1ε and VR1eGFP were transfected into Cos7 cells either together or individually using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. 48 h after transfection, 3 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer without SDS (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (1 tablet/10 ml of PBS) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the cells and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Subsequently, 10 µl of anti-PKCε polyclonal antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 µl of anti-eGFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or 10 µl of non-immune serum was added to 1 ml of supernatant containing 0.4 mg of protein and rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. Then, 20 µl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the immune complexes and rotated at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer without SDS, eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Cell membranes from rat DRGs were prepared as described previously (29Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighting 200–250 g were decapitated under CO2 anesthesia. The spinal columns were opened, and DRGs from all levels were collected in ice-cold physiological saline. DRGs were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm KCl, 5.8 mm NaCl, 0.75 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 320 mm sucrose, and 10 mm HEPES using a tissue homogenizer type PRO 200 (PRO Scientific Inc., Monroe, CT) followed by sonication. Tissue homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g (4 °C) to remove cellular debris and the supernatant was centrifuged again for 30 min at 35,000 ×g (4 °C) to obtain a partially purified membrane fraction (pellet). After solubilization in PBS containing 2%n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Sigma), the membrane proteins were separated on PFO-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were fractionated by PFO-PAGE as described by Ramjeesingh et al. (32Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Freshly poured 6% Tris-glycine gels without SDS were used. Total cell lysates were prepared from Tet-Off induced CHO-VR1 cells 48 h after tetracycline withdrawal, from Cos7 cells expressing VR1eGFP 48 h after transfection, and from rat DRGs as described above. In some experiments cell lysates from CHO-VR1 cells were treated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Twenty µg of lysates were mixed with doubly concentrated sample buffer (100 mm Tris base, 2–8% NaPFO (Oakwood Products Inc., West Columbia, SC), 20% glycerol, 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 8.0), the final PFO concentration being in the range of 0.8–3.2%. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature the samples were subjected to electrophoresis. The running buffer contained 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% NaPFO, pH 8.5, adjusted with NaOH. The electrotransfer and immunostaining were performed as described above. As molecular weight standard, cross-linked phosphorylaseb (Sigma) was separated on the same gels, electroblotted, and stained with Amido Black. The following water-soluble, homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccimide esters were used for protein cross-linking studies: the non-cleavable bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3) and the base-cleavable bis[2-(sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (sulfo-BSOCOES; Pierce). Both reagents were dissolved in PBS immediately before use. The lysates prepared from Tet-Off induced CHO-VR1 cells 48 h after tetracycline withdrawal and from Cos7 cells expressing VR1eGFP 48 h after transfection were incubated with different concentrations of cross-linkers (1 µm to 10 mm) or without any cross-linker for 30 min at room temperature. To stop the reaction, an equal volume of 1 mglycine was added to the mixtures and incubated for an additional 20 min. The quenched samples were subsequently mixed with 4× concentrated Nu-PAGE sample buffer (564 mm Tris base, 424 mmHCl, 292 mm lithium dodecyl sulfate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.88 mm Serva Blue G250, 0.70 mm Phenol Red, pH 8.5) according to the description provided by the manufacturer (Novex, San Diego, CA), incubated at 70 °C for 15 min, and then subjected to electrophoresis. The samples were separated on 3–8% gradient Nu-PAGE Tris acetate gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Cross-linking experiments were also performed on living Cos7 cells transiently expressing VR1eGFP. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS containing different concentrations of BS3 (0.01–10 mm) followed by preparation of cell lysates and their Western blot analysis. To determine if two or more VR1 subunits form a complex, VR1ε and VR1eGFP were coexpressed in Cos7 cells. These differently tagged VR1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-eGFP or anti-ε tag antibodies and Western blots containing the immune complexes were probed with the reciprocal antibodies. Transfection with just one construct as well as immunoprecipitation with non-immune serum were used as controls. The results shown in Fig.1demonstrate that VR1eGFP co-immunoprecipitated with VR1ε and vice versa, suggesting the existence of at least two VR1 molecules in a protein complex. The first method used to determine the nature of the VR1 channel complex was PFO-PAGE. In this method, PFO is used in place of SDS in gel electrophoresis, as it is less disruptive of interactions within protein oligomers and thus permits molecular mass determination of multimeric proteins. VR1eGFP-transfected Cos7 cell lysates, Tet-Off induced CHO-VR1 cell lysates, and partially purified DRG membranes were separated on PFO-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.2). The pattern of protein migration depended on time and temperature of incubation with sample buffer containing PFO; a longer incubation time and higher temperature resulted in a greater degree of subunit dissociation from the protein complex (see Supplementary Figs. 1–6, available in the on-line version of this article). Subunit dissociation was also highly dependent on the ratio of PFO to protein and/or lipid (Fig. 2 A). CHO-VR1 cell lysates were incubated with different PFO concentrations (0.4–3.2%) for 30 min at room temperature and separated on 6% PFO-PAGE. Using 3.2% and 1.6% PFO, VR1 migrated as monomers and some dimers. With 0.8% PFO, VR1 was separated into multiple bands representing VR1 monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers; using 0.4% PFO, VR1 migrated mainly as tetramer, but higher molecular weight protein aggregates were also seen, probably due to insufficient solubilization of membrane proteins (Fig. 2 A). Based on these results in each system, we varied the PFO concentration to find the appropriate conditions for detecting oligomers. In CHO-VR1 cells VR1 monomer is present in two different forms: a non-glycosylated form with apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa and a glycosylated form with calculated molecular mass of 114 kDa as shown in Fig. 2 (A, B, and F). Treatment for 1 h at 37 °C with peptide-N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that cleaves N-glycosidic bonds between the sugar portion and asparagine of glycoproteins, reduced or eliminated the upper band of VR1 monomer representing the glycosylated form of the protein. On SDS-PAGE, VR1 migrated as a double band without and as a single band after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2 F). On PFO-PAGE the upper band of VR1 monomer and some upper bands of the dimers and trimers were markedly reduced with PNGase F treatment, and there also was a shift in the mobility of VR1 tetramer (Fig. 2 B). Based on these observations, we assume that the multiple bands corresponding to VR1 multimers are due to the different combinations of the glycosylated and non-glycosylated monomers, with predicted apparent molecular masses ranging from 190 to 220 kDa for dimers (three possible bands of 190, 205, and 220 kDa) and from 285 to 330 kDa for trimers (four possible bands of 285, 300, 315, and 330 kDa). The failure to resolve multiple bands of VR1 tetramers (five possible bands with predicted apparent molecular masses of 380, 395, 410, 425, and 440 kDa) can be explained by the decreased resolution of the gel in the higher molecular weight region; the increased mobility of VR1 tetramer after glycosidase treatment is still apparent. In the treated sample, a band with higher molecular mass and some protein aggregates stacked at the top of the separating gel are also seen. Based on our present studies, their nature and importance cannot be determined. In the other heterologous system used, VR1eGFP migrated as four distinct bands on 6% PFO gels (Fig. 2 C) with estimated molecular masses of 119, 236, 345, and 464 kDa, respectively (Fig.2 D). Molecular mass determination of the observed protein species was based on the linear relationship of the logarithm of the molecular masses of cross-linked phosphorylase b subunits used as molecular weight standards versus their migration distance. Based on the obtained molecular weights, we assume that these four bands represent the VR1eGFP monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers (predicted molecular mass for VR1eGFP of 124, 248, 372, and 496 kDa). VR1eGFP migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE as shown on Fig. 2 F, although some glycosylation (10–15%) was seen in some experiments, resulting in the appearance of a double band when higher exposure times were used for ECL development. After treating the cells expressing VR1eGFP for 30 min with the VR1 agonist RTX at doses activating the channel, VR1eGFP was separated as monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer on PFO-PAGE (Fig. 2 C) and as monomer, dimer, and multimer on SDS-PAGE (Fig.3A), showing that some covalent bonds are formed between the subunits of the complex. Some higher molecular weight bands running in the PFO-stacking gels could be visualized with higher exposure times (see supplemental material, available on line) possibly because some other proteins or another preformed complex are covalently cross-linked to VR1 tetramer. When partially purified DRG membranes were subjected to PFO-PAGE using optimized conditions (solubilization of membrane proteins with 2% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and incubation with sample buffer containing PFO at a final concentration of 0.8% for 30 min room temperature), VR1 migrated as a major band representing VR1 tetramer and as a minor band representing VR1 monomer (Fig.2 E). When higher PFO concentrations were used, VR1 monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers could be also seen (see supplemental material, available on line). VR1 monomer migrated as a single band both on PFO and SDS-PAGE showing the lack of the glycosylated form of VR1 in DRG (Fig. 2, E and F). In accordance with this observation, VR1 tetramer from DRG had a slightly higher mobility than the VR1 tetramer from CHO-VR1 cells, as the tetramer of the latter is a combination of the glycosylated and non-glycosylated form of VR1 resulting in a complex with higher molecular weight. Upon VR1 activation by agonists such as capsaicin or its ultrapotent analog RTX, VR1 became covalently cross-linked as detected by SDS-PAGE. The cross-linking depended on time, on ligand concentration, and on the presence of extracellular calcium. Treatment of Cos7 cells expressing VR1eGFP with different doses of RTX (0.001–1 nm) for 30–60 min resulted in formation of VR1 dimers and multimers; the cross-linking was not seen when 1 mm EGTA was added to the extracellular fluid (Fig.3 A). The lowest RTX concentration causing cross-linking was 0.01 nm. This ligand concentration is sufficient to activate the channel and induce a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (see supplemental information, available on line). Cross-linked VR1eGFP showed a pattern similar to control VR1eGFP without agonist treatment when separated on PFO-PAGE (Fig.2 C). The same multimerization was observed when cells were treated with other VR1 agonists (capsaicin, olvanil, PPAHV) at doses known to activate the VR1 channel but was not observed with the competitive inhibitor capsazepine at concentrations up to 30 µm. Likewise, pretreatment with 10 µm capsazepine could prevent the covalent bond formation between VR1 monomers (Fig.3 B). Treatment of cells with 1–10 µmionomycin, an agent that increases intracellular Ca2+, did not result in the same degree of cross-linking, although some formation of dimers and a very low amount of higher oligomers could be seen (see supplemental information, available on line). We surmise that covalent cross-linking of VR1 reflects the Ca2+-dependent activation of endogenous transglutaminases. Consistent with this interpretation, pretreatment with 20 mm cysteamine or 250 µmmono-dansylcadaverine, two transglutaminase inhibitors, prevented the covalent cross-linking (Fig. 3 B). Similar cross-linking of VR1 in response to VR1 agonists was seen in CHO-VR1 cells as well (see supplemental information, available on line). A third method to explore VR1 oligomerization and to potentially reveal associated proteins in complex with VR1 was cross-linking with chemical cross-linking agents. Two water-soluble cross-linkers were examined in detail: the non-cleavable cross-linker BS3 with a spacer arm of 1.14 nm and the base-cleavable cross-linker sulfo-BSOCOES with a spacer arm of 1.3 nm. Total cell lysates from VR1eGFP-transfected Cos7 cells and from induced CHO-VR1 cells, treated or not treated with PNGase F, were incubated with different concentrations of the cross-linkers for different times at room temperature. The formed complexes were se"

We here report a new member of the IκB protein family, IκB-ζ, harboring six ankyrin repeats at its carboxyl terminus. IκB-ζ mRNA is strongly induced after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide. The induction of IκB-ζ is also observed by stimulation with interleukin-1β but not by tumor necrosis factor-α.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar, 2Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The NF-κB activity is attributed to the homo- and heterodimers of Rel/NF-κB family proteins. In resting cells, NF-κB is present in the cytosol as an inactive complex with its inhibitor proteins, IκBs. Exposure of cells to various proinflammatory stimuli including microbial cell-wall components, viral products, cytokines, or cellular stresses induces proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB following its phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Thus liberated NF-κB translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of target genes, such as cytokines/chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, the nitric-oxide synthase, or co-stimulatory molecules (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar, 2Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although the activation of NF-κB is essential for the initiation of inflammation to eliminate pathogens, its activity must be tightly regulated: too strong or prolonged activation of NF-κB leads to overproduction of cytokines, which culminates in the induction of fever or life-threatening shock, and thus is seriously detrimental to the host. In order to regulate the activity, NF-κB activates genes, such as IκB-α (3Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin or LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, is one of the strongest stimulators to activate NF-κB for monocytes and macrophages, which play critical roles in innate immunity (9Ulevitch R.J. Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cellular activation triggered by LPS and some of the other microbial cell-wall components has recently been shown to be mediated by members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family (10Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4344) Google Scholar, 11Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

TLRs share a cytoplasmic domain (TIR domain) with homology to that of the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (IL-1R) or the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), and it is suggested that the intracellular pathways for the LPS and IL-1 signaling are shared. In this study, to better understand the mechanisms regulating inflammation or NF-κB activity, we screened for genes that are induced by proinflammatory stimuli on these cells. During the screening, we identified a protein with partial similarity with the IκB protein family. The protein, induced by the proinflammatory stimuli, negatively regulates the NF-κB activity in the nucleus, whereas typical IκB proteins, represented by IκB-α, -β, and -ε, are constitutively expressed and present in the cytosol to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The distinct characteristics of this protein from the cytosolic IκB proteins would expand our understanding of mechanisms for the regulation of NF-κB and inflammatory reactions. Peritoneal macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage with Hank's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies) at 4 or 5 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 3% sterile thioglycollate (Difco) into 8–10-week-old mice and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The other cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. LPS from Escherichia coli0111:B4 was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β were from Genzyme Corp. Cambridge, MA. Subtractive hybridization was performed using polymerase chain reaction-select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) with cDNAs from LPS-treated (1 µg/ml, 1 h) and untreated RAW264.7 cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A partial cDNA fragment obtained by the subtractive hybridization was used as a probe for Northern blotting to confirm the induction by LPS and for the screening of a cDNA library constructed from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The 5′ non-coding region was isolated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to confirm the initiation codon. The expression plasmids for transfection were constructed by subcloning the DNA fragments obtained by polymerase chain reaction into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.), pCI (Promega Corp.), or pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) with or without NH2-terminal Myc- or Flag-tag. pRK-IKK-β-Flag (14Woronicz J.D.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar) were described previously. The entire coding region or the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 315–629) of IκB-ζ was subcloned into pMALg (provided by Dr. T. Ito) or pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), respectively, to prepare recombinant proteins. RAW264.7 or HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmid together with pELAM1-Luc (16Irie T. Muta T. Takeshige K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and pRL-TK (Promega Corp.) by the FuGENE™ 6 method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or the calcium-phosphate method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), respectively. Two days after transfection, the cells were stimulated as indicated at 37 °C for 6 h. Luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual-luciferase Reporter System (Promega Corp.). EMSA was performed essentially as described in Ref. 18Yamamoto H. Hanada K. Nishijima M. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar with annealed oligonucleotides (5′-TTAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTGTTAA-3′) as a probe. HeLa and COS-7 cells grown on a coverslip were transfected with the indicated expression vector with FuGENE™ 6. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc (9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or anti-Flag (M2, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum. After washing, the cells were further incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Molecular Probes) and/or Cy™ 3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia BiotechAB). Cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole before analyses under a fluorescent microscopy. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitate with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-Myc (9E10) antibody was resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with the indicated antibody. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Life Technologies). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h and stained with annexin V-biotin (BD Pharmingen), followed by streptavidin-TRIcolor (Caltag Laboratories) and analyzed by flow cytometry. To identify genes that were up-regulated after LPS stimulation in macrophages, subtractive hybridization was performed with cDNAs from LPS-treated and untreated murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7. Among the clones specifically induced by LPS treatment of the cells, one clone was identified to encode a protein containing the ankyrin repeats as found in IκBs. The protein was named IκB-ζ and further analyzed, since it exhibited similarity to known IκB family proteins both in structure and function but had distinct characteristics (see below). No or little mRNA for IκB-ζ was detected in the resting cells, but it was strongly induced by LPS treatment in RAW264.7 cells (Fig.1 A). A similar induction was observed with mouse peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1 B). The induction of IκB-ζ peaked at 1 h after the stimulation. The levels of the mRNA then gradually decreased, but significant expression was detected even 24 and 48 h after the stimulation (Fig. 1 C). As low as 0.1 ng/ml LPS elicited IκB-ζ mRNA and the induction was abolished by polymyxin B-treatment, a polypeptide that neutralizes lipid A, the biological center of LPS (Fig. 1 D). In order to determine the specificity for the induction, the expression of IκB-ζ was examined with cells stimulated with two proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β. mRNA for IκB-ζ was also induced by IL-1β treatment in NIH3T3 cells, with a time course similar to that observed in the LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 E). In contrast, its induction by TNF-α was negligible (Fig. 1 E). To monitor whether the cells were activated by these stimuli, the expression of IκB-α was examined in parallel, as a control for a typical gene induced by NF-κB (3Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 4Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C.

The IκB-α mRNA was strongly induced by all three stimulants, indicating that these stimuli induced cells to activate NF-κB. To investigate the molecular functions of IκB-ζ, cDNAs for IκB-ζ were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The composite sequence of the two partial cDNA clones encoded an open reading frame for 629 amino acids of IκB-ζ (Fig.2 A). An in-flame stop codon preceding the first methionine codon in the cDNA was confirmed by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. IκB-ζ contained a COOH-terminal region with 6 ankyrin-repeats, which was most similar to that of Bcl-3 (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, the NH2-terminal region did not show any significant homology to proteins in the data bases. When expression of IκB-ζ in the normal tissue was examined by Northern blotting, a 4-kilobase mRNA for IκB-ζ was detected in the kidney, liver, lung, and heart, but was hardly detected in the skeletal muscle, spleen, and brain (Fig. 2 C). A strong band with a smaller size was detected in the testis, but its identity remains unknown. During the course of the following functional characterization, a protein identical to IκB-ζ was reported as MAIL-S (19Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All of the IκB proteins thus far identified contain multiple repeats of the ankyrin motifs, which interact with the Rel homology domain of the Rel/NF-κB proteins to mask their nuclear localization signal and block their DNA binding. To explore the involvement of IκB-ζ in the activation of NF-κB, we transfected IκB-ζ-expression plasmid into cells and measured their NF-κB activities in response to proinflammatory stimuli. LPS stimulation of RAW264.7 cells induced strong activation of NF-κB, as measured with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter. Expression of IκB-ζ resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the NF-κB activity in the stimulated cells (Fig. 3 A). To identify the functional domains responsible for the inhibition, we constructed truncated mutants of IκB-ζ and examined their effects. The COOH-terminal half (IκB-ζ(C), amino acids 315–629) of IκB-ζ containing the ankyrin-repeat region effectively inhibited the NF-κB activity. The NH2-terminal region (IκB-ζ(N), amino acids 1–314) without the ankyrin-repeat sequence showed weaker but significant activity (Fig. 3, A andG). Since LPS stimulation of RAW264.7 cells led to strong induction of IκB-ζ (Fig. 1 A), we examined the effect of endogenous expression of IκB-ζ on the NF-κB activities upon LPS stimulation, by preventing the induction with antisense RNA for IκB-ζ. We transfected a construct for sense- or antisense-IκB-ζ into RAW264.7 cells and stimulated them with LPS (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the effect of the sense construct, LPS-induced NF-κB activities were augmented by expressing the antisense mRNA for IκB-ζ, possibly by inactivation of induced IκB-ζ mRNA. Neither the sense nor the antisense construct had any effect on basal NF-κB activity. Thus, LPS stimulation of the cells, leading to activation of NF-κB, simultaneously induces IκB-ζ expression, which is inhibitory for the NF-κB activities. In addition to LPS-induced NF-κB activity, transfected IκB-ζ inhibited the IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activities (Fig. 3,C and D). NF-κB is activated by degradation of cytosolic IκB-α or -β, which is induced by phosphorylation catalyzed by IKK (IκB kinase)-α/β (14Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). In order to determine the signaling step(s) of the IκB-ζ inhibition of NF-κB, we activated NF-κB by overexpressing IKK-β or NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), the latter of which is a known activator for IKKs (15Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), and examined the effects of the co-expression of IκB-ζ. Transfection of IκB-ζ inhibited both IKK-β- and NIK-mediated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3,E and F). Furthermore, the transactivation activity of transfected p65/p50 of the NF-κB subunits was inhibited by IκB-ζ (Fig. 3 G). The IκB-ζ(N) and IκB-ζ(C) also had this inhibitory activity. These results indicate that IκB-ζ inhibits NF-κB at the later step(s) than IKK activation. The stronger activity of IκB-ζ(C) might be due to higher expression levels of this mutant compared with the full-length IκB-ζ or IκB-ζ(N) (data not shown). The above finding prompted us to study its effects on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB upon stimulation. HeLa cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged IκB-α or IκB-ζ were treated with TNF-α, and then nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was examined. p65 exclusively localized in the cytosol in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4 A, left) and was translocated into the nucleus upon TNF-α stimulation (Fig.4 A, untransfected cells in upper middle andright). Transfection of IκB-α resulted in inhibition of the nuclear translocation of p65 by the stimulation (Fig. 4 A, upper middle; compare the transfected cells shown by arrowheads with the others). In contrast to the effect of IκB-α, IκB-ζ did not affect the translocation of p65 (Fig. 4 A, upper right). We found simultaneously that IκB-ζ was concentrated in the nucleus, whereas IκB-α localized throughout the cells (Fig. 4 A,lower panels). The same results were observed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 B, upper row). Thus, IκB-ζ inhibits the activated NF-κB in the nucleus rather than affecting its nuclear translocation. We further determined the subcellular localization of the truncated mutants of IκB-ζ (Fig. 4 B). While the NH2-terminal half (Fig. 4 B, Flag- IκB-ζ(N)) showed nuclear staining similar to that of intact IκB-ζ (Flag-IκB-ζ), the COOH-terminal half (Flag-IκB-ζ(C)) was distributed throughout the entire cells, indicating that the nuclear localization signal(s) is present in the NH2-terminal region. All the above results were also confirmed with green fluorescence protein fusion proteins (data not shown), which had inhibitory activities (Fig. 3 A). We also found that the cytosolic IκB-ζ(C) inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB upon stimulation (data not shown), which might explain the stronger activity of this mutant (Fig. 3, A andG). To further study the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of NF-κB by IκB-ζ, we examined the physical association of IκB-ζ with the NF-κB subunits. Myc-tagged IκB-α or IκB-ζ was co-expressed with Flag-tagged p65 or p50 in HEK293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. IκB-ζ was found to associate with p50, but its association with p65 was hardly detectable (Fig.5, top). Strong interaction was observed between IκB-α and both p65 and p50. (Fig. 5,top, and data not shown). That IκB-ζ showed a preference for p50 appears to be reasonable, since the ankyrin repeat region of Bcl-3, which is most homologous to that of IκB-ζ, have been reported to preferentially associate with p50 rather than p65 (20Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Nature. 1992; 358: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization and its association with the p50 subunit suggest that IκB-ζ might affect the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. In Fig. 6, the effect of recombinant IκB-ζ on the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was examined by EMSA. An NF-κB probe was retarded when incubated with nuclear extract prepared from RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS (Fig.6 A). The band was competed out with the unlabeled probe and supershifted by either anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibody, demonstrating that it represented the p65/p50 heterodimer (data not shown). The addition of a recombinant maltose-binding protein fusion protein with the full-length IκB-ζ efficiently inhibited the appearance of the band (Fig. 6 A, MBP-IκBζ).A glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with the COOH-terminal ankyrin repeats alone (Fig. 6, GST-KκB-ζCC) exhibited the same activity, whereas no effect was observed with control maltose-binding protein or glutathione S-transferase protein. Furthermore, we prepared the p65/p50 heterodimer and the p50 homodimer by transfecting both p65 and p50 or p50 alone into HEK293 cells. The nuclear extracts from the cells transfected with p65 and p50 gave two bands (Fig. 6 B), each of which was confirmed to be the p65/p50 heterodimer and the p50/p50 homodimer by supershift analyses (data not shown). The recombinant IκB-ζ protein inhibited the appearance of both bands (Fig. 6 B). The COOH-terminal half (IκB-ζ(C)) alone also exhibited the inhibitory activity and the inhibition of the p50 homodimer was weaker than that of the p65/p50 heterodimer (Fig. 6 C). Thus, IκB-ζ inhibits the DNA binding of p65/p50 heterodimers as well as the p50 homodimer, through its association with the p50 subunit. The inhibitory activity of IκB-ζ on NF-κB, which acts as an anti-apoptotic factor (21Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 22Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar, 23Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 24Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar), suggests that IκB-ζ might also be involved in the regulation of apoptosis upon inflammatory stimuli or in other physiologically relevant processes. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of IκB-ζ expression on TNF-α-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells transfected with an empty vector, a phosphorylation-defective mutant (S32A/S36A) of IκB-α, or IκB-ζ were stimulated with TNF-α for 24 h and their morphological changes were examined under a microscope. As well as the cells expressing the mutant IκB-α, the IκB-ζ-transfected cells exhibited increased numbers of cells with round-shaped apoptotic morphologies (Fig. 7 A). For more quantitative analyses, we stained apoptotic cells with annexin-V and analyzed them by flow cytometry. When transfected 293 cells were analyzed after TNF-α stimulation, the vector-transfected cells exhibited 17.4% of annexin V-possitive apoptotic cells (Fig.7 B). On the other hand, the IκB-ζ-expressing cells analyzed under the same conditions showed 29.3% of apoptotic cells. The results indicate that expression of IκB-ζ promotes apoptosis. This effect was comparable to that of the mutant IκB-α (22.7% apoptotic cells). The IκB-ζ expression did not promote apoptosis without the stimulation. Thus, IκB-ζ accelerates apoptosis, possibly by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic NF-κB activity. We described in this paper a novel protein belonging to the IκB family. No or little expression of IκB-ζ is observed in unstimulated macrophages and it is induced by a subset of proinflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and IL-1β, which activate receptors containing the TIR domains, TLR4 and IL-1R, respectively. Although both the TNF-α- and IL-1/LPS signaling cascades activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases, TNF-α induces little induction of IκB-ζ. The induction of IκB-ζ was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG-132, suggesting that NF-κB is involved in the induction of IκB-ζ. 2S. Yamazaki, T. Muta, and K. Takeshige, unpublished results. However, overexpression of the NF-κB subunit p65 resulted in robust up-regulation of IκB-α mRNA, but little induction of IκB-ζ mRNA was detected (data not shown). The results indicate that IκB-ζ is induced by a different mechanism from that of IκB-α, with NF-κB activation being sufficient for the latter. A transcription factor(s) that is essential for the induction of IκB-ζ appears to be specifically activated by the signaling through the cytoplasmic TIR domains of TLRs and IL-1R. Transfection of IκB-ζ inhibited the NF-κB activities induced by LPS and IL-1 as well as TNF-α (Fig. 3, A, B,and D). This negative regulation of NF-κB would be important to prevent undesirable heavy inflammatory reactions, which lead to septic shock or other detrimental effects. The introduction of antisense RNA for IκB-ζ results in augmentation of NF-κB activity upon stimulation with LPS (Fig. 3 B), suggesting physiological significance of IκB-ζ in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. Since IκB-ζ expression was induced with as little as 0.1 ng/ml LPS and was sustained for at least 2 days (Fig. 1,C and D), it could play a role in the acquisition of LPS tolerance in LPS-sensitive cells. Cross-tolerance between LPS and IL-1β stimulation is explained at least in part by IκB-ζ, since both stimuli activate IκB-ζ induction (25Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activities of full-length IκB-ζ or IκB-ζ(N) appeared weaker than those of IκB-α or -β, but this finding might be attributable to the fact that IκB-ζ or IκB-ζ(N) was not as highly expressed as the other two proteins (data not shown). IκB-ζ might be subjected to degradation in the cells via its NH2-terminal region although it does not appear to have the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by IKK nor lysine residue(s) for the subsequent ubiquitination. In contrast to IκB-α, -β, and -ε, all of which are in the cytosol, the induced IκB-ζ localizes in the nucleus through the NH2-terminal region (Fig. 4), where it negatively regulates the DNA binding of NF-κB via association with the p50 subunit (Figs.5 and 6). These findings are consistent with the observation that IκB-ζ does not affect the translocation of activated NF-κB into the nuclei. Kitamura et al. (19Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) independently isolated the proteins, MAIL-L and -S, the latter of which is identical to IκB-ζ. The protein identical to MAIL-L was also reported more recently by another group as an IL-1-inducible protein (26Haruta H. Kato A. Todokoro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12485-12488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The induction by LPS stimulation and the nuclear localization of IκB-ζ described in this paper is consistent with their results. They also showed in Swiss 3T3 cells that transfection of the cDNA resulted in the promotion of LPS-induced IL-6 production, which is also regulated by NF-κB. The apparent discrepancy may be attributed to different assay systems or different cell lines. Alternatively, IκB-ζ might also be involved in some transcriptional activation as in the manner of Bcl-3, which has been shown to act as a coactivator of several transcription factors (27Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 28Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J.

TLR2, which acts as a receptor for several microbial products to activate NF-κB, has been reported to induce apoptosis upon the stimulation (30Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 31Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Weiss D.S. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Since TLR2 also contains a TIR domain, IκB-ζ expression is likely induced by the activation of TLR2, and would regulate NF-κB activity and apoptosis. The proapoptotic activity of IκB-ζ was comparable to that of IκB-α (Fig. 7 B), although its activity on NF-κB was much weaker (Fig. 3 C, see above). The results suggest that IκB-ζ may have other activities to promote apoptosis than inhibiting NF-κB. IκB-ζ was induced by both LPS and IL-1β but not by TNF-α (Fig.1 E). The specificity of the IκB-ζ induction provided evidence that these two proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, have qualitatively different activities that would culminate in distinct consequences. The physiological significance of the induction of IκB-ζ was exemplified by the induction of IκB-α, an NF-κB-regulated gene: the induction of IκB-α was sustained for longer periods in TNF-α-stimulated cells, where little IκB-ζ induction was observed, whereas the induction was transient in IL-1β- or LPS-treated cells (Fig. 1 E). Various types of cytokines are produced during inflammation, and a single cell is exposed to a mixture of cytokines. The subtle balance of the cellular responses, such as activation of NF-κB and induction of IκB-ζ, may determine the fate of the cells, including apoptosis. Since NF-κB regulates not only inflammation but also wide varieties of biologically important processes, IκB-ζ might play critical roles in such physiological and pathological situations. Precise analyses for the IκB-ζ induction and its molecular function would shed more light on the regulation of appropriate inflammatory reactions, the physiological relevance of each inflammatory cytokine, and other biological processes regulated by NF-κB.

H2O2 is a ubiquitous ROS that can activate signaling processes and induce cytotoxicity in many mammalian cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), cardiomyocytes, and neurons (1Li P.F.

The cells were grown in minimum essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stocks were subcultured at subconfluence by trypsinization. All experiments were performed on cells between passages 8 and 20 grown to 70% to 95% confluence in 24-well plates, 35- or 60-mm dishes, or 4-well chamber slides. Lucigenin luminescence measurements were carried out using 5 µm lucigenin, a concentration which is unlikely to induce redox cycling (14Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Roubaud V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to subconfluence in 35-mm dishes and growth arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h. After exposure to H2O2 at the indicated concentrations and times, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 5 µm lucigenin was added. Immediately afterward, NADPH (0.1 mm) was added, and after dark adaptation, luminescence was measured every 15 s for 5 min in a luminometer (Zylux Corp). Changes in luminescence were expressed as relative luminescent units per 105 cells per minute. No changes in luminescence were observed in the absence of NADPH, and addition of H2O2 to lucigenin in PBS in the absence of cells did not increase chemiluminescence. Some experiments were also performed with coelenterazine (5 µm), a structurally distinct luminescent probe which reportedly is not capable of redox cycling via autoxidation (15Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Suarez E. Richardson G. Radi R. Freeman B.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni t testing. SMC grown on chamber slides were treated as indicated under “Results” and in the figure legends, washed, and incubated with dihydroethidium (HE, 5 µm), a probe which detects O⨪2, for 40 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The cells were then imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser (excitation 488 nm, emission 610 nm). Fluorescence was detected with a 585-nm long pass filter. Control and treatment groups were always imaged in parallel to ensure that the processing techniques and laser settings were identical. All images were collected using a 512 × 512-pixel format and archived for subsequent analysis, as reported previously (10Brown M.R. Miller F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P.

Fluorescence intensity (expressed in arbitrary units) was analyzed using Confocal AssistantTM, version 3.10 and NIH Image: Use in Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy, version 2.0. The relative fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the total fluorescence intensity by total cell number in the measuring field (10Brown M.R. Miller F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N.

Afterward, coverslips were applied, and confocal microscopy was performed as described above. Under these conditions, only highly elastic structures (i.e.elastic laminae) exhibit autofluorescence. For all confocal microscopy experiments, results shown are representative of those obtained in experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated at least one time to ensure reproducibility. In some experiments, the fluorescence of HE was quantitated using flow cytometry. Mouse aortic fibroblasts were grown to subconfluence in 60-mm dishes, treated with or without 200 µmH2O2 for 40 min, washed, and incubated with HE (10 µm) for 40 min. The cells were removed by trypsinization, which was neutralized with PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACScan). Mean fluorescence values among the groups were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni t testing.

The duration of pretreatment was 30 min for all agents except PEG-SOD, with which the cells were preincubated for 16 h. Alternatively, fibroblasts from C57 or gp91phox knock-out mice were exposed to 0–200 µmH2O2 for 1 h. Subsequently, MTS viability assay was performed 24 h after exposure to oxidants. After normalizing the MTS results to % of control values, data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni t testing. In separate experiments, SMC were treated with vehicle or 10 µm DPI, or transfected with scrambled, sense, or antisense oligonucleotides against p22phox, as described below.

Briefly, following completion of the experimental protocols, the samples were preincubated with equilibration buffer for 5 min and subsequently incubated with deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase in the presence of digoxigenin-conjugated dUTP for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by incubating the samples in stopping buffer for 30 min. After three rinses with PBS, samples were incubated with the fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody for 30 min, and three rinses with PBS were repeated. Finally, the samples were stained and mounted with Oncor Propidium Iodide/Antifade, and then examined by laser confocal microscopy. Cells were transfected with 1 µmoligonucleotides (prepared by the DNA facility at the University of Iowa College of Medicine) with the aid of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium for 18 h. The sequences were as follows: antisense p22phox: 5′-GATCTGCCCCATGGTGAGGACC-3′; sense p22phox: 5′-GGTCCTCACCATGGGGCAGATC-3′; and a scrambled sequence 5′-TGGCGAGGTGCCCAGTTCAACC-3′. After washing, 2% fetal calf serum medium was applied for 24 h, after which the cells were treated as indicated under “Results” and in the figure legends, and then assayed for intracellular O⨪2 or viability. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Procurement of all animal and human tissues was approved by, and performed in accordance with, the Review Committees at the University of Iowa College of Medicine. To investigate whether H2O2 stimulates release of O⨪2, rat aortic smooth SMC were exposed to various concentrations of H2O2 for 40 min. The cells were washed, and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence was performed for detection of O⨪2. Treatment with H2O2 resulted in concentration-dependent increases in NADPH-stimulated lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, with maximal values observed at 200 µm H2O2 (Fig.1 a). Examination of the time course with 200 µm H2O2 indicated that an increase in the chemiluminescence signal was detected as early as 10 min after application of H2O2 and reached maximum by 40 min (Fig. 1 b). The increase in lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence was maintained for at least 3 h after exposure to a single dose of 100 µmH2O2 (not shown). Pretreatment with allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, or L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase, did not attenuate the H2O2-induced enhancement in chemiluminescence, suggesting that these enzymatic pathways were not responsible for O⨪2 production (not shown). In contrast, the signal was abolished by diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 10 µm), which inhibits flavin-containing enzymes, including NAD(P)H oxidase (Fig. 1 c). Consistent with the lucigenin data, H2O2 also produced an increase in coelenterazine-enhanced chemiluminescence, which was likewise inhibitable by DPI, suggesting that autoxidation of lucigenin was not responsible for the observed effects (data not shown). Next, cells were exposed to 200 µmH2O2 for 40 min, washed, incubated with HE, and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. HE reacts with intracellular O⨪2 to produce a red cellular fluorescence (10Brown M.R. Miller F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P. Engelhardt J.F. Zwacka R.M. Oberley L.W. Fang X.

Res. 1998; 82: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Treatment with H2O2 resulted in a 4-fold increase in HE fluorescence, which was blocked by preincubation with polyethylene glycol-conjugated SOD (PEG-SOD), indicating that the signal resulted from O⨪2 (Fig. 2, Table I). Pretreatment with DPI eliminated the increase in HE fluorescence produced by H2O2, suggesting that the O⨪2 was derived from NAD(P)H oxidase. In contrast, preincubation with diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC), an inhibitor of Cu/Zn-SOD (17Hiraishi H. Terano A. Tazandi M. Sugimoto T. Harada T. Ivey K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14812-14817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in an increase in HE fluorescence under basal conditions as well as following treatment with H2O2. This latter observation raised the possibility that the increase in O⨪2might be due to H2O2-induced inhibition of endogenous SOD activity. Therefore, we performed SOD activity assays. Exposure to H2O2 did not inhibit Cu/Zn-SOD activity (determined by gel assay) (18Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6276-6283PubMed Google Scholar) in control cells or in cells whose SOD activity was increased ≅2-fold by preincubation with PEG-SOD (not shown). In contrast, DETC, as expected, markedly inhibited Cu/Zn-SOD activity in control cells and in cells treated with H2O2 (not shown). Mn-SOD activity (determined by colorimetric assay) (18Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6276-6283PubMed Google Scholar) was not different among control and H2O2-treated cells (not shown). Also, rat SMC do not express the extracellular isoform of SOD (19Carlsson L.M. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5219-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, H2O2 increased intracellular O⨪2 by inducing the production, rather than inhibiting the destruction, of O⨪2.Table IQuantitative effects of H2O2 on HE fluorescence in SMCRelative fluorescenceVehiclePEG-SODDETCDPIRotenoneControl2.7 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.55.8 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.49.1 ± 1.1H2O211.0 ± 0.61-ap < 0.05 compared with corresponding control value.3.0 ± 0.51-bp < 0.05 compared with vehicle H2O2 value.16.7 ± 1.51-ap < 0.05 compared with corresponding control value.1-bp < 0.05 compared with vehicle H2O2 value.2.2 ± 0.21-bp < 0.05 compared with vehicle H2O2 value.16.1 ± 0.81-ap < 0.05 compared with corresponding control value.1-bp < 0.05 compared with vehicle H2O2 value.SMC were grown on 4-well chamber slides and treated with vehicle, PEG-SOD (500 units/ml), DPI (10 µm), DETC (1 mm), or rotenone (10 µm), as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Cells were then exposed to 0 (control) or 200 µm H2O2 for 40 min, incubated with HE (10 µm), and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Mean fluorescence intensity measurements (expressed as arbitrary units, normalized to the percentage of the field occupied by fluorescent cells) obtained from three separate wells in each group were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni t testing. Mitochondria are important sources of O⨪2 and may contribute to cytotoxicity induced by peroxides (20Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J. Meinicke A.R. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1995; 3: 479-486Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the O⨪2 generated by treatment with H2O2might be derived from mitochondrial sources, we tested the effects of rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (21Dumont A. Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ueffing M. Droge W. Schimtz M.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Like H2O2, rotenone, by itself, increased HE fluorescence (Fig. 2, Table I), suggesting that blockade of the mitochondrial electron transport chain can promote electron leakage to generate O⨪2. Pretreatment with 10 µm DPI did not inhibit rotenone-induced O⨪2production (not shown). Moreover, exposure to H2O2 resulted in further enhancement of HE fluorescence in rotenone pretreated cells (Fig. 2, Table I). Antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, also increased intracellular O⨪2 but did not block the increase in O⨪2 production following H2O2 (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that H2O2 increases O⨪2 through a mechanism distinct from the mitochondrial electron transport chain, with the most likely source being NAD(P)H oxidase. As pharmacological inhibitors are not absolutely specific to one cellular target, we transfected SMC with antisense oligonucleotides against p22phox, a subunit required to form activated NAD(P)H oxidase complexes in SMCs (22Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 23Lynn S. Gurr J.R. Lai H.T. Jan K.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The antisense sequence we employed has been shown to inhibit NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent O⨪2production in SMC (22Ushio-Fukai M.

Res. 2000; 86: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Transfection with p22phox antisense oligonucleotides markedly attenuated the increase in HE fluorescence induced by a 40-min application of 20 ng/ml PDGF, whereas sense oligonucleotides were without effect (Fig.3 a, TableII), confirming the efficacy and specificity of the antisense oligonucleotides to functionally block NAD(P)H oxidase in our SMC. Transfection with p22phox antisense oligonucleotides also markedly attenuated the increase in HE fluorescence induced by exposure to H2O2 (Fig.3 b, Table II). In contrast, the increase in HE fluorescence induced by the mitochondrial inhibitor, rotenone, was unaffected by transfection with p22phox antisense oligonucleotides. Furthermore, scrambled p22phox antisense oligonucleotides did not inhibit the H2O2-induced increase in intracellular O⨪2 (not shown).Table IIQuantitative effects of transfection with p22phoxoligonucleotides on HE fluorescenceRelative fluorescenceVehiclePDGFH2O2Rotenonep22phox sense3.9 ± 0.6016.7 ± 1.52-ap < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.15.3 ± 0.22-ap < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.16.0 ± 1.92-ap < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.p22phoxantisense3.1 ± 0.65.7 ± 0.62-ap < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.2-bp < 0.05 compared with corresponding sense value.6.0 ± 0.62-ap < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.2-bp < 0.05 compared with corresponding sense value.16.3 ± 2.62-ap < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.SMC were grown on 4-well chamber slides and transfected for 18 h with the indicated oligonucleotides (1 µm) and then maintained in 2% FCS medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were then exposed to vehicle, PDGF (20 ng/ml), H2O2 (200 µm), or rotenone (10 µm) for 40 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with HE, and fluorescence was quantitated as described in Table I.2-a p < 0.05 compared with sense or antisense vehicle value.2-b p < 0.05 compared with corresponding sense value. Open table in a new tab SMC were grown on 4-well chamber slides and transfected for 18 h with the indicated oligonucleotides (1 µm) and then maintained in 2% FCS medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were then exposed to vehicle, PDGF (20 ng/ml), H2O2 (200 µm), or rotenone (10 µm) for 40 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with HE, and fluorescence was quantitated as described in Table I. Gp91phox is a plasma membrane subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase in fibroblasts, but not in SMC (24Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of NAD(P)H oxidase in H2O2-induced O⨪2 production, aortic fibroblasts were cultured from gp91phox knock-out mice and from control C57 mice. H2O2 produced greater increases in intracellular O⨪2 in fibroblasts from C57 mice as compared with those from gp91phox knock-out mice (Fig. 4,a and b). In contrast, rotenone produced similar increases in intracellular O⨪2 in fibroblasts cultured from C57 and gp91phox-deficient mice. These results further support the notion that the H2O2-induced O⨪2production is mediated by NAD(P)H oxidase. To assess the potential role of NAD(P)H oxidase in generation of O⨪2 in human blood vessels, we examined coronary arteries removed from the hearts of patients with atherosclerosis at the time of cardiac transplantation. Vessel segments were pretreated with vehicle or DPI, incubated with HE, and then examined by confocal microscopy, as described previously (10Brown M.R. Miller F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P. Engelhardt J.F. Zwacka R.M. Oberley L.W. Fang X. Spector A.A. Weintraub N.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Miller Jr., F.J. Gutterman D.D. Rios C.D. Heistad D.D. Davidson B.L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). HE fluorescence was detected throughout the neointima, media, and adventitia of segments pretreated with vehicle (Fig.5). Preincubation with PEG-SOD markedly attenuated the HE fluorescence, confirming that it originated from O⨪2 (not shown). The HE fluorescence was strongly attenuated by pretreatment with DPI, suggesting that NAD(P)H oxidase contributes importantly to O⨪2 production in SMC and fibroblasts in atherosclerotic human coronary arteries. Next, we examined whether NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated O⨪2 production contributes to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Exposure of SMC to 100 µm H2O2for 1 h resulted in ≅40% reduction in cell viability as determined 24 h later by MTS assay, which could be prevented by adding catalase to the incubation medium (Fig.6 a). Pretreatment with DPI blocked the reduction in cell viability induced by H2O2. When the exposure to H2O2 was extended from 1 to 3 h, ≅65% reduction in viability was observed in cells not pretreated with DPI, whereas DPI-pretreated cells maintained full viability (not shown). Similar results were obtained in cells continuously exposed to serum, suggesting that the protective effect of DPI was not dependent on the growth status of the cells (not shown). The protective effects of DPI were observed when cells were exposed to <800 µmH2O2; higher concentrations of H2O2 were uniformly toxic regardless of pretreatment with DPI. Because reduction of MTS depends upon mitochondrial function, which can be influenced by H2O2, we also examined cell viability by staining with trypan blue. Up to 1 h after exposure to 200 µm H2O2, no trypan blue-positive cells were observed (not shown). Six h after exposure to H2O2, however, we observed dose-dependent increases in the percentage of trypan blue-positive cells, which were blocked by DPI (Fig. 6 b) or by transfection with antisense oligonucleotides against p22phox(Fig. 6 c). H2O2 has been shown to induce SMC apoptosis (1Li P.F. Dietz R. Harsdorf V.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To investigate whether activation of NAD(P)H oxidase might participate in this process, TUNEL staining was performed. Cells were transfected with p22phox sense or antisense oligonucleotides as described previously, and then exposed to 200 µmH2O2 or vehicle (control) for 1 h. After 24 h, TUNEL staining was performed. Following transfection with sense oligonucleotides, 15.0 ± 2.0% of H2O2-treated cells were TUNEL-positive, whereas only 0.6 ± 0.1% of control cells were TUNEL-positive (p < 0.05). Transfection with the p22phoxantisense oligonucleotides markedly attenuated the increase in TUNEL-positive cells following treatment with H2O2 (3.4 ± 0.4%, p < 0.05 compared with sense transfection). Similar results were obtained following pretreatment with 10 µm DPI (not shown). These results suggest that activation of NAD(P)H oxidase may play an important role in H2O2-induced apoptosis of SMC. Moreover, pretreatment with Tiron (a cell-permeable intracellular scavenger of O⨪2) or PEG-SOD attenuated, while DETC or rotenone enhanced, H2O2-induced SMC cytotoxicity (Fig.6 a). Finally, as compared with aortic fibroblasts from C57 mice, the fibroblasts derived from gp91phox knock-out mice were resistant to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity (Fig.6 d). Collectively, these results suggest that H2O2 induces NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent production of O⨪2, which in turn participates in vascular cell cytotoxicity, perhaps in part through induction of apoptosis. Levels of reactive oxygen species are increased in, and participate in the pathophysiology of, many diverse conditions involving chronic oxidative stress. In inflammatory processes, the phagocytic NADH oxidase of activated leukocytes is a primary source of O⨪2, which is converted, in part by the action of SOD, to H2O2 (25Fridovich I. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 is a highly permeable yet relatively non-reactive molecule in the absence of proper reductants; consequently, micromolar levels of H2O2 can be attained in cells and tissues exposed to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in intracellular compartments such as peroxisomes, it is estimated that even greater concentrations of H2O2 can be produced. Here, we demonstrate that physiologically relevant concentrations of H2O2 (up to 200 µm) stimulate NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent O⨪2 production in non-phagocytic cells of vascular origin. This finding could potentially be very significant in regards to intracellular signaling by H2O2. Moreover, as SMC are important sources of ROS in atherosclerotic blood vessels (16Miller Jr., F.J. Gutterman D.D. Rios C.D. Heistad D.D. Davidson B.L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), our findings could be relevant to cytotoxic and proliferative responses induced during oxidative stress in chronic vascular inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. In addition to NAD(P)H oxidase, several other enzymes, such as xanthine oxidase, cyclooxygenase, and nitric-oxide synthase, have been suggested to be capable of generating O⨪2 in SMC; however, inhibitors of these enzymes did not block H2O2-induced production of O⨪2 by our cells. The mitochondrial electron transport chain is also a potential source of O⨪2, as demonstrated by the results obtained with rotenone and antimycin A. While both of these agents increased intracellular O⨪2, neither was able to block H2O2-induced O⨪2production. Furthermore, p22phox antisense oligonucleotides selectively blocked H2O2-induced O⨪2production, without affecting the increase in O⨪2 induced by rotenone. Finally, H2O2-induced O⨪2production in fibroblasts derived from C57 mice exceeded that observed in cells derived from gp91phox knock-out mice. Together, these data clearly implicate an NAD(P)H oxidase as the primary source of O⨪2 production induced by physiologically relevant concentrations of H2O2 in non-phagocytic cell types present in the vascular wall. The marked reduction in HE fluorescence by DPI in atherosclerotic human coronary arteries suggests that NAD(P)H oxidase is present in fibroblasts and SMC and may contribute significantly to vascular O⨪2 production in vivo. The mechanism by which H2O2 activates the non-phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase remains to be determined. Since increases in O⨪2 were observed as soon as 10 min after exposure to H2O2, gene transcription and translation do not appear to be required. The NAD(P)H oxidase in non-phagocytic cells is known to be comprised of several subunits, including the α subunit of cytochrome b 558, p22phox, the β subunit of cytochrome b 558, gp91phox (or a homologue in SMC and in some other cells), p47phox, and p67phox (5Suh Y-A.

In addition, cytoplasmic Rac protein must associate with the membrane-bound complex to form active enzyme (27Kim K.S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.X. Gerrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that the oxidase can be rapidly activated by arachidonic acid, and that angiotensin II-mediated activation of the oxidase is dependent upon release of endogenous arachidonic acid (24Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). Concentrations of H2O2similar to those used in this study have also been demonstrated to induce arachidonic acid release in SMCs (28Cane A. Bretion M. Koumanov K. Bereziat G. Colard O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1040-C1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this mechanism is possible. Moreover, angiotensin II-induced activation of the non-phagocytic oxidase was reported to be dependent upon p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (29Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), which also appears to be activated by H2O2 in some cells (5Suh Y-A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). In addition, H2O2 could activate the NAD(P)H oxidase by phosphorylating p22phox or, perhaps, another subunit of the enzyme. Finally, concentrations of H2O2similar to those used in this study (100–500 µm) have been shown to increase levels of intracellular calcium (30Hu Q. Corda S. Zweier J.L. Capogrossi M.C. Ziegelstein R.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 97: 268-275Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which might serve as a second messenger to activate the oxidase. Besides demonstrating that H2O2stimulates NAD(P)H oxidase to increase intracellular O⨪2production, we have shown that inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidase protected cells against toxicity induced by the same concentrations of H2O2. As transfection with p22phoxantisense oligonucleotides markedly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells after treatment with H2O2, our results suggest that inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase may protect SMC against H2O2-induced apoptosis. Since oxidant-induced SMC apoptosis has been implicated in neointimal regression and atherosclerotic lesion destabilization, these findings could be relevant to clinical vascular disease (11Li W-G Miller Jr., F.J. Brown M.R. Chatterjee P. Aylsworth G.R. Shao J. Spector A.A. Oberley L.W. Weintraub N.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1473-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidase with DPI protected against cytotoxicity induced by similar concentrations of a lipid hydroperoxide,tert-butylhydroperoxide (data not shown), suggesting that the non-phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase might be activated by endogenous lipid hydroperoxides, which are present in abundance in oxidized low-density lipoprotein particles. Tiron or SOD, which reduced intracellular O⨪2, also protected against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, while DETC, which increased O⨪2, enhanced it. Therefore, NAD(P)H oxidase appears to contribute to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, at least in part, by generating O⨪2. Interestingly, O⨪2has been implicated as a growth-promoting agonist in SMC, and inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidase blocked growth responses induced by angiotensin II and PDGF (22Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 31Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Our results show for the first time that O⨪2 production via the non-phagocytic oxidase can promote oxidant-mediated vascular cell injury. The precise mechanism by which this occurs, and whether additional oxidants (such as HO⋅and/or redox-active metal ions) are involved, remain to be determined. In summary, these data suggest the existence of a self-promoting cycle, whereby reactive oxygen species such as H2O2can activate NAD(P)H oxidases in non-phagocytic cells to produce O⨪2, which in turn can lead to the generation of more H2O2. This mechanism could help to explain why micromolar concentrations of H2O2 cause oxidant-mediated injury to many different types of cells during chronic oxidative stress. Moreover, H2O2-induced activation of NAD(P)H oxidase in non-phagocytic cells could be an important mechanism by which the degree of oxidative stress, and the subsequent cellular damage, is amplified during inflammatory disorders. Accordingly, the non-phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase would appear to be a promising target for the amelioration of the biological effects of oxidant stress in chronic inflammatory states. We thank G. R.

Biol Chem. 275, 31369–31378), we report the identification and cloning of a cDNA encoding for a novel human alkaline ceramidase (aPHC) that hydrolyzes phytoceramide selectively. Northern blot analysis showed that aPHC was ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression in placenta. Green fluorescent protein tagging showed that it was localized in both the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of aPHC in mammalian cells elevated in vitro ceramidase activity towardN-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-C12-phytoceramide. Its expression in a yeast mutant strain devoid of any ceramidase activity restored the ceramidase activity and caused an increase in the hydrolysis of phytoceramide in yeast cells, thus leading to the decreased biosynthesis of sphingolipids. These data collectively suggest that, similar to the yeast phytoceramidase YPC1p, aPHC has phytoceramidase activity both in vitro and in cells; hence, it is a functional homolog of the yeast phytoceramidase YPC1p. However, in contrast to YPC1p, aPHC exhibited no reverse activity of ceramidase either in vitro or in cells. Biochemical characterization showed that aPHC had a pH optimum of 9.5, was activated by Ca2+, but was inhibited by Zn2+ and sphingosine. Substrate specificity showed that aPHC hydrolyzed phytoceramide preferentially. Together, these data demonstrate that aPHC is a novel human alkaline phytoceramidase, the first mammalian alkaline ceramidase to be identified as being specific for the hydrolysis of phytoceramide. Ceramidases are enzymes involved in regulating cellular levels of ceramides, sphingoid bases, and their phosphates. Based on sequence homology to the yeast alkaline ceramidases YPC1p (Mao, C., Xu, R., Bielawska, A., and Obeid, L. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 6876–6884) and YDC1p (Mao, C., Xu, R., Bielawska, A., Szulc, Z. M., and Obeid, L. M. (2000) J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In yeast cells phytosphingosine-1-P suppresses growth (9Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enhances heat stress tolerance (10Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The diversity of cellular actions by these lipids implies that a balance among these different lipids may determine the physiological responses of cells. The balance involves many metabolic enzymes and their regulators, among which are ceramidases. Ceramidases hydrolyze the amide linkage of ceramides to generate free fatty acids and sphingoid bases (11Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill A.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). There are three types of ceramidases described to date (11Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill A.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These are classified as acid, neutral, and alkaline ceramidases according to their pH optimum of enzymatic activity. The murine acid ceramidase was the first ceramidase to be cloned (13Koch J. Gartner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is localized in the lysosome and is mainly responsible for the catabolism of ceramide. Dysfunction of this enzyme because of a genetic defect leads to a sphingolipidosis disease called Farber disease (13Koch J. Gartner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D.

These ceramidases share significant homology, and this homology extends to putative proteins deduced from expressed sequence tag (EST)1 sequences ofDictyostelium discoideum and Arabidopsis thaliana(16Okino N.

These ceramidases have a broad pH optimum ranging from 5 to 9 for their activity (17Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

They appear to hydrolyze unsaturated ceramide preferentially, saturated ceramide (dihydroceramide) slightly, and hardly hydrolyze phytoceramide (17Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Pseudomonas, mouse, and human neutral ceramidases have a reverse ceramidase activity of catalyzing the formation of ceramide from sphingosine and a fatty acid (16Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A.

Recently, we cloned and characterized two Saccharomyces cerevisiae ceramidases YPC1p (20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and YDC1p (21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both had an alkaline pH optimum of 9.5–10 and are classified as alkaline ceramidases. YPC1p showed a preference for phytoceramide as a substrate, whereas YDC1p showed a preference for dihydroceramide. Neither hydrolyzed the unsaturated mammalian type ceramide. In addition, YPC1p showed considerable reverse ceramidase activity, catalyzing the formation of phytoceramide and dihydroceramide from a free fatty acid and sphingoids, whereas YDC1p had very minor reverse activity (20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that these two ceramidases were involved in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Deletion or overexpression of these ceramidases significantly altered the turnover of many sphingolipids including complex sphingolipids, free sphingoid bases, and their phosphates (20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, the critical role of these ceramidases in regulating sphingolipid metabolism is reflected by their localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where ceramides are generated and the synthetic enzymes of sphingolipids reside. Deletion of YDC1p increased cell tolerance to heat stress, which is in agreement with the established roles of sphingolipids in heat stress responses (10Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,22Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Because of the roles of these ceramidases in sphingolipid metabolism and their regulation of yeast heat stress, we elected to identify and characterize their mammalian counterparts. In this study, we report on the cloning and characterization of a novel human alkaline ceramidase based on sequence similarity. This new ceramidase shares many biochemical properties with the yeast ceramidases, although it lacks the reverse activity. It has an alkaline pH optimum and is activated by Ca2+. Interestingly, this enzyme hydrolyzes phytoceramide selectively. It shares neither sequence similarity nor substrate specificity with other mammalian ceramidases; therefore it represents a novel mammalian ceramidase, the first mammalian enzyme to be identified as being specific for hydrolysis of phytoceramide. d-erythro-Sphingosine,d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine, andd-ribo-phytosphingosine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.d-erythro-C12-NBD-4,5-dihydroceramide,d-ribo-C12-NBD-phytoceramide, andd-erythro-C12-NBD-ceramide were synthesized in our laboratory following the methods described by Marchesini et al. (25Marchesini S. Preti A. Aleo M.F. Casella A. Dagan A. Gatt S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 53: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HEK293 and COS-1 cell lines purchased from ATCC were respectively cultured in minimum essential medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Minimum essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA, PBS, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. HEK293 and COS-1 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the advanced BLAST program, the nonredundant data bases and the EST data bases in GenBank were searched for homologous sequences of the yeast alkaline ceramidases YPC1p and YDC1p. No significantly homologous sequences with known function were found. However, two mouse EST sequences (AA271224 andAI607051) and three human EST sequences (N57268, BF086933, andAI375670) were found to be highly homologous to the yeast YPC1p and YDC1p at the protein level. The three overlapping human EST sequences were assembled into a longer sequence using the software MacVector. The assembled sequence was used further to search the human EST data base, from which the longest sequence with a length of 1.8 kb was assembled. This 1.8-kb sequence contains a putative open reading frame encoding for a 200-amino acid polypeptide, which has 38% identity to the yeast ceramidases YPC1p and YDC1p. Several polyadenylation signals downstream of the stop codon and in-frame ATG codons were also found; however, there was no in-frame stop codon upstream of any of these ATG codons, suggesting that the translation initiation site ATG might not be included. To clone the full-length cDNA, 5′-RACE was performed using RACE ready marathon kidney cDNA (CLONTECH) as template, the gene-specific primer 5′-AAACTGGAGCGAAAGGAGGAGGGG-3′ and the adaptor primer AP1, and Advantage-GC2 DNA polymerase (CLONTECH, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first round PCR products were diluted 50-fold and used as the templates for the second round PCR using the gene-specific primer 5′-GCCATGAGCTAAACACCCAGCAGGCCCTAC-3′ and the adaptor primer AP2, thus resulting in a major 1.0-kb product that was cloned into a TA vector pCRII (Invitrogen, Inc.) and sequenced. Sequencing showed that 5′-RACE extended 87 nucleotides from the existing sequence. This extended sequence contains an in-frame ATG codon preceded by an in-frame stop codon. The flanking sequence of this ATG codon matches the Kozak consensus sequence, thus it is very likely to be the translation initiation codon. To obtain the 3′-end of the cDNA, 3′-RACE was performed using primer 5′-CAAGCACCTACCATAGACCTGGC-3′ and the adaptor primer AP1, which resulted in a single 2.7-kb PCR product. Sequencing showed that the 3′-RACE product was extended from the previously assembled sequence. The sequences of 5′- and 3′-RACE products were assembled into the full-length cDNA whose coding region was identified by the software MacVector. The full-length cDNA was amplified from a kidney cDNA library with primers 5′-TCGCCAGCCTAACCCGGCAC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTTCCCTTTCTGCTTCC-3′ using the Advantage-2 DNA polymerase, cloned into the vector pCRII, and sequenced. The human full-length cDNA was cloned downstream of the T7 promoter of the vector pCRII in the sense orientation. The resulting construct pCRII-aPHC was amplified inEscherichia coli and purified by a Midi-prep kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The trace RNase in the plasmid preparation was removed by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by chloroform. The in vitro translation was performed with the empty vector pCRII or the plasmid pCRII-aPHC (0.5 µg) as a template using a Single Tube Protein System 3 kit (Novagen, Inc.) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Translation products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass of the products was estimated according to prestained protein standards (Life Technologies, Inc.). A multiple human tissue mRNA blot (CLONTECH, Inc.) was hybridized with DNA probes radiolabeled by [32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine aPHC mRNA, the DNA probe spanning the entire coding region was generated by PCR. The actin mRNA probe was provided with the blot by the manufacturer and used for the normalization of cDNA from different tissues. Hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 or COS-1 cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and was subjected to RT-PCR analysis using a SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on human skin cDNA (Invitrogen, Inc) or a human multiple tissue cDNA panel (CLONTECH, Inc.) in which concentrations of cDNA reverse transcribed from mRNA of different tissues or organs were normalized to the mRNA expression levels of at least four different housekeeping genes. The PCR primers for determining aPHC mRNA were 5′-ATGTTCGGTGCAATTCAGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTTCTTTCGAAAGTTCCTCAGTG-3′ (reverse), which generated a 428-base pair product. PCR products were verified by sequencing. To generate a construct (pYES2-FLAG-aPHC) expressing the FLAG-tagged aPHC under the control of the GAL1 promoter, the coding sequence of aPHC was amplified by PCR using the template pCRII-aPHC and the primers 5′-GAAGATCTATGGCTCCGGCCGCGGACCGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAATGCTTCCTGAGAGGCTCAAAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes BglII andEcoRI and cloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pYES2-FLAG, which was constructed from pYES2 (Invitrogen, Inc.) by inserting the FLAG tag coding sequence (underlined) plus the Kozak sequence (ACC) and a start codon (ATG) 5′-ACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGATAAG-3′ into theHindIII and BamHI sites. The construct pYES2-FLAG-aPHC or the empty vector pYES2-FLAG was transformed into the yeast strain Δypc1Δydc1as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Expression of the FLAG-tagged aPHC was induced by 2% galactose in synthetic complete medium (SC-ura) with the omission of uracil as described. Microsomes were prepared from yeast cells as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To generate a construct pcDNA3.1(+) -FLAG-aPHC expressing the FLAG-tagged aPHC in mammalian cells, the plasmid pYES2-FLAG-aPHC was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI. TheHindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the coding sequence for the FLAG-aPHC fusion protein was isolated and cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+). The aPHC coding sequence was also cloned into the BglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 to create a construct pEGFP-aPHC expressing the GFP-tagged aPHC. Both constructs were sequenced and transfected into HEK293 or COS-1 cells. HEK293 or COS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-aPHC. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were fixed by 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice by PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked for 20 min with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and probed with a primary antibody anti-giantin (1:1000, Babco, Richmond, CA) followed by a secondary antibody donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with rhodamine (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus IX70) operated with an Ultraview software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that was set at the spinning disc mode. Cells (in a 10-cm culture dish) transfected with pcDNA 3.1(+) or pcDNA 3.1(+)-FLAG-aPHC were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml, Roche)) after being washed twice with PBS. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 5 min, and the resulting supernatant (containing ∼1 mg of protein) was incubated with 20 µg anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) for 1 h followed by 50 µl of protein A/G agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 additional h. The agarose beads were suspended in 50 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 4 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g after being washed four times with the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The FLAG-tagged aPHC was detected by the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) using an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ceramidase activity was assayed by using fluorescent NBD-C12-phytoceramide, ceramide, or dihydroceramide as substrate. NBD-ceramides (8 nmol) were dissolved in 20 µl of assay buffer A (25 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.4, containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40) and added to 20 µl of yeast microsomes (∼50 µg of proteins) or mammalian postnuclear cell lysates (∼15 µg of proteins) in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and the protease inhibitor mixture). For determining the pH optimum of enzymatic activity, the yeast microsomes were suspended in the buffer A but with 1 mm Tris-HCl instead. Enzymic reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and were stopped by boiling for 5 min. After the reactions were dried under a SpeedVac evaporator, lipids were dissolved in 35 µl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and 25 µl was spotted onto a TLC plate. The product NBD-C12-fatty acid was separated from the substrates by chloroform:methanol (90:30:0.5) and 25% ammonium hydroxide. The TLC plate was scanned by a PhosphorImager system (Storm 860) set at the fluorescence mode. NBD-fatty acid was identified by a standard and was analyzed by an Imagequant software. Both reaction time and protein concentrations were in the linear range of the assay. Reverse ceramidase activity was measured using [3H]palmitic acid and sphingoid bases as substrates as described (21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA (Pierce) or Bradford (Bio-Rad) protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast cells were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]inositol, and lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described (20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A human kidney cDNA, homologous to the yeast genes YPC1 (20Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and YDC1 (21Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at the protein level, was cloned by a combination of 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cDNA sequence was deposited in the GenBank with the accession number AF214454. The coding sequence of the cDNA was predicted using a MacVector program and is depicted in Fig. 1 A. The cDNA encodes a putative protein of 253 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31.6 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The deduced amino acid sequence of this putative protein was aligned to the yeast ceramidases and to putative proteins of A. thaliana andCaenorhabditis elegans. It exhibited 38% identity to the yeast ceramidases YPC1p and YDC1p and 28% identity to the putative proteins of A. thaliana and C. elegans (Fig.1 B). These proteins share several conserved regions, suggesting that these regions may be important for catalysis. Hydropathy plot showed that, similar to the yeast ceramidases, the putative human protein is a very hydrophobic protein (Fig.1 C). Five putative transmembrane domains were predicted by the pSORTII program (Fig. 1 A). Based on sequence similarity, this putative protein is postulated to be a ceramidase (aPHC).Figure 1Coding sequence and deduced protein sequence of the human aPHC. Panel A, the cDNA of the human aPHC was sequenced to completion on an Applied Biosystems sequencer. The coding region (plain letters) was predicted, and the encoded protein sequence (bold letters) was deduced by a MacVector software. Potential transmembrane domains (underlined) and a Golgi to ER retrieval-like sequence (double underlined) were predicted using the pSORTII program. Panel B, protein sequences were aligned using the ClustalW method. The alignment includes the deduced protein sequences of the yeast ceramidases YPC1p and YDC1p, the putative proteins ofA. thaliana and C. elegans, and the human homolog aPHC. Identical amino acids are shaded, and conserved regions areboxed. Panel C, the hydropathy was plotted by the Kyte/Doolittle method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that the cDNA does encode the predicted protein, we performed an in vitro translation with the full-length cDNA as a template in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translated product labeled by [35S]methionine was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. A single polypeptide band with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa was translated from the cDNA-containing plasmid but not from the empty vector (Fig. 2), indicating that the cDNA isolated from human kidney indeed encodes the protein (aPHC) as predicted. To determine the tissue distribution of the aPHC mRNA, we performed Northern blot analysis on mRNA from different tissues using the entire coding region as a probe. Fig.3 A shows that three transcripts with respective sizes of 3.4, 4.4, and 7.6 kb are expressed in most tissues or organs examined. All three transcripts were expressed most abundantly in placenta and least in skeletal muscle. The 7.6-kb transcript was also expressed considerably in heart, brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas. The 3.5- and 4.3-kb transcripts showed tissue distribution patterns similar to those of the 7.6-kb transcript but with a lesser abundance. The cloned cDNA is closest to the 3.4-kb transcript in size. Whether the other two transcripts are alternatively spliced products or alternative polyadenylation isoforms awaits further investigation. To investigate total mRNA levels of aPHC in the above organs, we performed PCR on a cDNA panel (CLONTECH, Inc.) reverse transcribed from the mRNA of different organs. A 428-base pair PCR product was generated by using the primers within the coding sequence. Fig. 3 Bshows that placenta had the highest expression, and skeletal muscle had the lowest. These data are consistent with those seen in the Northern blot analysis. To understand better the physiologic functions of aPHC, its cellular localization was studied. A"

Their islets show marked alpha (A)-cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible defect in glucagon processing (Furuta, M., Yano, H., Zhou, A., Rouille, Y., Holst, J., Carroll, R., Ravazzola, M., Orci, L., Furuta, H., and Steiner, D. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 6646–6651). In this report we have examined the biosynthesis and processing of proglucagon in isolated islets from these mice via pulse-chase labeling and find that proglucagon undergoes essentially no processing in chase periods up to 8 h in duration. Only a small percent of cleavage at the sensitive interdomain site (residues 71 and 72) appears to occur. These observations thus conclusively demonstrate the essentiality of PC2 for the production of glucagon in the islet A-cells. Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical studies indicate the presence of large amounts of proglucagon in atypical appearing secretory granules in the hyperplastic and hypertrophic A-cells, along with morphological evidence of high rates of proglucagon secretion in PC2 null islets. These findings provide strong evidence that active glucagon is required to maintain normal blood glucose levels, counterbalancing the action of insulin at all times.

They are members of a larger family of converting proteases of the secretory pathway and have specialized features directing their sorting into the acidic dense core vesicles of the regulated secretory pathway.

The production of mature glucagon and somatostatin is also impaired as might be anticipated if PC2 plays a role in proglucagon processing to selectively release glucagon, as postulated by Rouillé et al. (12Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Rouillé Y. Bianchi M. Irminger J.-C. Halban P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mammalian proglucagon protein contains three homologous hormonal sequences, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) (14Bell G.I. Santerre R.F. Mullenback G.T. Nature. 1983; 302: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 15Heinrich G. Gros P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10487-14082Google Scholar). These are arranged in this order in proglucagon but are separated by two intervening peptides, IP-1 and IP-2, and preceded by an N-terminal extension called glicentin-related polypeptide (GRPP) (see Fig. 1). At either end of each peptide, pairs of basic amino acids (Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg) are present representing sites of cleavage by the prohormone convertases PC2 or PC3/PC1 in the proglucagon-expressing islet A-cells or intestinal L-cells, respectively. In the islets of Langerhans, proglucagon is synthesized in the A-cells and processed to glucagon, GRPP, IP-1, and major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), which contains the unprocessed GLP-1, IP-2, and GLP-2 sequences (12Rouillé Y.

Only very low levels of GLP-1 are generated in the A-cells, whereas GLP-1 and -2 are major products of proglucagon processing in L-cells, along with glicentin, the intact N-terminal domain that contains unprocessed glucagon (17Holst J.J.

The identity of the prohormone convertases responsible for the A-cell phenotype has been investigated in several laboratories (6Schäfer M.K.-H. Day R. Cullinan W.E. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Watson S.J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1258-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marcinkiewicz M. Ramla D. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M.

Cytol. 1996; 59: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proglucagon processing has been examined in a number of cell lines expressing PC2, PC3, or both convertases with proglucagon by coexpression techniques, and these studies have suggested that PC2 generates the A-cell-processing phenotype (12Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Rouillé Y. Bianchi M. Irminger J.-C. Halban P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, other investigators have reported that PC2 acting alone is not able to generate mature glucagon (20Dhanvantari S. Seidah N.G. Brubaker P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Rothenberg M.E. Eilertson C.D. Klein K. Mackin R.B. Noe B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Some of these discrepancies may have arisen because of low levels of expression of PC2 obtained in transfection experiments or low levels of activity in partially purified preparations of the recombinant enzyme used for in vitro studies. To circumvent some of these problems we report here studies on the biosynthesis of glucagon in the islets of PC2 null mice. Our earlier studies of these mice indicated the presence of high levels of circulating glucagon-related peptides but little or no mature glucagon (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We also noted an increased number (hyperplasia) of the A-cells consistent with a block in the production of glucagon. The present studies provide a more detailed analysis of the structural changes and the nature of the proglucagon processing defects in the A-cells in the absence of active PC2. The PC2 null mutant mouse line was generated as described previously (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). For all experiments, 8–12-week-old mutant mice (PC2−/−) and control littermates (PC2+/+) of the same age were used. The care of animals used in these studies was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and Institutional guidelines. Antisera prepared in rabbits against glucagon (P7) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Polonsky (University of Chicago) and against GLP-1 (K2135) by Dr. J. J. Holst (Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen). Both antisera recognize extended forms of their respective targets. They were used for immunoprecipitation. Antisera used for immunocytochemistry were rabbit anti-porcine C-terminal glucagon (code 15k from R. H. Unger, Dallas, Texas) and rabbit antiporcine N-terminal glucagon (code K6248 from L. Heding, Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark). Antibodies were diluted 1:100 and 1:200, respectively. Islet total RNA was prepared using the acid-guanidinim thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform procedure. Because PC2−/− islets are larger than PC2+/+ islets due to the thick mantle of A-cells the amounts of total RNA extracted from the same number of islets from each genotype were different. Total RNA from PC2−/− islets was about 10-fold more abundant than from PC2+/+ islets. 15 µg of total RNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis through a 1.4% agarose, 0.66m formaldehyde gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, hybridized with random-primed mouse glucagon cDNA, amplified, and labeled with [32P]dCTP by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for mouse glucagon. After overnight hybridization at 42 °C, the filter was washed with washing buffer (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 55 °C and autoradiographed. Band intensity was measured in the PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Islets of Langerhans were isolated as described (22Lernmark A. Nathans A. Steiner D. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 606-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were cultured overnight in RPMI medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. After overnight culture, control and mutant islets were labeled in groups of 300–400 in 100 µl of pulse medium (11Furuta M. Carroll R. Martin S. Swift H. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Steiner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3431-3437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) containing 2.8 mmglucose, 500 µCi (1 µCi = 37 GBq) each of [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol), [3H]leucine (300 µCi/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Islets were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min. Islets were then washed, divided into four batches, and chase-incubated for 2, 4, and 8 h in medium containing 2.8 mm glucose, 20 µg each of unlabeled methionine and leucine, and 500 units/ml Trasylol. After the pulse and chase incubations, the islets were washed and then sonicated briefly in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.05m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaC1, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 10 µm pepstatin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 units/ml Trasylol, and 1 mm EDTA). The sonicate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed on islet lysates or media. Samples were precleared by addition of 2 µl of normal rabbit serum followed by 10 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Pierce). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipita-tion using glucagon or GLP-1 antibodies. After the antibody was added, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, 30 µl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose immunocomplex was then washed twice with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were then heated for 5 min at 95 °C in 50 µl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography. Pancreatic tissue was obtained from wild type and PC2−/− mice fixed by vascular perfusion with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer. For conventional electron microscopy, tissue was postfixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 2% OsO4, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Thin sections containing islets of Langerhans were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips CM10 electron microscope. For immunofluorescence, the postfixation with OsO4 was omitted. Semithin sections, about 1 µm thick, were etched to remove the epoxy resin (23Maxwell M.H. J. Microsci. 1978; 112: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and then incubated with antiglucagon antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Cell size was estimated on immunofluorescent sections by measuring the diameter of A-cells sectioned across their nucleus. Values were expressed as mean ± S.E. of 50 cells in each wild type and mutant mouse. For cryoimmunocytochemistry, islets of Langerhans were dissected from the exocrine pancreatic tissue, embedded in 12% gelatin, and cryoprotected with 2.3 m sucrose before freezing with liquid nitrogen and sectioning with a cryoultramicrotome. Thin sections were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and labeled with protein A-gold for 30 min. Groups of isolated islets were metabolically labeled for 30 min followed by chase incubations for 2, 4, and 8 h. Glucagon-related peptides produced during these pulse-chase studies were immunoprecipitated and identified after electrophoresis and fluorography. Both antisera used for immunoprecipitation recognize N- and C-terminally extended forms of either glucagon or GLP-1. In the PC2+/+ islets, some processing of proglucagon into glucagon-related components was already evident at the end of the 30-min pulse period (see Fig. 2, panel A). The number and size of the bands observed corresponded well to those identified previously in α TC1–6 cells (12Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), consisting of 18-kDa proglucagon, 9-kDa glicentin, 7.5-kDa GRPP-glucagon, 4.5-kDa oxyntomodulin, and 3.4-kDa glucagon (see Fig.1). The amount of all the processed peptides reached a peak after 2 h of chase incubation and then gradually decreased. In contrast, in PC2−/− islets a major proglucagon band appeared that persisted throughout the 8-h chase period (Fig.2, panel B). In addition trace amounts of a 14.3-kDa peptide tentatively identified as a C-terminally extended form of glicentin (Gli-GLP-1) appeared at 2 h, followed by small amounts of glicentin, which reached a maximum at 4 h and then decreased. GRPP-glucagon, oxyntomodulin, or glucagon were not detected even after 8 h of chase incubation, in either islets (Fig. 2, panel A) or media (Fig. 2, panel C). The components of islet immunoprecipitates using GLP-1 antisera are shown in Fig. 2, panel B. In the PC2+/+ islets, large amounts of 8-kDa MPGF were produced, reaching a maximum after 2 h of chase. In PC2−/− islets, the major band at all times was proglucagon (Fig. 2, panel B). The 14.3-kDa extended form and 8-kDa MPGF, which both peaked at 4 h of chase, were also evident but at much lower levels. No GLP-1 was seen. In the medium of the mutant islets large amounts of proglucagon and a small amount of MPGF were seen, peaking at 4 h. Because the conditions used were stimulatory to secretion from A-cells (2.8 mm glucose), it is very likely that this represents regulated release of proglucagon from secretory granules (see below). The lack of detectable amounts of glucagon in the PC2+/+ chase medium (Fig. 2,panel C), which contains trace amounts of proglucagon and glicentin, may be because of losses of mature glucagon during fixation of gels or to its greater susceptibility to nonspecific proteolytic degradation after secretion. The tendency of secreted proglucagon to peak at 4 h of chase in both PC2+/+ and PC2−/− islet media is most consistent with regulated secretion, although a small component of constitutive secretion of the prohormone cannot be ruled out. Our earlier findings indicated that the A-cell population in PC2−/−pancreatic islets is greatly expanded because of hyperplasia of these cells (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it was of interest to determine the level of preproglucagon mRNA by Northern analysis. These results, shown in Fig. 3, indicate a marked increase in proglucagon mRNA abundance in mutant islets, being roughly 6- to 7-fold greater than in normal islets. Islet lysates from wild type or PC3 null mice were electrophoresed on 12 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels to examine proglucagon and its processed products, or PC3 levels. The results of immunoblotting with glucagon antiserum P7 are shown in Fig.4 A and confirm the results of the pulse-chase studies, indicating the presence in PC2 null islets only of large amounts of intact proglucagon and traces of the 14.3-kDa component described above. In contrast, in normal islet lysates, the proglucagon band is greatly reduced, and a faint mature glucagon band is also visible. This result was further confirmed by Coomasie Blue staining, which gave a visible proglucagon band only in PC2 null islet lysates (data not shown). Immunoblots for PC3 shown in Fig.4 B revealed significantly reduced levels of PC3 in PC2 null mice, indicating that a lack of active PC2 in the non-β-cell population of the islets does not result in induction of expression of PC3 in these cells. Indeed, the diminished levels seen in the null islets are consistent with the observed reduction in β-cell activity and mass in these chronically hypoglycemic animals (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A.

Studies by light and electron microscopy of A-cells in the mutant mice indicated hyperplasia of the A-cells (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Here we found that the cells are also enlarged in size (hypertrophy). The diameter of mutant A-cells was 13.5 ± 0.3 µm versus 9.3 ± 0.2 µm in wild type. The increase of cell size in mutant mice was accompanied by the accumulation of large numbers of atypical secretory granules. These have a homogeneous content filling the granule space rather than the usual dense core surrounded by a clear peripheral halo (Fig. 5, A andB). Immunocytochemical analysis reveals that unlike mature granules of the wild type A-cells (Fig. 5 C), the atypical granules react weakly to antisera specific for mature glucagon (Fig.5 D). However, these granules react strongly with antisera to glicentin/glucagon (Fig. 5 F), indicating the presence of higher molecular weight forms. In addition, ultrastructural analysis provides evidence for intense rates of exocytosis of the proglucagon-rich granules from the PC2 null A-cells (Fig.6).Figure 6Thin sections of pancreatic A-cells from wild type (A) and PC2−/− (B–F) mice reveal morphologic differences of the secretory granules and exocytotic events. Secretory granules in wild type (A,arrowheads) have a distinct halo surrounding the dense core. The halo is absent in mutant mice (B,arrowheads), and the dense core extends to the secretory granules membrane. In the mutant mice, as compared with the wild type, the exocytotic figures are frequent (arrows). On electron micrographs, 39 exocytotic events were recorded in 117 A-cells of mutant mice, versus only two events in 109 A-cells of wild type mice. In addition to single granule exocytosis (B), images suggesting compound exocytosis involving several secretory granules are detectable (C, arrows).

In the absence of active PC2 in the mutant mice, large amounts of glucagon-like immunoreactivity are present in the plasma, but fractionation of the plasma reveals only larger precursor material and no detectable mature glucagon (data not shown). In keeping with the lack of circulating active glucagon, the animals are chronically hypoglycemic and have reduced and flattened glucose-tolerance curves (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the A-cells are interpreted as responses to feedback stimulation arising from the chronic hypoglycemia and/or hypoinsulinemia. The β-cell population is reduced, and the requirement for insulin is clearly significantly decreased in the absence of glucagon, indicating the existence of a normal tonic balance between the two hormones (24Brand C.L. Jorgensen P.N. Svendsen I. Holst J.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fractionation of PC2 null pancreatic extracts by gel filtration reveals complex mixtures of high molecular weight products, some of which may have arisen through autolysis or through autophagy of proglucagon-containing α-granules (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the biosynthesis of glucagon in pulse-chase labeling experiments to ascertain the extent of the processing defect more accurately. The experiments presented here reveal that in chases up to 8 h, less than 5% of the proglucagon is cleaved at the interdomain site (between residues 71 and 72) to give rise to glicentin and MPGF. There is no detectable production of glucagon, oxyntomodulin, GLP-1, or other smaller processing products. Although other investigators have raised questions as to whether PC2 acting alone is capable of cleaving glucagon from proglucagon, especially cleavage at the N terminus of the glucagon sequence in the precursor (20Dhanvantari S. Seidah N.G. Brubaker P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Rothenberg M.E. Eilertson C.D. Klein K. Mackin R.B. Noe B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the action of another convertase is not likely. If another convertase were required for cleavage after GRPP (see Fig. 1) relatively large quantities of glucagon extended at its C terminus would be expected. However, if prior cleavage at the interdomain site is necessary to produce fragments that are susceptible to this convertase, then one would expect that instead of glicentin, one would see oxyntomodulin and MPGF as the minor products, rather than glicentin and MPGF as we observe. Thus it seems highly unlikely that any other convertases will be found to be involved in the processing of proglucagon to glucagon in vivo. Although it is conceivable that the small amounts of glicentin and MPGF seen in the pulse-chase experiments in mutant islets might be produced by very small amounts of active PC2 arising from the truncated pro-PC2 that is produced in the PC2−/− mice (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), it is more likely that low levels of other convertases such as PC3 or PC6A may be responsible (25De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Proglucagon processing is similarly severely inhibited in mice lacking 7B2, a neuroendocrine secretory protein that is required for the production of active PC2 from pro-PC2 (26Westphal C. Muller L. Zhou A. Zhu X. Bonner-Weir S. Steiner D. Lindberg I. Leder P. Cell. 1999; 96: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another important point emerging from the studies reported here is that proglucagon is secreted into the medium in large amounts, and this seems to reflect the situation in vivo, where large amounts of proglucagon-related forms are present in the circulation in the null mice. This does not, however, mean that proglucagon is being secreted via constitutive pathways; rather the evidence from the morphological studies presented here indicate that the secretory granules contain very large amounts of proglucagon and other precursor-related products and that exocytotic events are markedly increased, indicating that this is the main source of the secreted precursor forms. These findings indicate that the absence of active PC2 does not influence developmental processes in the neuroendocrine system but rather influences the postnatal production and maturation of multiple regulatory peptides, including the neuropeptides melanin-concentrating hormone (27Viale A.

The yeast ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p, a homologue of mammalian Nedd4 and Itch, is required for the ubiquitination and subsequent internalization of multiple plasma membrane proteins, including the α-factor receptor (Ste2p). Here we demonstrate that Rsp5p plays multiple roles at the internalization step of endocytosis. Temperature-sensitive rsp5 mutant cells were defective in the internalization of α-factor by a Ste2p-ubiquitin chimera, a receptor that does not require post-translational ubiquitination. Similarly, a modified version of Ste2p bearing a NPFXD linear peptide sequence as its only internalization signal was not internalized in rsp5 cells. Internalization of these variant receptors was dependent on the catalytic cysteine residue of Rsp5p and on ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that bind Rsp5p. Thus, a Rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination event is required for internalization mediated by ubiquitin-dependent and -independent endocytosis signals. Constitutive Ste2p-ubiquitin internalization and fluid-phase endocytosis also required active ubiquitination machinery, including Rsp5p. These observations indicate that Rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination of a trans-acting protein component of the endocytosis machinery is required for the internalization step of endocytosis.

Two characterized functions of protein ubiquitination are to target proteins for degradation by the cytosolic 26 S proteasome or to promote the internalization of cell surface proteins into the endocytic pathway. Recognition of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome generally requires modification with a polyubiquitin chain of at least four ubiquitin subunits (1Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D.

Protein ubiquitination is catalyzed by a cascade of three enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 9Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar and 10Weissman A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s)1 activate ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction, forming a high-energy thiolester bond with ubiquitin. The activated ubiquitin is then passed to a cysteine residue in a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Normally, E2s function together with ubiquitin ligases (E3s) to catalyze isopeptide bond formation between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and ε-amino groups in lysine side chains of specific substrates. E3s bind directly to substrates and comprise the major specificity determinants of the ubiquitination machinery. There are two major classes of E3s. One class carries a RING finger domain, and the other carries a hect (homologous toE6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain. RING finger E3s function as adapter proteins, bringing the substrate to the ubiquitin-charged E2, whereas E3s of the hect domain family participate directly in catalysis by forming a thiolester with ubiquitin during the ubiquitination reaction. Ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis regulates the cell surface activities of diverse plasma membrane proteins (reviewed in Refs. 11Hicke L.

In yeast, ubiquitin is a widely used endocytosis signal that promotes the internalization of plasma membrane proteins such as peptide pheromone receptors, transporters, and nutrient permeases. In mammalian cells, ubiquitin and the ubiquitination machinery regulate the endocytosis of the growth hormone receptor, epithelial sodium channel, epidermal growth factor receptor, and colony-stimulating factor receptor (13Strous G. van Kerkhof P.

In addition, many more mammalian signal-transducing receptors are known to undergo ligand-stimulated ubiquitination (reviewed in Ref. 17Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The mammalian hect domain E3s Nedd4 and Itch recognize and ubiquitinate the epithelial sodium channel and Notch, respectively (14Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A.

Rsp5p, a homologue of Nedd4 and Itch, promotes the regulated ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins in yeast (reviewed in Ref.21Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rsp5p is an essential protein that is implicated in a number of cellular processes in addition to its role in endocytosis. Rsp5p carries an amino-terminal C2 domain, three WW protein-protein interaction domains, and a carboxyl-terminal hect catalytic domain. Structure-function analyses have indicated that the WW domains of Rsp5p play an important role in its endocytic function (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Gajewska B. Kaminska J. Jesionowska A. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Zoladek T. Genetics. 2001; 157: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar). All three WW domains are required for normal rates of stimulated internalization of the α-factor receptor Ste2p and the uracil permease Fur4p, implicating these domains in the recognition of endocytic substrates (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Gajewska B. Kaminska J. Jesionowska A. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Zoladek T. Genetics. 2001; 157: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the C2 domain in endocytosis is less clear. Deletion of this domain has no effect on Ste2p internalization, but causes an increase in Gap1p and Fur4p activities at the cell surface and delayed fluid-phase endocytic transport to the vacuole (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Springael J.Y. De Craene J.O. André B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3564-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the C2 domain may be required for the internalization of a subset of plasma membrane proteins and/or may be involved in sorting within the endocytic pathway. Observations in both yeast and mammalian cells have suggested that the role of ubiquitin in endocytosis may extend beyond its function as an appended internalization signal. The UbE motif, an endocytosis signal in the growth hormone receptor (GHR), is required for GHR internalization by a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway (26Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves Dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because UbE-dependent internalization does not require ubiquitination sites in the receptor, Govers et al.(26Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) suggested that the binding of the ubiquitination machinery to the UbE motif, not ubiquitination of the GHR itself, is the critical event for internalization. Association of the ubiquitination machinery with the receptor may be required to recruit endocytic proteins to the GHR, or the ubiquitination machinery may modify a receptor-associated regulatory protein (26Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Endocytic proteins are known to be substrates of the ubiquitin system. Eps15, an essential component of the clathrin-based endocytic machinery, undergoes epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated monoubiquitination in fibroblasts (28van Delft S. Govers R. Strous G. Verkleij A. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila have suggested that cell fate specification in the compound eye requires specific deubiquitination of Liquid facets, the Drosophila orthologue of the endocytic protein epsin (29Cadavid A.L. Ginzel A. Fischer J.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1727-1736PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, a rsp5 mutant lacking an intact C2 domain could ubiquitinate the Gap1 amino acid permease normally but was defective in permease down-regulation (24Springael J.Y. De Craene J.O. André B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the requirement for Rsp5p in endocytosis cannot be fully explained by its role in modifying specific cargo proteins. As a model for the function of ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases in the down-regulation of plasma membrane proteins, we have studied the role of Rsp5p in the internalization of the yeast α-factor receptor, Ste2p. Ste2p is a MATa cell-specific G-protein-coupled receptor that initiates an intracellular signal required for yeast mating in response to α-factor binding (reviewed in Ref. 30Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ligand binding also induces the sequential hyperphosphorylation and ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, modifications that trigger rapid receptor internalization (31Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 32Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). After internalization, receptors are delivered to the lysosome-like vacuole, where they are permanently inactivated by degradation (33Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of lysines in the receptor cytoplasmic domain or mutations that impair Rsp5p or the Ubc1p/Ubc4p/Ubc5p E2s disrupt the ubiquitination and internalization of Ste2p (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination by Rsp5p is sufficient to induce Ste2p internalization, since fusion of a single ubiquitin moiety to the cytoplasmic domain rescues the defective internalization of a receptor lacking post-translational ubiquitination sites (4Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The internalization information in ubiquitin has been mapped to two distinct hydrophobic patches on the surface of the ubiquitin molecule (34Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which ubiquitin induces internalization is undefined. In this study, we used α-factor receptor variants that do not require post-translational ubiquitin modification to uncover a novel function of Rsp5p in endocytosis that is distinct from its role in ubiquitination of plasma membrane cargo. We found that the Rsp5p catalytic cysteine, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and free cellular ubiquitin were required for internalization mediated by ubiquitin-dependent and -independent endocytosis signals. Our results indicate that Rsp5p has two distinct roles at the internalization step of endocytosis: the regulated ubiquitination of cargo proteins and the ubiquitination of a component of the constitutive endocytic machinery. This study demonstrates a requirement for trans-acting ubiquitination in endocytosis and identifies Rsp5p and Ubc1p/Ubc4p/Ubc5p as the enzymatic machinery required for this event. The genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Cells were propagated in synthetic minimal (SD) medium (35Sherman F.

Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). To generate the ste2-NPFXD mutant, the mutation G392N was introduced into a mutant ste2 (ste2–7xR) with Lys to Arg mutations at amino acids 337, 352, 358, 374, 387, 400, and 422 (4Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To generate ste2-All Lys, the F394A mutation was introduced into pJR3 (41Rohrer J. Bénédetti H. Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) by PCR mutagenesis. Sequences encoding Ste2p-NPFXD and Ste2p-All Lys were subsequently subcloned into the centromeric plasmid YCplac33 (42Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) resulting in LHP426 and LHP427, respectively. Construction of ste2-ubi (LHP361) andste2–378Stop (LHP147) has been described previously (4Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The ste2-ubi construct used in this study contains a singleubiK48R ubiquitin fused after amino acid 376 of the receptor. ste2-ubi and ste2–378Stop were introduced at the ura3 locus of yeast strains by single-step gene transplacement. PCR-derived sequences were verified by automated and/or manual DNA sequencing. All ste2 variants were able to complement the mating defect of ste2Δ cells.RSP5 plasmids were based on the yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pRS414 (43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of the HA-taggedRSP5 (LHP478) and rsp5-C777A (LHP510) plasmids has been described (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). α-Factor internalization assays were performed as described (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Specific variations in growth conditions and assays are indicated in the figure legends. Cells were grown to early logarithmic phase, harvested by centrifugation, and suspended in YPUAD medium at 5 × 108 cells/ml. For continuous presence assays, cells were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature for 15 min prior to the addition of 35S-labeled α-factor. For pulse-chase internalization assays, 35S-labeled α-factor was bound to cells on ice for 45–60 min. Unbound radioactivity was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C, and internalization was initiated by the addition of media warmed to 30 °C or 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends. Percentage of internalization is expressed as the ratio of internalized to total cell-associated radioactivity. For unknown reasons, ubc1Δ ubc4Δ cells expressed a low level of α-factor binding sites. Loss of Ubc1p and Ubc4p has also been reported to cause a decrease in maltose permease expression (44Medintz I. Jiang H. Michels C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34454-34462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For this reason, internalization assays depicted in Fig.5 A were corrected by subtracting nonspecific cell-associated radioactivity that bound to ste2Δ cells under the same conditions. This correction did not significantly alter the results of the assay but allowed a more accurate measurement of initial internalization rates. Receptor clearance assays were performed as described (32Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with the following changes: Cells were shifted to 37 °C at the same time as the addition of cycloheximide to 10 µg/ml. The 0-min time point was taken 30 min after cycloheximide treatment was initiated to allow Ste2p en route through the biosynthetic pathway to reach the cell surface. The number of α-factor receptor binding sites present on the cell surface at each time point was determined by binding with a mix of35S-labeled α-factor and ∼3 × 108m unlabeled α-factor to ensure that α-factor binding sites were saturated in each sample. Lucifer Yellow (LY) endocytosis assays were performed as described previously (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As indicated in the figure legends, cells were shifted to 37 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of 10 µl of 40 mg/ml Lucifer Yellow CH (Fluka Chemika-Biochemika, Switzerland), or LY was immediately added at 30 °C. After 60 min of incubation, the assay was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate/stop buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mmsodium azide, 10 mm sodium fluoride). Cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets. Lysates for Ste2p immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (31Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in SD medium to early logarithmic phase, harvested by centrifugation, and transferred to YPUAD medium. Cells were incubated 12.5 min at 37 °C before treatment with 1 × 10−6m α-factor for 8 min. Cells were not treated with cycloheximide. Lysis was achieved by mechanical agitation with glass beads in urea/SDS buffer containing 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit isopeptidase activities in the extract. Lysates were supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (2%) and bromphenol blue (0.002%) and incubated at 37 °C for 10–15 min prior to loading. Extracts used for detecting HA-Rsp5p in Fig. 4 A were prepared by an alkaline lysis protocol as described (45Horvath A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (22Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ste2p-Ub is a chimeric, functional α-factor receptor that lacks post-translational ubiquitination sites but carries a monoubiquitin moiety fused in-frame to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Fig.1). We have shown previously that the fused ubiquitin moiety is sufficient to signal internalization (4Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 34Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because the internalization of Ste2p-Ub does not require post-translational ubiquitin conjugation, we hypothesized that Ste2p-Ub internalization would not depend on Rsp5p. To test this idea, we compared the internalization of Ste2p-Ub with a receptor that carries the same tail sequence but lacks a fused ubiquitin and requires post-translational ubiquitination for internalization (Ste2p-378Stop, see Fig. 1). The ability of these receptors to internalize α-factor was examined in the rsp5–2 temperature-sensitive mutant and in wild-type cells (Fig. 2). Both Ste2p-Ub and Ste2p-378Stop were internalized rapidly in wild-type cells. Consistent with previous observations, rsp5–2 cells were unable to internalize Ste2p-378Stop. The internalization of Ste2p-Ub in rsp5–2 cells was also defective, although it occurred more rapidly than the internalization of Ste2p-378Stop. These data suggest that fusion of ubiquitin to the receptor partially relieves the requirement for Rsp5p in receptor internalization, consistent with its role in appending ubiquitin to activated receptors, but that Rsp5p is also required downstream of receptor modification.Figure 2Rsp5p is required for the internalization of a Ste2p-ubiquitin chimera. Plasmids encoding Ste2p-Ub and Ste2p-378Stop were introduced into rsp5–2 ste2Δ andRSP5 ste2Δ cells. Continuous presence α-factor internalization assays were performed at 37 °C. Cells were grown in YPUAD medium at 24 °C and were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled α-factor.

In addition to ubiquitin, a linear aromatic residue-based sequence, NPFXD, that is present in the cytosolic domain of thea-factor receptor, Ste3p, can act as an efficient internalization signal (46Tan P.K. Howard J.P. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A weak version of the NPFXD signal, GPFAD, is present in the cytoplasmic tail of wild-type Ste2p. 2J. Howard and G. Payne, personal communication. To analyze receptor endocytosis that is mediated solely by the NPFXD signal, we generated a mutant receptor with all tail ubiquitination sites mutated to Arg and with the mutation G392N to convert the GPFAD sequence to a strong NPFXD signal (Ste2p-NPFXD, Fig. 1). Ste2p-NPFXD is internalized with kinetics similar to wild-type Ste2p (see Fig.3 B).2 To confirm that Ste2p-NPFXD does not undergo ligand-stimulated ubiquitination at the cell surface, we expressed Ste2p-NPFXD and wild-type Ste2p in an end4–1 mutant. Theend4–1 mutation causes a complete block in the internalization step of endocytosis at 37 °C (47Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J.

https://openalex.org/W2042570182,"We have shown previously that activation of the heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) gene by hypoxia in aortic smooth muscle cells is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). In mutant (Ka13) Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking HIF activity, accumulation of ho-1 mRNA in response to hypoxia and the hypoxia-mimetic CoCl2 was similar to that observed in wild type (K1) cells. These results support the existence of HIF-dependent and HIF-independent mechanisms forho-1 gene activation by hypoxia and CoCl2. In Ka13 cells, CoCl2 stimulated expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 15-kilobase pair mouseho-1 promoter (pHO15luc). Mutation analyses identified the cobalt-responsive sequences as the stress-response elements (StREs). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, two specific StRE-protein complexes were observed using extracts from Ka13 cells. In response to cobalt, the level of the slower migrating complex X increased, whereas that of complex Y decreased, in a time-dependent manner. Members of the AP-1 superfamily of basic-leucine zipper factors bind to the StRE. Antibody supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays did not detect Jun, Fos, or ATF/CREB proteins but identified Nrf2 and the small Maf protein, MafG, as components of complex X. Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of Nrf2 and small Maf, but not of other bZIP factors, attenuated cobalt-mediated gene activation. Additional experiments demonstrated that induction by cobalt does not result from increased expression of MafG or regulated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 but is dependent on cellular oxidative stress. Unlike cobalt, hypoxia did not stimulate pHO15luc expression and did not increase StRE binding activity, indicating distinct mechanisms for ho-1 gene activation by cobalt and hypoxia in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

These proteins include: erythropoietin (EPO),1 which stimulates erythropoiesis and the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and one of its receptors Flt-1, which promote angiogenesis and the delivery of oxygen carrying blood to hypoxic sites; and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) and various glycolytic enzymes that provide for increased energy production through glycolysis during periods of reduced energy production via oxidative phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 1Wenger R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia-dependent expression of these and other proteins is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Transcriptional regulation of many hypoxia-responsive genes is critically dependent on a common cis-acting sequence, the hypoxia response element (HRE), and the trans-acting factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric protein comprising α and β subunits. The α subunit is unique to HIF-1, whereas the β subunit is shared by other transcription factors, most notably the arylhydrocarbon receptor. In addition to hypoxia, certain transition metals such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese, and the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) also stimulate expression of several hypoxia-responsive proteins including EPO, VEGF, phosphoglycerokinase 1, and Glut-1. These agents are considered to be hypoxia mimetics as they are proposed to exploit the cellular oxygen sensing mechanism or the hypoxia signal transduction pathway for gene activation. Consistent with this idea, cobalt and DFO stimulate HIF-1 activity and the HRE is required for target gene induction by these agents (reviewed in Refs. 1Wenger R.H. J. Exp.

HO-1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction in heme catabolism, the oxidative cleavage of b-type heme molecules to yield equimolar quantities of biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by the action of biliverdin reductase. Both biliverdin and bilirubin are potent antioxidants, and CO has been shown to function as a neuronal messenger and a vasodilator (reviewed in Refs. 8Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar and 9Durante W. Schafer A.I. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that CO modulates other cellular activities including signal transduction pathways (10Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Lu H.T. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (11Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M. Soares M.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In addition to hypoxia and cobalt, expression of HO-1 is widely induced by a variety of oxidative stress-associated agents including the substrate heme, inflammatory cytokines, heavy metals, hyperthermia, and UV irradiation (reviewed in Ref. 12Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Because of its inducibility and the pleiotropic properties of the reaction products, HO-1 manifests potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and helps maintain cellular homeostasis in response to stress and injury. Stimulation of HO-1 expression by most inducers is controlled primarily at the level of gene transcription, and we have previously identified two 5′ distal enhancer regions, E1 and E2, within the mouseho-1 promoter that mediate gene activation by a variety of pro-oxidants (12Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Both E1 and E2 contain multiple copies of a motif, termed the stress response element (StRE), that are sufficient and necessary for gene activation by multiple agents including heme, cadmium, and various xenobiotics (13Inamdar N.M. Ahn Y.I. Alam J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Prestera T. Talalay P. Alam J. Ahn Y.I. Lee P.J. Choi A.M.K. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the mouse ho-1 promoter identified two sequence elements distinct from the StREs that resembled the consensus HRE. These elements bound HIF-1 and mediated hypoxia-dependent activation of a reporter gene in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating that HREs and HIF-1 regulate HO-1 expression in response to hypoxia (15Lee P.J.

In contrast to these findings, Wood et al. (16Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have developed mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking the HIF-1α subunit and demonstrated that, although activation of certain hypoxia-responsive genes such asglut-1 is attenuated in these cells, induction of HO-1 mRNA by hypoxia and cobalt is not impaired. One explanation for the inducibility of HO-1 in these cells is the possibility of the more recently characterized HIF-2α (17Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. William C. Eckardt K.-U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HIF-3α (18Gu Y.Z. Moran S.M. Hogenesch J.B. Wartman L. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar) subunits to compensate for the HIF-1α deficiency. The mutant CHO cells, however, do not express HIF-2α and otherwise do not exhibit inducible HRE binding activity or HRE-dependent transcription activity (16Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M.

Taken together, these results imply the existence of both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent mechanisms forho-1 activation by hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics. We have used the mutant CHO cells to characterize the HIF-1-independent mechanism. Here we show that induction by cobalt, but not by hypoxia, is mediated by the StREs and the heterodimeric transcription factor Nrf2·MafG. Indirect evidence suggests that induction by hypoxia in CHO cells may not occur at the level of gene transcription.

The dominant mutant of JunD (pCMV/JunDM) was constructed by cloning the 591-base pairBssHII/BssHII (blunt-ended) fragment of the mouse JunD cDNA into the vector pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). This manipulation deletes amino acid residues 1–169, resulting in atrans-activation domain-deficient mutant of JunD similar to one described previously (23Hirai S.I. Ryseck R.-P. Mechta F. Bravo R.

The Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gdbd) vector (pEG) was constructed by cloning the Gdbd (residues 1–147) into pEF/myc/mito (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA). Full-length mouse Nrf2 or human MafG cDNAs were subsequently cloned downstream of, and in frame with, the Gdbd to generate pEG/Nrf2 and pEG/MafG, respectively. Plasmid pFRluc, containing five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site, was obtained from Stratagene. Plasmid pCMVβ-gal encodes Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and was used to monitor transfection. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were subjected to hypoxia in a controlled atmosphere chamber (Billups-Rothenburg; Del Mar, CA) supplied with a constant flow of a hydrated 1% O2, 5%CO2, balanced N2 gas mixture. Hypoxic exposures were performed as cells approached 75–90% confluence. Transient transfections of luciferase reporter gene constructs were carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (26Alam J. Maines M.D. Costa L.G. Reed D.J.

For calcium phosphate transfections, cells were seeded (4 × 105/well) in six-well plates and cells in each well were transfected with a DNA mixture consisting of 1 µg of the luciferase plasmid, 0.5 µg of pCMVβ-gal, and 3.5 µg of pBluescriptII SK- (Stratagene). For Fugene6 transfections, cells were seeded (2 × 105/well) in 12-well plates and cells in each well were transfected with a DNA mixture consisting of 50 ng of the luciferase plasmid, 10 ng of pCMVβ-gal, and, where indicated (see Figs. 6 and 7 D), 50 ng of the dominant-negative mutant or Gdbd fusion construct.

Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For RNA dot blot analysis, 5 µg of total RNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad) nylon membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions. α-32P-Radiolabeled hybridization probes were generated by random priming of cDNA fragments encoding rat HO-1 or ribosomal protein S3. Hybridization and washing conditions were identical to those described previously for Northern blots (28Alam J. Shibahara S. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6371-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HO-1 hybridization signals were quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). After signal quantification, the membranes were stripped and re-hybridized to the S3 probe. Relative mRNA levels were calculated after correcting for RNA loading by normalizing the primary hybridization signal with the S3 signal. CHO cells were plated (4 × 106 cells/100-mm plastic dish) and cultured in complete medium for 40–48 h. Cells were then exposed to vehicle/normoxia, hypoxia (1% O2), or CoCl2(100 µm) in fresh, complete medium. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (29Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. Cells were re-suspended in three volumes of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH7.9), 0.4 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of extraction buffer lacking KCl and stored frozen at −70 °C. The standard binding reaction mixture (12.5 µl) contained 18 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 160 µg/ml poly(dI-dC), 20,000 cpm [γ-32P]ATP labeled probe, and 5 µg of whole cell extracts. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and analyzed by native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (29Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-GATCTTTTATGCTGAGTCATGGTTT-3′ (core StRE underlined) was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and used as probe in EMSA reactions. Unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides, either wild-type or those containing specific mutations within the core StRE, were used as competitors. In antibody supershift assays, 1 µl (2 µg) of pre-immune IgG or specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. In the case of MafG, 1 µl of whole serum (pre-immune and anti-MafG) was used. Cell culture and treatment, preparation of whole cell extracts, and target protein detection were carried out as described previously (19Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S.

Frasca D. Doria G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 856-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-mouse Nrf2 and anti-MafG antibodies were used at 1:1000 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively. Anti-α tubulin and anti-histone H1 antibodies were used at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Wild-type (K1), clonal control (C4.5), and clonal HIF-1α-deficient (Ka13) CHO cells were exposed to normoxia, hypoxia (1% O2), or 100 µmCoCl2, NiCl2, or DFO for 18 h, and the steady-state level of ho-1 mRNA was measured by RNA dot blot analysis. In part confirming the results of Wood et al.(16Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), HIF-1-positive (K1, C4.5) and HIF-1-deficient (Ka13) cells exhibited similar levels of ho-1 mRNA accumulation in response to hypoxia or cobalt (Fig. 1). In addition, DFO, a compound known to activate HIF-1α in CHO cells and NiCl2, another hypoxia mimetic, did not increaseho-1 mRNA levels even in HIF-1-positive cells. Taken together these results imply that HIF-1 activity is neither sufficient nor necessary for ho-1 gene activation by hypoxia or cobalt in CHO cells. Induction of the ho-1 gene by most agents is mediated at the level of gene transcription. Induction by cobalt appears to occur by the same mechanism, as CoCl2 activated a 15-kbp ho-1 promoter/luciferase reporter fusion gene, pHO15luc (Fig. 2), in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum activation, 7.3-fold, was observed at a metal concentration of 100 µm (Fig.3 A). Higher concentrations of CoCl2 resulted in cellular toxicity and reduced luciferase expression. Consistent with the RNA analysis, no significant induction was observed with NiCl2 or DFO even up to a concentration of 300 µm. 5′ deletion mutants of pHO15luc were used in initial experiments to localize the cobalt-responsivecis-element(s). Although relatively large regions were deleted, partial or complete loss of cobalt responsiveness correlated with removal of the E2 or both E2 and E1 regions, respectively (Figs. 2and 3 B). The role of the E1 and E2 enhancers in cobalt responsiveness was confirmed using mutants of pHO15luc specifically lacking E1, E2, or both enhancers (Fig. 3 C) and by directly testing the activity of E1 and E2 in isolation (Fig. 3 D). Both E1 and E2 alone are activated by cobalt and appear to contribute equally to the overall activity of the 15-kbp promoter.cis-Elements common to E1 and E2 include one or more binding sites for specificity protein 1, C/EBP, and members of the AP-1 superfamily of bZIP proteins (12Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). In either enhancer, mutation of the latter, also referred to as the StREs, completely abolished cobalt responsiveness (pE1lucM739 and pE2lucM45, Fig. 3 D). The StRE alone (p3xStREluc), but not the HIF response sequences (p3xHifREluc), conferred cobalt responsiveness. From these results we conclude that the StRE is sufficient and necessary for cobalt-mediatedho-1 gene activation in Ka13 cells.Figure 3Cobalt activates the ho-1promoter via the StRE. Ka13 cells were plated and transfected with pHO15luc (A) or with the indicated luciferase constructs (B–D) by the CaPO4(A–C) or Fugene6 (D) methods as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfected cells were treated with vehicle, the indicated agent (A), or 100 µmCoCl2 (B–D) for 24 h, and cell lysates were assayed for reporter enzyme activities. Background luciferase activity (from mock-transfected cells) was subtracted from each experimental measurement, and the resulting value was corrected for variation in transfection efficiency by normalization with background-subtracted β-galactosidase activity in the same cell extract. -Fold change in normalized luciferase activity (relative to that in vehicle-treated cells) is presented; each data point (A) represents the average of two, and each bar (B–D) represents the average ± S.E. from three to six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reporter gene transfection assays were carried out to determine if ho-1 gene activation by hypoxia and cobalt in CHO cells occurred by the same mechanism. Surprisingly, in contrast to that observed with CoCl2, hypoxia did not stimulate expression of the luciferase gene under the control of the StRE, the E1 enhancer, or the 15-kbp ho-1 promoter in either K1 or Ka13 cells (Fig. 4). This result was not due to a general lack of responsiveness of CHO cells to hypoxia, as expression of the luciferase gene, under the control of multiple HIF-1 binding sites (p3XHifREluc), was clearly stimulated in K1 cells. As expected, HIF-1-dependent gene regulation was inoperative in Ka13 cells and mutation of the HIF-1 binding sites (p3XHifREMluc) abolished reporter gene activation in K1 cells. EMSA reactions using whole cell extracts from Ka13 cells were carried out in order to identify DNA-binding proteins responsible for cobalt-mediatedho-1 gene induction. In vehicle-treated cells, three major StRE-protein complexes were observed (Fig.5 A). Competition experiments using wild-type and mutant StRE sequences indicated that the fastest migrating complex resulted from nonspecific DNA-protein interaction (data not shown). The specific complexes, X and Y, exhibited opposing behavior upon treatment of CHO cells with cobalt. Although the amount of complex X increased in a time-dependent manner, the level of complex Y progressively decreased over a period of 24 h. In contrast to cobalt and consistent with the promoter analysis, hypoxia did not increase StRE binding activity in Ka13 or K1 cells (Fig. 5 B, data not shown). Together with the reporter gene transfection data, these results clearly point to divergent mechanisms for ho-1 gene activation by cobalt and hypoxia. The consensus StRE (13Inamdar N.M. Ahn Y.I. Alam J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) resembles the binding sites for AP-1 (Fos/Jun), ATF/CREB, Maf, and CNC-bZIP families of transcription factors. In order to determine which, if any, member(s) of these families of proteins could function as the cobalt-responsive transcription factor(s), antibody “supershift” EMSA reactions were carried out to identify specific StRE-binding proteins in Ka13 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, commercially available antibodies directed against individual ATF/CREB, Jun, Fos, and Maf proteins did not significantly or consistently alter formation or migration of either complex X or Y. In contrast, incubation with anti-Nrf2 completely supershifted (and also possibly inhibited formation of) DNA-protein complex X. We have recently generated antibodies to MafG that do not, or only poorly, cross-react with MafF and MafK, respectively (Ref. 32Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 2935-3925Crossref Google Scholar; data not shown). Reduced migration, or supershifting, of complex X was also observed with anti-MafG. The nearly complete elimination or supershifting of complex X by antibodies against Nrf2 and MafG strongly suggest that Nrf2·MafG heterodimers are the primary protein components of complex X. Although extracts from Ka13 cells treated with CoCl2 for 2 h were utilized in the experiments depicted in Fig. 6, similar results"

The family is characterized by a highly conserved, cysteine-rich C terminus in which the spacing of the cysteines is invariant. Although resistin and the RELMs have interesting biological properties, little is known about their structure and signaling mechanisms. Formation of disulfide bonds, both intramolecular and intermolecular, is an important process in protein folding (5Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Narayan M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4207-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonding is required for proper folding and secretion of proteins (6Wittrup K.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and it is important for creation and maintenance of tertiary structure of polypeptide growth factors and hormones (7McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Given the high percentage of cysteine residues in the amino acid sequences of resistin and the RELM family, we hypothesized that disulfide bonding might have important structural consequences in these molecules. Here we show that resistin is a disulfide-linked dimer whether expressed recombinantly or endogenously secreted by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. RELMβ is also a homodimer. By contrast, RELMα is secreted as a monomer. This fundamental difference is because of a single cysteine residue that is present in resistin and RELMβ in multiple species but is not conserved in RELMα. The biological functions of resistin and the RELMs are likely to be influenced by this structural diversity. Wild type resistin, as well as C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged resistin, RELMα, and RELMβ expression vectors, were described previously (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R.

Wild type RELMα and RELMβ were subcloned into the expression vector pZac2.1 using similar methods. Site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a cysteine to alanine mutation at amino acid 26 of resistin and resistin fused to a FLAG epitope at its C terminus (resistin-F) was performed using the Stratagene QuickChange kit according to the manufacturer's directions. Constructs were sequenced to confirm they were correct. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (hereafter referred to as growth media) and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 100-mm plates of cells at 50–80% confluence were transfected with a total of 3 µg of DNA and a DNA:Fugene ratio of 6:1. The medium was changed at 24 h post-transfection, and conditioned medium was harvested 48 h later. Harvested medium was used immediately or stored at −20 °C until use. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in growth media and differentiated as described previously (8Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

Medium was collected from preadipocytes (Day 0) and adipocytes (Day 8) and stored at −20 °C until use. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. For non-reducing conditions, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). For reducing conditions, samples were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer supplemented previously with 20% β-mercaptoethanol. All samples were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Blots were transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris/glycine buffer (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 2 h at 60 V or overnight at 20 V. Blots were probed with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% blotting grade nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) for 1 h but were otherwise performed as described previously (9Huang E.Y.

Rabbit anti-RELMα polyclonal serum was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 32–46 of mRELMα. Mouse RELMβ and RELMα antisera were used at 1:1000 dilution. Wild type resistin, as well as resistin-F, was expressed separately or together in 293T cells. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot under reducing conditions, the secreted proteins migrated as monomeric species (labeled M in Fig. 1) with molecular masses consistent with those deduced from the cDNA sequences. However, under non-reducing conditions, both resistin and resistin-F migrated with apparent molecular masses approximately twice those of the respective monomers (labeled D in Fig. 1). Moreover, when resistin and resistin-F were coexpressed, a novel band migrating with an electrophoretic mobility intermediate between resistin and resistin-F appeared. This corresponds to a covalent heterodimer of resistin and resistin-F. This assignment was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody, which only detected the upper two bands (data not shown). Heterodimerization between resistin and resistin-F was not noted when the individual proteins were mixed after being expressed separately (data not shown), suggesting that homodimers were stable in non-reducing conditions. We next investigated whether endogenous resistin is a disulfide-linked homodimer. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes over 8 days. Preadipocytes do not express the resistin gene (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S.

Resistin secreted by 3T3-L1 adipocytes migrates as a monomer under reducing conditions (labeledM in Fig. 2). By contrast, 3T3-L1 adipocyte-derived resistin was revealed to be a dimer when electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions (labeled D in Fig. 2). Thus both recombinant and 3T3-L1 adipocyte-derived resistin are disulfide-linked homodimers. Given the similar sequences of resistin and the RELMs, we next compared the electrophoretic mobilities of RELMβ and RELMα under reducing and non-reducing conditions. We first compared the FLAG-tagged proteins visualized with anti-FLAG antibody. Consistent with the behavior of resistin-F, the RELM-F proteins migrated true to their predicted monomeric molecular masses when electrophoresed under reducing conditions (labeled M in Fig.3 a). On the same gel, but under non-reducing conditions, RELMβ-F migrated as a dimer (labeledD in Fig. 3 a). In stark contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of RELMα-F was identical under non-reducing and reducing conditions, corresponding to the monomeric species in both cases. To ensure that the differing gel mobilities of non-reduced RELMβ-F and RELMα-F were not because of the FLAG epitopes, wild type proteins were studied using specific antibodies. Under non-reducing conditions, wild type RELMβ was a dimer (Fig.3 b) whereas RELMα behaved as a monomer. Thus, resistin and RELMβ exist as disulfide-linked dimers whereas RELMα is a monomer. Alignment of mouse resistin and the RELMs revealed that although all three share the 10 most C-terminal cysteines, RELMα lacks the most N-terminal cysteine that is present in both resistin and RELMβ (indicated by an arrow in Fig.4 a). This cysteine is also conserved in human resistin and RELMβ (as well as rat and bovine resistin; data not shown). However, rat RELMα (which is also secreted as a monomer) also lacks this 11th cysteine. We hypothesized that the 10 conserved C-terminal cysteine residues present in resistin and all RELMs could form five intramolecular disulfide bonds, whereas the additional cysteine in resistin and RELMβ would be paired by an intermolecular disulfide bond, resulting in the observed secretion of homodimers. To determine the role of the most N-terminal cysteine (Cys26) in resistin dimerization, we mutated this residue to alanine (C26A). Unlike wild type resistin, the C26A mutant was found to migrate as a monomer under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4 b). No intermediate species were observed when the wild type and C26A mutant resistin were coexpressed, indicating that Cys26 of one subunit of the dimer interacts with Cys26 in the other subunit. This experiment shows that Cys26 is required for resistin dimerization. The equivalent mutation in RELMβ also abolishes its disulfide-linked dimerization (data not shown). Thus, in all members of the RELM family each of the 10 conserved cysteines participates in creating what is likely to be a conserved structure of the signature region of the molecule. In resistin and RELMβ, an 11th cysteine mediates covalent dimerization via disulfide bonding. This cysteine is missing from RELMα, which is therefore a monomer. The RELM/FIZZ family has only been described recently (1Holcomb I.N. Kabakoff R.C. Chan B. Baker T.W. Gurney A. Henzel W. Nelson C. Lowman H.B. Wright B.D. Skelton N.J. Frantz G.D. Tumas D.B.

We and others have observed previously that this family is characterized by a signature C-terminal sequence containing 10 C-terminal cysteine residues (1Holcomb I.N. Kabakoff R.C. Chan B. Baker T.W.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). We have shown that an 11th cysteine residue present in resistin (Cys26), as well as RELMβ but not RELMα, is necessary for homodimerization. It is likely that dimerization is because of a single disulfide bond between Cys26 residues in each of two monomers. The remaining 10 cysteines that are conserved in all members of the RELM/FIZZ family are likely to be involved in intramolecular disulfide bonding, creating a structure that may contribute to a common function such as receptor binding. The precise intramolecular disulfide boding remains to be determined. We cannot exclude the possibility that cysteine residues other than Cys26 participate in intermolecular disulfide bridging in the resistin dimer. However, our results clearly show that a cysteine in position 26 is required for any such additional intermolecular disulfide bonds to form. The cysteine residue required for resistin dimerization is contained within the highly variable N-terminal domain of the RELMs. This variability in primary sequence and dimerization potential, together with the tissue-specific expression patterns, suggests functional differences in the actions of resistin and the RELMs. Although the signaling mechanisms of these proteins is not yet known, it is likely that these secreted proteins act via cell surface receptors. There is precedent for oligomerization status affecting the signaling function of a ligand, particularly in receptor binding and activation. For example, oligomerization of tumor necrosis factor α is required for ligand-induced receptor activation (10Leong, K. G., and Karsan, A. (2000) 15,(1303–1325).Google Scholar). More relevant to resistin and the RELMs are dimeric signaling molecules in which intermolecular disulfide bonds have functional significance. Activin, a growth factor in the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is a disulfide-bonded dimer containing nine cysteines. Mutation of a single cysteine results in monomeric activin with essentially no ability to activate the activin receptor (11Husken-Hindi P. Tsuchida K. Park M. Corrigan A.Z. Vaughan J.M. Vale W.W.

Another example is intestinal trefoil factor, which contains seven cysteines, one of which is involved in dimer formation (13Chinery R. Bates P.A. De A. Freemont P.S.

Future identification of the receptors for members of the RELM/FIZZ family will shed light on the biological significance of their differential dimerization.

To assess the number of subunits in each pore, we studied external proton block of Kcnk3, a subunit prominent in rodent heart and brain. Consistent with a pore-blocking mechanism, inhibition was dependent on voltage, potassium concentration, and a histidine in the first P domain (P1H). Thus, at pH 6.8 with 20 mm potassium half the current passed by P1H channels was blocked (apparently via two sites ∼10% into the electrical field) whereas channels with an asparagine substitution (P1N) were fully active. Furthermore, pore blockade by barium was sensitive to pH in P1H but not P1N channels. Although linking two Kcnk3 subunits in tandem to produce P1H-P1H and P1N-P1N channels bearing four P domains did not alter these attributes, the mixed tandems P1H-P1N and P1N-P1H were half-blocked at pH ∼6.4, apparently via a single site. This implicates a dimeric structure for Kcnk3 channels with two (and only two) P1 domains in each pore and argues that P2 domains also contribute to pore formation.

Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). 50 years after their description (2Goldman D.E. J. Gen.

Preceded by TOK1, a non-voltage-gated outward rectifier from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with eight predicted membrane-spanning segments (a 2P/8TM1topology) (4Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), the first canonical leak channel, KCNK0, was isolated from Drosophila melanogaster and has a predicted 2P/4TM topology (5Goldstein S.A.N.

To date, 15 mammalian genes (KCNK1–15) have been identified to encode subunits with a 2P/4TM topology (1Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Family members that show function (KCNK0, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -9, -10, -13, and -15) are potassium-selective leak channels; open at rest, they pass potassium without apparent delay in response to changes in membrane potential across the physiological voltage range. The functional repertoire of KCNK channels is, however, more varied, as phosphorylation can reversibly transform cloned and hippocampal KCNK2 between an open and voltage-dependent phenotype (8Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A.N. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Other KCNK subunits have yet to reveal their biophysical attributes (KCNK1, -7/8, and -12). Previously, we studied the genomic structure, cardiac localization, and biophysical properties of murine Kcnk3 (9Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, at steady-state, Kcnk3 channels behave like potassium-selective, transmembrane holes inhibited by physiological levels of protons. With voltage steps, Kcnk3 currents activate (or decay) in two phases; one phase appears to be instantaneous, and another appears to be time-dependent (τ ∼ 5 ms). Both proton block and time-dependent gating are potassium-sensitive, producing an anomalous increase in outward flux as external potassium levels rise because of decreased proton block. At physiological levels of potassium, proton inhibition at −120 mV is half-maximal at ∼pH 7.6, indicating that Kcnk3 is poised to sense and respond to changes in pH value. Moreover, Kcnk3-like channels have been recorded in rat central nervous system nuclei, where they were shown to influence spike frequency in response to volatile anesthetics and neurotransmitters (10Millar J.A.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential role for Kcnk3 in the physiology of cerebral and cardiac acidosis. Four KCNK channels are notably sensitive to extracellular pH in the physiological range, (KCNK3, -5, -9, and -15) (1Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 16Decher N. Maier M. Dittrich W. Gassenhuber J. Bruggemann A. Busch A.E. Steinmeyer K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). KCNK3 and -9 appear to be closely related sharing 54% amino acid identity and a histidine at position 98 in the first P domain (P1) in the midst of signature sequence residues that form the potassium selectivity filter (GYGH); KCNK5 and -15 do not possess this histidine. Kim et al. (17Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that histidine 98 in KCNK9 confers sensitivity to external pH. In this study, we demonstrate a similar role for histidine 98 in Kcnk3 and employ this finding to evaluate subunit stoichiometry. Our findings support the conclusions that there are two P1 domains present in the channel that contribute equivalently to pore formation and, thus, that two Kcnk3 subunits assemble to form each channel. Cloning of Kcnk3(GenBankTM accession number AB008537) and the pBF2 vector have been described (9Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Point mutants were produced by Pfumutagenesis with a QuickchangeTM kit (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) followed by insertion of mutant gene fragments into translationally silent restriction sites. Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To produce dimer constructs, a cDNA fragment encoding all but the first 6 amino acids of Kcnk3 was excised (withFspI and EcoRI) and ligated behind another copy of the gene replacing the last 71 amino acids (from ScaI toEcoRI). The result was two linked but truncated Kcnk3 subunits. the first lacks 71 C-terminal residues, and the second lacks 6 N-terminal residues. Wild type (P1H) and H98N (P1N) subunits were combined in this fashion to form P1H-P1H, P1H-P1N, P1N-P1H, and P1N-P1N. cRNA was produced with T3 RNA polymerase and a kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis frogs (Nasco, Atkinson, WI), treated with collagenase to ease follicle removal, and injected with 0.1–0.4 ng of Kcnk3 cRNA in 46 nl of sterile water. Currents were measured 1–4 days after injection by two-electrode voltage clamp using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Intruments, Foster City, CA). Data were sampled at 4 kHz, filtered at 1 kHz, and analyzed using Pulse (Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) and Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) software. Electrodes of 1.5-mm borosilicate glass tubes (Garner Glass Co., Claremount, CA) contained 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.3 to 1 megohms. Oocytes were studied at room temperature with perfusion at 0.4–1 ml/min using 5 mm potassium solution as follows (in mm): 93 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. As indicated, KCl was isotonically substituted for NaCl. At pH 6.0, MES was substituted for HEPES. Dose response curves were fit to Equation1, 1+[B]K1/2n−1Equation 1 where [B] is proton or barium concentration,K 1/2 is the concentration of Brequired to achieve 50% inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient. Voltage dependence was modeled for data accumulated in 20 mm potassium solution using a simplification of the Woodhull approach (18Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), represented by Equation 2, ImaxI=1+[B]K1/2exp−zδFVRTnEquation 2 where [B] is proton or barium concentration,n is the Hill coefficient, z is the electronic charge of the blocker, and δ is the apparent electrical distance traversed by the blocker to reach its site. Native Kcnk3 channels expressed in oocytes are notable for at least four reasons. First, the currents activate and deactivate in response to voltage changes in two phases, one instantaneous, another time-dependent (Fig.1 A). A non-zero holding current at voltages from −120 to 60 mV (Fig. 1, A andB) indicates that the channels are open across the physiological voltage range, as has been observed directly at the single channel level (9Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Second, Kcnk3 currents are non-inactivating, remaining at a stable level until voltage is again altered. Third, Kcnk3 currents show open rectification; as expected for an open, potassium-selective portal, the relationship of current and voltage becomes linear as potassium is raised to nearly equal levels across the membrane (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, at physiological levels of bath potassium (∼5 mm), Kcnk3 passes large outward currents and small inward currents, because permeant ions flow more readily from a side of high concentration. Fourth, Kcnk3 channels are inhibited by protons in the physiological pH range. Currents are close to maximal at pH 8.0, partially suppressed at pH 7.0, and essentially absent at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1 C). Mutation of Kcnk3 histidine 98 (P1H) to asparagine (P1N) markedly diminishes pH sensitivity of Kcnk3 so that little block is now seen at neutral pH (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, wild type channels show anomalously low outward current in 5 mm potassium compared with 100 mm at pH 7.4 because of increased proton blockade (Fig. 1 B) (9Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) whereas this effect is absent in the mutant (Fig. 1 E). Otherwise, the P1N mutation did not appear to significantly change channel-gating kinetics, rectification properties, or ion selectivity (Fig. 1, D and E, and data not shown). These findings suggested that pH inhibition of Kcnk3 resulted from protonation of histidine 98 in the selectivity filter. The influence of external potassium concentration on inhibition of Kcnk3 by proton was next studied (Fig. 2). At −120 mV, with 5 mm potassium, Kcnk3 current was half-maximal at pH 7.6 ± 0.6 (n = 16 cells) whereas with 20 mm and 100 mm potassium, half-block required lowering the pH to 6.83 ± 0.01 and 6.35 ± 0.02, respectively (n = 10 and 20 cells). Moreover, the current-pH relationship with 5 mm potassium showed a Hill coefficient of 0.96 ± 0.06 whereas with 20 and 100 mmpotassium, Hill coefficients of 2.02 ± 0.14 and 1.86 ± 0.21 were determined. This suggested that protonation of a single pore site was sufficient to inhibit at low bath potassium whereas protonation of more than one site was required at higher potassium levels. Consistent with the idea that proton enters the superficial portion of the Kcnk3 pore to block, inhibition was sensitive to transmembrane voltage. In the presence of 20 mm potassium the apparent fraction of the electric field traversed by proton to reach its site (δ) was estimated to be 0.08 ± 0.01 (n = 6; see “Materials and Methods”). To assess the effect of proton blockade on ions entering and leaving the Kcnk3 pore, blockade by external barium was studied. Inward Kcnk3 currents are inhibited by barium in a voltage-dependent manner (zδ = 0.45 ± 0.01; n = 5 cells) (9Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), apparently via occupancy of a potassium site in the pore as in 1-P-domain (19Neyton J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 569-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y.X. MacKinnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and another 2-P-domain channel (7Ilan N. Goldstein S.A.N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 241-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, with 20 mm potassium at pH 8.0, Kcnk3 was half-blocked by 0.40 ± 0.02 mm barium with a Hill coefficient of 1.1 ± 0.1 (−120 mV; n= 7 cells). When the pH value was lowered from 8.0 to 6.5, inhibition by 1 mm barium decreased from 66 ± 3% to 37 ± 4% (n = 8 cells; see Fig.3 A). Although the onset of barium block was not resolved from the capacitance transient associated with a voltage step to −150 mV, release from steady-state barium inhibition at −150 mV could be assessed by a step to 60 mV; τoff was slowed ∼2-fold (from 53 ± 8 and 100 ± 10 ms) when the pH value was lowered from 8.0 to 6.5 (n = 7 cells) (Fig. 3 B). Studies with the proton-insensitive Kcnk3 channel mutant (P1N) supported the conclusion that the proton(s) that modify barium blockade reside on histidine 98. Thus, P1N channels were inhibited by barium like wild type (K 1/2 was 0.42 ± 0.06 with a Hill coefficient of 0.9 ± 0.1; n = 8 cells). However, blockade of P1N channels by 1 mm barium was insensitive to pH, showing 77 ± 2% and 75 ± 3% inhibition at pH 8.0 and 6.5, respectively (n = 5 cells; see Fig. 3 A). Moreover, unblock kinetics for P1N channels were less sensitive to pH than wild type channels, showing τoff of 59 ± 3 and 67 ± 5 ms at pH 8.0 and 6.5, respectively (n = 5 cells; see Fig.3 B). When two subunits were linked in tandem to produce constructs with four P domains, those with two native subunits (P1H-P1H) or two mutant subunits (P1N-P1N) showed the same sensitivity to proton as channels formed by the related monomer subunits, P1H or P1N (Fig.4 A). Thus, with 20 mm potassium at −120 mV the K 1/2and Hill coefficient for wild type tandems was 6.75 ± 0.04 and 1.84 ± 0.11, respectively, similar to wild type monomer, suggesting protonation at more than one site. In contrast, tandem constructs with a single histidine in the first or second P1 position (P1H-P1N and P1N-P1H, respectively) showed decreased pH sensitivity and evidence for a single proton blocking site. Values for P1H-P1N channels were 6.28 ± 0.05 and 1.10 ± 0.14 whereas those for P1N-P1H channels were 6.34 ± 0.04 and 1.18 ± 0.21. These results support the conclusion that two P1H sites are protonated in channels formed by wild type subunits, and one P1H is protonated in mixed tandems whether it resides in the first or downstream position. Here, we demonstrate that Kcnk3 senses pH value changes in the physiological range via protonation of histidine 98 leading to channel blockade. We employ proton blockade to demonstrate that the first P domain in Kcnk3 subunits contributes to pore function and then provide evidence that the pore contains two P1 domains. Four experiments support the conclusions that inhibition results from protonation of sites in the pore and that P1 domains are pore-forming. First, block is mediated by histidine 98, which is located in P1 adjacent to residues that coordinate potassium ions in the ion-conduction pathway (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5696) Google Scholar). Second, block depends on voltage as if the protons enter the transmembrane electric field to bind. Third, protons alter steady-state affinity of barium on its pore site (as well as barium block kinetics). Fourth, increasing external potassium decreases the sensitivity of the channel to proton (perhaps because of increased occupancy of the pore by potassium). Finally, evaluation of linked subunits bearing four P domains (P1-P2-P1-P2) demonstrate that P1 mediates proton blockade in the first or third position arguing for their functional equivalence. Because four P domains are necessary and sufficient to form the pore in voltage-gated and inwardly rectifying potassium channels we expect the same number of P domains in each Kcnk3 pore. The arrangement and number of Kcnk3 subunits should account for the following four findings in this report: first, wild type channels are expected to have more than one proton binding site (based on a Hill coefficient of ∼2 in 20 mm potassium); second, occupancy of one of the sites is sufficient to block (based on a Hill coefficient of ∼1 in 5 mm potassium); third, the site is formed with histidine residues on the external side of the pore (as the P1N mutant is insensitive); and fourth, only one site is available in channels formed by mixed tandem constructs with a single P1H domain (based on a Hill coefficient of ∼1 in 20 mm potassium). The most likely model for pore formation is a dimer with two P1 and two P2 domain as this provides two histidine residues to bind protons in P1H (Fig. 4 B, upper) and P1H-P1H channels (Fig.4 B, lower), no histidine sites in P1N (Fig.4 C, upper) and P1N-P1N channels (Fig.4 C, lower), and one histidine in P1H-P1N (Fig.4 D, upper) and P1N-P1H channels (Fig.4 D, lower). It is appropriate to rule out both channels formed by four P2 domains, as P1 domains contribute to pore function (Fig. 4 E, left), and channels formed only by the central P domains in linked tandems, because P1H-P1N channels (Fig. 4 E, right) show proton blockade. Finally, it seems extremely unlikely but remains possible that four P1 domains form the pore (Fig. 4 F) if KCNK P2 domains are non-functional (more on this below). Indeed, four glutamate residues (on four 1P/6TM subunits) form only two proton binding sites in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel pore (22Morrill J.A. MacKinnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and a single proton site is formed by a cluster of four glutamate residues in an l-type cardiac voltage-dependent calcium channel (23Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, to account for our results with mixed tandem constructs, P1 domains would either need to function non-equivalently (which is not what we observed), and/or single protons must block via imidazole/imidazolate pairs (an arrangement that has not been described in other proteins), and/or single protons must block across the mouth of the pore (Fig.4 E, right). Thus, it is reasonable to argue that Kcnk3 channels are homodimeric (Fig. 4 B,upper). Functional evidence that 2-P-domain channels are dimeric has been expected since the isolation of the first channel clones (1Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Indeed, an early report argued that a cysteine in the first external loop of KCNK1 was required for both dimer formation and function (24Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, that channel (TWIK1) has subsequently been demonstrated to be non-functional in oocyte plasma membranes, and the cysteine residue revealed to be absent from other KCNK channels (1Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Protonation of Kcnk3 histidine 98 is likely to alter channel gating rather than permeation. Thus, Kim et al. (15Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) found that proton blockade decreased open probability of Kcnk3 and KCNK9 whereas single channel conductance was not significantly altered. Moreover, increasing external permeant ion concentration destabilizes the long-lasting closed state of single KCNK0 channels 2N. Zilberberg, N. Ilan, and S. A. N. Goldstein, submitted for publication. whereas changing the external permeant ion from potassium to rubidium increases the open probability of single KCNK2 channels (8Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A.N. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that protonation favors Kcnk3 channel closure whereas permeant ions in the pore favor the open state. The position homologous to P1H in Kcnk3 is also a histidine in KCNK1, -3, -7/8, and -9 but is occupied by aspartate (GYGD) in TOK1 and asparagine (GYGN) in KCNK0, -2, -4, -5, -6, -12, -13, and -15. This indicates that blockade of KCNK5 and -15 channels by external proton proceeds by a different mechanism than for Kcnk3 and KCNK9. The analogous position in the second P domain of all KCNK channels is aspartate (GYGD) as found in voltage-gated potassium channels; when this P2D was mutated to histidine there was no evidence for Kcnk3 channel function whether a histidine, asparagine, or aspartate was in position 98 (not shown) demonstrating that homologous P1 and P2 residues are not functionally equivalent. Kir2.1 inward rectifier potassium channels are formed by 1P/2TM subunits and have an arginine residue in the P domain (GYGFR) that has been argued to form an electrostatic barrier to divalent cation permeation, because a histidine at the site (GYGFH) yields channels with increased sensitivity to magnesium until proton levels increase and the site is thought to bear a proton (26Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); a similar mechanism may explain the effects of pH on barium blockade via P1H in Kcnk3 (Fig. 3). Remarkably, a P2 domain has yet to be shown to contribute to pore formation. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that mutations in the TOK1 P2 domain (and flanking transmembrane segments) alter potassium-sensitive gating kinetics without affecting its single channel current (25Vergani P. Miosga T. Jarvis S.M. Blatt M.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Loukin S.H. Vaillant B. Zhou X.L. Spalding E.P. Kung C. Saimi Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4817-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Vergani P. Hamilton D. Jarvis S. Blatt M.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7190-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, external potassium concentration influences both the magnitude and rate of TOK1 current development, and mutations in some P2 sites modify this effect. As homologous sites in Shaker channels are known to affect the potassium sensitivity of C-type inactivation, these P2 residues have been suggested to contribute to channel regulation. A homodimeric stoichiometry for Kcnk3 demands that P2 domains are, indeed, pore-forming. We are grateful to F. Sesti, M. Buck, and R. Goldstein for generous advice and technical support."

Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). TNF also induces programmed cell death of many transformed cells. Unfortunately, however, many malignancies are resistant to the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Such resistance may derive from the coincident activation of signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis or cell survival (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Whether or not a cancer cell succumbs to TNF is largely determined by whether the life or death signaling events induced by the cytokine predominate in a cell. TNF promotes its actions by binding to TNF receptor (TNFR) type 1 and TNFR2 (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Binding to TNFR1 activates the receptor such that it recruits proteins that contain a recognition motif, the death domain. The first of these proteins to engage the receptor is the TNFR-associated death domain protein, which subsequently interacts with Fas-associated death domain protein. Fas-associated death domain protein binds the death domain of procaspase 8 and promotes its activation, thereby inducing cell death. The signaling cascade downstream of TNFR1 bifurcates at TNFR-associated death domain protein, which also plays an obligate role in activation of NF-κB (5Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). TNFR-associated death domain protein, through association with TNFR-associated factor 2 and in concert with receptor-interacting protein, activates a serine-threonine kinase cascade (4Wallach D.

Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). One component of this cascade is NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (6Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates and plays a role in the activation of the IKK complex in cells (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L.

Active Akt phosphorylates IKKα, which promotes activation of its heterodimeric partner, IKKβ, in IKKα/IKKβ complexes (12Tanaka M. Fuentes M.E Yamaguchi K. Durnin M.H. Dalrymple S.A. Hardy K.L.

Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). Dissociation of IκB unmasks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB, permitting it to enter the nucleus, where it binds DNA and activates genes that promote immunity and cell survival (15Bauerle P.A.

Activated PI 3-kinase promotes the formation of the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which plays an essential role in activation of Akt (19Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F.

These observations led us to consider the possibility that PTEN might inhibit activation of NF-κB by TNF. Demonstration of a PTEN/NF-κB connection would identify a mechanism through which PTEN could manifest its tumor suppressor activity. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor was a gift from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Antibodies to IKKγ, IKKα, and PTEN were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-RelA (p65) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). 293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure. Routinely, transfection efficiencies of >90% were obtained based on control experiments with β-galactosidase. PC-3 cells were transfected using the GenePorter reagent according to the directions of the manufacturer (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Control experiments with β-galactosidase showed that the PC-3 cell line was transfected with an efficiency of 27%. After transfections, cells were harvested and lysed by incubation for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 m EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P to prepare Western blots, or IKKγ was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. For immunoprecipitations, 1 µg of anti-IKKγ was preadsorbed to protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h and then added to 750 µg of cell lysate. After a 4-h shake at 4 °C, incubates were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MnCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 12.5 mm β-glycero-2-phosphate, 50 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NaF, and 50 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitates in 15 µl of kinase assay buffer were then incubated with 0.25 µCi/µl [γ-32P]ATP and 1 µg of recombinant GST-IκBα(1–51) at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by being heated at 105 °C for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P. EMSAs were conducted on 6 µg of protein from 293 cells transiently transfected with pCMV expression constructs. NF-κB DNA binding was assayed using a double-stranded32P-labeleled κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′). For reporter gene assays, cells were transiently co-transfected with β-galactosidase and 3xNF-κB, a reporter plasmid containing three consensus NF-κB binding sites inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were incubated with vehicle or TNF for 6 h before assaying luciferase activity, which was normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. Because our previous work showed that TNF activates a PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway that plays a role in activation of NF-κB in 293 embryonic kidney cells, we determined whether PTEN would inhibit this process. 293 cells transfected with an empty vector or PTEN were stimulated with TNF. Akt activation was determined by probing a Western blot of transfected cell lysates with an antibody specifically directed against the active form of Akt, which is phosphorylated on serine 473. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, TNF increased Akt phosphorylation in cells transfected with empty vector. However, basal Akt activity was diminished in cells overexpressing PTEN, and the capacity of TNF to activate Akt above the basal level was abrogated by transient PTEN expression. The observations just described are reinforced by the demonstration that pharmacological inhibition of PI 3-kinase using LY294002 blocked TNF-promoted activation (phosphorylation) of Akt (Fig. 1 B). The results in Fig. 1show that activation of Akt by TNF is blocked by the PTEN phosphatase, which dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate generated by PI 3-kinase or by inhibition of the catalytic activity of PI 3-kinase with LY294002. Because our previous observations showed that Akt activates the IKK complex (9Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar), the results shown above indicated that PTEN would inhibit the ability of TNF to activate this complex. To test this, IKK kinase activity was assayed, based on phosphorylation of the IKK substrate IκB, in vector-transfected 293 cells and in 293 cells overexpressing PTEN. Because the IKK complex is part of a high molecular weight signaling complex that also includes IKKγ (26Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), we incubated cells in the absence or presence of TNF and then immunoprecipitated IKKγ from cell lysates. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using GST-IκBα(1–51) as substrate. Western blot analysis of equal amounts of IKK showed that TNF induced substantial phosphorylation of GST-IκBα in vector-transfected cells, and this was blocked in cells transiently overexpressing PTEN (Fig. 2). The phosphorylation and dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB unmasks the nuclear localization sequence of the transcription factor, thereby allowing it to translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it binds DNA (15Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). To determine whether PTEN would inhibit NF-κB DNA binding, 293 cells transfected with empty vector or transiently overexpressing PTEN were serum-starved and then treated with 1 nm TNF or vehicle for 30 min. Proteins from treated cells were used for EMSAs. As illustrated by the results in Fig.3, top panel, TNF stimulated NF-κB DNA binding in cells transfected with an empty vector. However, in cells overexpressing PTEN, TNF-induced DNA binding was abrogated. A Western blot prepared from the extracts used for EMSA was probed with an antibody to p65 Rel, one of the subunits of NF-κB. The data (Fig. 3, bottom panel) show that equivalent amounts of protein were used for the EMSA. Overall, the data in Fig. 3demonstrate that PTEN blocked TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding in 293 cells. The observations described above indicate that TNF-induced PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling activates the IKK complex, thereby promoting NF-κB DNA binding, and that PTEN inhibits these events. This led us to test whether TNF-induced transactivation of NF-κB could be inhibited by PTEN. A reporter gene assay was conducted in which 293 cells transfected with empty vector or transiently overexpressing PTEN were stimulated with TNF before NF-κB transactivation was assayed. As illustrated by Fig. 4 A, TNF activated NF-κB, and this was suppressed in cells expressing PTEN. The ability of PTEN to inhibit TNF-induced activation of NF-κB was also demonstrable in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 4 B), showing that this effect is not unique to the 293 cell line. Because PTEN is mutated or deleted in many types of malignancies, we extended our investigation to evaluate NF-κB activation in prostate cancer cells in which functional PTEN was present (DU145 cells) or absent (PC-3 cells) (27McMenamin M.E. Soung P. Perera S. Kaplan I. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4291-4296PubMed Google Scholar). The PTEN status of the DU145 and PC-3 cells used in the present study was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.5). Western blot analysis of proteins fractionated from lysates of control or TNF-treated cells also showed that TNF did not activate Akt in DU145 cells but induced such activity in PC-3 cells (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation and activation of IKKα by induction of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling is one mechanism through which TNF can activate NF-κB (9Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). The ability of TNF to activate Akt in PC-3 cells, but not in DU145 cells, suggested that this mechanism of NF-κB activation might be of significance in the former cell type, but not in the latter. To test this hypothesis, PC-3 and DU145 cells were treated with LY294002 and then with vehicle or TNF. EMSAs revealed that TNF induction of NF-κB DNA binding in PC-3 cells was sensitive to inhibition by LY294002 (Fig. 6). Results averaged from three independent experiments showed that TNF increased NF-κB DNA binding 6.6 ± 0.7-fold relative to control and that this was not affected by LY294002 alone (1.0 ± 0.2-fold relative to control). However, treatment of PC-3 cells with LY294002 suppressed the ability of TNF to increase NF-κB DNA binding (3.0 ± 0.4-fold stimulation relative to control). In contrast, TNF induction of NF-κB DNA binding in DU145 cells was not affected by LY294002. In DU145 cells, TNF increased NF-κB DNA binding 4.8 ± 0.4-fold relative to control. LY294002 had no effect of NF-κB DNA binding (1.2 ± 0.4-fold relative to control) and did not suppress NF-κB DNA binding induced by TNF (4.7 ± 0.6-fold relative to control). These observations show that the ability of TNF to utilize PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling to activate NF-κB is cell-specific and that other mechanisms can be used by TNF to effect activation of NF-κB.Figure 6Effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition on NF-κB DNA binding in prostate cancer cells. DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells were treated with vehicle or LY294002 and then incubated in the absence or presence of TNF. NF-κB DNA binding was then assayed by EMSAs using 6 µg of protein from whole cell lysates. Anti-p65 was used for supershifting to demonstrate that p65 Rel was in the DNA binding complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observations illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 led us to test whether expression of PTEN in PC-3 cells would inhibit activation of NF-κB by TNF. To accomplish this, we transiently expressed PTEN to varying levels in PC-3 cells. Next, we compared the level of expression to that in DU145 cells by Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis revealed that transfection of PC-3 cells with 0.5 or 1 µg of a PTEN expression vector led to a level of expression comparable to that observed in untransfected DU145 cells (Fig.7 A). A gene reporter assay using PC-3 cells transfected with an empty vector or PTEN showed that PTEN inhibited the capacity of TNF to induce NF-κB transactivation (Fig. 7 B).

Activation of NF-κB by PI 3-kinase/Akt can be effected not only through activation of the IKK complex (9Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) but also by stimulation of the transactivation potential of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB (40Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effect of PI 3-kinase Akt signaling on NF-κB activation is cell type-specific. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway activated by TNF or interleukin-1 inhibits apoptosis but does not activate NF-κB (43Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). NIK and PI 3-kinase/Akt also do not mediate NF-κB activation in embryonic fibroblasts from NIK-mutant mice (44Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H. Kurosawa K. Uchida D. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The cell type-specific activation of NF-κB is further emphasized by the demonstration that NF-κB activation in dermal fibroblasts is not mediated by NIK/TNFR-associated factor 2 signaling but rather by a surrogate pathway in which acidic sphingomyelinase and calpain activities are implicated (45Kouba D.J. Nakano H. Nishiyama T. Kang J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6214-6224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, epidermal keratinocytes utilize the previously defined NIK-dependent pathway to activate NF-κB (45Kouba D.J. Nakano H. Nishiyama T. Kang J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6214-6224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A compelling indication of how cell type-specific mechanisms mediate NF-κB activation is shown in our observation that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling plays a role in NF-κB activation in PC-3 but not DU145 prostate cancer cells. The demonstration that the mechanisms that activate NF-κB are diverse and cell type-specific indicates that NF-κB activation is unlikely to be inhibited by a single mechanism. PTEN is a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates inositol lipids at the D3 position of the inositol ring, suggesting that PTEN antagonizes PI 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate signaling (23Stambolic V.

Ectopic expression of PTEN in tumor cells that carry mutations in the PTEN gene establishes that it regulates the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt, a survival factor that suppresses the activity of proapoptotic proteins and promotes the functions of survival factors (9Ozes O.N.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling promotes activation of IKKα and NF-κB (9Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) and the ability of PTEN to oppositely affect the PI 3-kinase/Akt survival pathway suggested that one manifestation of the tumor suppressor activity of PTEN would be an ability to suppress NF-κB activation by TNF. The observations presented here confirm this hypothesis, although, as suggested above, such suppression is cell type-specific. One manifestation of such cell type specificity is the ability of TNF to activate Akt in PC-3 cells but not in DU145 cells. Consequently, PTEN inhibits activation of NF-κB by TNF in PC-3 cells, but not in DU145 cells. Further confirmation that the transduction pathways used by TNF to activate NF-κB are cell type-dependent is found in the observation that the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C blocked NF-κB activation by TNF or interleukin-1 in Jurkat or NIH3T3 cells but not in MCF-7 A/Z cells (58Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.P. Bours V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Atypical isoforms of protein kinase C can participate in activation of NF-κB through selective action on the IKKβ subunit of the IKK complex (59Lin X. O'Mahoney A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Green W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that signaling pathways not involving PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling and therefore insensitive to suppression by PTEN are likely to play a role in NF-κB activation. While this work was under review, it was reported that PTEN could inhibit cytokine-induced NF-κB activation without interfering with the IκB degradation pathway (60Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzze J.L. Yung W.K.A. Reddy S.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, PI 3-kinase can use a mechanism that may be independent of the function of the IKK complex to affect the activity of NF-κB (40Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzze J.L. Yung W.K.A. Reddy S.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations reinforce the view that much remains to be understood regarding the mechanisms that activate and regulate NF-κB. The ability of PTEN to suppress that component of NF-κB activation mediated by PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling is important. NF-κB activation renders cells resistant to the cytotoxic activity of TNF and chemotherapy by inducing the expression of survival genes (16Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar, 17Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity also suppresses MyoD expression (61Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and may thereby promote the muscle wasting associated with cancer, AIDS, and other chronic diseases. The demonstration that PTEN can suppress NF-κB activation by TNF suggests that its tumor suppressor activity derives, in part, through its capacity to inhibit expression of genes that suppress the function of the cellular apoptotic machinery. Furthermore, PTEN may impair the ability of cytokines, such as TNF, to produce metabolic alterations, such as cachexia, that often lead to host mortality."

In particular, a conserved arginine on the F-strand of the V-set domain is essential for sialic acid-dependent binding by all Siglecs (19Vinson M. Van er Merwe P.A. Kelm S. May A. Jones E.Y.

Other conserved residues include aromatic amino acids on the A and G β-strands of the V-set domain that contact theN-acetyl and glycerol side group of N-acetyl neuraminic acid (22May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). All Siglecs characterized have an unusual arrangement of conserved cysteine residues in the V-set and adjacent C2-set domains (23Crocker P.R. Kelm S. Hartnell A. Freeman S. Nath D. Vinson M. Mucklow S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of an intrasheet disulfide bond in the N-terminal V-set domain and an interdomain disulfide bond between the V-set domain and the proximal C2-set domain (22May A.P.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2651-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Many of the Siglecs have potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the context of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic tails, suggesting their involvement in intracellular signaling pathways. Recently, a growing number of leukocyte membrane receptors have been described to contain at least one ITIM motif. Such ITIM motifs, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, have been shown to mediate negative regulatory signals via the recruitment and activation of intracellular phosphatases (SHP-1, SHP-2, or SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase) (25Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 149-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that CD33/Siglec-3 and Siglec-7 are capable of transmitting negative regulatory signals upon cross-linking by specific antibodies (7Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M.

In this study we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a new member of Siglec family from human dendritic cells (DCs) designated Siglec-10. The protein shares high homology with Siglec-5, CD33/Siglec-3, and other Siglec members and possesses all of the key structural features of the Siglecs described above. Like other Siglec members, Siglec-10 is able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding to cells either when expressed on COS-7 cells or as a recombinant fusion protein immobilized on plastic. In addition, we have examined the cell and tissue expression of Siglec-10, which revealed its expression in a large number of cells and tissues including human DCs and monocytes. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Vibrio cholerae sialidase was purchased from Calbiochem. [125I]-Streptavidin (20–40 mCi/mg) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A cDNA encoding full-length dendritic cell-derived IFN-induced protein (DCIP) in the pSPORT vector was obtained from a human DC cDNA library produced in our laboratory. Biotinylated polyacrylamide (PAA) carrying either NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc (2,3-PAA) or NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4Glc (2,6-PAA) was purchased from Syntesome (Munich, Germany). The full-length cDNA of Siglec-10 was directly isolated from a cDNA library of human DCs by random sequencing as described previously (31Nitschke L. Carsetti R. Ocker B. Khler G. Lamers M.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Briefly, DCs were derived from human peripheral monocytes by culture with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-4 and enriched by a CD1a-mediated positive selection at day 7 of culture. A plasmid cDNA library of pSPORT vector was constructed using the SuperscriptTM plasmid system for cDNA synthesis. Plasmid cloning was performed according to manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). By large-scale sequencing of the DC cDNA library, we established an in-house data base of 25,668 expressed sequence tags, based on which more than 100 full-length novel genes have been isolated. The full-length cDNA of clone SBBI91 was found to potentially encode a protein with an Ig domain sharing homology with the known Siglecs, hence designated as Siglec-10. The full-length sequence is available in the GenBankTM data base with accession number AF311905. The following cell lines were obtained from the ATCC: K562, HL60, U937, THP-1, MOLT-4, Raji, MCF-7, LoVo, HT-29, PC-3, CaoV-3, A172, HeLa, and A549. Standard procedures were used for the cell cultures. Human red blood cells were obtained from healthy donors and stored at 4 °C in Alsever's solution for up to 2 weeks. Human blood leukocytes were obtained from whole blood by dextran sedimentation followed by lysis of contaminating RBCs. DCs generatedin vitro for 5 days in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 were further cultured in the presence of LPS (100 µg/ml). Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer instructions, and first strand cDNA was prepared with the Superscript II system using an oligo(dT)12–18 primer. The synthesis of cDNA was checked by RT-PCR using β-actin primers. RT-PCRs with the primers 5′-TGGCTCAGAAGCGGAATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCATTGGAACTTGACTTCTGC-3′ (backward) specific for Siglec-10 cDNA were subjected to denaturing (95 °C for 15 s), annealing (57 °C for 30 s), and extension (72 °C for 30 s) for 28 cycles using a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600. Human adult multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were used to detect mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis. The RT-PCR products mentioned above were cloned into a T/A vector for sequencing and labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (50 µCi, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a probe. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spin column chromatography (Roche Molecualr Biochemicals). Hybridization was performed in Express HybTMhybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer instructions. After stringently washing at 50 °C for 20 min in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, the filters were subjected to autoradiography. A cDNA fragment of Siglec-10 encoding the extracellular Ig-like domains was amplified by PCR using forward (5′-ACGAATTCTGCGCCTCCTATGCGGAGAT G-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGGATCCCCGTTGGAGAATGCCGTTGAG-3′) primers from DC cDNA as a template. The fragment was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA-3.1-Fc, giving rise to a fusion protein of Siglec-10 extracellular domains and a human IgG Fc tail. The constructs were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) into COS-7 cells, the culture supernatants were collected, and the chimeric proteins were purified on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These were carried out as described previously (4Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. De Bellard M.-E. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 965-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were sham-transfected or transfected using LipofectAMINE with cDNA encoding full-length Siglec-10 or Siglec-5 used as a positive control (obtained from a human DC cDNA library produced in our laboratory). Erythrocyte rosetting was performed 48 h after transfection with or without sialidase pretreatment of COS-7 cells or erythrocytes and assessed by microscopy after a thorough washing to remove unbound red blood cells. A solid-phase binding assay with human RBCs was performed as described previously with the Siglec-10-Fc fusion protein (4Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. De Bellard M.-E. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 965-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with full-length cDNAs encoding Siglec-10, Siglec-5, or DCIP as a mock control, and binding assays were carried out 60 h later. The COS-7 cells were either left untreated or treated with 0.1 units/ml sialidase for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with saturating concentrations (20 µg/ml) of 2,3-PAA or 2,6-PAA for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBA (PBS containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin), and incubated with [125I]-streptavidin diluted to 0.5 µCi/ml in PBA for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing in PBA, bound radioactivity was counted using a Wallac gamma counter. The 3124-base pair full-length clone directly isolated from the human DC cDNA library encoded a type I transmembrane protein of 602 amino acids belonging to the IgSF. A BLAST search with the amino acid sequence detected similarities to other Siglec family members. At the primary sequence level, it most closely resembled Siglec-5 (overall sequence 51% similarity and 38% identity, Fig.1). Based on its sequence similarity with other Siglecs, the conservation of Siglec features, and its capacity of sialic acid-dependent binding (shown below), the protein was designated as Siglec-10 (Fig. 1). The extracellular region of Siglec-10 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide and four Ig-like domains (one V-set domain followed by three C2-set domains). There were three putative N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular region including one highly conserved site at position 100 (20Van der Merwe P.A. Crocker P.R. Vinson M. Barclay A.N. Schauer R. Kelm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9273-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The transmembrane region comprised position 453–479, after which was a cytoplasmic tail of 123 amino acids (Fig. 1). The N-terminal Ig-like domains contained many structural features of the Siglec subgroup of IgSF (Fig.2). Previously demonstrated conservation of the unusual pattern of cysteines was found in Siglec-10, particularly the cysteines on the B- and E-strands of domain 1, which are thought to result in an intrasheet disulfide bond (22May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and the cysteines on the A-B loop of domain 1 and the B-C loop of domain 2, which may give rise to an interdomain disulfide bond (24Pedraza L. Owens G.C. Green L.A. Salzer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2651-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Conversation of other key amino acids included a typically placed arginine (Arg-119). Also, two aromatic amino acids (Phe-21 and Phe-130) on the A- and G-strands of the V-set domain were present, both of which are known to be involved in sialic acid binding of Siglec-1/sialoadhesin from x-ray crystallographic analysis (22May A.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Homology of individual Ig-like domains was compared with those of other Siglecs. In the first two extracellular domains, Siglec-10 is most similar to the two extracellular domains of CD33 (65% similarity and 48% identity), whereas the third Ig domain most closely resembles the Siglec-7 domain 3 (57% similarity and 42% identity). The fourth Ig domain is most similar to Siglec-8 Ig domain 3, with high similarity of up to 73% and 60% identity. Alignment of the intracellular domain of Siglec-10 with other Siglecs revealed a high degree of sequence identity and similarity to CD33/Siglec-3. Notably, the four Ig-like domains of Siglec-10 contained three, three, two, and three cysteines, respectively, suggesting that there might be either interdomain disulfide bonds as for other Siglecs or interpolypeptide disulfide bonds as in Igs. Within the putative cytoplasmic tail were four tyrosine residues (Fig. 2), of which the first (Tyr-502) and third (Tyr-572) have been identified in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM, S/I/L/VXYXXL/V). The two motifs (LDYINV and LHYATL) conformed well to the consensus ITIM that has been found in several other leukocyte proteins. Alignment of the closely related Siglec subset (Siglec-5, -6, -7, and -9; Fig. 1) reveals a low degree of conservation in the cytoplasmic tail except for the amino acids surrounding two tyrosines in the ITIM and the ITIM-like motifs. The two ITIM motifs of Siglec-10 were not, however, found at the corresponding sites of other Siglecs. Despite the site differences, the presence of ITIM motifs suggests that the motifs are under functional positive selection. The fourth tyrosine residue (membrane distal, Tyr-596) did not conform to the ITIM motif but is similar to the membrane-distal ITIM-like motif characterized in some other leukocyte receptors (33Hua C.T. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Jackson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28332-28340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Huber M. Izzi L. Grondin P. Houde C. Kunath T. Veillette A. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of the entire Siglec family (Fig.3) was performed by the ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar) and TreeView (36Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) programs. The results revealed a close association between Siglec-10 and CD33, Siglec-6, and Siglec-5 as expected from the high sequence identity mentioned above. The novel gene, encoding the Siglec-10 protein, possesses all the necessary features, such as the Ig-like domains, the type-I transmembrane topology, and the conserved cytoplasmic motifs, for it to be designated as the newest member of the Siglec family. It also shows a close phylogenetic relationship to the other Siglec family members. By RT-PCR we have demonstrated the mRNA expression of Siglec-10 in a large number of cells including HL60 (myelomonocytic), U937 (promonocytic), THP-1 (monocytic), MOLT-4 (T lymphoma), Raji (B lymphoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), PC-3 (prostate adenocarcinoma), A172 (glioblastoma), SMMC 7721 (hepatoma), HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma), A549 (lung carcinoma), and freshly isolated human peripheral monocytes (Fig.4A). No message was detected in K562 (erythroid/megakaryocytic), LoVo (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), or CaoV-3 (ovarian adenocarcinoma) cells. We also examined the effect of LPS stimulation on Siglec-10 expression in human DCs. DCs derived from peripheral monocytes cultured in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 expressed Siglec-10 at relatively high levels before LPS stimulation. The expression decreased after the stimulation with LPS, reaching a minimum at 24 h, and increased again to a high level after 48 h of stimulation (Fig. 4 B). These results suggested that DCs expressed Siglec-10 in a time-dependent manner after the activation with LPS. The mRNA expression pattern of Siglec-10 in human tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig.5). Because the first three Ig-like domains of Siglec-10 were of high similarity to other Siglecs, we designed a probe to minimize the likelihood of cross-reactivity and performed hybridization under stringent conditions. Two major forms of transcripts were observed. The larger one was ∼3.3 kilobases in length and was found in peripheral blood lymphocytes, ovary, and spleen; therefore, the 3124-base pair cDNA isolated from DCs is likely to represent a full-length mRNA. The other transcript was estimated to be ∼1.8 kilobases in length and was present in liver, spleen, thymus, and lung. This is likely to represent alternatively spliced mRNA rather than different gene family members based on the low cross-reactivity of the probe and the stringency of conditions used. To investigate the sialic acid binding properties of Siglec-10, we further performed the human RBC binding assay, because all Siglecs characterized thus far have been shown to mediate sialic acid binding to human RBCs after the transient expression of their full-length cDNA in COS-7 cells (3Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. De Bellard M.-E. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1753-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In our experiments, COS-7 cells were transfected with the full-length cDNA of Siglec-10 or its close homologue Siglec-5. The transfected cells were then either left untreated or treated with sialidase before RBCs were added. Both Siglec-10- and Siglec-5-transfected COS-7 cells bound RBCs at a moderate level. Notably, sialidase pre-treatment of COS-7 cells that could eliminate sialylated ligands on the same cell surface (cis-ligands) augmented RBC adhesion by at least 50% (Fig.6, A and B). In all cases, this binding was completely abrogated by sialidase pretreatment of RBCs, indicating that the binding is sialic acid-dependent. In a solid-phase binding assay, the Siglec-10-Fc fusion protein containing the extracellular domains of Siglec-10 was able to bind RBCs at a high level, and this binding was also eliminated completely by sialidase pretreatment of RBCs (data not shown). The results suggested that, just as with other Siglecs, the recognition function of Siglec-10 could be masked and hence regulated by endogenous sialylation on the same cell surface. To determine the sialic acid linkage preference of Siglec-10, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding Siglec-10, Siglec-5 as a positive control, or DCIP as a mock control. After sialidase treatment of the COS-7 cells to remove potentiallycis-inhibitory sialic acids, binding assays were carried out using biotinylated polyacrylamide, derivatized with 3′- or 6′-sialyllactose (Fig. 7). Under these conditions, untransfected wild-type COS-7 cells showed no detectable binding to glycoconjugates. With sialidase-treated COS-7 cells, the property of Siglec-10 was more similar to that of Siglec-5, binding glycoconjugates carrying sialic acid in either α2,3 or α2,6 linkages. Therefore, the binding specificity of Siglec-10 seems similar to that of Siglec-5 (5Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22127-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Siglec-10 cDNA encodes a protein with many typical features of previously described Siglecs. The first Ig-like domain contains two amino acid residues critical in sialic acid recognition (22May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar): an arginine in β-strand F (Arg-119) and an aromatic amino acid in β-strand G (Phe-130). Crystallographic studies of Siglec-1/sialoadhesin have shown that these residues directly interact with the carboxyl group and glycerol-like side chain of sialic acid, respectively (22May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence similarity with other Siglecs and the conservation of key residues implicated in sialic acid recognition increased the possibility that this protein was a new member of the Siglec family of IgSF proteins. We were able to show that full-length Siglec-10 expressed in COS cells behaved similarly to all other Siglecs thus far characterized in that it was able to bind human RBCs and soluble sialoglycoconjugates in a sialic-dependent manner. Therefore, Siglec-10 fulfills the criteria required for its inclusion in the Siglec subgroup of IgSF proteins (38Crocker P.R. Clark E.A. Filbin M. Gordon S. Jones Y. Kehrl J.H. Kelm S. Le Douarin N. Powell L. Roder J. Schnaar R.L. Sgroi D.C. Stamenkovic K. Schauer R. Schachner M. van den Berg T.K. van der Merwe P.A. Watt S.M. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: V-VICrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of Siglec-10 contains four tyrosine residues. It is of interest that Siglec-10 and other Siglecs share conserved tyrosine residues embedded in ITIM motifs that have been found in a growing number of cell surface members of the Ig family (39Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar, 40Borges L. Hsu M.L. Fanger N. Kubin M. Cosman D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5192-5196PubMed Google Scholar), although the location of motifs in Siglec-10 does not match the conserved positions in other Siglecs. In many cases, such ITIM motifs have been shown to be the docking site for the phosphotyrosine phosphatases (39Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar, 41Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and therefore could mediate negative regulatory signals via recruitment and activation of tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-1, SHP-2, and SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase (39Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar, 42Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The actual function of these motifs in Siglec-10 remains to be determined, but the motifs are likely to be involved in signal transduction, because those in Siglec-3/CD33 and Siglec-7/AIRM1 have been shown to interact with SHP-1 (7Falco M.

The sequence around the second tyrosine of other Siglecs (TEYSEI in Siglec-5, -6, and -9), which does not strictly conform with but is similar to the proposed SAP-docking site (TIYXXV/I) on signaling lymphocytic-activating molecule/CDw150 (45Sayos J.

Future studies on the intracellular consensus motifs are needed and will facilitate understanding of the mechanisms of signaling functions of Siglecs. Apart from myelin-associated glycoprotein, all currently known Siglecs (Fig. 2) have been found to be expressed in specific types of bone marrow stem cell-derived cells including B cells for CD22, myeloid progenitor cells for CD33, natural killer cells for Siglec-7, and eosinophils for Siglec-8. In fact, as analyzed by Northern blot analysis, Siglec-10 mRNA was found in relatively high abundance in peripheral blood leukocytes. RT-PCR revealed that Siglec-10 is actually expressed on DCs and monocytes. Thus DCs express several Siglecs simultaneously including Siglec-5, Siglec-7, and Siglec-10, and monocytes express CD33, Siglec-5, Siglec-7, and Siglec-10. We speculate that Siglec-10 is also predominantly expressed on some distinct populations of hematopoietic cells, playing roles in extracellular recognition and intercellular signaling, which is supported by the presence of ITIM-like motifs in its cytoplasmic region (see above). Experiments to analyze the hypothetical role of Siglec-10 and that of another highly related Siglec, Siglec-5 (also on DCs and monocytes), is now underway in our laboratory. It was of interest that when we searched the HTGS data base, the nucleotide sequence of Siglec-10 was found in chromosome 19 (working draft sequence AC008750 (data not shown)).

Chromosome 19q13.3–13.4 is now recognized as a region that is especially enriched with a large number of other hematopoietically expressed Ig-related receptors described as the leukocyte receptor complex (48Wende H. Colonna M. Ziegler A. Volz A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).

Two known K18 caspase cleavage sites are aspartates in the consensus sequences VEVDA and DALDS, located within the rod domain and tail domain, respectively. Several K14 (another type I keratin) mutations within the caspase cleavage motif have been described in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Here we use extensive mutational analysis to show that K19 and K14 are caspase substrates and that the ability to undergo caspase-mediated digestion of K18, K19, or K14 is highly dependent on the location and nature of the mutation within the caspase cleavage motif. Caspase cleavage of K14 occurs at the aspartate of VEMDA, a consensus sequence found in type I keratins K12–17 with similar but not identical sequences in K18 and K19. For K18, apoptosis-induced cleavage occurs sequentially, first at 393DALD and then at 234VEVD. Hyperphosphorylation of K18 protects from caspase-3 in vitro digestion at 234VEVD but not at 393DALD. Hence, keratins K12–17 are likely caspase substrates during apoptosis. Keratin hyperphosphorylation, which occurs early in apoptosis, protects from caspase-mediated K18 digestion in a cleavage site-specific manner.

Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The keratin subfamily of IF proteins is classified into two major groups, type I keratins (K9–20) and type II keratins (K1–8), which associate as noncovalent type I-II heteropolymers in an epithelial cell type-specific manner (1Fuchs E.

The nuclear lamin IF proteins also undergo degradation during apoptosis and were the first IF proteins demonstrated to undergo apoptosis-associated digestion (9Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D.

The only keratins shown to undergo proteolysis during apoptosis are K18 and K19, whereas their type II partner (i.e. K8) manifests remarkable resistance to apoptotic degradation. Two known K18 caspase sites, VEVD and DALD, are located in the rod domain and tail domain, respectively (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornvall H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). VEVD or similar consensus sequences are found in other IF proteins within the so-called linker 1–2 (L1–2) region of the rod domain (Fig. 1), whereas DALD is a unique caspase site that is found only in the K18 tail domain. The signals, if any, that target keratin degradation and the significance of this proteolysis are unknown. To that end, the only keratin-related apoptosis-associated change after an apoptotic signal is marked early keratin hyperphosphorylation. The significance of this early keratin hyperphosphorylation in association with apoptosis is not known, but amino acid substitution of the major K18 phosphorylation sites does not alter susceptibility to caspase digestion (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Understanding the significance and regulation of keratin (and other IF protein) degradation during apoptosis is important from a cell biological perspective and may also have pathophysiological relevance to human disease. For example, although most keratin mutations that have been identified in patients with epidermal blistering keratin diseases are located at the N-terminal region of the rod IA subdomain (12Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 13Irvine A.D. McLean W.H. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), at least four K14 mutations have been described within the L1–2 region (14Rugg E.L. Morley S.M. Smith F.J. Boxer M.

Dermatol. 1998; 111: 900-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in close proximity to the caspase recognition motif (VEMDA, also referred to herein as the caspase box). The cause of blister formation in these patients may be attributed to keratin filament assembly defects with resultant cell fragility. However, the proximity of these mutations to the caspase digestion site raises the possibility that the phenotype of the keratin disease in these instances may also be associated with perturbations in keratin degradation. If so, this could potentially impact the disease pathophysiology in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), who harbor K14 L1–2 region mutations, and may offer more directed therapeutic strategies. In this study, we use a mutagenesis approach to confirm that Asp396 in the K18 tail domain is a caspase cleavage site in vivo. In addition, we show that sequential K18 digestion occurs at the tail (DALDS) and then at the rod (VEVDA) domains and that keratin hyperphosphorylation protects against cleavage at the rod but not the tail motif. To address the significance of the caspase box residues in keratin degradation, we generated a battery of caspase box mutations that mimicked the K14 mutations described in EBS patients and examined parallel mutations in K18 and K19. The results show that: (i) K14 VEMDA→MEMDA or VEMDD has no effect on susceptibility to caspase digestion, (ii) K14 VEMDA→VERDA and equivalent K18 and K19 mutations altered the migration of the N-terminal fragment on gel analysis, and (iii) K14 VEMDA→VEMGA and the equivalent K18 mutation abolished caspase digestion (boldface letters indicate residues that are mutated). Hence, pathogenic K14 mutations within the L1–2 region in patients with EBS can prevent caspase-mediated keratin degradation during apoptosis. In addition, the VEMDA caspase box, which is found in many type I keratins (K12–17) is a suitable caspase substrate, as shown here for K14. The primary monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) were L2A1 (anti-K8/K18), D5 (anti-K18), DC10 (anti-K18; Neomakers, Fremont, CA), M30 (anti-K18 Asp396 fragment;Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and KA4 (anti-K19). Other reagents and antibodies used were rabbit anti-K14 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH), anisomycin (An), caspase inhibitor III (t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp·(O-methyl)·fluoromethyl ketone (BOC)), human recombinant caspase-3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HT29 (human colon) and BHK-21 (hamster kidney) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in media as recommended by the supplier. HT29 cells express K8, K18, and K19, whereas BHK-21 cells do not express any easily detectable keratins (data not shown). Wild-type (WT) or mutant keratin constructs, generated using a TransformerTM kit (CLONTECH), were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Notably, this transfection method induces apoptosis and keratin degradation in BHK-21 cells as reported previously (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Keratin degradation and subsequent apoptosis were induced in HT29 cells by culturing the cells in the presence of An (10 µg/ml in Me2SO) for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 h. Total cell lysates in 2% SDS-containing sample buffer were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, followed by immunoblotting (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells transiently transfected with K8 and/or K18 were treated with 0.1% Me2SO or 50 µm caspase inhibitor III (BOC) overnight, followed by isolation of total cell lysates and immunoblotting. HT29 cells were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After 1 h, lysates were pelleted, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation by incubation in the presence of Sepharose-protein A coupled to mAb L2A1. Two duplicate K8/K18 immunoprecipitates were either used as a control or incubated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (20 units) for 1 h at room temperature to obtain dephosphorylated K8/K18. Hyperphosphorylated K8/K18 immunoprecipitates were obtained from HT29 cells treated with 1 µg/ml okadaic acid for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates (control, dephosphorylated, or hyperphosphorylated K8/K18) were incubated with buffer alone or with buffer containing recombinant human caspase-3 for 0.5, 1.5, or 3 h. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Previous studies utilizing K18 D237A (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) or direct sequencing of apoptosis-generated K18 fragment b (Fig.1 and Ref. 6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showed that K18 Asp237 is a major cleavage site in vivo. In addition, in vitro digestion of K18 using caspase-3 or caspase-7 indicated that a second caspase site is likely to be present in the tail domain of K18 (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The second site was inferred to be K18 Asp396 by epitope mapping using mAb M30 (7Leers M.P. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. Bergman T. Tribbick G. Persson B. Bjorklund P. Ramaekers F.C. Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornvall H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), although this was not formally tested by mutational analysis. We mutated K18 D396E and K18 D237/396E and examined caspase digestion of the mutants as compared with WT K18-transfected BHK-21 cells undergoing apoptosis. K18 D396E generated a “new” 27-kDa band (K18 b+c fragment) that was recognized by a K18 C-terminal-specific Ab (Fig. 1 A; Fig.2, A and C), whereas K18 D237E accumulated a 43-kDa band (K18 a+b fragment; Fig.2 A) that was recognized by a K18 N-terminal-specific Ab (Fig. 1 A; Fig. 2, B and D). The double mutant K18 D237/396E generated only one major undigested K18 species (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Hence, both K18 Asp237 and Asp396 are caspase digestion sites in vivo. Generation of the K18 fragments a+b, a, or b was inhibited using the broad range caspase inhibitor BOC in cells transfected with WT K18 or with WT K8/K18 (Fig. 3 A), thereby indicating that K18 fragmentation at Asp237 and Asp396 is caspase-mediated. Antibody specificity was confirmed by blotting K8-transfected cells (Fig. 3 A; K8 expression was determined by blotting with anti-K8-specific Ab; data not shown). The M30 mAb (which recognizes an epitope that becomes exposed after K18 is cut at Asp396) does not detect K18 when mutated at D396E or D237/396E (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and5) as predicted from its reactivity with K18 synthetic peptides (7Leers M.P. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. Bergman T. Tribbick G. Persson B. Bjorklund P. Ramaekers F.C. Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornvall H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In addition, M30 reactivity for K18 a+b fragment increases dramatically in K18 D237E as compared with WT K18 transfectants, because K18 a+b fragment accumulates because it can no longer be further degraded (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). We then tested, using An-induced apoptosis, whether caspase digestion occurs sequentially or randomly at VEVD and DALD. Immunoblotting of total lysates from HT29 cells treated with An for various time intervals with M30 showed that K18 a+b (i.e. digestion at DALD) begins to appear after 0.5 h, whereas K18 b (i.e.digestion at VEVD) is detected after 2 h of An treatment (Fig.3 C). This indicates that upon An-induced apoptosis, Asp396 is initially cleaved followed by digestion at Asp237. Cleavage at Asp396 does not appear to be essential for cleavage at Asp237 because the K18 D396E mutant remains a caspase substrate at Asp237 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 4). We showed previously that K8 (Ser73 and Ser431) and K18 (Ser52) but not K18 (Ser33) hyperphosphorylation occurred within 0.5 h after An treatment and that keratin Ser→Ala mutants at these sites remain comparable to WT K18 in terms of their susceptibility to caspase digestion (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the effect of dephosphorylation or hyperphosphorylation on K18 fragmentation using in vitrodigestion by caspase-3. K8/K18 immunoprecipitates that were isolated from okadaic acid-treated cells or treated with alkaline phosphatase were digested with caspase-3 in vitro and then analyzed for the formation of keratin fragments. As shown in Fig.4 A, K18 hyperphosphorylation inhibited digestion at K18 Asp237 without any significant effect on K18 digestion at Asp396. In contrast, dephosphorylation did not have a significant effect on K18 Asp237 or Asp396 digestion (Fig.4 A), which is consistent with our previous findings using phosphorylation-mutant keratins (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The effect of okadaic acid and alkaline phosphatase on K8/K18 phosphorylation was confirmed by immunoblotting of the K8/K18 precipitates with anti-phospho-K8 and anti-phospho-K18 antibodies (Fig. 4 B). The VEVDA motif in the rod domain is found in K18 and K20, whereas the VEVDS motif is found in K19. Similar rod domain motifs, such as VEMDA, are present in other IF proteins including K14 (Fig. 1 B), whereas the DALD motif in the tail domain is unique to K18. Given the conserved nature of the rod domain motif (X1E/DX2DX3; X1-X3, aliphatic residues with caspase cleavage occurring at the aspartate between X2 and X3; Fig. 1 A) and the presence of K14 mutations at the aspartate of VEMD (D→G) and at X1 (V→M), X2 (M→R), and X3 (A→D) in patients with EBS, we asked whether these mutations have an effect on type I keratin fragmentation during apoptosis. To address this question, we generated several corresponding mutations in K14, K18, and K19 and tested the mutant constructs for susceptibility to caspase-mediated degradation in cell transfection systems. Mutation V236M in K18 or K19 to generate a WT K14-like caspase box (i.e. VEMD instead on VEVD) had no effect on caspase-mediated degradation of K18 (Fig.5 A) or K19 (Fig.5 C). Similarly, EBS-like mutations at the X1 or X2 positions of the caspase box of K14 (V270M or M272R, respectively) and of K19 (V234M or V236R, respectively) and at the X2 position of K18 (V236R) had no effect on keratin fragmentation upon apoptosis (Fig. 5; TableI). However, the X2 mutation of M (in K14) or V (in K18/19) to R generates an N-terminal fragment that migrates slightly faster on SDS-PAGE gels as compared with the equivalent N-terminal fragment generated with WT or other mutant K14, K18, or K19 fragments (Fig. 5, highlighted with anasterisk). It is unlikely that the altered migration is due to the valine to arginine substitution per se because the N-terminal fragment of K18 V220R migrates similarly to the WT K18 fragment (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1 and2). In addition, this faster-migrating N-terminal fragment does not appear to result from exposure of other potential cryptic caspase digestion sites (i.e. K18 Asp180 at177VEND or K18 Asp189 at 186KVID that may be exposed after the Val→Arg mutation in K18 V236R). For example, the double mutants K18 D180E/V236R or K18 D189E/V236R generate fragments with migration similar to that of K18 V236R (data not shown). Interestingly, an arginine substitution at the X1 position of K18 (V234R) blocks K18 cleavage at Asp237 (Fig.5 B, lane 3), thereby indicating that a basic residue substitution at the X1 caspase box position is likely to inhibit caspase enzyme-substrate recognition.Table IKeratin constructs and their degradation phenotypesType I keratinCaspase box sequenceConstruct mutationCleavage in rod domainK14270VEMD/ANone (wild-type)YesMEMD/AV270M (EBS)YesVERD/AM272R (EBS)Yes1-aAltered fragment migration in SDS-PAGE gels.VEMG/AD273G (EBS)NoVEME/AD273ENoVEMD/DA274D (EBS)YesK18234VEVD/ANone (wild-type)YesVEMD/AV236M (K14-like)YesVERD/AV236R (EBS-like)Yes1-aAltered fragment migration in SDS-PAGE gels.VEVG/AD237G (EBS-like)NoVEVE/AD237ENoVEVD/DA238D (EBS-like)YesREVD/AV234RNoK19234VEVD/SNone (wild-type)YesMEVD/SV234M (EBS-like)YesVEMD/SV236M (K14-like)YesVERD/SV236R (EBS-like)Yes1-aAltered fragment migration in SDS-PAGE gels.VEVE/SD237ENoVEVA/SD237ANoThe table summarizes the results obtained upon analysis of K14, K18, and K19 mutations within the conserved caspase box of the L1–2 region of the rod domain.

An EBS-like K14 VEMD→VEMG mutation and a similar K18 mutation (VEVD→VEVG) abolish caspase cleavage (Table I). As shown previously for K18 (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and shown here for K19 (D237E) and K14 (D273E), D→E mutations in these keratins also block caspase cleavage (Fig. 5,C and D). In addition, K18 VEVD→VEVE generates the 43-kDa fragment (K18 a+b in Fig. 2 A) due to caspase digestion at Asp396 in 393DALD, a site that is not found in other non-K18 type I keratins. Another EBS-like mutation at the X3 position in K14 (A274D) or K18 (A238D) does not affect susceptibility to caspase-mediated digestion (Table I), thereby indicating that the X3 position is insensitive to acidic charge perturbations.

Oncol. 1999; 14: 563-570PubMed Google Scholar) are the only keratins that have previously been demonstrated to undergo degradation during apoptosis. Degradation occurs primarily in type I keratins, with marked relative sparing of type II keratins as determined for K8, which is the only type II keratin studied in this context (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Sparing of type II keratins may be related to differences of the context of the caspase box within the L1–2 region of the rod (Fig. 1 B, note the E→S substitution in type II keratins within the VEVD sequence), but type II keratins do posses other potential caspase recognition sequences (e.g. 77LEVD and 253LDMD in K8) that do not appear to be prominently cleaved. One important finding herein is that K14 is also a caspase substrate in transfected cells. This indicates that the remaining keratins of K12–17, in addition to desmin and neurofilament-L, are also likely to be caspase substrates because they all share the same VEMD motif, which differs slightly from the K18–20 (VEVD) motif. The type of keratin fragments generated during apoptosis may differ depending on the presence or absence of other caspase recognition motifs and their susceptibility to cleavage. In the case of K18, two well-defined cut sites occur as defined immunologically (7Leers M.P. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. Bergman T. Tribbick G. Persson B. Bjorklund P. Ramaekers F.C. Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornvall H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and molecularly (Fig. 2). These two sites undergo sequential caspase-mediated digestion (Fig. 6) with release of the small K18 tail fragment (397) from the K8/K18 complex, followed by cleavage at K18 Asp237 to generate two stable fragments (1–237 and 238–396) that remain associated with K8. This apoptosis-associated keratin cleavage is accompanied by significant reorganization of the keratin cytoskeletal network (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar,20Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

Transient transfection of the K18, K19, and K14 mutants (with WT K8) did not have any significant effect on filament organization as determined by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Keratin hyperphosphorylation occurs as an early event upon exposure of cells to an apoptotic signal (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,24Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the major K8 and K18 phosphorylation sites did not affect the susceptibility of caspase-mediated cleavage of K18 at Asp237, thereby indicating that dephosphorylation did not affect keratin degradation during apoptosis (6Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, hyperphosphorylation does significantly inhibit caspase-3 in vitro digestibility of K18 at Asp237 (the second sequentially cut K18 site), but not at Asp396 (the first cut site) (Fig. 6). This raises the possibility that hyperphosphorylation of the remaining type I keratins, which are cleaved at the K18 Asp237-equivalent site (Fig.1 B), may also be protective. Several functional roles, acting alone or in concert, can be envisioned for keratin hyperphosphorylation during apoptosis: (i) a simple by-product of the apoptosis-associated activation of multiple kinases (e.g. Refs. 25Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita Ki K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar and 26Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar); if so, this favors a role for keratins as a phosphate reservoir or sink (24Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) a facilitator, alone or in concert with keratin degradation, of keratin filament reorganization during apoptosis, or (iii) a mechanism that either protects from apoptosis-induced damage (in this case degradation of keratins) or allows for a graded sequence of apoptotic events. The caspase box motif that is found within the L1–2 region of the rod domain of cytoplasmic IF proteins is a prototype caspase recognition motif, represented in type I keratins by X1E/DX2DX3 (with site of cleavage occurring at the D between X2 and X3; X1-X3, hydrophobic residues). Our results showed that replacement of X1 by an Arg prevents caspase-mediated degradation (Table I), which suggests that basic residue substitutions at X1 are likely to be incompatible with substrate-enzyme recognition. In contrast, the X2 or X3 positions were not affected by basic residue substitutions in that M/V→R mutations (i.e.VEMD/VEVD→VERD in K14, K18, or K19) or A→D mutations (VEMDA/VEVDA→VEMDD/VEVDDin K14 or K18), which mimic K14 mutations found in EBS patients, had no measurable effect on caspase-mediated cleavage of the type I keratin. These results, using an in vivo transfection system, are similar to what has been noted with in vitro peptide substrates in that the X2 position can tolerate a wide range of amino acids, whereas X1 seems to dictate caspase enzyme-type specificity (27Sleath P.R.

The significance of keratin degradation in modulating apoptotic progression is unclear, although the predicted and observed reorganization of the cytoskeleton during apoptosis (5Caulin C. Salvesen G.S. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 20Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggests that caspase cleavage during apoptosis is likely to facilitate apoptotic body formation. Formation of keratin fragments during apoptosis has potential clinical utility because detection of such fragments has been used in a number of studies as diagnostic and prognostic markers (30van Dalen A. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2345-2349PubMed Google Scholar, 31van Dalen A. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 1999; 14: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Valik D. Nekulova M. Br. J.

Chemother. 1978; 22: 16-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include the so-called tissue polypeptide antigen and tissue polypeptide-specific antigen, which are related to K8, K18, and K19 (36Weber K. Osborn M. Moll R. Wiklund B. Luning B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2707-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and to a C-terminal K18 fragment (37Rydlander L. Ziegler E. Bergman T. Schoberl E. Steiner G. Bergman A.C. Zetterberg A. Marberger M. Bjorklund P. Skern T. Einarsson R. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms for generating tissue polypeptide antigen and tissue polypeptide-specific-like fragments are unknown, although caspase-mediated degradation and/or other protease activation are likely mechanisms. Hence, understanding the precise molecular changes that occur to keratins during apoptosis is an important first step in determining the significance of caspase-mediated keratin fragment formation and release in tumors. The presence of keratin mutations within the caspase box in patients with epidermal diseases raises the possibility that alterations in susceptibility to caspase-mediated cleavage could impact disease pathogenesis or alter susceptibility to other skin diseases. For example, apoptosis (and presumably subsequent keratin degradation) is a feature of several skin diseases and injury (e.g. Refs. 38Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Spoonde A.

Identification of the keratin cleavage sites during apoptosis will allow subsequent in vivo testing of the significance of mutations that inhibit keratin degradation on progression of apoptosis. Although keratin mutations are most common within the proximal region of the rod domain (12Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W.

Of the four such K14 mutations we tested, only the K14 D273G mutation prevented the caspase-mediated digestibility of K14 (Table I). Another K14 mutation (M272R) generated a K14 fragment with altered mobility on SDS-PAGE gels, and a similar mutation that was introduced in K18 and K19 also altered the migration of the resultant apoptotic fragment (Fig. 5). The cause of this altered migration is unclear, but it is unlikely to be due to the arginine mutationper se because introducing an arginine (V220R) proximally did not alter fragment migration (Fig. 5). Given that the type I keratins K12–14, K16, K17, and K18 have been associated with a variety of human diseases (12Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 13Irvine A.D. McLean W.H. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), it is likely that additional mutations within L1–2 and the caspase box will be defined. If so, our results should facilitate the prediction of whether such mutations will interfere with caspase digestion. K15 and K17 were also recently shown biochemically to undergo apoptosis-induced digestion at the aspartate of the conserved VEMDA (40Badock V. Steinhusen U. Bommert K. Wittmann-Liebold B. Otto A.

Other protein-directed mechanisms of Raf-1 regulation have been identified recently. These appear to function through a poorly understood mechanism of membrane targeting and the organization of Raf-1 with its effectors. These include KSR (18Kornfeld K. Hom D.B. Horvitz H.R.

The Raf kinases contribute to the complex process of cell proliferation through their regulation of the MAPK cascade. Persistent stimulation of this cascade by activated Raf protein can result in cellular transformation (reviewed in Ref. 23Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 495-500PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work by Mason et al. (8Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the expression of oncogenic Ras in cells induced phosphorylation of Raf-1 at serine 338, a consensus site for PKC-mediated phosphorylation, whereas activated Src induced Raf-1 phosphorylation predominantly at tyrosine 341; Raf-1 phosphorylation was also dependent upon its association with the plasma membrane. Mitogen-induced Raf-1 activity required phosphorylation on both Ser-338 and Tyr-341, which cooperate to induce full Raf-1 activation. Under specific conditions, Tyr-341 phosphorylation appeared to direct Ser-338 phosphorylation, since Raf-1 harboring a Y341A substitution was not phosphorylated on Ser-338 in cells expressing activated Ras and Src. Although co-expression of activated Ras and Src induced Ser-338 phosphorylation that was dependent upon phosphorylation of Tyr-341, mitogen-induced (PMA or EGF) Ser-338 phosphorylation could occur in the absence of Tyr-341 phosphorylation. This observation suggested that two distinct Raf-1 kinases might phosphorylate Raf-1 on Ser-338 and contribute to its activation in vivo. Recently, in addition to PKC, PAK3, a kinase downstream of the Ras-related Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac, was also identified as a putative Raf-1 kinase by its ability to phosphorylate Raf-1 on Ser-338 in vitro(24King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). PKC activation by phorbol esters or diacylglycerol (DAG) activates the MAPK cascade, presumably through stimulating Raf-1 activity (25Cai M. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Several PKC family members phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 in vitro indicating that the actions of PKC may directly impinge upon the MAPK cascade. Ser-338 has been identified as a putative PKC phosphorylation site on Raf-1 (7Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Both classical (cPKC) and novel (nPKC) PKCs have the potential to phosphorylate and activate Raf-1. Both cPKC and nPKC respond to DAG or phorbol ester and have been suggested as Raf-1 regulatory kinases (25Cai M. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M.

There is little evidence, however, as to whether Raf-1 activity is directly regulated by distinct PKC isozymes. Schonwasser et al. (26Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although cPKCα, nPKCη, and the atypical (DAG- and Ca2+-independent) PKCζ stimulate MEK1 and ERK2 activity, only PKCα and -η were able to directly stimulate Raf-1 activity. However, a study by Ueda et al. (29Ueda Y. Hirai S.-I. Osada S.-I. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) suggested that the expression of activated nPKCδ, but not activated cPKCα or nPKCε, activated the MAPK pathway in a c-Raf-1-dependent manner. Although these studies demonstrated some degree of PKC isotype specificity in Raf-1 regulation, the use of activated PKC constructs did not clearly define an unequivocal role for distinct PKC isotypes in Raf-1 regulation. The interaction and regulation of Raf-1 by Ras (30Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) is the best characterized Ras-dependent signaling cascade.In vivo, activated Ras binds Raf-1, localizing the kinase to the plasma membrane (14Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) where it is subsequently phosphorylated and activated (6Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 8Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The physical interaction of Ras with Raf-1 also provides a structural requirement for efficient Raf-1 activation. Tamada et al. (13Tamada M. Hu C.-D. Kariya K.-I. Okada T. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) described a Ras activator region mutant, Ras(V45E), which, although it bound efficiently to Raf-1 and recruited the kinase to the plasma membrane, failed to stimulate efficiently Raf-1 activity. These data indicated that not only did Ras interact with the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 but that the interaction of Ras with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain was also critical in Raf-1 activation. Previous studies in this laboratory demonstrated a Ras isoform dependence in the regulation of c-Raf-1 activation in C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts transformed by the minimal expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras. These studies demonstrated that N-Ras has a higher affinity for c-Raf-1 than did Ha-Ras in vivo (32Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells transformed with oncogenic N-Ras had a persistently elevated MAPK activity that was resistant to the actions of growth factor and receptor tyrosine kinase antagonists, unlike those transformed by oncogenic Ha-Ras. This suggested that distinct aspects of an Ha-Ras-transformed cell phenotype, including persistent stimulation of MAPK activity, were the consequence of autocrine growth factor signaling (32Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Hamilton M. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28155-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and not the physical association of c-Raf-1 with Ha-Ras. Indeed, contrary to expectations, oncogenic Ha-Ras was not associated with c-Raf-1. Oncogenic N-Ras, however, was sufficient in itself to stimulate the MAPK cascade through its stable association with c-Raf-1. Further analysis demonstrated that in Ha-Ras-transformed cells, c-Raf-1 was associated with wild-type c-N-Ras and that antisense mediated down-regulation of c-N-Ras protein levels in these cells ablated their elevated MAPK activity and inhibited their serum-independent growth. These observations supported the concept that in this cell background, c-N-Ras was the Ras isoform that specifically regulated c-Raf-1 and the MAPK cascade. We have now identified the existence of signaling complexes containing c-N-Ras, c-Raf-1, and PKCε that are biochemically silent, insofar as possessing no significant Raf-1 activity, in quiescent, normal, non-transfected C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts. In light of the recent observations of Marais et al. (34Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the interaction between Raf-1 and Ras was necessary for PKC to activate Raf-1, we have now extended those observation to show that these biochemically silent complexes of c-N-Ras, c-Raf-1, and PKCε are latent and are directly activated by phorbol esters. We postulate that these latent complexes represent physiological signaling modules that are a target for the phorbol ester-mediated activation of c-Raf-1 through the activation of PKCε.

Raf-1 and PKC isozyme-specific monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. N-Ras and phospho-ERK monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-MAPK rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The N-Ras-specific polyclonal antisera used for immunoprecipitation studies have been described previously (32Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, respectively. The phospho-Ser-338 Raf-1 rat monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from Richard Marais, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. Normal mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts and their (G12V)Ha-Ras-transformed counterparts, 11A cells, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 5% (v/v) CO2/air environment. Cells were made quiescent by serum deprivation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48–72 h. Immunoblot analysis was performed according to standard protocols. After resolution on SDS-PAGE gels, proteins were electroblotted to PVDF membranes and blocked using 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody in TBST containing 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum. Membranes were then extensively washed with TBST before being incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were again extensively washed, and the immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL. Equal amounts of whole cell lysate or solubilized plasma membrane proteins were incubated with 50 µl of anti-N-Ras sera or non-immune sera or with 2.5–5 µg of purified antibodies at 4 °C. After 2 h, the lysates were microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the clarified lysates were transferred to clean tubes containing either protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose, in excess, and the antibody complexes were precipitated for an additional hour at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with TBST, denatured by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. Plasma membranes were prepared using a modified protocol as described by Smart et al. (54Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed, scraped, and pelleted by low speed centrifugation in Tricine buffer (20 mm Tricine, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.75 ml of Tricine buffer and disrupted with 20 strokes in a 7-ml Dounce. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and stored on ice. The cell debris was resuspended in 0.75 ml of Tricine buffer, homogenized, and recentrifuged as described. The supernatant was removed and combined with the first supernatant. The supernatant was then layered on a 30% (v/v) Percoll gradient prepared in Tricine buffer and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation through the 30% Percoll gradient, the distinct, plasma membrane band was collected and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.6, and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The plasma membrane was collected and washed twice with TBS followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The pelleted plasma membranes were solubilized in P21 buffer (20 mm MOPS, 200 mm sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) containing 1% (w/v) CHAPS (CHAPS buffer) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 20 min on ice. The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Enrichment of plasma membranes was monitored by Western analysis for the plasma membrane marker protein, the ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+ATPase versus the mitochondrial specific protein Porin. Plasma membranes were prepared from 72-h starved C3H10T1/2 cells as described. Equal amounts of plasma membrane protein were incubated with either 2 µg of control (Con) antibody or with a PKCε-specific antibody (P14820; Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by high speed centrifugation to remove protein aggregates. The soluble protein was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography at 4 °C through a 1-m Sephacryl S200HR column equilibrated in TBS, pH 7.6, containing 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS. Eluted protein was collected as 0.95-ml fractions for analysis by SDS-PAGE. All inhibitors were reconstituted in Me2SO. C3H10T1/2 cells were serum-starved for 72 h. Prior to mitogen stimulation, cells were either incubated overnight with 5 µm PMA (chronic PMA) or for 1 h prior to mitogen stimulation with the cPKC and nPKC inhibitor, GF109203X (10 µm), the cPKC inhibitor, Gö6976 (10 µm), or with the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM (25 µm). Cells were pretreated for 30 min with the PKCδ-specific inhibitor Rottlerin (15 µm). Cells were stimulated with either 10 ng/ml EGF or 5 µm PMA for 3 min. Cell lysates were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted for activated MAPKs using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated, activated ERK1 and ERK2. The specificity of the PKC inhibitors was confirmed, in vitro. 200 ng of recombinant PKCα and PKCε were incubated in P21 buffer containing either 10 µm GF109203X or Gö6976 or Me2SO solvent alone, 400 ng of PKCε or PKCα peptide substrate, 10 µm ATP, 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 10 µmphosphatase inhibitors, 10 µm CaCl2 (PKCα buffer only), 50 ng/ml PMA and were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 120 µl of 10% (v/v) phosphoric acid; the reactions were spotted onto P81 paper and washed extensively with 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid. The P81 paper was dried with acetone, and the samples were processed for counting in a scintillation counter. PKCε antisense ODN sequences were derived from the mouse PKCε cDNA sequence and selected to recognize areas of minimal secondary structure and base pairing using the RNA folding program Mulfold. A specific 18-mer PKCε sense ODN and complementary antisense sequences were synthesized as phosphorothioate-modified, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified DNA ODNs. The 18-mer sense ODN sequence is cagacgttccttttggac, and its complementary antisense sequence is gtccaaaaggaacgtctg. These sequences correspond to bases 115–132 of the published mouse PKCε cDNA sequence (NM005400). Confluent C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected for 5 h with 1 µm sense or antisense PKCε-specific ODN in the presence of the cationic lipid, LipofectACE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were allowed to recover overnight and then serum-starved for 48 h before being stimulated with 5 µm PMA for 3 min. Cells were lysed in 400 µl of CHAPS buffer, and the lysates were analyzed for PKC expression and MAPK activity. MAPK activity was measured in a direct kinase assay. Briefly, MAPK was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell protein for 2 h using a MAPK-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody precoupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed with P21 buffer and then incubated in 50 µl of P21 buffer containing 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 10 µm ATP, 10 µm phosphatase inhibitors, and 25 µm myelin basic protein (MBP) as a MAPK substrate. Kinase reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 50 µl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The reactions were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, and the phosphorylated MBP was visualized using a Molecular Dynamics StormImager. c-N-Ras immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with P21 buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and then twice with P21 buffer alone. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer (P21 buffer containing 25 µm ATP, 20 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 µm phosphatase inhibitors) containing 2.5 µg of kinase-inactive GST-MEK1(K97A) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli buffer and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Phosphorylated GST-MEK1 was visualized on a Molecular Dynamics StormImager. c-N-Ras immunoprecipitates were washed as described above. Immunoprecipitates were then washed once in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 µm phosphatase inhibitors, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm MnCl2) and incubated in 50 µl of Kinase Buffer B (Buffer A containing 25 µm ATP, 30 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2.5 µg of GST-MEK1(K97A), 25 µg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 50 ng/ml PMA) for 30 min at 30 °C. Additional calcium was not added to the buffers. 10 µm GF109203X was included in some reactions to inhibit PKC activity. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 µl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and phosphorylated proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics StormImager. 1–5 ng of purified, recombinant human PKCε was incubated with 2.0 µg of GST-MEK1(K97A) in Kinase Buffer B with or without phosphatidylserine and PMA for 30 min at 30 °C. In parallel reactions, 2 ng of recombinant human PKCε was incubated with 10–100 ng of PKCε peptide substrate (NH2-ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV-OH) in kinase buffer B containing PMA for 30 min at 30 °C. After 30-min reactions were transferred to 0.22 µm GS filters (Millipore), prewashed with P21 buffer containing 1 mm ATP, and washed extensively with the same buffer. [32P]Phosphate incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. CHAPS-solubilized rat brain extracts (30Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) were used as a source of N-Ras. These lysates were exchanged with 100 µm GTP in the presence of 25 mm EDTA for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess Mg2+was added to stabilize the N-Ras-GTP. Glutathione-agarose precoupled (and washed) with GST fused to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (GST-RBD) was added to the lysates. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C the beads were washed and then incubated in the indicated concentrations of buffered NaCl (1 h at 4 °C). The beads were again washed, and the amount of N-Ras associated with the GST-RBD was assessed by Western analysis. A similar experiment was performed in which the preformed N-Ras-RBD complexes were incubated (1 h at 4 °C) with buffer at the indicated pH values (ranging from 4 to 9) rather than increasing NaCl concentrations. The GST-RBD-agarose was washed, and the amount of N-Ras associated with the RBD was determined by Western analysis. GTP binding assays were performed with [α-32P]GTP in p21 buffer supplemented with 25 mm EDTA and 100 µm GTP. These assays were done in two different ways. First we tested whether the exchange was inhibited at buffer pH values ranging from 4–9. This was done simply by altering the pH of the assay buffer and performing the filter binding assay as described previously (30Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Second, we tested whether the Ras-GTP complex itself was stable at pH values ranging from 4 to 9. In this assay the GTP binding was performed at pH 7.4 in the standard binding buffer described above. Excess Mg2+ was added to stabilize the complex; the pH was altered, and excess unlabeled GTP was added to quench any labeled GTP released by the change in pH. After 1 h at 4 °C, the reactions were then filter through 0.22-micron filters as descr"
https://openalex.org/W2107017864,"Multiple Na+/H+exchangers (NHEs) are expressed in salivary gland cells; however, their functions in the secretion of saliva by acinar cells and the subsequent modification of the ionic composition of this fluid by the ducts are unclear. Mice with targeted disruptions of the Nhe1,Nhe2, and Nhe3 genes were used to study the in vivo functions of these exchangers in parotid glands. Immunohistochemistry indicated that NHE1 was localized to the basolateral and NHE2 to apical membranes of both acinar and duct cells, whereas NHE3 was restricted to the apical region of duct cells. Na+/H+ exchange was reduced more than 95% in acinar cells and greater than 80% in duct cells of NHE1-deficient mice (Nhe1 −/−). Salivation in response to pilocarpine stimulation was reduced significantly in bothNhe1 −/− and Nhe2 −/−mice, particularly during prolonged stimulation, whereas the loss of NHE3 had no effect on secretion. Expression of Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter mRNA increased dramatically in Nhe1 −/− parotid glands but not in those of Nhe2 −/− orNhe3 −/− mice, suggesting that compensation occurs for the loss of NHE1. The sodium content, chloride activity and osmolality of saliva in Nhe2 −/− orNhe3 −/− mice were comparable with those of wild-type mice. In contrast, Nhe1 −/− mice displayed impaired NaCl absorption. These results suggest that in parotid duct cells apical NHE2 and NHE3 do not play a major role in Na+ absorption. These results also demonstrate that basolateral NHE1 and apical NHE2 modulate saliva secretion in vivo, especially during sustained stimulation when secretion depends less on Na+/K+/2Cl−cotransporter activity.

Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter isoform 1 Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms 1–4 epithelial Na+ channel β-, and γ-ENaC, α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC nucleotides Saliva formation is thought to involve a two-stage process (1Martinez J.R. Holzgreve H. Frick A. Pflugers Arch. Gesamte Physiol. Menschen Tiere. 1966; 290: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Thaysen J.H. Thorn N.A. Schwartz I.L. Am. J.

Menschen Tiere. 1966; 291: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Initially, acinar cells secrete an isotonic plasma-like fluid, the generation of which depends on the coordinated activity of a number of membrane transport proteins that drive net transepithelial Cl− movement and significant HCO 3− efflux (see Refs. 4Melvin J.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 5Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that Cl− uptake across the basolateral membrane of acinar cells is primarily mediated via the electroneutral Na+/K+/2Cl−cotransporter. This has been demonstrated clearly in mice lacking expression of theNkcc1 1 gene, in which pilocarpine-stimulated secretion is greatly reduced but not eliminated (6Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J. Watson G.E. Nguyen H.V. Dennnett M.R. Hand A.R. Flagella M. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In situ, the main fluid and electrolyte agonist acetylcholine triggers secretion by increasing the Cl− and HCO 3− permeability of the apical membrane. HCO 3− efflux via the apical anion channel produces an intracellular acid load that is rapidly buffered by an increase in Na+/H+exchanger activity (7Lau K.R. Elliott A.C. Brown P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C288-C295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19564-19569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Soltoff S.P.

Therefore, the residual secretion from NKCC1-deficient mice is likely mediated by enhanced Na+/H+ exchange, which drives Cl−uptake via the coupled operation of Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO 3− exchangers as well as carbonic anhydrase- and Na+/H+exchanger-dependent HCO 3−efflux (5Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). During the second stage of secretion, ductal cells modify acinar secretions primarily by conserving NaCl in a flow rate-dependent fashion; and because the apical surfaces of salivary ducts are relatively impermeant to water, saliva is generally hypotonic (see Refs. 4Melvin J.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 5Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). A “typical” NaCl-conserving duct cell is thought to possess at least two Na+ uptake mechanisms. The first of these is Na+/H+exchange located in the lumenal membrane (10Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M.

Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Of the different Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoforms expressed in salivary gland duct cells, NHE2 and NHE3 are thought to be associated with Na+ absorption in other epithelial tissues (see Refs.13Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and 14Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). A second mechanism for Na+ uptake by salivary gland duct cells is an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (15Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This channel has properties comparable with the cloned epithelial Na+ channel ENaC (16Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which is involved in Na+absorption in the kidney and lungs (see Ref. 17Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Consistent with the two-stage secretion model, inhibitor studies suggest that Na+/H+ exchangers may contribute both to fluid and electrolyte secretion from acinar cells and to reabsorption of NaCl by duct cells (18Dissing S. Nauntofte B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G1044-G1055PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lau K.R. Howorth A.J. Case R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 425: 407-427Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Martinez J.R.

The relative lack of specificity of these inhibitors makes it unclear as to which NHE isoforms are involved. The mammalian NHE gene family consists of six isoforms (13Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 14Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Of these, NHE1, NHE2, NHE3, and NHE4 are expressed in the plasma membrane of epithelial tissues including salivary glands (10Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the specific functions of the individual NHE isoforms in salivary glands. To determine the molecular identity of the Na+/H+ exchangers involved in the above processes, we examined the effects ofNhe1, Nhe2, and Nhe3 gene disruptions on mouse parotid gland function. Our results demonstrate that Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms NHE1 and NHE2, which are located in the basolateral and apical membranes of acinar cells, respectively, are important regulators of saliva secretion in vivo. Furthermore, the loss of NHE2 or NHE3 does not inhibit NaCl absorption by duct cells, whereas NaCl absorption was blunted in NHE1-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, these results suggest that neither NHE2 nor NHE3 are primary Na+ absorption mechanisms in mouse parotid glands. All chemicals were from Sigma. Targeted disruptions of the murine Nhe1,Nhe2, and Nhe3 genes were performed previously (24Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J.

All animals were housed in micro-isolator cages with access to laboratory chow and waterad libitum with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Experiments were carried out on animals aged between 1.5 and 4 months. Body and parotid gland weights were recorded for each animal used. HomozygousNhe1 −/− mutants exhibited decreased rates of postnatal growth resulting in significantly lower body weights than their wild-type or heterozygous littermates, exhibited an ataxic gait, and became prone to epileptic seizures that ended in a catatonic-like state, from which the animal usually recovered (24Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C788-C795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, mean body weights (g) for NHE1 animals were 30.8 ± 2.2 (+/+, n = 11) and 16.4 ± 2.2 (−/−,n = 12, p < 0.01 compared with +/+, Student's t test). The magnitude of the body weight loss (>45%) did not correlate with a comparable decrease in parotid gland weight (∼7%); parotid weights (mg) were 33.9 ± 2.4 (+/+,n = 12) and 31.5 ± 1.9 (−/−, n= 14). Nhe2 and Nhe3 mutant mice grew normally and exhibited the same appearance and behavior as wild-type animals (25Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J.

Nhe2 body weights were 30.3 ± 0.9 (+/+,n = 30) and 29.2 ± 1.0 (−/−, n= 23), and parotid weights were 33.4 ± 1.8 (+/+,n = 20) and 32.5 ± 2.0 (−/−, n= 8). Nhe3 body weights were 32.4 ± 1.6 (+/+,n = 26) and 31.3 ± 1.1 (−/−, n= 22), and parotid weights were 45.3 ± 3.1 (+/+,n = 14) and 41.7 ± 2.8 (−/−, n= 10). For immunolocalization experiments, Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE1 was detected using a polyclonal antibody kindly provided by Dr. J. Noel. Specific antisera for NHE2 (antibody 2M5) and NHE3 (1314) were used as described previously (27Bookstein C. Xie Y. Rabenau K. Musch M.W. McSwine R.L. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. Am. J.

Parotid glands fromNhe1 −/−, Nhe2 −/−,Nhe3 −/− (negative control), and wild-type animals were removed and immediately placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (NHE1) or frozen in 2-methylbutane on dry ice (NHE2 and NHE3). Paraformaldehyde-treated tissue was paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 4 µm. Frozen sections (10 µm) were fixed and permeabilized, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked as described previously (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS, O.8% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 1:500 (NHE1) or 1:200 (NHE2 and NHE3) dilutions of antibody and then treated with 1:1000 Alexa 594 fluor-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the above buffer (NHE1) or 1:500 fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (NHE2 and NHE3, goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Images were recorded and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope or a Leica confocal microscope. To avoid contamination of saliva by other body fluids (e.g. tracheal and nasal secretions), saliva was collected directly from isolated parotid gland ducts. Wild-type and null mutant animals of either sex were anesthetized with chloral hydrate, and the main excretory duct of the right and left parotid glands were isolated using a dissecting microscope. Prior to saliva collection, a tracheotomy was performed to prevent asphyxiation. Secretion was initiated by the injection of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine HCl (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and saliva was collected from each duct in a calibrated glass micropipette (Sigma) by capillary flow. The rate of fluid production was measured by marking the position of the fluid front on the micropipette wall every 5 min. Each animal was weighed prior to an experiment, and parotid glands were subsequently dissected, trimmed free of connective tissue, and weighed. For data presentation, the volume of saliva secreted (µl) and the rate of parotid saliva flow in µl/min were normalized to 100 mg parotid gland weight. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of the saliva flow from both the right and left glands fromn animals measured at each time point. Collected saliva samples were analyzed for total sodium and potassium content by atomic absorption using a Perkin-Elmer 3030 spectrophotometer. Sample osmolality was measured using a Wescor 5500 Vapor Pressure Osmometer, and chloride activity was estimated using an Orion EA 940 expandable ion analyzer. Total RNA was isolated from the parotid glands of mice using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by poly(A)+ mRNA selection using an Oligotex mRNA kit from Quiagen. For Northern analysis, each gland sample was pooled from three or more mice. Northern blots were prepared and hybridized as described previously (6Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J. Watson G.E.

A cDNA for mouse ribosomal messenger RNA L32 (mouse nts 3072–3244, GenBankTM accession number K02060) was used to normalize the expression between preparations. For dot blots, mRNA was isolated from the parotid glands of individual animals. Ten separate replicate dot blots were prepared using each mRNA sample. Each blot was hybridized with both a specific probe (as described above) then stripped and probed with L32 cDNA. Quantitation was performed by PhosphorImager analysis (Bio-Rad). Parotid acini (5–20 cells) were prepared from wild-type and knockout littermates by collagenase digestion (29Evans R.L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29025-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, glands were minced in Earle's minimum essential medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 0.075 units/ml collagenase P, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the same medium at 37 °C for 75 min. The final acinar preparation was loaded with a pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator by incubation with 2 µm carboxy SNARF1-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 30 min in a physiological salt solution. Experiments to measure intracellular pH were carried out in physiological salt solution containing (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 20 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). NH4Cl-containing physiological salt solution was made by substituting 30 mmNaCl with 30 mm NH4Cl. Intracellular fluorescence was monitored in ratio mode from acini and ducts adhering to the base of a superfusion chamber mounted on an UltimaTMconfocal microscope (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were excited at 514 nm and emitted fluorescence measured at 570 and ≥630 nm. Intracellular pH was estimated by in situ calibration of the excitation ratio using the high K+/nigericin protocol as described previously (30Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchanger activity was monitored after an NH4Cl-induced acid load (31Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). For light and electron microscopic studies of the parotid gland, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine (100 mg/10 mg, intraperitoneal) and perfused intracardially with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). The glands were excised, immersed in fixative for an additional 3–4 h, then trimmed into small pieces, and rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. The tissues were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in cacodylate buffer and then stained in block with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate. After dehydration in graded ethanol solutions and substitution with propylene oxide, the tissues were embedded in Polybed epoxy resin (Polysciences). For light microscopy, 1-µm sections were stained with methylene blue-Azure II and examined in a Leitz Orthoplan microscope. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope. Previous reports have demonstrated that the distribution of the different NHE isoforms is species- and salivary gland type-specific. Thus, to better understand the precise function(s) of the various NHE isoforms expressed in mouse parotid glands we first documented their distribution by immunohistochemistry. NHE1 has been localized to the basolateral membrane of acinar and duct cells in rat parotid (10Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar, 23Robertson M.A. Woodside M. Foskett J.K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). NHE2 and NHE3 are located in the apical membranes of submandibular ducts and acini, whereas only NHE3 was detected in the ductal apical membrane of the rat parotid gland (10Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). The top left panel of Fig.1 shows that NHE1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of acinar cells in wild-type mice. No labeling was detected in parotid sections from Nhe1 −/− null mutant mice (top right panel), verifying the specificity of the antibody. Much more intense staining was seen in the ducts of parotid gland. An image of a duct in cross-section is shown in themiddle left panel of Fig. 1, where the intensity of the illumination was reduced relative to that used in the top left panel to prevent overexposure. The middle right panelof Fig. 1 is a Nomarski image of the duct shown in the middle left panel. To more clearly demonstrate the acinar localization of NHE1, parotid cells were dispersed by treatment with collagenase. Consistent with the staining observed in tissue sections (top left panel), NHE1 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of isolated acinar cells (bottom left panel). A Nomarski image of this acinus is provided in the bottom right panel of Fig.1. These data confirm the targeting of NHE1 to the basolateral membranes of mouse parotid acinar and duct cells. In contrast to NHE1 staining, the top left panel of Fig.2 shows that NHE2 protein was distributed primarily to the apical membranes of duct cells (strong specific apical staining is indicated by arrows; note that the basal borders of the duct are overlaid by dashed lines). Much less intense staining of the apical membrane of acinar cells was detected; in fact, in some acini, expression of NHE2 protein was either absent or too low to be detected. The antibody used was specific because parotid sections from Nhe2 null mutants showed an absence of staining (top right panel). Parotid glands were dispersed by treatment with collagenase to more clearly demonstrate the localization of NHE2 in acinar cells. In agreement with the staining observed in tissue sections (top left panel), NHE2 was primarily expressed in the apical region of isolated acinar cells (middle left panel; the outline of the acinus is represented by thedashed line). A Nomarski image of this acinus is provided in the middle right panel of Fig. 2. NHE3 protein was not detected in parotid acinar cells but only in the apical region of duct cells (arrow in the bottom left panel of Fig. 2; the basal border of the duct cut in cross-section is overlaid by adashed line). No staining was detected in NHE3-deficient mice (bottom right panel of Fig. 2). Nhe1,Nhe2, and Nhe3 null mutant animals were used to examine the contribution of each isoform to pH regulation in parotid acinar and duct cells. The NH4+ pulse method was used to acid-load cells to monitor Na+/H+exchanger activity. The average intracellular pH responses to this manipulation in acinar cells isolated from wild-type (+/+,dotted line) and NHE1-deficient animals (−/−,solid line) are shown in Fig.3 A. Removal of NH4Cl led to an intracellular acidification followed by an intracellular pH recovery, and this recovery was inhibited by more than 95% in NHE1-deficient mice, whereas disruption of the Nhe2and Nhe3 genes (data not shown) had little or no effect on recovery rates (see also Ref. 29Evans R.L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29025-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Duct cells isolated fromNhe1+/+ animals (+/+, dotted line) also recovered their intracellular pH (Fig.3 B) but at an initial rate nearly 3-fold faster than that of acinar cells. The more robust Na+/H+ exchanger activity in duct cells likely reflects the higher expression of Na+/H+ exchangers in this cell type (see Figs.1 and 2). The magnitude of the inhibition of pH recovery caused by disruption of the Nhe1 gene was less dramatic in duct cells (∼80%, −/−, solid line). This result correlates with the abundance of NHE2 and NHE3 in ducts (see Fig. 2). Moreover, the residual pH recovery in duct cells from NHE1-deficient mice was about an order of magnitude more resistant to the amiloride derivative ethylisopropyl amiloride than ducts from wild-type mice (data not shown), in agreement with immunological staining suggesting that NHE3 is strongly expressed in this cell type. These results confirm that NHE1 is the major regulator of intracellular pH in mouse parotid acinar cells and also demonstrate that NHE1 contributes to pH regulation in duct cells, albeit less significantly. Earlier studies using the Na+/H+exchange inhibitor amiloride and its analogs suggested that Na+/H+ exchangers may be involved in salivation. Localization of NHE1 and NHE2 (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively) to acinar cells suggests that one or both of these isoforms might contribute to secretion. To directly test the role of each NHE isoform, parotid saliva was collected from Nhe1, Nhe2, orNhe3 wild-type and null mutant mice over a 50-min time period. Fig. 4 A shows that targeted disruption of Nhe1 (open circles) reduced the total volume of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva secreted during the 50-min collection period by 34% compared with wild-type animals (solid circles). The magnitude of the decrease in flow rate increased over time. The flow rate was reduced by 16% during the first 5 min and reached 42% inhibition at the end of the 50-min collection period (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, disruption of NHE2 expression reduced the total volume of saliva secreted by 29% (Fig.5 A), and the effect on the flow rate increased during prolonged stimulation from 18% during the first 5 min to 46% inhibition at 50 min (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, normal salivation was observed in NHE3-deficient mice (Fig.5, C and D). For all genotypes, note the high initial flow rate seen at the commencement of secretion, which declines to a lower relatively constant rate thereafter. The secretion kinetics and flow rates are similar to those reported previously (6Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J. Watson G.E. Nguyen H.V. Dennnett M.R. Hand A.R. Flagella M. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J.

Subsequently, duct cells reabsorb much of the secreted NaCl to produce a hypotonic NaCl-poor saliva. Na+/H+ exchangers play a major role in NaCl absorption in other epithelia, although it is unknown whether they serve a similar function in salivary glands. To examine this possibility, parotid saliva was collected from Nhe1,Nhe2, or Nhe3 wild-type and null mutant mice, and the sodium and potassium content, Cl− activity, and osmolality were determined. Table I shows that the ion content and the osmolality of saliva collected from NHE2- and NHE3-deficient mice were comparable with secretions from littermate wild-type mice, suggesting that these Na+/H+exchangers do not play a major role in NaCl reabsorption in this tissue. In contrast, the osmolality and sodium, potassium, and chloride content increased significantly in saliva fromNhe1 −/− mice.Table ITargeted disruption of murine Nhe1, Nhe2, and Nhe3 genes: effects on osmolality, sodium content, potassium content, and chloride activity of pilocarpine-stimulated salivaNHE"
https://openalex.org/W2069321561,"Retinoblastoma-binding protein 2 (Rbp2) was originally identified as a retinoblastoma protein (RB) pocket domain-binding protein. Although Rbp2 has been shown to interact with RB, p107, TATA-binding protein, and T-cell oncogene rhombotin-2, the physiological function of Rbp2 remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that Rbp2 not only binds to nuclear receptors (NRs) but also enhances the transcription mediated by them. Rbp2 interacts with the DNA-binding domains of NRs and potentiates NR-mediated transcription in an AF-2-dependent manner. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Rbp2 are critical for the transactivation activity of Rbp2 on NRs. The C terminus is the NR-interacting region. In addition, RB functions in maximizing the effect of Rbp2 on the transcription by NRs. These results suggest that Rbp2 is a coregulator of NRs and define a potential role for Rbp2 in NR-mediated transcription.

The loss of RB function leads to a variety of cancers and defects in the development of certain cell types. RB has been shown to have the ability to block cell cycle progression from G1- to S-phase (2Huang H. Yee J. Shew J. Chen P. Bookstein R. Friedmann T. Lee E. Lee W.H.

This inhibition of cell proliferation is to some extent through the binding of RB to the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate numerous genes involved in S-phase entry, such as N-myc (4Mudryi M.

Phosphorylation of RB by cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases leads to dissociation of RB from E2F, allowing progression into the S-phase (7Tavosian S.G. Shih H.H. Mendelson K.G. Sheppard K.A. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The region of RB required for growth suppression has been studied extensively. The region consists of a domain called the pocket domain, a domain targeted by viral transforming proteins such as adenovirus E1A protein, simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen, and human papillomavirus E7 protein (reviewed in Ref. 8Nevins J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region are often tumorigenic (9Qin X. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A number of cellular proteins were identified based on their abilities to associate with the RB pocket domain. These RB-binding proteins, like viral E1A, T antigen, and E7, share a stretch of amino acid sequence LXCXE within their RB-binding domains. Some of the RB-binding proteins have been shown to cooperate with RB in inducing cell cycle arrest (10Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luba J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) represent a superfamily of structurally and functionally related ligand-inducible transcription factors that are involved in diverse biological events including development, differentiation, and homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 17Mangelsdorf D.J.

Members of the family include the receptors for thyroid hormones, steroids, retinoids, and vitamin D that activate transcription in response to their ligands by binding to cognate elements in the promoters of their target genes. All NRs have a modular structure with regions termed A–F. The N-terminal A/B regions contain the activity activation function 1 (AF1) that activates transcription constitutively. The central C region is the DNA-binding domain (DBD) that associates with specific DNA elements in target genes. Region D is a variable hinge region. The C-terminal region E contains a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a dimerization surface, and the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function 2 (AF2). Region F is a variable region at the extreme end of the C terminus (reviewed in Refs.17Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

These coactivators modify local chromatin structure by acetylating histones, and they directly assemble and/or stabilize the transcription preinitiation complex.

In addition, NRs and CBP/p300 have been shown to interact directly or indirectly with TFIIB, TATA-binding protein (TBP), and components of the basal transcriptional machinery (26Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 38Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A short sequence motif LXXLL (where L is leucine andX is any amino acid), present in some coactivators like p140, SRC1, and CBP/p300, is necessary and sufficient for mediating the interaction of the coactivators with NRs (39Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Although Rbp2 was originally isolated as an RB pocket domain-binding protein and has been shown to interact also with TBP, p107, and T-cell oncogene rhombotin-2 (15Kim Y.W. Gregory A.O. Kratzke R.A.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), its role in transcription remains obscure. In this study, we show that Rbp2 not only interacts with NRs but also enhances their transcription activity. The presence of Rbp2 is required for the transcription mediated by NRs, and RB is important for maximal activation. Both the C terminus and N terminus of Rbp2 play an important role in its activity. pGem-4Z-Rbp2 was a gift from Deborah Defeo-Jones.

Rbp2AS was constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified antisense cDNA encoding amino acids 1–168 into the XbaI site of pCI-neo. Rbp2M1(L728A,L729A), containing leucines 728 and 729 mutated to alanines, was constructed by replacing theApaI/StuI fragment of pCI-neo-Rbp2 corresponding to amino acids 245–828 with the corresponding cDNA fragment containing the indicated point mutations generated by the overlapping PCR mutagenesis strategy. Rbp2M2(L948A,L949A) was constructed by replacing the StuI/BsiWI fragment corresponding to amino acids 828–1238 with the corresponding cDNA fragment containing the indicated point mutations. Rbp2M12(L728A, L729A,L948A,L949A) was generated by replacing theStuI/BsiWI fragment of Rbp2M1(L948A,L949A) with the StuI/BsiW1 fragment containing leucines 728 and 729 mutated to alanine from Rbp2M1(L728A,L729A). ER(full-length), ER(ABC), ER(C), and ER(CDEF) were generated by inserting PCR-amplified cDNAs encoding amino acids 1–262, 180–262, and 180–595 into the MluI/SalI site of pCI-neo-VSVG-NLS. PCI-neo-ER**(M543A,L544A) was constructed by inserting ER cDNA containing the indicated point mutations generated by overlapping PCR mutagenesis strategy. ER(CDEF**), where ** indicates M543A and L544A mutations, was constructed by inserting PCR-amplified fragment encoding amino acids 180–595 from pCI-neo-ER**(M543A,L544A) into pCIneo-VSVG-NLS.

GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion constructs containing indicated amino acids of different nuclear hormone receptors were generated as follows: GST-ER (amino acids 251–595) was generated by inserting PCR-amplified cDNA into the EcoRI/SalI site of pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-RAR (amino acids 143–462) were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified cDNA fragment intoEcoRI/XhoI site of pGEX-KG. GST-GR (amino acids 465–792) were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified cDNA into theNcoI/SalI site of pGEX-KG. GST-VDR (amino acids 66–427) was generated by inserting PCR-amplified intoSalI/HindIII site of pGEX-KG. GST-ER(A/B), GST-ER(DBD), and GST-ER(LBD) were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified cDNAs encoding amino acids 1–179, 180–262, and 302–552 into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pGEX-KG, respectively. All the constructs were sequenced to confirm that there was no mutation created during PCR. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) carrying the pGEX fusion constructs was grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C until OD 0.8–1 and was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at room temperature. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline. The lysates were spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins were either stored at 4 °C or eluted with 5 volumes of 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8). The pure GST fusion proteins were stored at 4 or −20 °C. Protein-protein affinity chromatography with purified GST-ER (amino acids 251–595), GST-RAR (amino acids 143–462), GST-VDR (amino acids 66–427), GST-GR (amino acids 465–795), GST-RB (amino acids 373–792), and GST-YKT6 or GST alone bound to glutathione-Sepharose (5 µg/25 µl of resin), and 5 µl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitrotranslated Rbp2 protein was done in the presence or absence of appropriate ligands in binding buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors mixtures (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 500 µl at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was subsequently washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were released in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer and then analyzed by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and autoradiography. In some experiments, 5 µg of GST-ER(A/B), GST-ER(DBD), and GST-ER(LBD) were incubated in the presence and absence of 17β-estradiol for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1 mg of cell lysate and incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were then centrifuged, washed three times in binding buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western-blotted with anti-Rbp2 antibodies. Bacterially expressed GST-Rbp2 (amino acids 1430–1722) was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted in a buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). Polyclonal sera were raised against purified GST-Rbp2 (amino acids 1430–1722) in rabbits and were affinity-purified. An equal amount of each cDNA encoding HA-ER and VSVG-Rbp2 was introduced with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in COS-7 cells in 10-cm plates. Cells were induced with 17β-estradiol for 16 h before harvesting at 48 h posttransfection and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. Precleared extracts were incubated with 30 µg of HA monoclonal antibody and 60 µl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose overnight. Immunoprecipitated HA-tagged protein complexes were washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in 2× sample buffer. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were probed either with anti-VSVG or anti-ER (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce). Binding was detected by supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The binding assay was performed as described (35Blanco J.C.G. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 pmol of 45-base pair double-stranded DNA fragment containing two copies of ERE labeled with biotin at the 5′ end of one strand was conjugated to streptavidin beads (Pierce). In vitro translated 35S-labeled ER was bound to the ERE-conjugated beads in binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of ligand at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were subsequently washed with the binding buffer and incubated with in vitro translated35S-labeled Rbp2 with the same buffer in the presence and absence of ligand at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to autoradiography. Visual examination of Rbp2 amino acid sequence led to the identification of two LXXLL motifs (residues 725–729 and 945–949). To examine the potential association of Rbp2 with NRs, ER (amino acids 251–595) was fused to GST to generate GST-ER and incubated with 35S-labeled Rbp2 in the presence or absence of 17β-estradiol. 35S-Labeled Rbp2 was retained on GST-ER beads in a ligand-independent manner (Fig.1A, lanes 4 and5) but not on GST or GST-YKT6 beads (40Lowe S.L. Peter F. Subramaniam V.N. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nature. 1997; 389: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a protein involved in vesicle transport (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and 12). 35S-Labeled Rbp2 was retained by the GST-RB pocket (amino acids 373–792) (Fig. 1 A, lane 13), serving as a positive control. GST fusion proteins containing RAR (amino acids 143–462), GR (amino acids 465–795), and VDR (amino acids 66–427) were also produced and tested for interaction with35S-labeled Rbp2. All these have the ability to retain Rbp2 in the presence and absence of ligands, although with different efficiencies (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6–11). These results suggest that Rbp2 may directly interact with NRs in vitro in a ligand-independent manner. To determine whether Rbp2 and NRs can physically interact in mammalian cells, COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ER and VSVG-tagged Rbp2 expression vectors. Cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and the bound proteins were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VSVG antibody to detect Rbp2 that was coimmunoprecipitated. Rbp2 protein was clearly detected in the immunoprecipitates pulled down by anti-HA antibody, which recognized HA-tagged ER, from cells transfected with both ER and Rbp2, but not in the nontransfected cells (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). The interaction between Rbp2 and ER is again ligand-independent. The membrane blot was stripped and immunoblotted again with anti-ER antibody to show the presence of ER protein in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates pulled down by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 B,bottom panel). These results indicate that Rbp2 indeed interacts with ER in the cells. Rbp2 contains two LXXLL motifs in the central region (residues 725–729 as NR box 1 and residues 945–949 as NR box 2). LXXLL motifs are found in a large variety of LBD/AF2-interacting proteins (39Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). We next examined whether these motifs are responsible for the observed interaction of Rbp2 with NRs. Various Rbp2 mutants that contain mutations in the LXXLL motifs were tested. The LXXLL motifs were altered to LXXAA, a change influencing the binding of coactivators to receptors. Three LXXAA mutants of Rbp2 were constructed as shown in Fig. 2A. Rbp2M1 has an LXXAA mutation in the first NR box (amino acids 725–729). Rbp2M2 contains a LXXAA mutation in the second NR box (amino acids 945–949), whereas Rbp2M12 has both the NR boxes mutated. These mutants were compared with wild type Rbp2 for interaction with ER in in vitro GST pull-down experiments. GST-ER interacts with Rbp2 and each of the Rbp2 mutants with comparable efficiencies (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the LXXLL motifs of Rbp2 are not required for its interaction with NRs. Since the LXXLL motifs of Rbp2 are not required for binding to NRs (Fig. 2 B), it is possible that Rbp2 binds to regions of NR other than LBD. To delineate the Rbp2-binding domain of ER, different regions of ER were expressed as fusion proteins with GST to produce GST-ER(A/B), GST-ER(DBD), and GST-ER(LBD), as shown in Fig.3A. These various fusion proteins were used to examine their ability to retain Rbp2 from HeLa cell lysates. Proteins retained by these beads were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown, Rbp2 was bound by GST-ER(DBD) and GST-RB (positive control) affinity beads (Fig. 3 B, lane 4 and 7) but not by GST, GST-ER(A/B), or GST-ER(LBD) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2, 3, 5,and 6). Similarly, the DNA-binding domain of RAR binds Rbp2 (data not shown). These results indicate that Rbp2 interacts with the DBDs of NRs. Since Rbp2 interacts with the DBDs of NRs, it is important to examine whether Rbp2 could form a ternary complex with NR bound to DNA. To test this possibility, a binding assay using ER that had been bound to the estrogen-responsive element (ERE) conjugated to agarose beads was performed. Fig. 3 C shows that in vitro translated35S-labeled ER bound to ERE beads in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 5–10). Similar to the reported ligand-independent interaction of RAR and retinoid X receptor with RARE beads in vitro (35Blanco J.C.G. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), interaction of ER with immobilized ERE was independent of ligand (lanes 5–10). The ER-ERE beads were then incubated with the indicated amount of in vitro translated 35S-labeled Rbp2 in the presence or absence of ligand. The bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. Rbp2 was retained together with ER on the ERE beads in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5–10). No direct interaction of Rbp2 with ERE beads was observed (lane 4), suggesting that observed retention of Rbp2 was mediated by ER. RAR or Rbp2 was not retained by ERE beads (lanes 11–13). These results indicate that Rbp2 could form a ternary complex with ER bound to DNA. Since the LXXLL motifs of Rbp2 are not required for binding to NRs, a series of deletion constructs of Rbp2, tagged with VSVG, were generated to delineate the NR-binding domain (Fig.4A). GST-ER(DBD) was used to pull down interacting proteins from COS-7 cells transfected with the various deletion constructs of Rbp2. The deletion constructs were expressed efficiently in COS-7 cells as shown in Fig. 4 B,upper panel. The binding results shown in Fig.4 B, lower panel, established that the C-terminal region (amino acids 1379–1722) of Rbp2 is able to associate with ER(DBD) (Fig. 4 B, lower panel, lane 5). To map further the receptor interaction domain, the C-terminal region (amino acids 1379–1722) was subcloned into two smaller fragments, and each retained the ability to interact with ER independently, although with apparently less efficiency (Fig.4 B, lanes 6 and 7). We conclude that Rbp2 has at least two separable receptor interaction domains located at its C-terminal region, and these two regions act together for optimal interaction with NRs. The ability of Rbp2 to interact with NRs prompted us to test whether Rbp2 could stimulate transcription mediated by NRs. HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for ER, Rbp2, and ERE-LUC reporter in the presence or absence of 17β-est"

The chloroplast SRP (cpSRP) is unique among SRPs in that it possesses no RNA and is functional in post-translational as well as co-translational targeting. We have expressed and purified the two components of the Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) involved in post-translational transport: cpSRP54 and the chloroplast-specific protein, cpSRP43. Recombinant cpSRP supports the efficient in vitro insertion of pea preLhcb1 into isolated thylakoid membranes. Recombinant cpSRP is a stable heterodimer with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration analysis, and dynamic light scattering. The interactions of the components of the recombinant heterodimer and pea preLhcb1 were probed using an immobilized peptide library (pepscan) approach. These data confirm two previously reported interactions with the L18 region and the third transmembrane helix of Lhcb1 and suggest that the interface of the cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 proteins is involved in substrate binding. Additionally, cpSRP components are shown to recognize peptides from the cleavable, N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide of preLhcb1. The interaction of cpSRP43 with cpSRP54 was probed in a similar experiment with a peptide library representing cpSPR54.

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Since these LHCPs are nuclear encoded and are also the most abundant proteins within the thylakoid membrane, there is a strong demand for the efficient transport and targeting of these proteins into the chloroplast and into the thylakoid membrane (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) has been identified as the major targeting factor involved in the post-translational targeting of Lhcb1 from the inner chloroplast membrane to the thylakoid membrane (3Franklin A.E.

Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and it is probable that many other LHCPs also utilize cpSRP. Although the SRP system is conserved in all organisms, there are significant differences in its composition (8Lütcke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 531-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). All SRP systems described target their substrates as they are synthesized at the ribosome (co-translationally) through an interaction with a ribosome/nascent chain complex (9Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 10Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Ann. Rev.

The chloroplast SRP (cpSRP) differs from all other SRP systems in two respects. First, unlike SRPs from eukaryotes or prokaryotes, no RNA has so far been identified as part of cpSRP. Second, cpSRP is present within two pools in the chloroplast: a co-translationally active SRP54 homologue (cpSRP54), which associates with the chloroplast ribosome/nascent chain complex (3Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and a post-translationally active cpSRP, which has been shown to contain cpSRP54 and the novel SRP component, cpSRP43 (5Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,6Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The co-translational and post-translational cpSRP pools may be distinguished by differing subunit compositions, as no cpSRP43 could be identified in cpSRP/ribosome/nascent chain complexes engaged in co-translational transport (12Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). cpSRP54 is unable to form a complex with the 4.5 S RNA from Escherichia coli, despite sharing 74% sequence identity with the SRP54 homolog (Ffh) from E. coli (13Schuenemann D. Amin P. Hoffman N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). cpSRP43 is also unable to form a functional transit complex with Ffh (13Schuenemann D. Amin P. Hoffman N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), making it unlikely that cpSRP43 is a direct functional protein substitution for the RNA of other SRPs. Rather, the presence or absence of cpSRP43 seems to determine the targeting activity of cpSRP54. Although the LHCPs are highly hydrophobic, Lhcb1 is soluble in the stroma in a “transit complex,” which has been shown to contain cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 (5Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These proteinaceous components maintain the substrate in an insertion competent form, but insertion of Lhcb1 requires the additional presence of the chloroplast SRP receptor homologue, cpFtsY, and GTP (14Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, cpSRP is again unusual in that it recognizes an internal signal sequence within the LHCPs, rather than the usual N-terminal signal sequence recognized by the other SRP systems. Cross-linking experiments suggest this cpSRP targeting signal to be the highly hydrophobic third transmembrane helix (TM3) of LHCPs (15High S. Henry R. Mould R.M. Valent Q. Meacock S. Cline K. Gray J.C. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A hydrophilic peptide immediately N-terminal to TM3, known as L18, has been identified as a further targeting signal as the addition of this L18 peptide promotes the insertion of non-chloroplast membrane protein chimeras into thylakoid membranes (16DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A glutathioneS-transferase-L18 construct interacts with cpSRP43 in the absence of cpSRP54 in vitro, and cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 were proposed to interact independently with the substrate to form the transit complex (17Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of this transit complex was determined to be around 120 kDa by non-denaturing gel analysis (18Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, more recent data indicated a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa for the cpSRP43/cpSRP54/Lhcb1 transit complex (6Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest a heterotetrameric form of the cpSRP43/54 complex, a heterotrimeric cpSRP consisting of two molecules of cpSRP43 and a single cpSRP54 with a mass of 129 kDa has been proposed (14Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been proposed that cpSRP43 is a dimer both in stroma and in recombinantly expressed material (14Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this report, we have expressed and purified ArabidopsiscpSRP43 and cpSRP54 to homogeneity individually as well as in complex (cpSRP). Recombinant cpSRP is a heterodimer and cpSRP43 a monomer. In an in vitro insertion assay, using preLhcb1 from pea as a substrate, we show that recombinant cpSRP is active. We identify regions of interaction between cpSRP and preLhcb1 as well as between cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 using an immobilized peptide library. A bicistronic plasmid coding for the mature forms of the cpSRP components was constructed from two plasmids coding for the mature cpSRP54 and cpSPR43 proteins (a kind gift of N. E. Hoffman), introducing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site C-terminal to the 6-His tag of cpSRP43. The forward and reverse primers for cpSRP43 were: 5′-GCTCTAGAAGGAGGGTCTCACATGGCCGCCGTACAAAGAAACTACG-3′ and 5′-GCGTTAACGCTAGCTCATTCATTCATTGGTTGTTG-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers for cpSRP54 were: 5′-GCTCTAGAAGGAGATATATACATGTTTGGTCAGTTGACTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCGCTAGCTTAGTTACCAGAGCCGAAGCC-3′, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BsaI andNheI (cpSRP43) or XbaI and BamHI (cpSRP54) and ligated into the expression plasmid digested withNcoI and BamHI. This plasmid was introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were then grown in LB medium prior to induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β- d-galactopyranoside. The identity of the recombinantly expressed cpSRP54 was confirmed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody raised against cpSRP54 in rabbits (a gift from N. E. Hoffman). The cpSRP43 construct contains an N-terminal 6-His tag and was identified by an anti-6-His antibody (Qiagen). The expression products were further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Lysate from the expression was bound to Fast Flow Chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8, 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A). The column was washed, and cpSRP43/54 complex was eluted by a step gradient to 300 mm imidazole, pH 8. The complex can be dissociated on a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield the individual proteins or further purified on a Sephadex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B). Pure cpSRP complex elutes as a single peak. When the complex is reconstituted from individually purified cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 excess of either cpSRP component elutes as a separate single peak from the Sephadex-200 column. A C-terminal deletion construct of cpSRP54 (cpSRP54Δ461), which lacks the C-terminal 26 amino acids, was made using standard polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme techniques and was expressed and purified on Fast Flow Chelating Sepharose as described above for the full-length construct. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation techniques were used to determine the molecular mass of both the cpSRP complex and cpSRP43 in high and low salt conditions using a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge (Beckman; Ref. 19Creeth J.M. Pain R.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1967; 17: 217-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The sample volumes were 120 µl, with the wavelength and protein concentrations chosen to allow data collection within the linear range of the detector over the height of the column (concentrations were typically 0.1–1 mg/ml), although, in all cases, the protein solution under investigation was prepared by dilution from a concentrated sample (≥10 mg/ml). Centrifugation speeds were chosen based on predictions from the Ultrascan II for Unix package (copyright 1998, 1999; UTHSCSA). The data were fitted to a single component system using the Beckman Ultrascan package. A Dynapro (DYNAPRO-MS) dynamic light scattering device was used to test for aggregation of cpSRP complex and cpSRP components in all buffers used. This technique measures the average hydrodynamic radius of molecules in solution and is routinely used in crystallographic laboratories in order to test for conditions in which purified proteins are present in a single oligomerization state (monodisperse) or in a number of different oligomerization states (polydisperse) (for a review, see Ref. 20Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Immobilized peptide libraries representing cpSRP54 (15-mer peptides, five amino acids shift) and preLhcb1 (18-mer peptides, three amino acids shift) were synthesized with an ASP222 machine on activated cellulose membranes containing polyethylene glycol 600 amino spacers (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid derivatives (21Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Experimental conditions are described elsewhere (22Groves M.R. Sinning I. Koch J. Mahler M. Immobilized Peptide Arrays on Membrane Supports: Synthesis and Applications. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes are incubated to equilibrium with cpSRP or individual components under different blocking conditions, washed, and decorated with either an anti-cpSRP54 and/or an anti-His antibody (for 6-His-cpSPR43). After washing the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies, washed again, and binding detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to identify nonspecific interactions, two different washing buffers in independent experiments (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, with or without an additional 0.5% (w/v) milk powder) were used. The precursor of pea Lhcb1 (preLhcb1) was synthesized in vitro by transcription of the cDNA clone AB80, followed by translation in a wheat germ lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation mixture was treated with puromycin and centrifuged to remove any aggregated material, as described by Thompson et al. (23Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes and stromal extracts of pea chloroplasts were prepared as described previously (24Brock I.W. Hazell L. Michl D. Nielsen V.S. Moller B.L. Herrmann R.G. Klosgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After lysis of the chloroplasts in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8 (HM buffer), the membranes were washed twice in 82.5 mm sorbitol, 12.5 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8, before being resuspended in HM buffer to a concentration of 1 mg/ml chlorophyll (all operations were carried out at 4 °C). All insertion assays contained the following components: washed thylakoid membranes equivalent to 25 µg of chlorophyll, 0.15 mm GTP, 5 µl of in vitro translated pLhcb1, and HM buffer to a final volume of 100 µl. For analysis of cpSRP function, insertion assays included 10 µl of purified cpSRP in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B) (protein quantities given in figure legends). Stromal controls contained stromal extract equivalent to 110 µg of chlorophyll, supplemented with 10 µl of buffer B. Buffer controls contained 10 µl of buffer B. Where appropriate, various inhibitors were added to the insertion assays: 2 units of apyrase (Sigma, type VI), 0.5 mmnon-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (pH 7), 0.5 mmnon-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP-PNP (pH 7), 0.125 mm L18 peptide, or 0.125 mm L13 peptide. Assay samples were set up on ice and the incubation started with the addition of the in vitro translated preLhcb1. Samples were incubated in a water bath for 30 min at 26 °C, under 300 µmole photons m−2s−1. After incubation the samples were diluted by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold HM buffer, and the membranes were reisolated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The membranes were then extracted with 6.8 m urea, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8, as described by Thompson et al. (23Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), to remove non-inserted preLhcb1. One half of each sample was then treated with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma, type XIII) on ice for 30 min. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type I-S) and 10 µg of bovine serum albumin, before reisolation of the membranes by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The proteolyzed membranes were finally resuspended in 15 µl of HM containing 10 µg of trypsin inhibitor, and 15 µl of protein sample buffer before immediately heating the sample to 100 °C for 5 min. Non-proteolyzed membranes were resuspended in 15 µl of 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8, and 15 µl of protein sample buffer. All samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by staining of the gels in Coomassie Brilliant Blue and fluorography. Synthetic peptides L18 (VDPLYPGGSFDPLGLADD) and L13 (YLGPFSGESPSYL) were purchased from Jerini Biotools (Berlin). Rabbit antibodies againstArabidopsis cpFtsY and cpSRP54 were a kind gift of N. E. Hoffman; a chicken antibody against Arabidopsis cpSRP43 was a kind gift of L. Nussaume. Washed thylakoid membranes were prepared as described above. Additional aliquots of thylakoid membranes were washed once with 2 m potassium acetate, pH 8, before being washed twice with 82.5 mm sorbitol, 12.5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8. All membranes were finally resuspended in HM buffer and their respective chlorophyll concentrations determined. Samples of intact pea chloroplasts, stromal extract, and the various thylakoid membranes equivalent to 5 µg of chlorophyll, together with defined quantities of cpSRP complex, cpSRP54, and cpSRP43 were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the proteins transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using a semidry blotting apparatus. The membranes were probed with 1:2000 dilution of the anti-cpFtsY antibody, followed by 1:5000 dilutions of the anti-cpSRP54 and anti-cpSRP43 antibodies, and were stripped and washed between each probing. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cross-linking, glutathioneS-transferase binding, and gel filtration data published previously suggest that cpSRP43 is a dimer in solution (14Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on gel filtration data, it had been proposed that cpSRP is most likely a heterotrimer containing one cpSRP54 and a dimer of cpSRP43 (14Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To study cpSRP in more detail, we have co-expressed the cpSRP proteins cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 from Arabidopsis in milligram amounts. Both proteins have been purified to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1A). Pure cpSRP and cpSRP43 elute from the Superdex-200 column with apparent molecular masses of approximately 120 and 53 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 B). cpSRP can be purified either directly from E. coli co-expressing cpSRP54 and cpSPR43, or it can be formed by mixing purified cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 prior to gel filtration. In both cases, no stable higher molecular mass complexes are obtained and the excess of either cpSRP component elutes as a monomer. Only a small fraction of cpSRP components elute in the void volume of the column, with apparent molecular masses in excess of 2 MDa (Fig. 1 B). cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 co-elute from a gel filtration column equilibrated in 600 mm NaCl with the same elution profile as shown in Fig. 1 B. However, at an even higher salt concentration of 1m NaCl, cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 elute as two overlapping peaks, indicating that no cpSRP is formed (data not shown). cpSRP and cpSRP43 were subjected to equilibrium ultracentrifugation at various salt concentrations in order to accurately determine their molecular masses. The molecular mass of the cpSRP complex after gel filtration was determined to be 98 kDa (S.D. of fit 5 kDa) in both 300 mm and 25 mm NaCl (data not shown), in good agreement with the molecular mass of 93 kDa predicted from the cDNA sequences of mature 6-His-cpSRP43 and cpSRP54. As both cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 are present in the sample, visualized from the Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A), this clearly indicates a heterodimeric structure for cpSRP. The molecular mass of cpSRP43 in 100 mm NaCl was determined to be 43 kDa (S.D. of fit 2 kDa, data not shown), which is consistent with a monomer. Dynamic light scattering indicated a monodisperse (unaggregated) behavior for cpSRP43, cpSRP54, and cpSRP complex at concentrations in excess of 1 mg/ml in all buffer and salt conditions tested. No other additional higher molecular mass components could be identified in any of these experiments, and in all cases the concentration of the sample was greater than 0.1 mg/ml. The activity of the recombinant cpSRP was tested usingin vitro assays for the insertion of proteins into isolated thylakoid membranes. PreLhcb1 was used in these assays, as it is a known SRP substrate whose insertion is accompanied by the acquisition of pronounced resistance to trypsin proteolysis (6Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PreLhcb1 was incubated with thylakoids in the presence of insertion buffer, stromal extract (which contains cpSRP and so supports insertion) and the purified, heterodimeric cpSRP (Fig.2A). In this experiment we also tested diagnostic inhibitors for their ability to inhibit insertion; these included the non-hydrolyzable analogues of GTP and ATP (GMP-PNP and AMP-PNP, respectively), the L18 peptide shown to inhibit preLhcb1 insertion, and an additional control peptide derived from the preLhcb1 sequence (termed L13). Control assays carried out in the absence of any inhibitors (lanes marked Cont.) show that very little preLhcb1 inserts in the presence of buffer, whereas significant levels of protease-protected degradation product (DP) are observed using stromal extract. Importantly, the recombinant, dimeric cpSRP also supports efficient insertion, demonstrating that it is active. The activity of the cpSRP is completely inhibited in the presence of apyrase or the GTP analogue GMP-PNP, whereas AMP-PNP has no effect, confirming the GTPase activity of purified cpSRP. Interestingly, GMP-PNP also inhibits insertion using stromal extract, but in this case the inhibition is only partial. This can be understood on the basis that multiple rounds of cpSRP GTPase activity are needed for detectable levels of insertion. The L18 peptide at 0.125 mm also inhibits the activity of the recombinant cpSRP. In this particular experiment, insertion efficiency was reduced by about 50%, but near-complete inhibition has been observed in other experiments (data not shown). The L18 peptide also inhibits the ability of stromal extract to support insertion, as found previously (16DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). No effect is observed using the L13 peptide as a control. Insertion assays using stromal extract, recombinant cpSRP, and the individual cpSRP subunits show that both components of cpSRP are required for insertion of preLhcb1 (Fig. 2 B). The insertion observed with recombinant material is lower than that of stromal extract. No insertion is observed using purified cpSRP54 alone, and very little insertion is evident with cpSRP43 alone (this background insertion is probably due to contaminating cpSRP54 on the thylakoids; see below). These data indicate that the separate subunits can combine rapidly to form an active cpSRP complex during the timescale of the experiment (30 min). All of the insertion processes shown in this experiment are totally inhibited by pretreatment of the assay mixture with 2 units of apyrase, which hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates. Further tests were carried out to compare the activity of recombinant cpSRP with that present in crude stromal extract and to investigate the basis for the cpSRP43 mediated low level insertion observed above. Fig.3(A and B) shows cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 immunoblots of stromal extract (lane S, equivalent to 5% of that present in the import assay) and the purified heterodimeric cpSRP (lane D), equivalent to 10% of that used in the insertion assay. The signals obtained in this and other experiments indicate that the amount of recombinant cpSRP used in these assays is within a factor of 5 to that of the stromal sample. Fig. 3 C shows cpSRP43, cpSRP54, and cpFtsY immunoblots of stromal extract (lanes S), the thylakoids used in the insertion assays (lanes T) and thylakoids washed stringently using 2 mpotassium acetate, which removes all extrinsic protein (lanes Tac). The cpSRP43 signal is evident in the stroma sample but completely absent from either thylakoid sample, demonstrating that cpSRP43 does not interact directly with the thylakoid membranes used in the insertion assays. In contrast, Fig.3 C demonstrates that some cpSRP54 is present associated with the thylakoids used in the insertion assays and this subunit is only totally removed by the more stringent acetate washing. These data serve to explain some of the findings using the individual cpSRP subunits (Fig. 2 B). cpSRP43 alone was shown to support low level insertion of preLhcb1. cpSRP54 is present on the thylakoids, in low but significant amounts, and we propose that this endogenous cpSRP54 is able to bind to the recombinant cpSRP43 added to the insertion assays and thereby reconstitute an active cpSRP complex. It seems unlikely that cpSRP43 on its own can support insertion at any level, since it contains no identifiable nucleotide binding site and the insertion processes shown in Fig. 2 B are all apyrase-sensitive. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that the cpSRP-dependent insertion of preLhcb1 is dependent on the presence of both subunits. Although acetate washing of thylakoids is highly effective"

L., Ha, T., Tran, T. T., Kenneally, M., Harkin, P., Jung, M., MacLaughlin, D. T., Donahoe, P. K., and Maheswaran, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 28371–28379). Here we demonstrate that MIS activates the NFκB signaling cascade, induces IEX-1S mRNA, and inhibits the growth of MCF10A, an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line with characteristics of normal cells. In vivo, an inverse correlation was found to exist between various stages of mammary growth and MIS type II receptor expression. Receptor mRNA significantly diminished during puberty, when the ductal system branches and invades the adipose stroma and during the expansive growth at lactation, but it was up-regulated during involution, a time of regression and apoptosis. Peripartum variations in MIS type II receptor expression correlated with NFκB activation and IEX-1S mRNA expression. Administration of MIS to female mice induced NFκB DNA binding and IEX-1S mRNA expression in the breast. Furthermore, exposure to MIS in vivo increased apoptosis in the mouse mammary ductal epithelium. Thus, MIS may function as an endogenous hormonal regulator of NFκB signaling and growth in the breast. Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) inhibits breast cancer cell growth in vitro through interference with cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis, a process associated with NFκB activation and up-regulation of one of its important target genes, IEX-1S (Segev, D.

Müllerian inhibiting substance recombinant human MIS polymerase chain reaction nuclear factor κB The importance of MIS,1a sexually dimorphic member of the transforming growth factor β family of hormones, in regression of the Müllerian duct in male embryos is well established. MIS is produced by Sertoli cells of the testis even after regression of the Müllerian duct and continues to be made throughout adulthood. In females, synthesis by granulosa cells of the ovary commences after birth and persists until menopause (2Hudson P.L. Dougas I. Donahoe P.K. Cate R.L. Epstein J. Pepinsky R.B. MacLaughlin D.T. J.

The continued production of MIS throughout adolescence and adulthood in males and females implies other functional roles for this hormone after causing regression of the Müllerian duct. The MIS type II receptor, a highly conserved single transmembrane serine threonine kinase, is homologous to members of the transforming growth factor β family of type II receptors (4Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.

The binding of MIS ligand to its receptor initiates a signaling cascade that is dependent on recruitment of type I receptors, ALK2 and ALK6, which also signal for bone morphogenetic proteins (7Visser J.A.

It is expressed at high levels in the Müllerian duct, the Sertoli and granulosa cells of embryonic and adult gonads (6Teixeira J. He W.W. Shah P.C. Morikawa N. Lee M.M. Catlin E.A. Hudson P.L. Wing J. Maclaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the status of receptor expression and MIS responsiveness in other tissues has yet to be clarified. Using several different techniques, we recently demonstrated MIS type II receptor expression in normal breast, human breast fibroadenomas, ductal carcinomas, and cancer cell lines (10Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). MIS inhibited the growth of both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells in vitro by interfering with cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. The effect of MIS on breast cell proliferation correlated with its ability to induce the NFκB family of transcription factors and to up-regulate IEX-1S (10Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), an immediate early gene known to be induced following NFκB activation by other extracellular signals. PRG1 and gly96 represent the rat and mouse homologues, respectively, of human IEX-1 (11Schafer H. Diebel J. Arlt A. Trauzold A. Schmidt W.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IEX-1S in breast cancer cells inhibited their growth, indicating a negative growth regulatory role for this newly identified NFκB-inducible gene (10Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T.

The NFκB family consists of transcriptional activators, including p65, p50, p52, and c-Rel, that share a Rel homology domain and form either homo- or heterodimers that bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. NFκB in its inactive state exists in the cytosol bound to the inhibitory IκB family of molecules. Activation of the pathway by extracellular signals leads to phosphorylation and degradation of IκB with subsequent nuclear localization of NFκB (12Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative inhibitor of NFκB (IκBα-DN) in breast cancer cells ablated MIS-mediated induction of IEX-1S, inhibition of growth, and induction of apoptosis, indicating that activation of the NFκB pathway was required for these processes (10Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether MIS-mediated growth inhibition through activation of the NFκB signaling cascade, previously characterized using human breast cancer cell lines, is also functional in normal breast tissue, we analyzed the effect of MIS on MCF10A, a nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line (1Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar), and on murine mammary glands in vivo. Furthermore, to evaluate whether these events are developmentally regulated, we analyzed endogenous MIS type II receptor expression, NFκB activity, and IEX-1 expression in the mammary gland during postnatal morphogenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that MIS activates the NFκB signaling cascade, induces IEX-1S expression, and inhibits the growth of MCF10A cells. Peripartum expression of MIS type II receptor in the rat breast correlated with the level of NFκB DNA binding activity and expression of IEX-1S mRNA. In addition, exogenous MIS activated NFκB DNA binding and induced IEX-1S expression in the mammary glands of adult mice and increased the number of apoptotic cells in the ductal epithelium of the breast in vivo. Thus, MIS might be a hormonal regulator of the NFκB signaling cascade in vivo and a negative regulator of normal breast growth. Human breast cancer cell line T47D was grown in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 10% female fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. MCF10A cells were grown in mammary epithelial growth medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem). 184A1 cells (a gift from Dr. Martha Stampfer) were grown in mammary epithelial growth medium supplemented with isoproterenol and transferrin. To test the growth inhibitory effect of exogenous MIS, MCF 10A cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture flasks in the absence of MIS. MIS was added after 24 h, cultures were grown in the presence or absence of 35 nm MIS for 3 days, and cell numbers were compared by Coulter counter. MIS type II receptor expression analyses in the rat breast during development and peripartum stages were done using Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Recombinant human MIS (rhMIS) was collected from growth medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human MIS gene and purified as described in Ref. 14Ragin R.C. Donahoe P.K. Kenneally M.K. Ahmad M.F. MacLaughlin D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. To study the effects of rhMIS on the mammary gland, adult female C3H mice (8 weeks old; average weight, 25 g) were obtained from the Edwin L. Steele Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). All animals were cared for and experiments performed in this facility under guidelines approved by the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board-Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital. All experiments were performed using ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) for anesthesia. Each animal was injected intraperitoneally with 100 µg of rhMIS or phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle control). Breast tissue was harvested bilaterally from each animal for RNA isolation and gel shift assays. Blood was drawn from the animals at the time of tissue harvest to determine the circulating level of rhMIS using MIS-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Six-week-old female Rag 2 knockout mice (16Shinkai Y. Rathbun G. Lam K.P. Oltz E.M. Stewart V. Mendelsohn M. Charron J. Datta M. Young F. Stall A.M. Alt F.W.

At the end of this period, breast tissue was harvested bilaterally from each animal, and serum was collected to determine the circulating levels of rhMIS. Part of the tissue was embedded in paraffin for ApopTag assay and fluorescein-labeled in situ cell death detection. MCF10A and T47D cells were grown to 70% confluence and treated with 35 nm rhMIS for 1 h. Cells were harvested in cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of TKM (10:10:1) (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2), and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C, and proteins were extracted in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 350 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 3 µg of protein was used in 25-µl binding reactions containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 70 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4% glycerol. The oligonucleotide containing the consensus DNA binding sequence for NFκB proteins (Promega) was 32P-end-labeled, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. Supershift experiments were performed by adding 0.1 µg of rabbit anti-p65 or p50 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to the binding reactions. Nuclear protein extraction from tissues was performed as described by Sovak et al. (27Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin.

To generate a riboprobe to detect MIS type II receptor expression in the rat, a DNA fragment containing part of exon 11 and the 3′ untranslated region of the rat MIS type II receptor was amplified using the following primers: sense, 5′-CCCCGAATTCCCTGGCTTATCCTCAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCCCCTCGAGTCAGCCTGTACAGAGTTCATATGA-3′. The rat MIS type II receptor cDNA was used as the template. The receptor fragment was cloned in reverse orientation into XhoI-EcoRI sites of the pCDNA 3.1(–) plasmid. The resulting construct was sequenced to confirm the boundaries of the insert and linearized withHindIII, and the antisense transcript was obtained using T7 polymerase (MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit, Ambion). RNase protection assays were done with 90–100 µg of total RNA isolated from the rat breast at various stages of development using the RPA III ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion). RNA samples derived from both individual animals or pooled from groups of three animals were analyzed as indicated in the figure legends. Briefly, RNA was hybridized with 75–80 pg of radiolabeled probe overnight at 50–55 °C and digested with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C. The protected fragments were precipitated and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polycrylamide/6 m urea gel. The same amount of yeast tRNA were used as a positive control for the function of RNase, and another sample containing the same amount of yeast tRNA was incubated without RNase to control for probe integrity. The riboprobe to detect MIS type II receptor expression in the mouse was generated by PCR amplification using the following primers: sense, 5′-CCC CGA ATT CTG CCC AGA GAA CTC CCT T-3′; antisense, 5′-CCC CCT CGA GTT CCT GAG CAT ATC TAC CCC-3′. cDNA generated from RNA isolated from the mouse testis was used as the template. RNase protection was done as described above.

Rat genomic DNA was used as the template. The resulting fragment was cloned into SrfI sites of the pPCR-script Amp sk (+) plasmid. The construct was linearized with SalI, and the antisense transcript was obtained with T3 polymerase (MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit, Ambion). RNase protection was done as described above.

Total RNA was converted to cDNA and amplified with the above primers by PCR. RNA was isolated from cells or tissue samples using RNA STAT-60 total RNA isolation kit (Tel-Test, Inc.). Indicated amounts of RNA were separated on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to HyBond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with human IEX-1 or mouse gly96/IEX-1 as indicated in the figure legends. The human IEX-1 probe for Northern analysis was derived by PCR amplification as previously described (10Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K.

After sectioning and deparaffinization, apoptotic cells were detected using a fluorescein in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as indicated in the user manual. Images were obtained at a magnification of × 60. For confirmation, the same tissue was sectioned and stained using an ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen) using the protocol provided in the user's manual. Number of apoptotic cells on each slide was compared with number of mammary ducts seen in cross section and expressed as a ratio normalized to the average ratio in the controls. We had previously demonstrated that MIS inhibits the growth of both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells in vitro through activation of the NFκB signaling cascade. In order to determine whether MIS could also inhibit the growth of nontumorigenic breast epithelial cells, we analyzed MCF10A cells, a human mammary epithelial cell line with normal karyotype derived from a patient with fibrocystic breast disease (1Soule H.D.

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of receptor in both MCF10A and 184A1 cells (Fig. 1 A). Sequence analysis of the 582-base pair DNA fragment was identical to exons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the human MIS type II receptor (data not shown). Treatment of MCA10A cells with MIS induced three NFκB DNA-protein complexes following 1 h of treatment (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The heavier complex comigrated with the NFκB DNA-protein complex stimulated in T47D cells following MIS treatment (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Simultaneous addition of either rabbit anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies to the binding reaction demonstrated that the heaviest complex consisted predominantly of p50 and p65 subunits, as was demonstrated in T47D cells (10Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The faster migrating complexes, however, were unique to MCF10A cells and contained p50 subunits. Incubation of nuclear lysates with anti-c-Rel antibody did not supershift the complexes, suggesting that c-Rel protein was not present in them We next investigated whether MIS-mediated increase in NFκB DNA binding activity in MCF10A cells correlated with the induction of its target gene IEX-1S. An estimated 5-fold induction of IEX-1 mRNA was observed following 1 h of treatment with MIS, suggesting that the NFκB binding activity induced by MIS was functionally active (Fig.1 C, top panel). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the MIS-treated samples demonstrated that MIS selectively up-regulated the IEX-1S transcript (Fig. 1 C, bottom panel). We had previously demonstrated that MIS inhibited the growth of breast cancer cellsin vitro through a NFκB-mediated mechanism. As with breast cancer cell lines, treatment of MCF10A cells in vitro with exogenous MIS inhibited growth by 60% (Fig. 1 D). To confirm that MIS-mediated signaling events and its effects on breast epithelial cell growth identified using thein vitro cell systems are functional in vivo, we investigated whether MIS type II receptor is expressed in the normal breast. Total RNA isolated from the mammary glands of 8-week-old mice was analyzed by RNase protection assay using an antisense riboprobe specific for exon 11 and 3′ untranslated region of the mouse MIS type II receptor (Fig. 2 A, left panel). The protected fragment was 89 base pairs shorter than the probe due to unrelated sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends. Detection of a protected fragment of the expected size in the breast, which comigrated with that from the testis, confirmed that the MIS type II receptor mRNA was expressed in normal breast but at a level much lower than that in the testis (Fig. 2 A, right panel). MIS type II receptor was also detected in rat breast by RNase protection assay using an antisense riboprobe that contained exon 11 and the 3′ untranslated region specific to the rat MIS type II receptor DNA sequence. Because mammary tissue undergoes the majority of its development in the adult and robust expansion of the breast epithelium occurs during pregnancy and continues into lactation, MIS type II receptor mRNA levels were analyzed using total RNA isolated from mammary glands of virgin, pregnant, lactating, and weaned rats (Fig.2 B). Phosphorimaging of band intensities from three independent experiments demonstrated an 80% decrease in MIS type II receptor expression 2 days after delivery during early lactation. The receptor mRNA rebounded to higher levels 2 days after removal of pups, a period of ductal regression (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel). Analysis of MIS type II receptor expression during breast development in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats revealed a gradual increase up to postnatal day 30 and a decrease in three individual animals older than 30 days (Fig. 2 C, top panel). Quantification of transcript levels by phophorimaging analysis demonstrated a 2.5-fold decrease in MIS type II receptor between animals of postnatal days 14–30 and postnatal days 40–60 (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel). Onset of pubertal changes in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats occur at an average age of 35 days after birth (18McGivern R.F. Yellon S.M. Alcohol. 1992; 9: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Juarez J. Barrios De Tomasi E. Vazquez C. Alcohol. 2000; 21: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lowering of MIS type II receptor expression during breast development in the rat coincides with puberty, when the ductal system branches and invades the fat pad (20Masso-Welch P.A. Darcy K.M. Stangle-Castor N.C. Ip M.M. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The inverse correlation between MIS type II receptor expression and growth in the breast during puberty and peripartum stages was compatible with the hypothesis that MIS-mediated signaling may exert an inhibitory effect on proliferation. Several transcription factors, including NFκB, are regulated during tissue remodeling of the breast. In mice, NFκB DNA binding activity in the breast increases slightly during pregnancy, with undetectable levels during lactation (21Clarkson R.W. Heeley J.L. Chapman R. Aillet F. Hay R.T. Wyllie A. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12737-12742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Geymayer S. Doppler W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and is robustly induced in the involuting mammary gland, with the highest levels of binding evident at 2–3 days of involution (21Clarkson R.W. Heeley J.L. Chapman R. Aillet F. Hay R.T. Wyllie A. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12737-12742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether activation of NFκB DNA binding correlated with changes in MIS type II receptor expression during breast development in rats, electromobility gel shift assays were performed. NFκB DNA binding activity was quite readily detectable in the mammary glands of both virgin and pregnant rats. Consistent with the results in mice, reported by Clarkson et al. (21Clarkson R.W. Heeley J.L. Chapman R. Aillet F. Hay R.T. Wyllie A. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12737-12742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), very little NFκB activation was observed in the mammary glands of rats during early lactation, when type II receptor expression was lowest, but was strongly induced 2 days after removal of pups, a period of ductal involution, when type II receptor expression rebounds, indicating a correlation of NFκB activation with peripartum MIS type II receptor levels (Fig. 2 D). Because MIS-induced NFκB activation in human breast cancer cell lines led to specific up-regulation of its target gene IEX-1S, we tested whether activation of NFκB during different phases of mammary morphogenesis in the rat correlated with the levels of IEX-1 mRNA. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 E, top panels, PRG1/IEX-1S mRNA expression diminished in the lactating breast but returned to levels observed in the breasts of virgin animals after 2 days of postlactational involution, paralleling NFκB activation during this period of breast morphogenesis. Ethidium bromide staining of the gel demonstrated equal loading of RNA. PCR primers that permit the differentiation of the long and short PRG1 transcripts predominantly detected the latter in the normal breast, with a minor band of 403 base pairs (Fig. 2 E, middle panel). PRG1/IEX-1L has an in-frame insertion of 37 amino acids resulting from the presence of the entire intronic sequence within the coding region of the PRG1/IEX-1S transcript (23Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the 403-base pair band could have resulted from contaminating genomic DNA being amplified by PCR, a nonquantitative DNA amplification technique, RNase protection assay using an antisense riboprobe specific for rat PRG1/IEX-1L (Fig.2 E, Scheme), was performed. The results confirmed that PRG1/IEX-1S was the predominant transcript expressed throughout development (Fig. 2 E, bottom panel). A protected band of 403 nucleotides that would correspond to PRG1/IEX-1L was not detected. The developmental regulation of PRG1/IEX-1S coincided with NFκB DNA binding activity, suggesting that it might indeed be one of the downstream effector genes of activated NFκB in vivo in the mammary gland. Because MIS type II receptor levels, NFκB DNA binding activity, and IEX-1S expression demonstrated a compelling correlation during postnatal breast morphogenesis, we analyzed whether exogenous rhMIS could induce NFκB DNA binding activity and IEX-1S mRNA in the mammary glands of mice in vivo (n= 3). Exposure of mammary tissue to MIS resulted in the induction of NFκB DNA binding activity (Fig.3 A, top panel). Analysis of DNA-protein complexes demonstrated the presence of both p50 and p65 subunits; c-Rel was not present in the complex. The specificity of NFκB induction in vivo was demonstrated by incubating nuclear protein lysates with an oligonucleotide specific for OCT-1 (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). These experiments identify MIS as one of the first ligands that can induce NFκB DNA binding activity in the mammary gland in vivo. The levels of circulating rhMIS in the injected animals were estimated to be 2–4 µg/ml by MIS-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2Hudson P.L. Dougas I. Donahoe P.K. Cate R.L. Epstein J. Pepinsky R.B. MacLaughlin D.T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine whether MIS-mediated induction of NFκB DNA bindingin vivo correlated with gly96/IEX-1 induction, Northern blot analysis was performed. Exogenous rhMIS induced gly96/IEX-1 expression in the mammary glands of mice within 1 h of treatment compared with untreated controls and remained elevated up to 6 h (Fig.3 B, top panel). The serum rhMIS levels averaged 2–4 µg/ml in the animals. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels demonstrated equal loading and indicated that the increase in gly96/IEX-1 was not due to general elevation of mRNA expression following treatment with rhMIS.

Little is known about the molecular basis of the constitutive activity of these receptors. Our results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments have revealed that Phe-329 (analogous to Ala-350 in estrogen receptor α (ERα)) is responsible for the constitutive activity of ERRα-1. The ERRα-1 mutant F329A lost the transactivation activity and acted as a dominant negative mutant. The mammalian cell transfection experiments revealed that the ERRα-1 mutant F329A, like wild-type ERα, recognized toxaphene (an organochlorine pesticide) as an agonist. This compound was previously shown to be an antagonist of wild-type ERRα-1. On the other hand, like wild-type ERRα-1, the ERα mutant A350F was found to be constitutively active (as demonstrated by mammalian cell transfection and yeast two-hybrid assays). These results indicate that Phe-329 in ERRα-1 and Ala-350 in ERα play important roles in both ligand binding and transactivation function.

The first type of nuclear receptor, including estrogen receptor (ER)1 and androgen receptor, is activated by specific ligands. The second type of receptor, similar to steroid and xenobiotic receptor, has a wide selectivity for ligands. The third type of receptor, like ERRα-1, is transcriptionally active in the absence of exogenous ligand. The third type of receptor has similar structural domain arrangements to the first and the second types of receptors. Little is known as to why receptors such as ERRα-1 are constitutively active. Our site-directed mutagenesis study has provided a molecular basis for the constitutive activity of ERRα-1. The cDNA for ERRα-1 was first isolated by screening cDNA libraries using probes corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of the human ERα (1Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of ERRα-1, ERα, and ERβ reveals a strong similarity. In the ligand binding region, the amino acid sequence of ERRα-1 shows 36% identity when compared with ERα and 34% identity when compared with ERβ. However, ERRα-1 does not bind to any of the major classes of steroids, including estrogens and androgens (1Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Vanacker et al. (2Vanacker J.M. Bonnelye E. Chopin-Delannoy S. Delmarre C. Cavailles V. Laudet V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 764-773PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that ligands for ERRα-1 might be present in fetal calf serum, based on results that showed a lack of the ERRα-1 transactivation activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells under stripped serum conditions. Despite efforts from several laboratories, the physiological ligand for ERRα-1 has not yet been identified. Experimentally, ERRα-1 is transcriptionally active in the absence of exogenous hormone (see Fig. 2), and therefore, this receptor is generally considered to be a constitutive transcriptional activator protein. Utilizing yeast-based assays and mammalian transient transfection assays, we have recently found that two organochlorine pesticides, toxaphene and chlordane, can act as antagonists of ERRα-1 that suppress the constitutive activity of ERRα-1 (3Yang C. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4519-4524PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are similar to those for the interaction of androstane metabolites with nuclear receptor CAR-β (4Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In contrast to the antagonistic action on ERRα-1, these pesticides have been reported to be weak agonists of ERα (5Soto A.M. Sonnenschein C. Chung K.L. Fernandez M.F. Olea N. Serrano F.O. Environ. Health Perspect. 1995; 103: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing kits were from United States Biochemical (Cleveland, Ohio). T4 kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. AmpliTaq polymerase was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]Chloramphenicol ([d-threo-(dichloroacetyl-1-14C)]) chloramphenicol (specific radioactivity, 55 mCi/mmol) was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. The chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) expression vector, pUMSVOCAT, was a gift from Dr. K. Kurachi at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized in the DNA/RNA chemistry laboratory at the City of Hope. SK-BR-3 cells (ATCC (Manassas, VA)), derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine. Estradiol and tamoxifen were purchased from Sigma. Toxaphene was kindly provided by Dr. Michael D. Shelby at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Dimethyl sulfoxide was from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. The pSG5-GRIP1 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael R. Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The ERE-TK-CAT plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The mutants were generated by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis method described by Nelson and Long (6Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PCR mutagenesis for the ERRα1 mutant F329A used four primers: mutant Primer A for hERRα1/F329A, TGTGACCTCGCTGACCGAGAG (a forward primer with the mutated bases underlined); Primer B, GGGGTACTAGTAACCCGGGATCCTCAGTCCATCATGGCCTCGAG (a reverse hybrid primer containing a BamHI restriction site, a 3′-terminal 24-nucleotide sequence complementary to the ERRα-1 cDNA in the reverse strand that encodes for the carboxyl terminus, and a 5′-terminal 20-nucleotide unique sequence); Primer C, GACGGATCCGAATTCATGTCCAGCCAGGTGGTGGGCATTGAG (a forward primer containing an EcoRI restriction site and the cDNA sequence containing the first ATG site at the 5′-end); and Primer D, GGGGTACTAGTAACCCGGGA (a primer with a sequence that is identical to the 5′-terminal 20-nucleotide sequence of Primer B). PCR was carried out with a DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For step 1, the reaction mixture (in 100 µl) contained 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase, 1 pmol of pSG5-hERRα-1 as template, and 100 pmol each of Primers A and B. The PCR cycles were 2 min at 95 °C to denature the template DNA, 2 min at 45 °C to allow the primers to anneal, and 2 min at 72 °C for DNA extension and cycled 30 times. The PCR product was resolved over 1% agarose gel and extracted by using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The Step 2 reaction contained about 0.6 pmol of the Step 1 product and 1 pmol of pSG5-hERRα-1 and was run as a single cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 45 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. Primers C and D were then added (100 pmol of each), and 30 additional PCR cycles were completed. The final PCR products were extracted and digested withEcoRI and BamHI. The resulting full-length mutant cDNA for hERRα1/F329A was ligated into the pSG5 expression vector. The sequence of the pSG5-F329A construct was confirmed by sequencing. The ERα mutant A350F was also prepared by the PCR-based mutagenesis approach. Plasmid pIC-ERF (purchased from ATCC), which contains the complete coding sequence of human ERα, was used as template. The sequences of Primers A(ER), B(ER), C(ER), and D(ER) to generate the full-length human ERα cDNA encoding hERα/A350F are: 5′-CTGACCAACCTGTTCGACAGGGAG-3′, 5′-GGGGTACTAGTAACCCGGGCGGATCCTCAGACTGTGGCAGGGAAACCCTC-3, 5′-GCGGAATTCGCCGCCGCCATGACCATGACCCTCCACACCAAAGC-3, and 5′-GGGGTACTAGTAACCCGGGC-3′, respectively. The PCR-amplified A350F-containing ERα cDNA fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pSG5 vector through EcoRI and BamHI sites. The expression plasmid, pSG5-hERα, for the expression of wild-type human ERα, was generated as follows. The full-length coding region of human ERα was generated by PCR using Primers C(ER) and B(ER) (the same as those used in ER/A350F preparation) on template DNA, pIC-ERF. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pSG5 vector through EcoRI and BamHI sites. The yeast expression plasmids pGBT9-hERα/HBDWT and pGBT9-hERα/HBDA350F for the expression of Gal4DBD/hERαHBDWT and Gal4DBD/hERαHBDA350Ffusion proteins were constructed as follows. The coding regions for wild-type and A350F mutant containing human ERα hormone-binding domains (amino acids 279–595) were amplified by PCR using pSG5-hERα and pSG5-A350F as template DNA, respectively. The sequence of the forward primer is 5′-GCGGAATTCATGGAAGTGGGGTCTGCTGGAGAC-3′, and the reverse primer is Primer B(ER), the same as the one used for A350F preparation. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI andBamHI, and the digested DNA fragments were subcloned in frame into EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pGBT9 vector. The luciferase reporter plasmid that contains three copies of the ERE sequence, pGL3(ERE)3-luciferase, was constructed as follows. Two complimentary oligonucleotides for three tandem copies of ERE consensus sequences, 5′-AATTCCAGGTCAGAGTGACCTGAGCTAAAATACCAGGTCAGAGTGACCTGAGCTAAAATACCAGGTCAGAGTGACCTGAGCTAAAATAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTATTTTAGCTCAGGTCACTCTGACCTGGTATTTTAGCTCAGGTCACTCTGACCTGGTATTTTAGCTCAGGTCACTCTGACCTGG-3′, were synthesized, phosphorylated, annealed, filled in, and subcloned into pGL3 promoter vector through SmaI site. The sequences and the orientations of the inserts in all the constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The plasmid pGAD-GRIP1322–1121 was the kind gift of Dr. Michael R. Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles). SK-BR-3 cells were transfected with the CAT plasmids by the use of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The co-transfection experiments were performed 20–24 h after seeding ∼4 × 105 cells per 60-mm tissue culture dish using 10 µg of the test plasmid and 3 µg of the plasmid pSV-β-Gal, which was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. The overall amount of total DNA in all transfections was the same by including appropriate amounts of the empty vector, pSG5, in addition to specific amounts of the test plasmids indicated in each experiment. After overnight incubation, medium containing Lipofectin and DNA was removed, and the cells were cultured in the regular growth medium. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were harvested from the plates by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and disrupted by freeze-thawing three times. Aliquots of the lysate were used for an assay of β-galactosidase activity (7Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 705-720Google Scholar). The CAT activity in the cell extracts containing an equal amount of β-galactosidase activity from each sample was determined by the liquid scintillation counting method (8Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Briefly, the appropriate amount of cell extracts was incubated in a reaction containing14C-labeled chloramphenicol and n-butyryl coenzyme A. The reaction products were extracted with a small volume of xylene. The xylene phase was mixed with scintillant and counted in a scintillation counter. The CAT activity was expressed as relative activity compared with that of the pUMSVOCAT construct (1.0) and shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent transient transfection experiments performed for each construct. For studying the interaction of ERRα-1 with ligands, SK-BR-3 cells were initially cultured in growth medium containing charcoal/dextran-treated serum for 1 week. Compounds were added 24 h after cDNA transfection and incubated for another 24 h. Cells were harvested after two washes with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, and the CAT activity was measured. Transactivation analysis of wild-type ERα and its mutant A350F was performed using HeLa cells and SK-BR-3 cells as the host cells. The cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3(ERE)3-luciferase (0.25 µg) alone or along with 10 ng of pSG5-hERα or pSG5-A350F using Lipofectin in Opti-MEM medium. Five h after exposure to Lipofectin/DNA, the Lipofectin/DNA-containing medium was removed, and the cells were cultured in 5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and 100 nm E2-containing medium. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to protein assay. An aliquot of cell lysates containing the same amount of protein from all the samples was used for luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The luciferase activities were expressed as the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. The interaction between the wild-type ERα hormone-binding domain or its mutant A350F with GRIP1 was demonstrated by the yeast two-hybrid assays. The yeast strain Y187 was co-transformed with pGBT9-hERα/HBDWT or pGBT9-hERα/HBDA350F and pGAD-GRIP1322–1121. The reporter β-galactosidase activities in transformants were measured following the published procedure (7Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 705-720Google Scholar). Homology models (9Blundell T.L. Sibanda B.L. Sternberg M.J. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) were built using software marketed by Molecular Simulations Inc. (San Diego, CA). The agonist-bound form of ERRα-1 was modeled using the DES-bound form of the estrogen receptor as a template (Protein Data Bank 3ERD, Ref. 10Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). The antagonist form was modeled using the tamoxifen-bound form (3ERT). We reviewed the amino acid sequence alignment between ERRα-1 and ERα (1Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and compared the corresponding residues in ERRα-1 with those in the ERα ligand-binding site that are in direct contact with E2, as shown by Tanenbaum et al. (11Tanenbaum D.M. Wang Y. Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5998-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). We have found that 9 out of the 19 residues are identical. Seven residues are conservative changes. One critical difference is between Phe-329 in ERRα-1 and Ala-350 in ERα (Fig. 1). It was thought that this difference might be the cause of the differences in ligand binding properties between the two receptors. The phenyl group of Phe-329 in ERRα-1 could provide steric hindrance to prevent the binding of E2 to this receptor. To test our hypothesis, we prepared ERRα-1 mutants in which Phe-329 was replaced by the residues in ERα, i.e. F329A as well as the ERα mutant A350F. Studies from our laboratory have revealed that ERRα-1 up-regulates aromatase expression in human breast tissue by binding to a regulatory element, S1, that is situated near promoters I.3 and II of the human aromatase gene (12Yang C. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar). Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. The DNA mobility shift assay revealed that the levels of the protein-S1 complexes for the mutant F329A and wild-type ERRα-1 were very similar (results not shown), supporting our prediction that Phe-329 is situated in the ligand-binding domain, not in the DNA-binding domain. To address the biological significance of the ERRα-1 mutation, we co-transfected the SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells with the expression plasmid for ERRα-1 (or its mutant) along with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the aromatase genomic fragment having promoter I.3 and the ERRα-1 binding element S1 (i.e.pums-64/+129CAT, as described in Ref. 12Yang C. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar). Although wild-type ERRα-1 enhanced promoter I.3-driven CAT activity as reported previously (12Yang C. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar), the mutant F329A reduced the basic promoter activity (Fig.2). Furthermore, F329A suppressed the wild-type ERRα-1 activity when they were co-expressed. These results indicate that F329A, acting as a dominant negative mutant, inhibited the activity of wild-type ERRα-1. As reported previously (3Yang C. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4519-4524PubMed Google Scholar), the nuclear coactivator GRIP-1 augments the enhancer activity of ERRα-1 without the need of exogenous ligand. However, the F329A activity was not affected by the co-expression of GRIP-1 (Fig.3). The latter result supports our prediction that Phe-329 is situated in the ligand-binding site. It is known that coactivators such as GRIP-1 interact with nuclear receptors at the ligand-binding domain when the receptor is in an agonist binding conformation. It was not expected that toxaphene, an antagonist for ERRα-1 (3Yang C. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4519-4524PubMed Google Scholar), could act as an agonist for F329A (Fig.4). Toxaphene increased the F329A activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the same compound decreased the wild-type activity. Therefore, the ERRα-1 mutant F329A becomes ERα-like in that it recognizes toxaphene as a weak agonist. However, GRIP-1 was found not to enhance F329A activity in the presence of toxaphene, indicating that GRIP-1 could not recognize toxaphene-bound F329A (results not shown).Figure 4Toxaphene is an agonist for F329A.SK-BR-3 cells were transfected with pums-64/+129CAT (2 µg), pSG5-hERRα-1 (2 µg), or pSG5-F329A (2 µg). The transfected cells were incubated with toxaphene for 48 h at the indicated concentrations. After cells were washed twice with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, the CAT activity was measured. The graph represents an average of three independent experiments. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To better understand the importance of Phe-329 in ERRα-1, we made and characterized the ERα mutant A350F. Our mammalian cell transfection experiments (in both HeLa and SK-BR-3 cells) have revealed that the ERα mutant A350F is transcriptionally active without the addition of E2 (Figs. 5and 6). In fact, E2 was not able to further increase the transactivation activity, indicating that E2 cannot bind to this ERα mutant. Our experiments have also found that A350F can recruit GRIP-1 in the absence of ligands (Figs. 5 and 6). These results indicate that the ERα mutant A350F becomes ERRα-1-like in that it is transcriptionally active in the absence of exogenous hormone.Figure 6A, transactivation analysis of ERα mutant A350F in SK-BR-3 cells. B demonstrates that wild-type ERα interacts with GRIP1 only in the presence of E2. The experimental conditions are identical to those described in Fig. 5.DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our yeast two-hybrid assay has found that the ERα mutant A350F, but not wild-type ERα, has the ability to transactivate a heterologous promoter such as GAL4 promoter. It was found that a chimeric receptor consisting of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 fused to the ligand-binding domain of ERα with the A350F mutation was transcriptionally active on a GAL4 reporter (Fig.7). Ala-350 in ERα is within an autonomous activation domain AF-2α (amino acids 282–351) (14Norris J.D. Fan D. Kerner S.A. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 11: 747-754Google Scholar).

Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar) have revealed that helix 12 assumes different conformations in response to ligand binding. In the presence of E2 and other agonists, helix 12 binds to a hydrophobic groove, the floor of which consists of ligands and side chains contributed by helices 3, 5/6, and 11. Antagonists such as tamoxifen partially fill the helix 12 groove, thus preventing helix 12 from assuming a conformation that recruits coactivator proteins (10Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Results obtained from the analysis of the two mutants described in this paper allow us to conclude that, although we cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of a physiological ligand for ERRα-1, this orphan receptor is transcriptionally active in the absence of ligands. A molecular model of wild-type ERRα-1 reveals that the side chain of Phe-329 might be able to mimic bound ligand because it partially fills the binding pocket. This allows helix 12 to assume an active conformation capable of recruiting coactivator protein GRIP-1. As a result, the receptor is constitutively active (always turned on). This hypothesis has been evaluated by introducing a phenylalanine residue at the analogous position in ERα (A350F). As shown in Fig. 8A, the phenyl side chain fills nearly half the estrogen binding cavity, thus completing the floor of the groove in which helix 12 normally binds when the agonist is present. As predicted, the A350F mutant is constitutively active. Because the putative ligand cavity of wild-type ERRα-1 appears to be filled with side chains (most notably Phe-329), we predict that toxaphene binds in the hydrophobic groove normally occupied by helix 12 when it assumes the active conformation (Fig. 8 B). Toxaphene therefore acts as an antagonist of wild-type ERRα-1, displacing helix 12 and preventing the recruitment of coactivator. However, when space is created in the utative ligand cavity via the mutation of Phe-329 to Ala, our model suggests that toxaphene can fill the cavity (Fig. 8 C) and thus serve as an agonist, which it does when tested experimentally. However, the cavity is still not large enough to accommodate E2 or tamoxifen, which confirms our observation that these compounds are not ligands for wild-type ERRα-1 or the F329A mutant (data not shown). In addition, helix 12 does not assume a correct conformation for recruiting coactivator protein GRIP-1. For classical receptors, ligand binding is essential for the transcription activity. Our results provide a structural basis as to why some orphan receptors such as ERRα-1 are transcriptionally active in the absence of exogenous hormone. In ERRα-1, the phenyl side chain of Phe-329 is situated in the ligand binding pocket that places the AF-2 domain in an active conformation. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis in the proposed ligand binding pocket of ERRα-1 modifies the binding properties of toxaphene, strengthening the conclusion that this pesticide is a ligand of this receptor. Toxaphene is among the 12 persistent organic pollutants identified by the United Nations Environment Program as requiring urgent attention. Its antagonistic effect on ERRα-1 should not be overlooked. In addition to Phe-329 in ERRα-1 and Ala-350 in ERα, there are two other nonconserved differences between the ligand-binding site of ERRα-1 and that of ERα. They are Gly-403 in ERRα-1, Phe-425 in ERα, Val-493 in ERRα-1, and Gly-521 in ERα (Fig. 1). The ERRα-1 mutant G403F has been generated and was found to have similar properties to the wild-type ERRα-1, indicating that this position is not as important as Phe-329. As expected, the function of the double mutant F329A/G403F is similar to F329A (results not shown). E2 was found not to be a ligand for the ERRα-1 mutant G403F or F329A/G403F. The ERRα-1 mutant V493G was also generated recently and found to be constitutively active. Neither E2 nor toxaphene acts as a ligand of this mutant. Although it is not unexpected that E2 is not a ligand of V493G, the results suggest that Val-493 is important for toxaphene binding. Additional mutagenesis experiments are being carried out to further characterize the role of Val-493 in toxaphene binding."

The extreme N terminus and conserved region one of E1A, which are indispensable for transcriptional regulation and for binding to p300/CBP, TBP, and pCAF, play essential roles in these abilities. These observations strongly suggest an intrinsic link between E1A-mediated transcriptional regulation and other effects. In this report, we show that E1A inhibits the normal growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c, and this inhibition also depends on the domains required for transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate that E1A associates with histone acetyltransferase activity and represses the transactivation activity of transcription factor in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that E1A may suppress the expression of genes required for normal growth. Based on yeast growth rescue, we present a genetic screening strategy that identified RACK1 as an E1A antagonizing factor. Expression of human RACK1 efficiently relieves E1A-mediated growth inhibition in HF7c and protects human tumor cells from E1A-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that RACK1 decreases E1A-associated histone acetyltransferase activity in yeast and mammalian cells, and physically interacts with E1A.

Recently, we showed that the extreme N terminus (ENT)1 (aa 1–37) and the conserved region one (CR1) (aa 40–80) of E1A possess transactivation activity in both yeast and mammalian cells (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that these regions are able to regulate host cell gene expression, either positively or negatively, in a pRb/E2F-independent manner. The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation may involve the direct interaction with p300/CBP, two nuclear histone acetyltransferases (33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that these regions directly interact with pCAF, another histone acetyltransferase (26Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these regions also are required for E1A-induced apoptosis (37White E. Cipriani R. Sabbatini P. Denton A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2968-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mymryk J.S. Shire K. Bayley S.T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1187-1193PubMed Google Scholar) and for tumor suppression (16Deng J. Xia W. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in mammalian cells, suggesting that E1A induces apoptosis and tumor suppression by disrupting the regulation of host gene expression. Yeast is used widely as a model system to study cell growth regulation, DNA replication, and transcriptional regulation, since most of the essential regulatory mechanisms are well conserved between yeast and mammals (39Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 40Okayama H. Nagata A. Jinno S. Murakami H. Tanaka K. Nakashima N. Adv.

Genetic complementation approaches in yeast have been used to identify a variety of mammalian genes involved in growth regulation. In addition, identification of the basal transcriptional complexes reveals astonishing similarities between yeast and mammals, providing strong evidence that transcriptional regulation is a highly conserved process between evolutionarily distant species. Particularly, the yeast system has been successfully used for functional and genetic analysis of E1A effects (42Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zieler H.A. Walberg M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We investigated here the E1A-mediated growth inhibition in yeast cells and the roles of the ENT and CR1 regions. We found that the domains required for yeast growth inhibition also are required for transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and tumor suppression in mammalian cells. We also found that E1A associated with a HAT activity in yeast, and that expression of E1A repressed transactivation activity of yeast transcription factors. Based on the rescue of yeast growth, we designed a genetic screening strategy and found that human RACK1 successfully antagonizes E1A-mediated growth inhibition in yeast. Finally, we observed that co-transfection of RACK1 protects human tumor cells from undergoing E1A-induced apoptosis and that RACK1 physically interacts with E1A in vitro and in vivo. Oligonucleotides used as primers for PCR were synthesized by the Nucleic Acid Facility at Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University. The pGBT9, pGBKT7, pGAD424 vectors, and pCL1 were purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories. The pEG202 vector and pSH18–34 (URA3, LexAop-LacZ reporter plasmid) were described previously (32Sang N.

This fragment was then used to replace the KpnI-PstI fragment encoding the GAL4 transactivation domain in the pGAD424 vector, thus generating the construct pG-E1A. The LexA-E1A fusion constructs, pEG202-E1A and pG-LexA-E1A with a Trp selection marker were described previously. To express LexA alone in HF7c, the E1A part was removed by restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI followed by blunting and re-ligation that resulted in pG-LexA. To express 243R E1A in EGY48 the smaller SnaBI-PstI fragment from pG-E1A was used to replace the smallerSnaBI-PstI fragment in pGBT9, and to generate pE1A. Plasmid pGBT9-Rb2/p130 was constructed by PCR. Plasmids pGBT9-Rb and pGBT9-p107 were described previously (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A.

Primers were 5′-GATCCCCGGGCATGACTGAGCAGATGACC-3′ and 5′ GATCCTGCAGCTAGCGTGTGCCAATGGTC-3′. The amplified fragment was then cloned into a pGAD424 vector fused to GAL4 activation domain. For mammalian cell transfection assays, all the cDNAs encoding E1A, E1A mutants, DBD, DBD-E1A, DBD-E1A mutants, GST, GST-E1A, and GST-E1A mutants were driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The plasmid pON260 that constitutively expresses full-length GAL4 as a control of transfection efficiency was described previously (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R.

Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All the yeast strains were maintained at 30 °C on YPD plates. Yeast transformation was performed with the lithium acetate (LiOAc) method described previously (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and maintained on synthetic medium lacking selective amino acid(s). The yeast transformants were grown in 10 ml of SD without tryptophan or other auxotrophic amino acids depending on the selective marker of the plasmids, at 30 °C with shaking (270 rpm) to stationary. The liquid culture was diluted to 0.2 (around 0.5–0.6 × 106 cells/ml)A 600 in 10 ml of fresh SD without selective amino acids or 10 ml of YPD when transformants harboring plasmids with different selective markers were tested together to prevent variations caused by using different SD medium. The freshly inoculated culture was put back to incubate at 30 °C with shaking (270 rpm). One ml of sample was taken from each culture to measureA 600 at various time points post-inoculation. The cell growth rate was measured as the ratio of theA 600 at specific time points to the initialA 600 (Growth Index). To assay the viability of the yeast transformants, 100 µl of the original freshly inoculated culture were used to make sequential dilutions (10−2, 10−3, and 10−4) and were plated out on 150-mm plates with SD-dropout agar and cultured at 30 °C for 4 days to monitor colony formation. Transformants were grown overnight in 2 ml of proper synthetic medium at 30 °C with shaking. After adding 8 ml of fresh SD, yeast cells were allowed to grow for a further 4 h. After measuring the A 600, 1.5 ml of culture was collected and washed once with Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). After being re-suspended in 300 ml of Z buffer, 100 ml was transferred into a fresh sterile tube. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described before (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and corrected for cell density (A 600) and for the reaction time. The relative activity of the activators was compared with pGBT9 vector alone and expressed as relative transactivation activity. SAOS-2 (ATCC, human osteosarcoma) and HeLa (ATCC, human cervix carcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented withl-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection experiments, cells were seeded 24 h before the transfection to obtain a 50–70% confluence. Cells were transfected by either Transfectam (Promega) or by standard calcium phosphate protocols. Transfection efficiency was monitored by measuring β-galactosidase activity derived from the co-transfected pON260 plasmid (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To use Transfectam, the instructions for serum-free transfection procedures provided by the manufacturer were followed. Three hours after transfection, fresh medium with serum was added, and the cells then were cultured for 48 h before harvest. When using calcium phosphate transfection, 18 h after transfection, the medium was changed and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Transfection efficiency obtained from this method was around 20–25%. For stable transfection, the calcium phosphate method was used to transfect 10 µg of linearized plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfections, the cells were trypsinized and selected in G418 medium for 4 weeks. Cell labeling with [35S]methionine and GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described (36Sang N. Giordano A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Yeast protoplasts were prepared by standard methods (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight grown yeast culture was washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After being incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with stabilization buffer A (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin), the yeast was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with stabilization buffer B (1m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 25 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.5, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin). Protoplasts then were generated by enzymatic digestion with 25 units/ml lyticase (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature in stabilization buffer B. The protoplasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and lysed in IPH buffer as previously described (26Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Cultured human cells were directly lysed in IPH buffer as described. For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing 250 µg of protein were first incubated with a nonspecific mouse serum and cleared by mixing with killed whole Staphylococcus aureus cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cleared supernatant was incubated with anti-E1A monoclonal antibody and immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described to obtain E1A complexes (35Sang N. Avantaggiati M.L. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The anti-E1A monoclonal antibodies M73 and M37 were described elsewhere (46Harlow E. Franza Jr., B.R. Schley C. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 533-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Giordano A. Whyte P. Harlow E. Franza Jr., B.R. Beach D. Draetta G. Cell. 1989; 58: 981-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). E1A complexes then were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis, or used for HAT assays. The procedure for Western blotting was described previously (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 35Sang N. Avantaggiati M.L. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HAT assays were performed with the HAT-check kit (Pierce). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated complexes were incubated with a synthetic substrate corresponding to the first 23 amino acids of histone H4 and coupled to biotin at 30 °C for 1 h with 3H-labeled acetyl-CoA in 1 × HAT buffer. Washed immobilized streptavidin-agarose, pre-equilibrated in 1 × HAT buffer, was then added to each assay tube. The samples were rotated at room temperature for 30 min. After 3 washes with IPH buffer, the matrix was resuspended in 1 × HAT buffer and transferred to a scintillation vial. The incorporated3H-acetyl was measured in a scintillation counter. One microgram of the plasmid encoding for RACK1 was used to program a TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) under control of the T7 polymerase in the presence of [35S]methionine. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were added to glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with 4 µg of GST chimerized with E1A. Incubation was carried out in NENT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin) for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Beads were washed three times in NENT buffer, and then electrophoresis was performed on SDS-PAGE. Gel was dried and then exposed at −70 °C using Kodak Bio-Max MS film with DuPont Cronex intensifying screens. After transfection, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, washed in distilled water, and exposed briefly to 3% H2O2 to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The TUNEL reaction was performed using the peroxidase-based Apoptag kit (Oncor). The TUNEL positive cells were revealed by means of diaminobenzidine and H2O2, according to the supplier's instructions. Finally, stained cells were slightly counterstained with hematoxylin. TUNEL positive cells were considered as apoptotic. We previously reported that 243R E1A possesses transactivation activity when fused to a DNA-binding domain in yeast and in mammalian cells (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In that study, we consistently observed that expression of wild-type E1A in yeast strain HF7c led to a slow-growing phenotype. To further understand the E1A-mediated inhibition of yeast growth, we investigated this phenomenon in a carefully controlled study. As shown in Fig. 1 A, expression of E1A led to growth inhibition of HF7c. As controls, expression of the RB family gene products (pRb, p107, or pRb2/p130), a family of growth inhibitors in mammalian cells (23Sang N. Baldi A. Giordano A. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1995; 3: 1-29Google Scholar) showed no effect on yeast growth. The fusion of E1A with the DNA-binding domain (DB) of GAL4 was not essential for this effect, because expression of E1A alone, or when fused with either the transactivation domain (TAD) of GAL4 or LexA, resulted in similar inhibition (Fig. 1 B). Similar studies were performed in the EYG48 and PJ69-2A strains. Significant growth inhibition was observed in the EYG48 strain, but expression of E1A inhibited the growth of PJ69-2A strain only slightly (data not shown), suggesting that E1A-mediated yeast growth inhibition is a strain-specific event. 243R E1A is a multifunctional oncoprotein consisting of several well defined functional domains (48Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The definition of a solid link between the specific domains and the inhibitory activity is essential for understanding the underlying mechanism and the biological significance in the virus-host interaction. We used an extensive set of E1A mutants to express mutant E1A proteins in yeast cells and compared the effects of these mutants on yeast growth with that of wild-type E1A. The mutant E1A constructs were characterized previously (44Sang N. Condorelli G. De Luca A. MacLachlan T.K. Giordano A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the mutant protein expression in yeast was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Two monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of E1A were used to detect E1A proteins encoded by these constructs (46Harlow E. Franza Jr., B.R. Schley C. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 533-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, wild-type E1A was recognized by both the M73 and M37 antibodies. Mutants were detected by M73, M37, or both, depending on the existence of intact epitopes. The scheme in Fig.2 C represents the structure of the E1A mutants employed, with the position of the epitopes recognized by M73 and M37 indicated. The data in Fig. 3 show that constitutive expression of 243R E1A in the HF7c yeast strain resulted in a markedly slower growth rate, as did the expression of E1A mutants containing aa 1–228 or 1–120. However, deletion of the N-terminal 70 or 100 aa completely abolished E1A-mediated growth inhibitory activity. While deletion of the major part of CR1 (Δ38–67) resulted in a slightly lower growth rate, deletion of ENT, while keeping CR1 intact, also led to a loss of inhibition. We concluded that the growth inhibitory domain is contained within the N-terminal aa 1–70 region and must involve aa 38–67. The slow growth was not caused by a decreased viability of yeast transformants, because the numbers of colonies formed on plates did not differ significantly (data not shown). In mammalian cells, E1A proteins function as dual regulators of gene expression. They stimulate the transcription of certain genes, but repress others (1Shenk T. Flint J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 47-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Berlingieri M.T. Santoro M. Battaglia C. Grieco M. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 249-2554PubMed Google Scholar, 49Kraus V.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In yeast, while the domains involved in growth inhibition possess transactivating activity when recruited to a promoter (32Sang N. Claudio P.P. Fu Y. Horikoshi N. Graeven U. Weinmann R. Giordano A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), E1A-mediated growth inhibition is not caused by the stimulation of GAL4-responsive genes as shown above. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of E1A might actually disrupt transcriptional regulation i"

The sialylated oligosaccharides that are products of these enzymes' action have a variety of important roles in the normal cell and during development and disease (reviewed in Ref. 1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). For example, sialylated oligosaccharides function as selectin ligands during inflammation and the homing of lymphocytes; act as receptors for viruses, toxins, and parasites; function in B cell maturation and activation; maintain glycoproteins in the circulation; and play roles in negatively modulating cell adhesion during development and oncogenesis (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). Using α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I)1 as a model sialyltransferase, we have been investigating post-translational mechanisms that control sialyltransferase activity and function. For the ST6Gal I, these include the expression of two enzyme isoforms that differ in their localization and processing by cells (2Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the formation of a disulfide-bonded dimer (3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This disulfide-bonded dimer comprises ∼20–30% of the ST6Gal I found in liver Golgi. It exhibits reduced catalytic activity because it has little affinity for its sugar nucleotide donor, CMP-NeuAc (3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It does, however, retain the ability to bind galactose and asialoglycoprotein substrates and may be acting as a galactose-specific lectin in the Golgi. The ST6Gal I isoforms appear to be generated by an RNA editing event in which an A is changed to a G, resulting in the replacement of a Tyr residue by a Cys residue at position 123 in the catalytic domain (2Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The STtyr isoform is transiently localized in the Golgi and moves to a post-Golgi compartment, where it is cleaved and secreted into the extracellular space. The STcys isoform is stably localized in the Golgi and is not cleaved and secreted in most cell types. When highly expressed, the STtyr isoform is observed at low levels on the cell surface, whereas the STcys isoform is found in ER as well as the Golgi. Both isoforms are catalytically active when transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lack endogenous ST6Gal I enzyme. Both are also able to form disulfide-bonded dimers, suggesting that the “extra” Cys in the lumenal domain of the STcys isoform is not responsible for dimerization observed in the liver and in tissue culture (4Chen C. Ma J. Lazic A. Backovic M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13819-13826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the difference in isoform Golgi retention reflects a difference in the ability of these two proteins to form insoluble oligomers (4Chen C. Ma J. Lazic A. Backovic M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13819-13826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The stably localized STcys is quantitatively recovered as insoluble oligomers when Golgi membranes are solubilized at pH 6.3, the pH of the late Golgi, whereas only 13% of the transiently localized STtyr is found as insoluble oligomers under these conditions. A similar analysis of rat liver Golgi membranes, which contain both ST6Gal I isoforms, reveals that the disulfide-bonded dimer represents a significant proportion of the enzyme in the insoluble oligomer pellet when these membranes are solubilized at pH 5.8–6.3 (4Chen C. Ma J. Lazic A. Backovic M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13819-13826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This suggests that the disulfide-bonded dimer of either isoform may be a critical component in oligomer formation and Golgi localization. Three regions of homology or “sialyl motifs” have been identified in the sialyltransferase family (5Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) identified amino acids in the sialyl motif L (amino acids 178–225 in rat ST6Gal I), including Cys-181, which are required for CMP-NeuAc donor binding. In addition, a second Cys residue, Cys-332, is found in the sialyl motif S (amino acids 318–340 in rat ST6Gal I), a region shown by Datta et al. (10Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) to be involved in both asialoglycoprotein substrate and donor binding. More recently, these researchers demonstrated that these two Cys residues form a necessary intramolecular disulfide bond in the ST6Gal I monomer (11Datta A. Chammas R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that these Cys residues would not be involved in an intermolecular disulfide bond that would lead to dimer formation. However, the decreased ability of the ST6Gal I dimer to bind CMP-NeuAc suggests that disulfide bond formation between two monomers may occur between other Cys residues in the catalytic domain. In this study, we investigated the location and mechanism of ST6Gal I dimer formation. Analysis of the time course of STtyr dimerization demonstrated that the dimer forms in the ER. To determine which Cys residues in the STtyr play roles in disulfide-bonded dimer formation, we have created a series of Cys mutants in this protein and have evaluated their cellular localization, in vivo activity, cleavage, and secretion, as well as their dimerization. We have found that mutagenesis of the single Cys residue in the transmembrane domain of the ST6Gal I (Cys-24) abolishes dimerization of the enzyme. Additional experiments rule out the possibility that secondary disulfide bonds form between Cys residues in the catalytic domains of two monomers. These results suggest that the close packing of two catalytic domains, rather than a direct obstruction of sialyl motifs L and S by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond, leads to the reduced ability of the ST6Gal I dimer to bind CMP-NeuAc.

COS-1 and CHO cells maintained in either DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (COS-1) or in α-MEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (CHO) were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator until 50–70% confluent. Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE transfections were performed according to protocols provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, 30 µl of Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE was incubated with 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM medium for 40 min at room temperature in a polystyrene tube. Twenty micrograms of ST6Gal I DNA was mixed with 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM medium, added to the Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE solutions, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells to be transfected were washed with Opti-MEM medium and the transfection mixture added to the tissue culture dishes.

Ten milliliters of DMEM or α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was directly added to the cells following the 6-h incubation and cells were incubated for another 16–48 h. Transfection of cells plated on coverslips was essentially the same, except 250–500 ng of DNA, 2 µl of Lipofectin, or LipofectAMINE in 250 µl of Opti-MEM were used per coverslip. COS-1 or CHO cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected with cDNAs encoding wild type or mutant forms of the STtyr isoform of ST6Gal I subcloned into the pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression vector and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy, as described previously (2Ma J.

Following four PBS washes, cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed four times with PBS before mounting on glass slides using ∼20 µl of mounting media (15% (w/v) Vinol 205 polyvinyl alcohol, 33% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 8.5, in PBS). Cells were visualized and photographed using a Nikon Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination and a 60× oil immersion Plan Apochomat objective. For SNA staining, cells were not subjected to a blocking step but directly incubated with a 1:200 dilution of FITC-conjugated SNA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Following four PBS washes, coverslips were mounted, visualized, and photographed as described above. For double lectin staining/immunolocalization in CHO cells, following fixation and permeabilization, cells were washed with PBS, incubated with a 1:200 dilution of FITC-SNA for 1 h, washed four times in PBS, and then processed for immunolocalization as described above beginning with the 5% goat serum in PBS blocking step. Pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (2Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Chen C. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-1 cells were incubated with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM for 1 h. Medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml of fresh methionine-free DMEM containing 100 µCi/ml EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix, and cells labeled in a 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator for 30 min to 1 h. Radioactive medium was then removed, cells were extensively washed, 4 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were incubated in the CO2incubator for 6 h. Cell medium was collected, and cells were extensively washed with PBS and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mmiodoacetamide) containing protease inhibitors. ST6Gal I proteins were immunoprecipitated from both cell lysates and media using the anti-ST6Gal I antibody and protein A-Sepharose as described previously (2Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography (2Ma J. Qian R. Rausa F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol.

Bio-Rad prestained broad range gel standards were used to estimate molecular mass: myosin, 203 kDa; β-galactosidase, 116 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 83 kDa; ovalbumin, 48.7 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 33.4 kDa; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 28.2 kDa; lysozyme, 20.7 kDa; aprotinin, 7.6 kDa. COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type STtyr-pSVL or Cys mutants as described above. The cells were then trypsinized, washed once with PBS, and suspended in 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mm iodoacetamide (one volume of cell pellet per five volumes of homogenizing medium). Equilibrium sucrose density gradients were used to isolate a Golgi-enriched fraction according to the method described by Xu and Shields (13Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All the sucrose gradient solutions contain 100 mm iodoacetamide to avoid aberrant disulfide bond formation during the membrane preparation procedures (see Ref. 3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Golgi membrane-enriched fraction was collected, washed once with 100 mmiodoacetamide and pelleted by centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The pellets were then resuspended in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. To analyze dimerization of the STtyr and its Cys mutants, the Golgi enriched membrane fractions from cells expressing these proteins were treated with Laemmli sample buffer with or without 10% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Immunoblot analysis was performed using the rabbit anti-rat ST6Gal I antibody and a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Visualization of bands was achieved using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Asialofetuin-Sepharose 4 FF was prepared by cross-linking asialofetuin (Sigma) with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. About 20 mg of asialofetuin was cross-linked to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 FF. CDP-hexanolamine-agarose was a gift Dr. Gerald Hart (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Myc-tagged versions of STtyr, C350S, and C361S mutants in the pcDNA 3.1 vector were expressed in COS-1 cells and tested for their affinity for donor and substrate using the affinity chromatography methods described previously (3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and described below. Each plate of transfected COS cells was lysed with 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 and homogenized by passing through a 25-gauge needle four times. Cell lysates were diluted in 9 ml of Buffer E (10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.1% Triton CF-54, 0.25 m NaCl) and applied to a 1-ml CDP-hexanolamine-agarose affinity column. The column was washed with 2 ml of Buffer E and 4 ml of Buffer H (20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 5.3, 0.1% Triton CF-54, 0.15m NaCl), and eluted with Buffer H containing 5 mm CDP. Fractions of 800 µl were collected. Medium of transfected CHO cells was collected for the asialofetuin binding assay. The conditioned medium was incubated with asialofetuin-Sepharose FF beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with Buffer E and Buffer H, and ST6Gal I proteins were eluted with 0.5m galactose in Buffer H. Proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation using the rabbit anti-rat ST6Gal I and then detected by immunoblotting with a mouse anti-Myc antibody, a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent, as described above. Under steady state conditions, we detect the ST6Gal I disulfide-bonded dimer in liver Golgi membranes, but not in significant quantities in liver ER membranes (3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since disulfide bond formation usually occurs in the ER, this could reflect the formation of the disulfide-bonded dimer in the ER and its rapid transport to the Golgi. Interestingly, Bosshart and Berger (14Bosshart H. Berger E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that they were first able to detect a higher molecular weight form (∼97 kDa) of the endogenous ST6Gal I in H-4-II-E rat hepatoma cells after 2 h of chase, suggesting that a dimer of the enzyme is formed in the Golgi. However, these researchers commented that their recovery of this form of the enzyme was at times erratic. Their inability to consistently recover the ST6Gal I dimer could have compromised their ability to detect this form of the protein at earlier time points. To evaluate where the ST6Gal I disulfide-bonded dimer is formed in the COS-1 cell expression system, we performed a pulse-chase analysis in cells transiently expressing the STtyr isoform. Cells were labeled with EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix for 30 min and chased for 0–180 min. STtyr proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates at each time point and analyzed under non-reducing and reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this experiment and the others described in this report, we included 100 mm iodoacetamide in all buffers to prevent aberrant disulfide bond formation (see Ref. 3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Under nonreducing conditions, in addition to the expected 47–50-kDa STtyr band, a band of ∼100 kDa was observed after only 30 min of labeling and reflected 15% of the total STtyr protein (Fig. 1). This 100-kDa band disappeared when samples were treated with reducing agents, arguing that it represented a disulfide-bonded dimer of the STtyr. In addition, this dimer persisted throughout the chase period and only decreased in intensity at the longest chase time point (180 min), coincident with a decrease in the monomer, and likely reflecting the enzyme's cleavage and secretion. Increases in the molecular mass of the monomer band were observed between 60 and 180 min of chase and undoubtedly reflected the terminal glycosylation of the enzyme'sN-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi (Fig. 1). This was verified by a parallel experiment in which samples were digested with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that specifically cleaves high mannose, but not complex N-linked oligosaccharides and can be used to monitor transport into the Golgi where N-linked oligosaccharides are modified to complex forms (15Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 289-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer T.H.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In a subsequent identical experiment, we were able to successfully repeat these results, and we also demonstrated that an ER retained/retrieved form of the STtyr, Iip33-STtyr (17Ma J. Simonovic M. Qian R. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was capable of forming dimer, again suggesting that the STtyr dimer is forming within the ER. Taken together, these results suggest that the disulfide-bonded dimer of the STtyr forms in the ER of COS-1 cells and is rapidly transported to the Golgi along with the monomeric enzyme, where both forms of the enzyme are cleaved within the stem region and secreted. To determine which Cys residues are involved in the dimerization of the ST6Gal I STtyr isoform, we individually replaced one Cys residue in the transmembrane domain (Cys-24) and six Cys residues in the catalytic domain (Cys-139, -181, -332, -350, -361, and -403) with either Ala or Ser residues (Fig.2). Wild type and mutant proteins were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and Golgi-enriched membranes were isolated in the presence of 100 mm iodoacetamide according to the method of Xu and Shields (13Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Aliquots of membrane preparations were electrophoresed under reducing and non-reducing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and STtyr proteins detected by immunoblotting with the antibody specific for the ST6Gal I (3Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In four separate experiments, we found that replacement of Cys-24 (C24A), Cys-181 (C181A (shown) or C181S (not shown)), and Cys-332 (C332A) eliminated detectable disulfide-bonded dimer formation (Fig.3). Replacement of Cys-350 (C350S) and Cys-403 (C403S) did not significantly influence dimer formation, whereas replacement of Cys-361 (C361S) slightly decreased the amount of dimer. Notably, replacement of Cys-139 (C139S) appeared to significantly enhance dimer formation, and a higher molecular mass band was also observed in addition to the dimer when Cys-403 was replaced (C403S).Figure 3Disulfide-bonded dimers of STtyr are not formed when Cys-24, Cys-181, or Cys-332 are replaced. STtyr and its various Cys mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells, Golgi enriched membranes were isolated, and STtyr proteins found in these membranes analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Migration positions of ST6Gal I monomer and dimer are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our inability to detect dimers of the C24A, C181A/S, and C332A mutants could reflect the absence of Cys residues that are involved in dimer formation or an inability of the proteins to form dimers because they are generally misfolded. Strikingly, both the Cys-181 and Cys-332 mutants were found in the Golgi-enriched membranes in lower amounts relative to the other mutant STtyr proteins, suggesting that these proteins may be misfolded and retained to some extent in the ER (Fig.3). In addition, the lower amounts of these proteins in the Golgi-enriched membranes could have also compromised our ability to detect dimers if they were formed. This latter possibility was ruled out by additional experiments in which no dimers of the C181 and C332 mutants were detected even when greater amounts of these two mutant proteins were analyzed (data not shown). However, to more definitively identify the Cys residue or residues involved in dimer formation, we needed to evaluate the possibility that some or all of the STtyr Cys mutants were misfolded and/or mislocalized. To do this, we evaluated the localization of these proteins, as well as their catalytic act"
https://openalex.org/W1985681557,"Recent studies indicate that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) interact physically via two specific binding sites located within the amino-terminal globular region of apoB100. The first site is thought to be within the first 5.8% of the amino-terminal sequence, and the second site is between 9 and 16% of the amino-terminal sequence. It is not clear from prior studies whether these sites have unique or overlapping functions. Furthermore, there are no data differentiating between lipid transfer and potential chaperone functions of MTP. In the present study we have attempted to further characterize the physiologic interaction between apoB and MTP and to determine the relationship between the binding and lipid transfer aspects of the interaction. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoB cDNAs, and MTP binding to apoB polypeptides was determined by two-step immunoprecipitation. MTP bound equally well to apoB polypeptides with (apoB13, 16,β, apoB34, and apoB42) or without (apoB16, apoB13, and 16 or apoB13, 13, and 16) β sheet domains. When proteasomal degradation of newly synthesized apoB polypeptides was blocked, MTP binding to all of the apoB polypeptides was only modestly affected by lipid availability and was independent of MTP-associated lipid transfer. Furthermore, MTP did not bind directly to a portion of the first β sheet domain. We created two apoB constructs (apoB16del and apoB34del) by deleting the first 210 amino acids of apoB16 and apoB34. These apoB polypeptides, therefore, lacked the putative first MTP binding site. MTP binding to apoB16del and apoB34del was decreased significantly. However, the secretion of apoB16del was not different from apoB16, whereas the secretion of apoB34delwas impaired significantly. Our results indicate that the interaction between MTP and apoB involves independent binding and lipid transfer activities but that both activities are required for the secretion of apolipoprotein B from liver cells.

The essential role of MTP in the translocation of apolipoprotein B (apoB) across the ER membrane and the assembly of apoB with lipids has been demonstrated clearly by co-expressing apoB and MTP in cells that do not normally express either protein and by the characterization of mice lacking MTP. The expression of apoB alone in cells without MTP resulted in the intracellular degradation of nascent apoB and no secretion; co-expression of apoB with MTP resulted in the secretion of apoB on lipoprotein particles (4Gordon D.A.

Those results suggested that, at least in HepG2 cells, MTP facilitated the translocation of apoB across the ER membrane. Lack of expression of theMtp gene in mice is associated with an absence of lipid droplets in the ER lumen (13Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl.

Does MTP binding to apoB depend on active lipid synthesis and/or transfer? Does MTP bind directly to β sheet domain sequences? Are the two MTP binding sites on apoB functionally independent of each other? We sought to answer these questions by using cultured liver cells expressing the following human apoB constructs (Fig.1): carboxyl-terminal truncations of full-length apoB including apoB16, apoB34, and apoB42; apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16, which contain repeats of the amino-terminal globular domain but no β sheet domains; apoB13,16,β, in which the β sheet domain between apoB28 and B34 in full-length apoB100 has been inserted into apoB13,16; apoBβ, in which the β sheet domain between apoB28 and B34 has been linked directly to a signal peptide of apoB; and apoB16del and apoB34del, in which the putative first MTP binding site (the first 210 residues of apoB) (25Bakillah A.

Briefly, cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed every 3 days, and experiments were started after the cells were 70–90% confluent.

Structural comparisons of the proteins expressed by these cDNA constructs with apoB100 are shown in Fig. 1. Immunoprecipitation of MTP-bound apoB in cell lysates was carried out according to the methods of Wu et al. (22Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in a nondenaturing lysis buffer (62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 µg/ml pepstatin A, 50 µg/ml leupeptin, 150 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated on a shaker for 10 h at 4 °C with an excess amount of anti-MTP large subunit (a generous gift from Dr. John Wetterau at Bristol Myers Squibb) or anti-apoB antiserum; the immune complex was precipitated by an additional 3-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL 4B. After washing for three times, the precipitated immune complex was denatured by boiling 4 min in 2% SDS and subjected to second immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibody after adjusting the SDS concentration to 0.1%. The samples were finally analyzed on either 3–15% or 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were loaded onto the SDS-polyacrylamide gels after correcting for total trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity from each cell lysate. Our previous studies demonstrated that the intracellular levels of newly synthesized apoB42, apoB34, and apoB13,16,β, were significantly increased significantly by incubation with OA and decreased by MTP inhibition, whereas cell levels of apoB16, apoB13,16, and apoB13,13,16 were not affected by these perturbations (22Wu X.

Therefore, our first experiments focused both on the binding of MTP to apoB peptides with and without a β sheet domain and whether OA stimulation of triglyceride synthesis would differentially affect the association of MTP with apoB peptides either containing or lacking β sheet domains. Thirty-six h after the transfection of HepG2 cells with apoB cDNAs, the cells were preincubated for 2 h with and without OA (0.4 mm) and labeled for 30 min with [3H]leucine. Cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-MTP large subunit antibody followed by secondary immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-apoB antibody. Therefore, immunoprecipitated apoB represented apoB that had been bound to MTP. As we reported previously, apoB100 bound to MTP, and this interaction was increased in the presence of OA (22Wu X.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig.2A, lanes 2,4, 6, 8, and 10 versus lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, relative densitometric units (RDU) 4.21 ± 0.89;n = 3 separate experiments, p < 0.05). Additionally, all of the apoB peptides with (apoB34, lanes 1and 2; apoB42, lanes 3 and 4) or without (apoB16, lanes 9 and 10; apoB13,16, lanes 7 and 8; apoB13,13,16, lanes 5 and6) β sheet domains bound to MTP. Of interest, MTP binding to apoB peptides containing a β sheet domain (apoB34, apoB42) was increased markedly by OA treatment (lane 2 versus 1, RDU 3.35 ± 0.65, p < 0.05;lane 4 versus 3, RDU 3.64 ± 0.11, p < 0.05), whereas MTP binding to apoB peptides without any β sheet domains (apoB13,13,16, apoB13,16, or apoB16) was not affected by OA (lane 6 versus 5, RDU 1.10 ± 0.25; lane 8 versus 7, RDU 0.97 ± 0.21; lane 10 versus 9, RDU 0.95 ± 0.19). These results suggested that the binding of MTP to apoB was independent of the presence of lipid-binding β sheet domains. However, the effect of OA suggested that the association of MTP with the amino terminus of apoB constructs that did contain β sheet domains might be regulated by the availability of newly synthesized core lipids. To understand how OA treatment could increase the association of MTP with apoB, we carried out an additional experiment. Cells were pretreated for 2 h with the proteasome inhibitors ALLN (40 µg/ml) or lactacystin (10 µm) to prevent degradation of inefficiently translocated apoB (33Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R.

As indicated in Fig. 2 B, ALLN treatment minimized the OA-induced increase in the association of MTP with apoB100 and apoB34. As noted above, in the absence of ALLN, OA increased the association of apoB100 and MTP by 320% (Fig. 2 A). When ALLN was present (Fig. 2 B), the association of apoB100 with MTP was only increased by 35% (lanes 2, 4, and 6 versus lanes 1, 3, and 5, RDU 1.35 ± 0.29; n = 3). Similarly, whereas OA increased the association of MTP with apoB34 by 235% without ALLN (Fig. 2 A), the increase was only about 74% (lane 2 versus lane 1, RDU 1.74 ± 0.78;n = 3) when ALLN was present (Fig. 2 B). The association of either apoB13,16 or apoB16 with MTP, which was not affected by OA alone (Fig. 2 A), was also not affected by OA treatment in ALLN-pretreated HepG2 cells (lane 4 versus lane 3, RDU 1.23 ± 0.42; lane 6 versus lane 5, RDU 1.12 ± 0.35; both not significant,n = 3). These data indicate that the increased association of MTP with apoB100 and the apoB constructs containing β sheet domains in the presence of OA (demonstrated in Fig.2 A) was mediated mainly by the ability of OA to protect apoB from proteasomal degradation. Thus, the majority of the effect of OA to increase binding of MTP to apoB seemed to result from decreased proteasomal degradation of nascent apoB rather than by any direct effect of OA or lipid availability on the binding process. Overall, therefore, the studies shown in Fig. 2 indicated that the interaction between MTP and apoB was mainly independent of both the presence of lipid-binding β sheet domains and the availability of core lipids. Because MTP activity seems to be required for efficient apoB translocation when a β sheet domain is present (21Liang J.S. Wu X.U. Jiang H.S. Zhou M.Y. Yang H.Y. Angkeow P. Huang L.S. Sturley S.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35216-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our finding that increased lipid availability did not directly affect the interaction between MTP and apoB was surprising. Therefore, our next experiment examined the effect of inhibiting MTP lipid transfer activity on the association of MTP with apoB peptides. Thirty-six h after transfection with apoB cDNAs, the cells were preincubated for 1 h with and without an MTP inhibitor (CP-10447, 50 µm) (28Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled for 30 min with [3H]leucine. Cell lysates were analyzed by two-step immunoprecipitation. Consistent with our first experiment, apoB peptides with (apoB13,16,β, lanes 3 and 4; apoB42, lanes 5 and 6; apoB100, lanes 1–10) or without (apoB16, lanes 1 and 2; apoB13,16, lanes 9 and 10; apoB13,13,16,lanes 7 and 8) β sheet domains all bound to MTP (Fig. 3A). When the MTP activity was inhibited by CP-10447, MTP binding to apoB peptides with β sheet domains decreased dramatically. Specifically, apoB100 binding to MTP was reduced by 72% (lanes 2, 4,6, 8, and 10 versus lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, RDU 0.28 ± 0.08; p < 0.05, n = 3), apoB13,16,β binding to MTP was reduced by 71% (lane 4 versus 3, RDU 0.29 ± 0.12,p < 0.05, n = 3), and apoB42 binding to MTP was reduced by 65% (lane 6 versus 5, RDU 0.35 ± 0.11; p < 0.05,n = 3). In contrast, MTP binding to apoB peptides without β sheet domains was not affected by the inhibition of MTP (apoB16, lane 2 versus lane 1, RDU 0.88 ± 0.24; apoB13,13,16, lane 8 versus 7, RDU 0.94 ± 0.29; apoB13,16, lane 10 versus 9, RDU 0.97 ± 0.33; all not significant,n = 3) (Fig. 3 A). Thus, although simple insertion of a small portion of the first β sheet domain of apoB100 into apoB13,16 did not affect MTP binding to apoB in control medium, it appeared to make the interaction between MTP and apoB13,16,β responsive to the inhibition of MTP activity. The results presented in Fig. 2 B indicated, however, that the reduced interaction between MTP and apoB constructs containing β sheet domains observed during inhibition of MTP activity (in Fig.3 A) could have resulted from either 1) increased apoB degradation of nascent apoB by the proteasome and fewer apoB molecules available for binding to MTP or 2) decreased binding affinity of MTP for apoB. We therefore determined the effects of inhibiting MTP lipid transfer activity on the binding of MTP to apoB in the absence or presence of lactacystin (Fig. 3 B). Thirty-six h after HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoB cDNAs, the cells were preincubated for 2 h with or without MTP inhibitor (10 µm) in the presence or absence of lactacystin and labeled for 30 min with [3H]leucine. In the presence of lactacystin, MTP binding to the apoB species containing β sheet domains, apoB13,16,β and apoB100, was unaffected by the MTP inhibitor. Thus Fig. 3 B, lane 2 versus 1 and lane 5 versus 4, confirms the effects of the MTP inhibitor on the apoB100 binding to MTP shown in Fig. 3 A, but this effect is reversed by lactacystin (lane 3 versus 1 and lane 6 versus 4, RDU 0.91 ± 0.33; not significant,n = 3). Similarly, Fig. 3 B, lane 2 versus lane 1, confirms the effect of the MTP inhibitor on binding of apoB13,16,β to MTP, but this effect is reversed by lactacystin (lane 3 versus lane 1, RDU 0.89 ± 0.29; not significant, n = 3). On the other hand, the binding of apoB13,16 to MTP, which was not affected by the MTP inhibitor (Fig. 3 A), was also not altered by the MTP inhibitor plus lactacystin (Fig. 3 B, lane 6 versus lane 4, RDU 0.92 ± 0.28). These results indicate clearly that if proteasomal degradation is inhibited, the ability of MTP to interact physically with apoB is independent of MTP lipid-transfer activity. The results described above indicated that the binding of MTP to the amino-terminal globular domain of apoB is independent of the presence of β sheet domains. On the other hand, β sheet domains play a critical role in determining the response of apoB to OA-treatment and MTP-inhibition. Furthermore, it appears that although binding of MTP to apoB is mainly independent of both lipid availability and lipid transfer activity, the latter are both required for the translocation of apoB peptides containing β sheet domains into the ER lumen where they are assembled into lipoproteins. These findings raised the question whether MTP, in addition to binding to the amino-terminal globular domain of apoB, binds directly to the β sheet domains, where lipid transfer may occur. In an attempt to address this question, we created apoBβ in which the β sheet domain between apoB28 and apoB34 of full-length apoB is attached directly to the apoB signal peptide without any intervening amino-terminal globular region. ApoBβ was expressed in HepG2 cells (Fig.4A, lanes 1 and2). Consistent with our previous data, binding of MTP to apoB34 and apoB100 (in the absence of lactacystin) was decreased markedly by MTP inhibition (for apoB100: Fig. 4 B,lanes 2, 4, and 6 versus lanes 1, 3, and 5; for apoB34: Fig. 4 B,lane 6 versus lane 5), whereas MTP binding apoB16 was not affected (Fig. 4 B, lane 4 versus lane 3). We could not, however, detect any binding of MTP to apoBβ either in the absence or presence of the MTP inhibitor (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). This was not caused by a lack of translocation of apoBβ, because it was associated only with microsomes (data not shown). These data suggest that MTP does not bind directly to the first β sheet domain in apoB100. Although apoBβ may not be fully representative of the β sheet domains that are present within native apoB, we have shown previously that insertion of this portion of the first β sheet domain into the globular amino-terminal domain of apoB100 is sufficient to make the amino-terminal polypeptide sensitive to lipid availability and MTP activity. Additionally, the observation that MTP does not bind to apoBβ is consistent with the recent reports using in vitro (24Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol.

The preceding experiments suggested that the physical interaction between MTP and the amino-terminal of apoB was independent of the presence of β sheet domains, lipid availability, and lipid transfer activity. However, it is clear from numerous studies that all three are critical in determining the need for MTP in the assembly and secretion of apoB from liver cells. One explanation for this seeming paradox would be that MTP and apoB interacted in a sequential manner, with binding preceeding lipid transfer. More importantly, our results indicated that apoB might contain at least two independent functional domains involved in MTP binding and MTP lipid transfer, respectively. Because the putative second MTP binding site on apoB (between 9 and 16% of apoB) (24Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25612-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Bradbury P. Mann C.J. Köchl S. Anderson T.A. Chester S.A. Hancock J.M. Ritchie P.J. Amey J.

Indeed, when a salt bridge within the putative second MTP binding site in apoB was disrupted by mutation of the arginine 531 residue, the MTP-apoB interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system and the secretion of apoB from COS-1 cells were both reduced markedly (27Bradbury P. Mann C.J. Köchl S. Anderson T.A. Chester S.A. Hancock J.M. Ritchie P.J. Amey J. Harrison G.B. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3159-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The other putative MTP binding site is located within the first 5.8% of apoB, further away from the start of the first β sheet domain (26Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köchl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This site might play an important role in facilitating the initial translocation of apoB across the ER membrane, an event that could be the necessary prerequisite for lipid transfer to occur at the second site. To test this hypothesis, we created apoB16deland apoB34del, in which the first MTP binding site (the first 210 residues of apoB) was deleted. Thirty-six h after transfection of HepG2 cells with apoB16del and apoB34del cDNAs, the cells were labeled for 30 min with [3H]leucine. The cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-MTP large subunit antibody followed by secondary immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-apoB antibody. In HepG2 cells, MTP binding to either apoB34del or apoB16del was decreased significantly compared with its binding to apoB34 and apoB16 (Fig.5A, lane 2 versus 1 and lane 4 versus 3). The marked decrease in ability to immunoprecipitate apoB that had interacted with MTP was not caused by decreased immunoreactivity of either apoB16del or apoB34del; thus, when the anti-apoB antibody was used in both steps of the two-step immunoprecipitation, apoB34 and apoB16 with deletions were precipitated as well as their counterparts without the deletions (Fig. 5 B, lane 2 versus 1 and lane 4 versus 3. Lane 5 was an untransfected control). Secretion of apoB16del and apoB34del from HepG2 cells was also studied. Thirty-six h after transfection, HepG2 cells were labeled with [3H]leucine for 2 h. After labeling, the cell medium and lysates were collected and analyzed by a single-step immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibodies (Fig.6). Secretion of apoB34 was significantly inhibited when the first 5.5% of the amino terminus of that polypeptide was deleted (Fig. 6, lane 2). This is consistent with studies from Sf-21 insect cells by Gretch et al. (6Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol.

The data in Fig.5 A indicate that the first MTP binding site is required for the interaction between apoB and MTP. Furthermore, the results presented in Fig. 6 (medium) demonstrate that this first binding site plays a critical role in apoB translocation and secretion only when a β sheet domain is present.Figure 6Deletion of the first 5.8% of apoB significantly inhibited secretion of apoB34del but not apoB16del.

When the amino-terminal 17% of longer apoB polypeptides was deleted, however, the secretion of these apoB polypeptides was reduced markedly, and the response to MTP stimulation was lost.

The first binding site was localized by Mann et al. (26Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köchl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M.

Bradbury et al. (27Bradbury P. Mann C.J. Köchl S. Anderson T.A. Chester S.A. Hancock J.M. Ritchie P.J. Amey J. Harrison G.B. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol.

This second site is in the same region as the site of MTP binding to apoB reported by Hussain et al. (24Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25612-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), who demonstrated an in vitro interaction of amino acids 430–570 in apoB with MTP. Our present experiments extend these previous results to a human liver cell line and provide the basis for a physiologic model of the interaction between apoB and MTP. Thus, we have been able to demonstrate that although MTP binding and the concomitant transfer of newly synthesized lipids are required for efficient translocation across the ER membrane of apoB100 and apoB constructs that contain β sheet domains, the actual binding of MTP to the amino-terminal globular domain of apoB is independent of both the presence of β sheet domains and lipid transfer activity. Our results also indicate that MTP binding is mainly independent of lipid availability. Of particular note, our results demonstrate that the first MTP binding site on apoB plays a critical role in targeting native apoB for secretion. The data presented here are compatible with those recently reported by Bakillahet al. (37Bakillah A. Nayak N. Saxena U. Medford R.M. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4892-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They identified a compound, AGI-S17, that inhibited the in vitro interaction of apoB peptides with MTP but did not affect lipid transfer activity of purified MTP. Additionally, AGI-S17 inhibited apoB secretion from HepG2 cells without affecting the MTP lipid transfer activity. Bakillah et al.(37Bakillah A. Nayak N. Saxena U. Medford R.M. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4892-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) concluded that MTP had both chaperone and lipid transfer activities. In summary, our present studies indicate that the interaction between MTP and apoB involves independent binding and lipid transfer activities but that both activities are required for the secretion of apoB lipoprotreins from liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013850315,"Botulinum toxin is a zinc-dependent endoprotease that acts on vulnerable cells to cleave polypeptides that are essential for exocytosis. To exert this poisoning effect, the toxin must proceed through a complex sequence of events that involves binding, productive internalization, and intracellular expression of catalytic activity. Results presented in this study show that soluble chelators rapidly strip Zn2+ from its binding site in botulinum toxin, and this stripping of cation results in the loss of catalytic activity in cell-free or broken cell preparations. Stripped toxin is still active against intact neuromuscular junctions, presumably because internalized toxin binds cytosolic Zn2+. In contrast to soluble chelators, immobilized chelators have no effect on bound Zn2+, nor do they alter toxin activity. The latter finding is because of the fact that the spontaneous loss of Zn2+ from its coordination site in botulinum toxin is relatively slow. When exogenous Zn2+ is added to toxin that has been stripped by soluble chelators, the molecule rebinds cation and regains catalytic and neuromuscular blocking activity. Exogenous Zn2+ can restore toxin activity either when the toxin is free in solution on the cell exterior or when it has been internalized and is in the cytosol. The fact that stripped toxin can reach the cytosol means that the loss of bound Zn2+ does not produce conformational changes that block internalization. Similarly, the fact that stripped toxin in the cytosol can be reactivated by ambient Zn2+ or exogenous Zn2+ means that productive internalization does not produce conformational changes that block rebinding of cation.

Doussau F. Grant N.J. Poulain B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 85: 427-446Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Each of the three major steps in toxin action can be further subdivided into two or more events. Thus, the binding step reportedly involves two sequential processes. During the first, toxin associates with low affinity receptors on the cell surface, and during the second, the low affinity complex shuttles the toxin to a high affinity receptor (2Montecucco C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Productive internalization also involves a number of events (see “Discussion”), with the two major ones being receptor-mediated endocytosis across the plasma membrane and pH-dependent translocation across the endosome membrane. During the final step, botulinum toxin acts as a zinc-dependent endoprotease to cleave polypeptides that govern exocytosis (3Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 423-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Enzymatic cleavage of these polypeptides must also involve multiple events (viz. substrate binding, substrate cleavage), although this has not been studied extensively. During the interval since toxin action was first described as a sequence of three steps (4Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar, 5Simpson L.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 33: 155-188PubMed Google Scholar), investigators have tended to examine these steps as though they are separate and independent. However, recent and apparently contradictory findings may necessitate a change in perspective. In 1992, Schiavo et al. (6Schiavo G. Benfanti F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar) and Linket al. (7Link E. Edelmann L. Chou J.H. Binz T. Yamasaki S. Eisel U. Baumert M. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) reported that botulinum toxin type B and tetanus toxin were zinc-dependent endoproteases. In 1993, Simpsonet al. (8Simpson L.L. Coffield J.A. Bakry N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar) reported that all seven botulinum toxin serotypes (A–G) were likely to be zinc-dependent endoproteases, because the toxicity of all seven serotypes was diminished by zinc chelation. However, the work with Zn2+ chelators revealed an unexpected outcome. It was observed that removing Zn2+from toxin was necessary but not sufficient to cause a loss of toxicity against intact cells. Toxin stripped of Zn2+ could still produce blockade of exocytosis, apparently because the toxin could replenish its divalent cation from tissue stores. In keeping with this idea, the chelation of toxin as well as tissue was necessary to produce marked reductions in toxin activity. More recently, Fu et al. (9Fu F.-N. Lomneth R.B. Cai S. Singh B.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5267-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have published findings that seem to contradict those just described. They found that the use of a chelator to remove Zn2+ from toxin led to irreversible changes in tertiary structure as measured by various light-scattering techniques. They also found that removal of the cation led to irreversible losses in toxicity as measured by norepinephrine release from permeabilized PC-12 cells. Close inspection of these contradictory findings on Zn2+reveals that there could be implications that extend beyond the final or catalytic step in toxin action. These data may also have an impact on proposed models for productive internalization and particularly on models for toxin penetration of the endosome membrane (see “Discussion”). Thus, any model that calls for a significant relaxation of the toxin molecule, which in turn could cause the loss of Zn2+ binding, would not be plausible unless the toxin could subsequently regain Zn2+ and biological activity. Conversely, any model that calls for toxin to remain tightly bound to Zn2+ during translocation would not be viable unless the translocation process could accommodate a somewhat bulky protein that retains at least some of its secondary and tertiary structure. In the work that follows, both experimental studies and deduction have been used to gauge the likelihood that removal of Zn2+produces irreversible losses in botulinum toxin activity. This work then has been used to assess whether events that occur during the internalization step can impact events during the catalytic step. 65ZnCl2 (6,146.68 MBq/mg) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sephadex G-25 gel filtration columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chelex® 100 Resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. EGTA and EDTA disodium salts were from Sigma, and TPEN1 was purchased from Molecular Probes. Rabbit anti-C-terminal SNAP-25 polyclonal antibody was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, B.C., Canada), and donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher Scientific (Malvern, PA). Botulinum neurotoxin type A was purified to homogeneity by procedures that have been described previously (10Sakaguchi G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1982; 19: 165-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11DasGupta B.R. Sathyamoorthy V. Toxicon. 1984; 22: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Simpson L.L. Schmidt J.J. Middlebrook J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-SNAP-25 (∼50 kDa) was constructed and expressed according to published techniques. Murine SNAP-25 cDNA, pSNAP8.52, which was derived from a BALB/c strain brain Lambda cDNA library (13Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. Michael C. Wilson (Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA), was used as a polymerase chain reaction template. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out with primers 5′-TCT TGG ATC CGC CGA AGA CGC AGA CAT GC-3′ and 5′-TCT TGG ATC CTT AAC CAC TTC CCA GCA TCT T-3′. A product of ∼880 base pairs was digested with BamHI and ligated into pGEX-KG vector (14Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was sequenced to confirm that SNAP-25 cDNA had been inserted into pGEX-KG correctly. The transformation, expression of pGEX-KG/SNAP-25 in bacteria, and purification of GST-SNAP-25 fusion protein were performed as described (15Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using buffers that were pretreated with Chelex®100 resin to remove trace amounts of cations such as Zn2+. Calculations based on manufacturer specifications indicated that 0.5 mg of Chelex® 100 resin/liter of buffer should remove all trace cations from solution. The buffers used in these experiments were pretreated with a substantial excess of resin (5 g/liter) for 18 h at room temperature, and this was followed by filtration through a 0.2-µm filter to remove the resin. Prior to use, all filters and labware were rinsed three times with Chelex®100-treated distilled water. For all experimental methods described below, 65Zn associated with toxin was quantified using Sephadex G-25 chromatography followed by liquid scintillation counting. Columns were equilibrated by washing with a column buffer (50 mm NaPO4 and 1 m NaCl, pH 6.8). Subsequently, 0.5-ml experimental samples of toxin were filtered through Sephadex G-25 columns, and ∼0.5-ml (10-drop) fractions were collected. The samples were added to 3 ml of scintillation fluid, and the amount of radioactivity in the fractions was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Labeled toxin eluted at void volume, and the radioactivity contained in the void-volume fractions was summed to determine the total amount of 65Zn label associated with the toxin peak. Zn2+ depletion of toxin was carried out in 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, employing two steps. First, toxin was added to buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and EGTA (final concentrations) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, the toxin sample was dialyzed overnight at 3 °C (18 h, minimum of two buffer changes) against this same buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and EGTA. After Zn2+depletion, the toxin sample was dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, that had been pretreated with Chelex® 100 resin for 24 h (two buffer changes). Stripped (e.g. Zn2+-depleted) toxin was stored at 3 °C in sterile vials that had been rinsed three times with Chelex®-treated buffer, and it was used over a period of ∼6 months. For Zn2+ exchange, pure BoNT/A (1 × 10−7m final concentration) and 65ZnCl2(10−8–10−5m final concentration) were incubated in a 500-µl reaction volume in Chelex® 100-treated buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) at room temperature for 24 h. For Zn2+ replacement, Zn2+-depleted BoNT/A (1 × 10−7m final concentration) and65ZnCl2 (2 × 10−7m final concentration) were incubated in a 500-µl reaction volume in Chelex® 100-treated buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) at room temperature for 1, 5, 15, 45, 60, and 120 min. After incubation, the65Zn label associated with the toxin peak was determined as described above. Zn2+-depleted BoNT/A (1 × 10−7m final concentration) was prelabeled with 65Zn (2 × 10−7m final concentration) for 18 h at 3 °C in reaction buffer. The experiment with prelabeled toxin was initiated by warming the materials to room temperature and subsequently adding 30 mg of Chelex® 100 resin, EDTA (30 mm final concentration), or TPEN (20 µm final concentration) to 500-µl reaction vessels. Control reactions used prelabeled toxin without added chelator. Experimental samples were incubated at room temperature for varying lengths of time (see “Results”), after which the toxin-associated 65Zn label was determined. Zn2+-depleted BoNT/A (1 × 10−7m final concentration) was prelabeled with 65Zn (2 × 10−7m final concentration) as described above. The experiment with prelabeled toxin was initiated by warming to room temperature and adjusting the 500-µl reaction mixture to a pH of ∼4.00, ∼5.00, or ∼6.00 by the addition of the appropriate amount of 1 n HCl. Control reactions remained at pH 7.20. Experimental samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For each sample, the 65Zn label associated with the toxin peak was determined. Brain tissue was removed from mice and immediately immersed and homogenized in chilled buffer containing 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Hepes, pH. 7.4. The resulting suspension was homogenized with a Brinkmann homogenizer (E2M/Polytron, Norcross, GA) at a setting of ∼4–5 for ∼1 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min (SS-34 Rotor, Sorvall RC-5B Refrigerated Superspeed centrifuge). The resulting supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min (same rotor and centrifuge). The second supernatant (S2) was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 70 min (T-865.1 Rotor, Sorvall Ultra 80 centrifuge). The resulting pellet (P3) was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1. The protein concentration of P3 was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). BoNT/A was assayed for endoprotease activity using either recombinant GST-SNAP-25 or synaptosomal SNAP-25. In both cases, an anti-C-terminal SNAP-25 antibody was used as a reagent in the immunodetection of enzyme activity (16Poirier M. Hao J. Malkus P. Chan C. Moore M. King D. Bennett M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When recombinant substrate was used, ∼130 ng of GST-SNAP-25 was present in each reaction vessel; when synaptosomes were used, 7–10 µg of P3 protein was added to each reaction. In the latter case, 1%N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to the reaction to permeabilize synaptosomes and expose SNAP-25. Reactions were initiated by reducing BoNT/A (100–200 nm) with dithiothreitol (8 mm) at room temperature for 30 min in cleavage buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, plus 20 µm ZnCl2). When the assays were done with stripped toxin or chelators, auxiliary Zn2+ was not added to the reactions mixtures. In most experiments, substrate was added to reduced toxin, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 37 °C. Enzymatic cleavage reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 20% glycerol, 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The samples were denatured by incubating at 95 °C with subsequent cooling and then separated in 10% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 was transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 µm, Immobilon-NC and Fisher Scientific) and probed with anti-SNAP-25 C-terminal antibody at 1:10,000 dilution. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. The antibody reaction was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using x-ray film (Kodak Bio-Max). Phrenic nerve hemidiaphragms were excised from mice as described previously (18Coffield J.A. Bakry N. Zhang R.D. Carlson J. Gomella L.G. Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1489-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kiyatkin N. Maksymowych A.B. Simpson L.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tissues were suspended in physiological solution that was bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and maintained at 35 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, the physiological solution had the following composition: 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mmMgSO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, and 11 mm d-glucose. The solutions were supplemented with 0.01% gelatin as an auxiliary protein to diminish nonspecific inactivation of toxin. Phrenic nerves were stimulated continuously (0.5 Hz, 0.2-msec duration), and muscle twitch was recorded. Toxin-induced paralysis was measured as a 90% reduction in muscle twitch response to nerve stimulation. Two paradigms were used to expose BoNT/A to soluble chelators. In the first, toxin was exposed for lengthy periods of time to a combination of EDTA and EGTA to strip Zn2+ (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the second, toxin was incubated with TPEN for 60 min at room temperature before the assays. For both protocols, endoprotease activity was determined using recombinant substrate (GST-SNAP-25) or endogenous substrate (synaptosomal SNAP-25). As shown in Fig. 1, native toxin produced complete cleavage of substrate (A–D, lane 2 in each panel). By contrast, toxin that had been incubated with TPEN (A and C, lane 3 in each panel) and toxin that had been stripped of Zn2+ (B andD, lane 3 in each panel) were essentially free of enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous Zn2+ reversed the effects of chelation. Regardless of whether toxin had been transiently exposed to TPEN (A andC, lane 4 in each panel) or stripped of Zn2+ (B and D, lane 4 in each panel), the addition of micromolar amounts of Zn2+restored endoprotease activity. Samples of toxin that had been stripped of Zn2+ with EDTA and EGTA or had been exposed transiently to TPEN were bioassayed for their abilities to produce neuromuscular blockade of phrenic nerve hemidiaphragm preparations (Fig. 2). In both cases, treated toxin proved to be highly effective in blocking exocytosis. This result was obtained even though chelator-treated toxin was not exposed to exogenous Zn2+ before its addition to tissues. Experiments were done with Chelex®, an immobilized chelator that cannot gain access to Zn2+ within its coordination site in the toxin molecule but can bind free Zn2+ in solution. The toxin was incubated with chelator as described under “Experimental Procedures” for 120 min at room temperature, after which the mixture was centrifuged to separate the components. Soluble toxin was then assayed for biological activity. Interestingly, toxin exposed to Chelex® possessed enzymatic activity and neuromuscular blocking activity comparable with those of native untreated toxin (e.g. Fig. 1,A–D, lane 2; Fig. 2). These results were observed even without the addition of exogenous Zn2+(results not illustrated). Experiments were done to determine the rate of spontaneous exchange of zinc at the active site of botulinum toxin. For this purpose, four concentrations of 65Zn (10−8–10−5) were incubated with a single concentration of BoNT/A (1 × 10−7m). Experimental samples were incubated for 24 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the amount of exogenous radioactive Zn2+ that replaced endogenous unlabeled Zn2+ was determined. As shown in Fig. 3 A, there was concentration-dependent replacement of endogenous Zn2+. An exchange was evident even at 10−7m and was more pronounced at 10−6 and 10−5m. These results are consistent with the previously reported finding that the apparent K d for Zn2+ at its binding site is ∼60–80 nm(20Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Santucci A. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23479-23483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a subsequent set of experiments, the precise time course of Zn2+ exchange was studied. This was done at a65Zn concentration of 2 × 10−7m, which is on the linear portion of the concentration-effect curve shown in Fig. 3 A. The results indicated that a steady state for exchange was attained within ∼5–6 days, and the half-time for exchange was ∼2–3 days (Fig.3 B). This means that when studied in physiological buffer at pH 7.2, endogenous Zn2+ can exchange with environmental Zn2+. The time course of this exchange is such as to make it possible for botulinum toxin molecules to undergo at least a fractional exchange of Zn2+ during their lifetime (e.g. synthesis and release by bacteria, ingestion and absorption by victim, and binding, internalization, and onset of neuromuscular blockade). The results presented above and illustrated in Fig. 1strongly suggest that stripped toxin can regain Zn2+ and enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the in vitro toxicity experiments with phrenic nerve hemidiaphragm preparations indicate that stripped toxin can accumulate Zn2+ rapidly (Fig. 2). Therefore, experiments were done to quantify the rate at which Zn2+ can be acquired. Native toxin was stripped of endogenous Zn2+ with a combination of EDTA and EGTA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stripped toxin (1 × 10−7m) was then incubated for various amounts of time with65Zn (2 × 10−7m), and the rate of incorporation of exogenous zinc was monitored. The data, which are shown in Fig. 4, indicate that the half-time for accumulation was ∼6 min. This finding supports two conclusions: (a) the rate of Zn2+ accumulation by stripped toxin is much greater than the rate of Zn2+exchange in native toxin, and (b) the rate of Zn2+ accumulation by stripped toxin can easily account for the ability of this material to acquire exogenous Zn2+ and block neuromuscular transmission (e.g. Fig. 2). Bioassays for toxin activity in cleaving substrate and in blocking neuromuscular transmission have shown that a soluble chelator such as EDTA abolishes toxicity (Fig. 1), whereas an immobilized chelator such as Chelex® 100 does not (see above). This suggests that within the finite time course of an experiment, EDTA efficiently strips Zn2+, but Chelex® 100 does not. Therefore, experiments were done to test this premise. Botulinum toxin was stripped of endogenous Zn2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then loaded with65Zn. This material was then incubated with EDTA (30 mm), TPEN (20 µm), or Chelex®for 3 h at room temperature, after which the residual65Zn associated with the toxin was quantified. The averaged data from three experiments showed that Chelex® had no detectable ability to strip Zn2+ from toxin. On the other hand, EDTA removed more than 98% of bound Zn2+, and TPEN removed ∼89% of the bound cation. These findings indicate that soluble chelators act rapidly to remove Zn2+ from toxin. Furthermore, the results indicate that soluble chelators do more than merely bind Zn2+. In all likelihood, they approach the active site and scavenge bound Zn2+. And finally, the data showing that Chelex® is not very effective in stripping Zn2+ accounts for the finding that Chelex® is not effective in abolishing toxicity (see above). Botulinum toxin is not likely to encounter a chelator when it acts on neuromuscular junctions to paralyze transmission. However, there are ambient conditions encountered by the toxin that could produce a loss of Zn2+. The most notable of these is the fall in pH that is encountered when the toxin translocates from the lumen of the endosome to the cytosol. The fall in pH could produce a loss of Zn2+because low pH leads to protonation of histidine residues that coordinate Zn2+ binding, low pH produces conformational changes that diminish Zn2+ binding, or both. Therefore, experiments were done to quantify Zn2+ retention at pH values (4.0–7.2) that bridge the pK a for the imidazole side chain of histidine residues in proteins (6.1–6.4). Coincidentally, these pH values also bridge the range for those that induce conformational changes associated with toxin translocation. Botulinum toxin was stripped of Zn2+ as described above and loaded with 65Zn. This material was then incubated with solutions of varying pH for 30 min at room temperature. When the levels of residual 65Zn were quantified, the results (Fig. 5) showed that there was a significant loss of cation at a pH of 6.0. There was an additional loss of cation with further lowering of pH. The exact pH at which toxin is induced to translocate from the endosome to the cytosol has not been determined. Nevertheless, the pH of primary endosomes is in the range of 6.2–6.3, and the pH of later stage endosomes is even lower (21Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that there is a significant loss of Zn2+ at pH 6.0 suggests that, at least potentially, some endogenous cation could be lost during translocation. This could be caused by protonation of histidines, change in conformation, or both. As reported previously, pretreatment of toxin with a soluble chelator is not sufficient to cause the molecule to lose neuromuscular blocking activity (Ref. 8Simpson L.L. Coffield J.A. Bakry N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar; see above). Stripped toxin can regain Zn2+ from tissue stores and thus regain catalytic and neuromuscular blocking activity. A loss of activity is observed only if both toxin and tissue are pretreated with the chelator. Fig. 6 illustrates the results of an experiment in which native toxin and TPEN-pretreated toxin (10 µm) were added either to control tissues or to TPEN-pretreated tissues (10 µm). These data clearly show that native toxin and stripped toxin were comparable in their abilities to block neuromuscular transmission in control tissues (Aand B). They also show that neither native toxin nor stripped toxin blocked transmission when added to tissues incubated in TPEN (A and B). In a subsequent set of experiments, native toxin and stripped toxin were added to tissues pretreated with TPEN. After an elapsed time equivalent to that necessary for toxin to paralyze control tissues (i.e. Fig. 6 A), a molar excess of Zn2+ (20 µm) was added to preparations (C). It is noteworthy that (a) there was early onset of toxin action that eventually culminated in neuromuscular blockade, and (b) there was no significant difference between native toxin and stripped toxin in terms of rate of onset of blockade. The results in Fig. 6 C suggest that paralysis was caused by toxin that had already undergone productive internalization. To confirm this hypothesis, tissues were treated identically to that for tissues in C except that tissues were washed several times prior to the addition of Zn2+. Thus, there was no toxin left in solution for binding and later internalization. When tissues were washed free of extracellular toxin and then exposed to Zn2+, there was again a rapid onset of toxin action (D). Interestingly, there was no difference between tissues that were continuously exposed to toxin (C) and those that were washed to remove unbound toxin (D). The data presented above show that soluble, but not immobilized, chelators can strip Zn2+ from toxin. Stripped toxin has little ability to cleave substrate or to block neuromuscular transmission. However, toxin that regains Zn2+ from tissue stores or from external sources regains biological activity. The data in Fig. 6, and particularly those on control toxin added to TPEN-pretreated tissue, presents a special circumstance. The fact that native toxin is rendered inactive when added to tissues incubated in TPEN suggests that a soluble chelator can strip the toxin in less time than that needed for the toxin to enter the nerve and begin cleaving substrate. This premise was tested by examining the rate of TPEN-induced loss of Zn2+. Samples of toxin (1 × 10−7m) were stripped and reloaded with 65Zn as described above. This material was incubated with TPEN (2 × 10−5m) for varying lengths of time, after which zinc retention was measured. As shown in Fig.7, TPEN produced a significant loss of zinc within 20 min, and the loss continued to occur for at least 180 min. These data provide qualitative support for the premise that TPEN can strip Zn2+ during the brief interval when toxin is en route to its site of action. Indeed, the actual sequence of events in the tissue bath is likely to be even more dramatic than that suggested by Fig. 7. For the Zn2+ stripping experiment (e.g.Fig. 7) the ratio of chelator to toxin was ∼200 (2 × 10−5m TPEN; 1 × 10−7m toxin). For the neuromuscular blocking experiments, the ratio was 2,000,000 (2 × 10−5m TPEN; 1 × 10−11m toxin). Therefore, the actual rate of Zn2+ stripping while the toxin is en route to its site of action"

The enzymes involved in these events are known as the procollagen N and C proteinases.

However, the presence of putative BMP-1 cleavage sites in the α1(V) C-propeptide sequence prompted us to reconsider the procollagen V C-propeptide cleavage by BMP-1. Using a recombinant system to produce substantial amounts of the proα1(V) homotrimer, we have previously shown that the C-propeptide is spontaneously released in the culture medium. The trimeric C-propeptide fragment, resulting from the furin cleavage, still encompassed the predicted BMP-1 cleavage sites. It was purified and tested as a substrate for BMP-1. In parallel, the release of the C-propeptide in the culture medium was inhibited by the addition of a specific furin inhibitor, allowing the re-examination of BMP-1 activity on the intact molecule.

They are synthesized as larger precursors, procollagens, in which the central uninterrupted triple-helical domain (COL1) is flanked by non-collagenous domains (NC),1 the N- propeptide and the C-propeptide (also referred to as the NC1 domain) (1Kielty K. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinman B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). Both the C- and N-terminal extensions are processed extracellularly, an event that triggers the assembly of the mature protein into fibrils. Anomalies in processing of the propeptides can severely affect the aggregation of the molecules into fibrils leading to defective connective tissues (2Steinman B. Royce P.M. Superti-Furga A. Royce P.M. Steinman B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 351-407Google Scholar).Processing of procollagens I, II, and III results in an almost complete removal of both the N- and C-propeptides (3Prockop D.J. Sieron A.L. Li S.W. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The release of collagen V N-propeptide, however, appears to be partial, leaving a globular domain of functional importance. Indeed, collagens V and I co-aggregate to form heterotypic fibrils, and the N-terminal globule remaining on collagen V was suggested to serve as a steric regulator of the heterotypic fibril accretion (4Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Barbiaz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J.

However, unlike collagen I, collagen V is rare in tissues, and this has greatly hampered its purification and characterization as an intact molecule, resulting in a controversial determination of the exact cleavage site of the N-propeptide (5Linsenmayer T.F.

Concerning the collagen V C-propeptide, although little is known about its processing, its complete removal is generally agreed. Most of the studies on collagen V have dealt with the most abundant collagen V isoform, the heterotrimer [α1(V)]2α2(V) (9Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Two other stoichiometries, α1(V)α2(V)α3(V) and [α1(V)]3, have also been described, but other chain associations might exist since a novel α4(V) chain has recently been described (10Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K.

One should therefore consider the possibility that the processing patterns of the various collagen V collagen molecules may differ.Removal of the N- and C-propeptides from procollagens I, II, and III is catalyzed by specific Zn2+-dependent metalloendopeptidases, procollagen N- and C-proteinase, respectively (3Prockop D.J.

Cleavages by BMP-1 of all the known substrates have been shown to occur at peptide bonds with Asp at the P1′ position, in particular Ala-Asp or Gly-Asp, sequences known as the consensus procollagen C-proteinase cleavage sites in procollagens I-III (3Prockop D.J. Sieron A.L. Li S.W. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Ovens A. Joule J.A. Kadler K.E. J. Peptide Sci. 2000; 6: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). BMP-1 has also been reported to process the homotrimer of type V procollagen (24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage site, a Ser-Gln peptide bond, and its location within the N-propeptide domain, were both inconsistent with those predicted for C-proteinase cleavage.Recombinant type V homotrimer was produced successfully in 293-EBNA cells; however, its C-propeptide domain was rapidly cleaved and accumulated in the medium (25Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been reported that this cleavage was due to a furin-like activity (24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Considering the fact that two consensus C-proteinase cleavage sites do exist near the furin-like cleavage site (26Takahara K. Sato Y. Okazawa K. Okamoto N. Noda A. Yaoi Y. Kato I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility that an enzyme other than BMP-1 is responsible for physiological processing of the NC1 domain of procollagen V seemed puzzling. Moreover, the 293-EBNA cells are known to possess high furin-like activity. Thus, although processing of certain proteins in these cells appears to be physiological, as was shown for pro-fibrillin-1 (28Lönnqvist L. Reinhardt D. Sakai L. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), irrelevant cleavages have also been observed for collagen XVI (29Grässel S. Timpl R. Tan E.M.L. Chu M-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).To further investigate the role of BMP-1 in processing of the collagen V C-propeptide, in this study the trimeric NC1 fragment released by the furin-like activity (fur-Cpro) was isolated and tested as a substrate for BMP-1. Also, by adding a specific furin inhibitor, we were able to produce intact procollagen V homotrimer that served to re-examine BMP-1 action on the entire molecule. We found that BMP-1 can cleave one of the two predicted C-proteinase cleavage sites within both the isolated fur-Cpro fragment and the full-length procollagen V homotrimer. These results favor a role for procollagen C-proteinase/BMP-1 in physiological C-terminal processing of type V procollagen.DISCUSSIONBased on sequence similarities, structures of their cognate genes, and their low abundance, collagen V chains along with those of collagen type XI are classified as a subgroup of the fibrillar collagens known as the minor collagens. Within this group of collagens, the proα1(V), proα3(V), proα1(XI), and proα2(XI) chains are further distinguished by the characteristic structure of their N-propeptide domains, each containing a conserved N-terminal subdomain known as the PARP (proline/arginine-rich protein) domain, followed by a nonhomologous region referred to as the variable domain (26Takahara K.

There is evidence that the N-propeptides of the proα2(XI), proα1(V), and proα1(XI) chains are processed at a site just downstream of their PARP domain, and in some tissues, the released PARP domains may persist as intact molecules with potential functional importance (5Linsenmayer T.F.

Another unique property of this subgroup of procollagen chains is that, with the exclusion of proα2(V), all contain a furin cleavage sequence (RXRR) in regions corresponding to the C-propeptide cleavage sites (TableI), which potentially can be processed by furin-like proprotein convertases (35Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar).

In contrast to type I-III procollagens, the C-propeptide of the proα1(V) homotrimer was not cleaved by BMP-1. Instead, BMP-1 released the N-terminal PARP domain, whereas the C-propeptide appeared to be cleaved by a furin-like proprotein convertase. Although the latter activity could be explained by the presence of the furin cleavage sequence in the vicinity of the predicted procollagen C-proteinase processing site, the observations with BMP-1 were difficult to reconcile because (i) the peptide bond cleaved within the N-propeptide domain (Ser-Gln) and the sequence surrounding this bond differed from the consensus cleavage site for procollagen C-proteinase in the pro-α-chains of procollagens I-III (3Prockop D.J.

Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and all are cleaved at sites similar to the established procollagen C-proteinase cleavage site (Table I). In particular, all BMP-1 cleavage sites except the one identified within the N-propeptide of the proα1(V) homotrimer were found to contain an aspartic acid residue at the P1′ position, a feature that appears to be indispensable for BMP-1 action. The surrounding sequences, including those residues that occupy the P1 position of the scissile bond, however, show a considerable degree of variability.Similarly with probiglycan and chordin, the sequences of the two predicted BMP-1 cleavage sites in the proα1(V) chain (Table I) do not conform perfectly to the rules established for the corresponding sites in procollagens I-III. However, both contain at least one aspartic acid residue, and one of them contains an A-D bond, a typical BMP-1 cleavage site. In view of these similarities and the relative sequence variability demonstrated for other BMP-1 cleavage sites, we were intrigued by the reported (24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) resistance of the type V procollagen NC1 domain to BMP-1, which led us to re-examine the procollagen V homotrimer as a substrate for BMP-1.In addressing processing of the NC1 domain, we took advantage of the availability of the purified fur-Cpro fragment that was released spontaneously in the culture medium as a result of the furin-like activity and contained the two potential BMP-1 cleavage sites. The results with this fragment clearly indicated that BMP-1 cleaved the D-D peptide bond within the first putative BMP-1 cleavage site (Table I). Although this suggested that BMP-1 may be involved in physiological processing of procollagen V, additional experiments were required to demonstrate that such cleavage can also occur in the intact procollagen molecule. To produce the intact procollagen V homotrimer in cultured 293 cells, it was necessary to inhibit the endogenous furin-like activity. Toward this, we chose to add a specific irreversible furin inhibitor instead of arginine as was used by others (24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), because this compound is far more potent as a furin inhibitor, and thus, effective inhibition of the enzyme can be achieved at concentrations that are not harmful to the cells. This approach has been used previously to block furin-dependent processing of pro-MMP-2 in cultured human fibrosarcoma cells (36Maquoi E. Noël A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J-M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), in which system an almost complete inhibition of processing was achieved at an inhibitor concentration of 100 µm. Because of the large scale of our experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of lower amounts of this costly inhibitor, sufficient to slow down the spontaneous processing of the C-propeptide and allowing partial accumulation of intact procollagen to be tested as a substrate for BMP-1. With this substrate preparation, which contained a mixture of pro- and pNα1 chains as well as some free fur-Cpro, we found that in addition to the previously reported processing of the N-propeptide domain, BMP-1 also released the C-terminal propeptide domain, and this resulted from cleavage of the same Asp-Asp peptide bond as observed with the free fur-Cpro fragment. Since the N-terminal sequence of the free N-propeptide fragment generated in our hands as well as its size and electrophoretic properties were the same as those reported previously (24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we presume that this fragment resulted from the same cleavage. The demonstration that the release of the N-terminal fragment and that of the C-terminal propeptide were both inhibited by the zinc chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, provided supportive evidence that both reactions resulted from the action of BMP-1 itself. A time course study showed that cleavage of the N-propeptide occurred more rapidly than that of the C-propeptide. This, together with the small difference in migration of the fur-Cpro and bmp-Cpro bands, can explain why cleavage of the C-propeptide by BMP-1 was not observed previously (24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given the unusual location in the procollagen molecule and nature of the specific processing site within the N-propeptide domain, the rapid release of the N-propeptide fragment was surprising. Perhaps this region within the procollagen V molecule is fully exposed and, thus, more sensitive to proteolysis. The marked difference in the progress of the two reactions, however, may also reflect the importance of secondary interactions of the enzyme with its substrate.In addition to the immediate interactions of the enzyme active site with residues surrounding the cleavage site, the noncatalytic domains of BMP-1 may contribute to substrate recognition, thereby affecting the efficiency and specificity of cleavage. Indeed, in common with other family members, BMP-1 consists of a proteolytic (astacin-like) domain followed by a number of CUB (37Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor-like domains. Although detailed kinetic studies on BMP-1 processing of the various substrates are lacking, there is evidence that the noncatalytic domains of BMP-1 and its alternatively spliced variant, mTld, are important in this regard. Indeed a number of BMP-1 variants have been identified that are either products of alternative splicing from the Bmp1 gene (mTLD, BMP-1/His) (38Takahara K. Lyons G.E. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32572-32578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or products of different genes (mTll1, mTll2) (20Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Tomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 39Takahara K. Brevard R. Hoffman G.G. Suzuki N. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 34: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When BMP-1 and mTld activities are compared, mTld appears to cleave probiglycan less efficiently than BMP-1 (19Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and appears inactive on chordin (20Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G.

In addition, early determinations of the kinetic constants for processing of type I procollagen by BMP-1 and mTld (40Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Adar R. Kessler E. Goldberg B. Collagen Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that theK m value for processing by BMP-1 is about 20-fold less than that for mTld. Thus, the presence of two additional CUB domains in the latter procollagen C-proteinase variant has marked effects on substrate specificity. Consistently, these additional CUB domains do not bind to procollagen type I (42Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Khan M.T. Li S.W. Stöcker W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may interfere with enzyme-substrate recognition.Together, our observations and those made by Imamura et al.(24Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) suggest that BMP-1 may play a dual role in proteolytic maturation of procollagen V, namely, removal of the C-propeptide domain as well as cleavage of the N-terminal PARP domain of the proα1(V) chain. Clearly, detailed quantitative studies with BMP-1 as well as mTld and procollagen V molecules of other chain stoichiometries are required for better understanding the role(s) of BMP-1/mTld in proteolytic maturation of collagen V. The demonstration that BMP-1 can cleave the C-propeptide of the type V homotrimer does not exclude a role for furin-like proprotein convertases in this process. Alignment of the C-propeptide sequence of the known procollagen V chains indicates that most of these chains contain candidate BMP-1 cleavage sites as well as a conserved furin cleavage sequence at the end of their triple helical domain (Table I). However, two outstanding exceptions exist; one exception is that the human α3(V) chain does not present an obvious BMP-1 cleavage site, and second and more striking, the α2(V) chain does not contain the conserved furin cleavage sequence (Table I). It is thus conceivable that C-terminal processing of procollagen V chains may depend on both types of processing enzymes, tolloid- and furin-like proteases. This possibility offers an explanation for the complete C-terminal processing of the [α1(V)]2α2(V) heterotrimeric molecule, the most abundant molecular form of type V collagen found in tissues. The distribution of the different molecular forms of procollagen V among tissues is not uniform. Although the distribution of the [α1(V)]2α2(V) heterotrimer is relatively broad, the α1(V)α2(v)α3(V) form is found mainly in placenta, t"

The inhibition of termination at intrinsic and ρ-dependent terminators by N protein depends on recognition of an RNA element callednut 1 (N utilization) on the nascent phage transcript and on fourEscherichia coli host factors (NusA, NusB, NusG, and ribosomal protein NusE). Together they form a ribonucleoprotein complex that converts the RNA polymerase into a termination-resistant form upon binding (1Das A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 893-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Greenblatt J. Nodwell J.R. Mason S.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). N protein binds specifically with high affinity to phage λ boxB RNA, a 15-mer RNA hairpin containing a purine-rich pentaloop (3Franklin N.C. J. Mol.

Nun protein of phage HK022 is a transcription termination factor that acts, in contrast to other termination factors, highly template- and site-specific. Nun terminates transcription uniquely on phage λ templates (5Robert J. Sloan S.B. Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. Robledo R. Harbrecht D.

Like N protein, Nun requires additional host factors (NusA, NusB, NusE, and NusG) for efficient termination, whereas the presence of NusA alone inhibits the termination activity of Nun (7Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

For both these phage peptides, a very similar mode of binding has been observed, with the peptides bound in the major groove of boxB RNA, which adopts a typical hairpin conformation closed by an apical tetraloop. Unlabeled 15-nucleotide boxBRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase, a synthetic DNA template (GCCCTTTTTCAGGGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA; MWG-BioTech, Ebersberg, Germany), and unlabeled nucleotide triphosphates. The RNA was purified as described previously (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Freeze-dried boxB was resuspended in water, applied on a size exclusion column (NAP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for desalting, and freeze-dried again. Nun-(10–44) and Nun-(20–44) were purchased from Biosyntan (Berlin, Germany). 15N-labeled N-(1–36) peptide was expressed and purified as described previously (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 1:1 complexes between either Nun-(10–44), Nun-(20–44), or N-(1–36) and boxB were generated by addition of small volumes of concentrated (∼2 mm) peptide toboxB RNA (∼0.2 mm). To increase concentration for two-dimensional experiments, Nun-(10–44)-boxB RNA complex was freeze-dried and resuspended in 280 µl of H2O or D2O, and Nun-(20–44) was concentrated by centricon centrifugation to a final volume of 270 µl. The samples with a concentration of 3 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively, were transferred into Shigemi microtubes. All NMR experiments were recorded at 28 °C for the Nun-(10–44)-boxB RNA complex and at 30 °C for the Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA complex on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer equipped with1H/13C/15N probes and triple-axis pulsed field gradient capabilities. For resonance assignment correlated spectroscopy (COSY), total coherence spectroscopy (TOCSY), and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments were performed using standard techniques for recording and water suppression (13Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). For the Nun-(10–44)-boxB RNA complex, TOCSY experiments were recorded with 40 and 80 ms mixing time, and NOESY experiments were recorded with 80 and 200 ms mixing time, respectively. For the Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA complex, TOCSY experiments were recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms, and NOESY experiments were recorded with mixing time 150 and 300 ms.1H15N HSQC spectra were recorded with the fast HSQC pulse scheme (14Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. O'Neil-Johnson M. van Zijl P.C.M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). All NMR data were analyzed with the NDee (SpinUp Inc., Dortmund, Germany) and XWINNMR (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) program packages augmented with in-house-written routines. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. The chemical shifts of the 15N resonances were referenced indirectly using the15N/1H Ξ ratio of 0.10132905 of the zero-point frequency at 298 K (15Live D.H. Davis D.G. Agosta W.C. Cowburn D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 1939-1941Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional NOESY spectra of both Nun peptide-boxB RNA complexes. NOE intensities were estimated semi-quantitatively on the basis of cross-peak intensities from NOESY spectra collected with 80 ms mixing time. The categories “strong”, “medium”, and “weak” were converted into distance constraints with upper limit of 2.7, 3.5, and 5.0 Å for peptide intramolecular NOEs (16Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For peptide-RNA intermolecular NOEs, these categories were converted in distance constraints with upper limit of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively. NOEs that were only visible in the NOESY spectra of Nun-(10–44)-boxB RNA complex with 200 ms mixing time were classified as “very weak” with an upper bound of 6.0 Å (10Cai Z. Gorin A. Frederick R. Ye X. Hu W. Majumdar A. Kettani A. Patel D.J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To improve the convergence of the structure calculation, the lower bounds of all NOE restraints were set to 0 Å (17Varani G. Aboul-ela F. Allain F.H.-T. Prog. Nuc. Magn. Res. Spec. 1996; 29: 51-127Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Experimental data clearly indicate that the boxB RNA in the Nun-(10–44) complex is virtually identical to the boxB RNA in the N-(1–36) complex. We thus used the structure of the boxB RNA in the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex that we determined earlier (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1qfq) as a fixed template for all molecular dynamics calculations. All structure calculations were performed using a modified ab initio simulated annealing protocol with an extended version of X-PLOR 3.851 (18Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3,851. onlina. Howard Medical School & Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). The calculation strategy, which was described in detail previously (19Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), included floating assignment of prochiral groups (20Holak T.A. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a conformational data base potential term (21Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein. Sci. 1996; 5: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and a reduced presentation for non-bonded interactions for part of the calculation (19Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The conformational search phase (60 ps of molecular dynamics at 2000 K) was followed by cooling from 2000 K to 1000 K within 40 ps, concomitantly increasing the force constants for the non-bonded interactions and the angle energy constant for the diastereospecifically unassigned groups to their final values. In the next stage of the calculation, the system was cooled from 1000 K to 100 K within 30 ps, applying the high force constants obtained at the end of the previous cooling stage. To detect the energy minimum, 1200 steps of energy minimization were performed, the final 1000 steps without conformational data base potential. In the final round, 100 structures were calculated, and the 20 structures that showed the lowest energy and the least number of violations of the experimental data were selected for further characterization. For geometrical analysis and investigation of secondary structure and structural parameters the PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Wright P.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and NUCPLOT (23Luscombe N.M. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4940-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) programs were used. Quick visualization and graphical presentation of the structures were performed with the programs RasMol V2.6 (24Sayle R. RasMol V 2.6. Molecular Visualisation Program. Glaxo Wellcome Research and Development, Stevevage, Hertfordshire, U. K.1995Google Scholar) and SYBYL 6.5 (Tripos Ass.) (25SYBYL, Version 6.5, Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO.Google Scholar), respectively. The coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 1HJI). We have monitored complex formation between the Nun-(10–44) peptide and the 15 nucleotideboxB RNA by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. FreeboxB RNA shows three imino proton resonances for G12, G13, and G14. Upon addition of Nun-(10–44) changes in chemical shifts of these resonances were observed, and two additional resonances for the imino protons of U5 and G6 were detected (Fig.1). The pattern of resonances is identical to that observed for boxB RNA in complex with N peptides (11Legault P. Li J. Mogridge J. Kay L.E. Greenblatt J.

Spectra of P22 boxB RNA in complex with a P22 N peptide also exhibit an identical pattern of imino proton resonances (10Cai Z. Gorin A. Frederick R. Ye X. Hu W. Majumdar A. Kettani A. Patel D.J.

Structure comparison shows that λ and P22 boxB RNA are very similar in complex with their respective N peptides, with one base looped out of the apical pentaloop, allowing formation of a typical GNRA tetraloop structure (10Cai Z. Gorin A. Frederick R. Ye X. Hu W. Majumdar A. Kettani A. Patel D.J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Legault P. Li J. Mogridge J. Kay L.E.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The indole NH resonance of the only Trp residue of N-(1–36), Trp-18, is shifted upfield by more than 1.0 ppm (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in presence of boxB RNA due to its stacking with the aromatic ring of A7, whereas the indole NH resonance of the single Trp residue of Nun-(10–44), Trp-33, is shifted upfield by only 0.2 ppm uponboxB RNA complex formation. The comparatively small change in chemical shift for Trp-33 in Nun-(10–44) may be attributed to conformational changes within the peptide upon RNA binding and already suggests that Trp-33 does not stack with A7 of boxB RNA. In the spectral range above 9 ppm another new signal is observed, originating from Ser-24 NH. For the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA and the P22 N-boxB RNA complex a corresponding signal is observed originating from Ala-3 (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Ala-2 (10Cai Z. Gorin A. Frederick R. Ye X. Hu W. Majumdar A. Kettani A. Patel D.J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), respectively. To compare binding affinities of Nun-(10–44) and N-(1–36) to boxB RNA we prepared samples containingboxB RNA and equal amounts of Nun-(10–44) and N-(1–36). One-dimensional NMR spectra showed two sets of imino proton resonances with similar intensities, one corresponding to the Nun-(10–44)-boundboxB RNA and the other corresponding to the N-(1–36)-boundboxB RNA (Fig.2a). HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled N-(1–36) in complex with unlabeled boxB RNA shows a well resolved spectrum (Fig.2 b). After addition of an equimolar amount of unlabeled Nun-(10–44) to the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex several new resonances originating from unbound N-(1–36) appear in the spectrum (Fig. 2 c), and the resonances of the boxB-bound N-(1–36) are reduced to less than 50% of their original intensities. In addition to those resonances from unbound, unstructured N-(1–36), additional resonances that may correspond to a partially structured, but unbound N-(1–36) could be observed. The indole imino proton of Trp-18, for example, shows three resonances: one resonance at 9.2 ppm as observed in the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex and two resonances around 10.2 ppm, one of which corresponds to the random coil peptide (Fig. 2 c). As both bound and unbound N-(1–36) are observed regardless whether Nun-(10–44) is added to the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex or vice versa and as both complexes can be distinguished as N-(1–36) was 15N labeled, we can safely conclude that N-(1–36) and Nun-(10–44) bind toboxB RNA with approximately the same affinity and are able to compete with each other. To obtain further information about the three-dimensional structure of the Nun-(10–44) complex, we recorded homonuclear two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra of the Nun-(10–44)-boxB RNA complex and the Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA complex, respectively. The spectra of both complexes for RNA and the peptide sequence from Leu-22 to Asn-43 were highly similar. Sequence-specific backbone assignments for Nun-(10–44)-boxB RNA complex as well as Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA complex could be performed completely. In two-dimensional spectra all H6/H8, H1′, pyrimidine H5, and cytosine amino protons could be assigned. Pyrimidine H5 and H6 were identified in two-dimensional COSY-spectra, cytidine amino protons could be assigned by intraresidual NOEs to their own H5, and purine H8 and all H1′ were assigned by comparison with spectra of boxB RNA in complex with λ N-(1–36). In this way, putative assignments were also possible for some isolated ribose resonances in the loop region, which show characteristic upfield (A7) or downfield (A9) shifts. Adenine H2 could be assigned for A7 and A9, and A11H2 could be identified by the strong NOE to U5H3 (Fig. 3). NOEs indicating formation of Watson-Crick base pairs were observed for C2:G14, C3:G13, C4:G12, and U5:A11. Comparison of the Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA and the λ N-(1–36)-boxBRNA NOESY spectra in the region of the imino protons show that the imino protons in Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA are shifted downfield by about 0.05–0.2 ppm, whereas for all non-exchangeable protons no systematic change of the chemical shifts between the spectra could be observed (Fig. 3). Both spectra show an identical pattern of resonances suggesting virtually identical folds in the stem region. The connectivities between the ribose and their own as well as their sequentially neighboring base were obtained from H1′i-H6/H8i and H1′i-H6/H8i+1-NOEs (26Varani G. Tinoco Jr., I. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1991; 24: 479-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As in the spectra of λ N-(1–36)-boxB RNA, no H1′i-H6/H8i+1-NOE could be observed between A8 and A9. This and unusual downfield shifts of the resonances of A9 in the boxB-RNA complexes of both peptides suggest that A9 is looped out the Nun-(10–44) complex in a fashion virtually identical to that observed in the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex. Spatial vicinity of A8 and A10 as in λ N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex is possible, but the corresponding NOEs could not be assigned unambiguously due to frequency degeneration. Finally, extreme upfield shifts of U5H5 and A7H1′ resonances that were also observed in the λ N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex lead to the conclusion thatboxB RNA adopts a highly similar structure in complex with either Nun-(20–44) or λ N-(1–36). For Nun-(10–44) strong TOCSY and relatively weak NOESY signals were observed for the first 10 residues in the complex, suggesting that this region is flexible and is not involved in RNA binding. Nun-(10–44) and Nun-(20–44) showed identical chemical shifts for the overlapping peptide. Thus, all further experiments were performed using Nun-(20–44). For the Nun-(20–44) peptide-boxB RNA complex the sequence-specific resonance assignments could be performed by standard two-dimensional NMR methods (27Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). NOESY cross-peaks in the backbone amide-amide region indicated the presence of helical structures for a large part of the RNA bound peptide. Unambiguous assignments of the amino acid side chain protons could be performed for all amino acids except Arg-25, Arg-27, Arg-29, Arg-32, Arg-36, and Lys-35 due to frequency degeneration and missing COSY-cross-peaks in the CαH region. Some arginine CβH could be assigned using the helix-typicald αβ(i, i + 3) cross-peaks. The analysis of the CαH chemical shift index (28Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar) gave first evidence for a helical structure from Ser-24 to Asn-43. For this region, helix-typical (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) NOEs could be observed throughout the sequence (Fig.4), in agreement with the observation of only very weak cross-peaks in the TOCSY-spectra for Leu-22 and subsequent residues, probably due to very small3JHNα coupling constants. To resolve ambiguities in NOE assignments, an iterative procedure for structure calculation was performed. Initially, only those NOEs that could be assigned unambiguously were used for molecular dynamics calculations. By verification of the resulting structures additional NOEs could be assigned, for example NOEs from the Trp-33 aromatic side chain (Fig.5) to either Ile-30 or Ile-37. 30 intermolecular NOEs could be identified unambiguously in the NOESY spectra. For the β-protons of Ser-24 the same NOEs with C2 and C3 are observed as for the β-protons of Ala-3 in the N-(1–36)-boxB complex. The aromatic protons of Tyr-39 show the same NOEs with A7 as observed for the aromatic protons of Trp-18 in the N-(1–36)-boxB complex (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further, NOEs between C4H5, U5H5, and side chain protons of Arg-28 which correspond to C4-Arg-7 NOEs in the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex could be assigned (Fig. 5). The final structure was calculated based on a total number of 191 intra- and 30 intermolecular distance restraints. A subset of 20 structures with energies lower than 182 kcal·mol−1 out of 120 structures was selected for further analysis.

Experimental restraints and simulated annealing statistics are summarized. r.m.s.d. values are averages over a family of 20 converged structures. Values inparenthesis indicate the standard deviation from this mean. The backbone of the peptide bound to boxB RNA is well defined for residues 22–43, with a backbone root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.52 Å. Residues 20, 21, and 44 remain disordered so that inclusion of these residues in the r.m.s.d. calculation increases the backbone r.m.s.d. to 0.94 Å. COOH-terminal residues and residues forming the hydrophobic surface show the lowest r.m.s.d./residue (Fig. 6) (<0.5 Å) indicating that the structure is very well defined in these regions. PROCHECK analysis of Nun-(20–44) in complex withboxB RNA shows that in the 20 accepted structures 95.9% of the residues are found in the most favored regions, 3.9% in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The Nun peptide forms an α-helix for residues 24–43, which is bent at residues Ala-31 and Arg-32. Bending does not require deviations from ideal helix Φ/Ψ angles. The COOH terminus of the peptide is well defined by contacts between Asn-43 and Tyr-39, reflected by several NOEs between side chain protons of both amino acids (Figs. 5 and 7). In the complex, Tyr-39 stacks tightly on A7 anchoring Nun-(20–44) to the RNA, and the γ-amino group of Asn-43 packs on the aromatic ring of Tyr-39 (Fig.7 a). The same structural characteristics are exhibited in the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex by A7, Trp-18, and Asn-22 (12Schärpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal residues occupy a well defined position close to C3, reflected by the intermolecular NOEs observed between the bases of both C2 and C3 and Ser-24. Arg28 is in close contact to the bases of C4 and U5, which is shown by several NOEs. According to the NUCPLOT analysis of the 20 converging structures, additional residues critical for the RNA recognition are Arg-27, Arg-32, Arg-36, and Lys-35, which are involved, as well as Arg-28, in numerous electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts (Fig.8) with the phosphate backbone and the sugar moieties. In several structures, hydrophobic contacts between the looped out base of A9 and Arg-36 are observed. Arg-36 occupies the position of Gln-15 in λ N contacting the bases of A7 and A8 in the N-(1–36)-boxB RNA complex. The most distinguishing feature of the Nun-(20–44)-boxB RNA structure is the formation of a hydrophobic, solvent-exposed surface. The wheel representation of the Nun-(20–44) helix in theboxB RNA complex clearly indicates that this helix is amphipathic, and all hydrophobic residues with large side chains are exposed to one side. Corresponding residues of N-(1–36) are either charged or alanines (Fig. 9). Various NOEs have been assigned between Trp33 aromatic side chain protons and aliphatic protons of Ile-30 and Ile-37. In the D2O-NOESY spectra, an NOE between methyl protons of Leu-41 and Ile-37 could be observed. Additionally, the Leu-22 side chain is in spatial vicinity to Ile-30 and also contributes to the hydrophobic surface (Fig. 7 b). All these residues are well defined in the structure calculations as shown in the overlay of 20 structures with the lowest overall energy (Fig. 7 c). The network of hydrophobic residues forms a clear cut ridge (Fig. 7 d) suggesting that the N-boxB- and the Nun-boxB-RNA complexes are recognized by different mechanisms by the target host cell factors. It has been shown that NusA binds to the COOH-terminal region of Nun and that NusA alone without the other Nus factors inactivates Nun function as a terminator (7Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NusA binding to boxB RNA can be nearly abolished by mutation of looped out nucleotide A9 (29Mogridge J. Mah T-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Together with N protein, NusA strongly enhances antitermination, which is also strongly reduced in vivo by mutations of A9 (30Chattopadhyay S. Garcia-Mena J. DeVito J. Wolska K. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4061-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) implying that A9 plays a crucial role in antitermination. The current work thus may serve as a basis for the design of specific peptide and RNA mutants aimed at a better understanding of the crucial termination/antitermination regulation of the viral replication on a structural level.

TSP1 can both promote and inhibit cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation. TSP1 also contains sequences that can both activate latent transforming growth factor-β1 and inhibit its activation (3Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D.

In various animal models, TSP1 expression has been both positively and negatively correlated with tumor growth and angiogenesis (4Zabrenetzky V. Harris C.C. Steeg P.S. Roberts D.D. Int. J.

Some of these disparities in the cellular responses to TSP1 may arise from the presence of several functional sites on TSP1, which, when coupled with differences in the expression or activation state of the corresponding cell surface receptors between cell types, could result in opposing responses to this protein in different cell types. Yet, a growing list of examples are known in which a single cell type can respond to TSP1 as both an activator and an inhibitor of a specific response (11Guo N. Templeton N.S. Al-Barazi H. Cashel J.A. Sipes J.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar, 12Taraboletti G. Roberts D. Liotta L.A. Giavazzi R. J.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional mechanisms must exist either to regulate cellular responsiveness to TSP1 or specific ligand binding activities of TSP1 itself. The latter mechanism for regulating TSP1 activity is consistent with several previous reports that soluble TSP1 has activities distinct from immobilized TSP1. Soluble TSP1 generally inhibits angiogenic responses (14Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le B.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but immobilized TSP1 can stimulate angiogenic responses in several contexts (13Chandrasekaran L. He C.-Z. Al-Barazi H.O.

Such distinct responses could arise from differences in TSP1 receptor signaling because of the increased valency of immobilized versus soluble TSP1 or from alterations in signal transduction resulting from physical immobilization of a specific TSP1 receptor. Both of these models have ample precedent from investigation of other cell-matrix interactions (reviewed in Refs. 18Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholarand 19Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). However, a third possibility is suggested by conformational studies of TSP1. Based on electron microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, the conformation of TSP1 is modulated by calcium binding (20Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol.

Characterization of the epitopes recognized by several monoclonal antibodies to TSP1 has identified calcium-dependent epitopes on the molecule (21Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TSP1 exists in at least two major conformational states, one of which is induced by calcium binding. Remarkably, some antibodies that recognize only the calcium-free state in vitro readily bind to TSP1 in a calcium-rich environment in some tissues (23Buee L. Hof P.R. Roberts D.D. Delacourte A. Morrison J.H. Fillit H.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shi S.R. Cote R.J. Hawes D. Thu S. Shi Y. Young L.L. Taylor C.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding to some TSP1 receptors may induce conformational changes that resemble those induced by removing calcium, and both states may exist in vivo. Other extracellular matrix components may regulate the conformation of TSP1. A recent study of protease sensitivity suggested that binding of TSP1 to fibronectin reversibly alters its conformation to resemble the calcium-depleted state (25Dardik R. Lahav J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to the reversible conformational changes induced by binding of calcium or specific TSP1 ligands, TSP1 is a substrate for protein-disulfide isomerase (26Hotchkiss K.A. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9761-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Huang E.M. Detwiler T.C. Milev Y. Essex D.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several disulfide isomer forms of TSP1 have been described and can also be differentiated by specific TSP1 antibodies (26Hotchkiss K.A. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9761-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Matthias L.J. Gotis-Graham I. Underwood P.A. McNeil H.P. Hogg P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These may also have different functional activities relating to inactivation of specific proteases or binding to the integrin αvβ3 (29Hotchkiss K.A. Matthias L.J. Hogg P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, TSP1 can exist in multiple conformational states, some of which can interconvert reversibly, whereas others are restricted by covalent disulfide bonds. While characterizing a new conformation-specific antibody for TSP1, we found that the TSP1 conformer recognized by this antibody is specifically induced following binding of TSP1 to the surface of some cells. We subsequently found that this conformation is induced by binding to fibronectin in vitro or by association with cell surface-associated fibronectin on cells. We further report that the conformation induced by binding of this antibody and fibronectin enhance the recognition of TSP1 by one of its cell surface receptors, α3β1 integrin. This reversible conformational change therefore modulates the ability of TSP1 to differentially engage specific cell surface TSP1 receptors and to thereby trigger specific biological responses.

A2058 melanoma cells were harvested using PBS containing 2.5 mm EDTA, centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm, and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/50 µl in complete cell medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum) with or without fibronectin or fibrinogen. The cell suspensions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with rocking and then re-centrifuged and resuspended in the appropriate cell binding buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS, pH 6, with the indicated divalent cations). A 50-µl volume of the cell suspension was then incubated with 125I-F18 alone or with 5 µg/ml of TSP1 and the indicated inhibitors, where indicated, in a final volume of 200 µl for 3 h with orbital mixing. The suspension was then transferred to a tube containing 100 µl of Nyosil oil (William F. Nye, Inc., New Bedford, MA), centrifuged, and washed with cell binding buffer. The pellet was collected, and the bound radioactivity was quantified with a gamma counter. To examine the role of cytoskeleton in induction of the F18 epitope, melanoma cells were harvested with 2.5 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended at 1×107 cells/ml in complete medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum). Cell suspensions (200 µl) were combined with 50 µl of 0.5 mg/ml fibronectin or 50 µl of Dulbecco's PBS, plus 1.25 µl of Me2SO, cytochalasin D (final 1 µm), or nocodazole (10 µm) dissolved in the same volume of Me2SO and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer. A 50-µl volume of each cell suspension was incubated with 125I-F18 (6.2 µCi/µg) alone or with 5 µg/ml TSP1 and 10 µg/ml fibronectin in a final volume of 250 µl for 1 h with orbital mixing at 4 °C. F18 is secreted by a hybridoma derived from a mouse immunized with activated human platelets. The binding sites on platelets for the antibody were increased 10-fold following activation with thrombin and induction of binding-required divalent cations (Table I). Fab fragments were used for these studies to preclude interactions with Fc receptors on the platelets, but a similar induction of binding was observed using the intact antibody (data not shown). Calcium was more active than magnesium for inducing the F18 epitope, and a combination of both cations was somewhat less effective than calcium alone. The antibody bound to purified platelet TSP1 (Fig. 1) formed a stable complex with TSP1 by gel filtration and specifically immunoprecipitated TSP1 from surface-labeled activated platelets (data not shown).Table IBinding of TSP1 antibody F18 to plateletsConditionsBinding sites/cellK dmExperiment 1Platelets + 5 mm EGTA2,7004.4 × 10−9+ 5 mm EGTA + thrombin6,2001.4 × 10−8+Ca2+ + thrombin26,8002.4 × 10−8Experiment 2Platelets + thrombin + 5 mm EGTA2,4005.8 × 10−9+ thrombin + 2 mmMg2+10,0001.8 × 10−8+ thrombin + 2 mm Ca2+15,5002.7 × 10−8+ thrombin + 2 mm Ca2+ + 2 mmMg2+7,2001.3 × 10−8Platelets purified on an arabinogalactan gradient (adjusted to 200,000/mm3) were treated as indicated and incubated with 0.4 to 200 nm125I-labeled F18 Fab fragment in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Where indicated, the platelets (400 µl) were treated with 0.1 units/ml thrombin for 5 min followed by the addition of 0.2 units/ml hirudin before adding the labeled antibody.

Where indicated, the platelets (400 µl) were treated with 0.1 units/ml thrombin for 5 min followed by the addition of 0.2 units/ml hirudin before adding the labeled antibody. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled F18. Equilibrium binding parameters are presented for two representative experiments. The divalent cation dependence for binding to platelets could indicate either that the antibody recognizes an epitope specific to a calcium-replete conformation of TSP1 or that the TSP1 receptor mediating its binding to platelets is calcium-dependent. Based on solid phase binding assays, however, F18 bound to TSP1 immobilized on plastic independent of divalent cations (Fig.1 A). In a reverse assay, soluble TSP1 bound preferentially to immobilized F18 when calcium was absent (Fig. 1 B). This divalent cation dependence is similar to that of the previously reported TSP1 antibody A6.1 (21Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the two antibodies did not cross-compete for binding to TSP1 (data not shown). Therefore, this antibody defines a distinct calcium-dependent epitope on TSP1 that is preferentially exposed when calcium is removed, but this divalent cation dependence could not account for the inverse calcium-dependence for F18 binding to activated platelets. The above data suggested that binding of TSP1, either to a cell surface TSP1 receptor or to another TSP1 ligand bound to its respective cell surface receptor, induces a TSP1 conformational epitope that is recognized by F18. Preliminary studies using the blocking antibody OKM5 excluded a role for the platelet TSP1 receptor CD36 (11 ± 15% inhibition of 125I-F18 Fab binding for six experiments at 20 µg/ml antibody). Of the platelet receptor antibodies examined, only the αIIbβ3integrin antibody 10E5 reproducibly reduced activation-dependent binding of F18 to platelets (35 ± 7% inhibition for six independent experiments). The TSP1 antibody C6.7, which blocks platelet aggregation and TSP1 binding to the platelet TSP1 receptor CD47 (44Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), also did not significantly inhibit binding of F18 Fab to activated platelets (22% at 20 µg/ml). To examine the ability of other known TSP1 ligands to induce this epitope, we immobilized several TSP1 ligands on plastic and examined the ability of labeled F18 to recognize TSP1 bound to each (Fig.2A). Of those tested, only immobilized fibronectin enhanced F18 binding to TSP1 (Fig.2 A). Fibrinogen also binds to TSP1 (45Lahav J. Lawler J. Gimbrone M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but binding to a fibrinogen substrate did not induce the F18 epitope (Fig.2 A). Type I collagen was also inactive (results not shown). Enhancement by fibronectin was specific for the F18 antibody in that the TSP1 antibody A6.1 exhibited similar reactivities for TSP1 bound to immobilized fibronectin, fibrinogen, or type I collagen substrates (Fig. 2 B). The latter result confirmed that similar amounts of TSP1 bound to each immobilized protein and that the increased binding of F18 to TSP1 bound to fibronectin was not an artifact of an increased TSP1 binding capacity on fibronectin compared with fibrinogen. The response for immobilized plasma fibronectin was dose-dependent, and cellular fibronectins from two sources produced similar enhancements of F18 binding to the TSP1-fibronectin complex (Fig. 2 C). Although some binding of F18 could be detected to TSP1 complexed with high concentrations of immobilized heparin-BSA (results not shown), when heparin and fibronectin concentrations that supported comparable levels of TSP1 binding were compared, as verified by quantifying direct 125I-TSP1 binding and binding of two other TSP1 antibodies, antibody F18 demonstrated enhanced binding to TSP1 complexed with fibronectin but much weaker binding to TSP1 complexed with heparin-BSA (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, binding to fibronectin specifically induces the F18 epitope on TSP1. If the enhancement of antibody F18 binding induced by fibronectin resulted from a conformational change in TSP1, then binding of these two ligands to TSP1 may be thermodynamically linked. To test this hypothesis, we compared the binding of radiolabeled fibronectin to TSP1 and to TSP1 complexed with F18 (Fig. 3). Fibronectin binding was ∼3-fold higher to the immobilized TSP1-F18 complex than to immobilized TSP1 itself. This enhancement was specific, because immobilized F18 alone had no binding activity for fibronectin and complexing TSP1 with a control TSP1 antibody, ah-TSP1, did not enhance fibronectin binding relative to immobilized TSP1 without antibodies (Fig. 3). Based on the dose-dependence for binding of125I-fibronectin to immobilized TSP1 alone or complexed to F18, we determined that F18 increased the number of binding sites for fibronectin (10 versus 22 pmol/well, respectively) but did not significantly alter the apparent affinity of fibronectin for immobilized TSP1. F18 bound at low levels to a suspension of A2058 melanoma cells, but its binding was reproducibly and dose-dependently enhanced by adding exogenous TSP1 (Fig.4A). In contrast, binding of labeled TSP1 to the same cells was not significantly induced by the addition of F18 (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates either that these two TSP1 binding interactions are not thermodynamically linked or that TSP1 bound to its major binding site on these cells is not recognized by the F18 antibody. Because high affinity binding of TSP1 to A2058 cells was previously shown to be mediated by the heparin-binding domain of TSP1 (37Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), this result also suggests that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are not the TSP1 recepto"

Its known interactions with the checkpoint proteins Mec3p and Ddc1p in a PCNA-like complex indicate a sensor role in damage recognition. In a novel application of the yeast two-hybrid system and by immunoprecipitation, we show here that Rad17p is capable of increased self-interaction following DNA damage introduced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, camptothecin or partial inactivation of DNA ligase I. Despite overlap of regions required for Rad17p interactions with Rad17p or Mec3p, single amino acid substitutions revealed that Rad17p·Rad17p complex formation is independent of Mec3p. E128K (rad17-1) was found to inhibit Rad17p interaction with Mec3p but not with Rad17p. On the other hand, Phe-121 is essential for Rad17p self-interaction, and its function in checkpoint arrest but not for Mec3p interaction. These differential effects indicate that Rad17p-Rad17p interaction plays a role that is independent of the Rad17p·Mec3p·Ddc1p complex, although our results are also compatible with Rad17p-mediated supercomplex formation of the Rad17p·Mec3p·Ddc1p heterotrimer in response to DNA damage.

In certain stress situations provoked by DNA damage, inhibition of replication or incorrect formation of the mitotic spindle, reversible arrest at checkpoints can provide a critical time window in which to remedy a condition that would otherwise result in irreversible cellular damage. Unless these cells are inviable or actively eliminated (e.g.by apoptosis), such damage may manifest itself as genetic change. Therefore, checkpoint mechanisms are critically important for preserving genetic stability. Inactivation of checkpoint controls can facilitate the multistep process of malignant transformation, and consequently, mutations in checkpoint genes have frequently been found to be associated with human cancer-prone syndromes and sporadic cancer (3Lengauer C.

It became clear that the identity of the targeted components of the cell cycle machinery may depend on the species-specific features of cell cycle organization. For instance, DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation elicits a G2 arrest in S. pombe and mammalian cells, primarily by preventing the dephosphorylation of a tyrosine residue of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1p (Cdc2p) (7O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, however, where budding and formation of the mitotic spindle is already completed in S-phase, and no G2-phase can be discerned, a similar checkpoint pathway triggers arrest at the metaphase/anaphase transition by targeting Pds1p, an inhibitor of sister chromatid separation (11Sanchez Y.

However, the available data strongly indicate that the damage-sensing mechanism(s) that initiate the arrest signal are evolutionary well conserved. The molecular nature of the recognized lesion(s) is still not entirely clear. Studies in yeast, human cells, andXenopus extracts have demonstrated convincingly that double strand breaks or stretches of single-stranded DNA can be efficient triggers (14Huang L.-C. Clarkin K.C.

Whereas such structures can be the consequence of exposure to ionizing radiation and certain chemicals, the checkpoint signal following UV irradiation, with dipyrimidine lesions as the most prominent damage, remains to be explained. For UV-induced G1 arrest prior to replicon initiation, a critical role for nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 has been demonstrated (18Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 19Neecke H. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4485-4497Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could be interpreted as a dependence of the arrest signal on the presence of intact NER proteins themselves or on a certain NER-mediated DNA repair intermediate. Among the checkpoint proteins, several sensor candidates have been identified based on structure predictions, protein interactions, and their role in damage-induced phosphorylation of further downstream acting “transducer” proteins. The same sensors not only trigger cell cycle arrest but also, through largely overlapping pathways, other regulatory responses connected with DNA repair.

The following discussion will focus on candidate sensor proteins functioning outside of S-phase where damage-sensing appears to occur by structure-recognition mechanisms that function largely independent of particular cell cycle events. In budding yeast, it is clear that in S-phase, many of these sensors are substituted by components of the replicative machinery, such as polymerase ε (21Navas T.A. Sanchez Y. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2632-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). An example of a conserved damage-recognition protein is represented byS. cerevisiae Rad17p and its various homologues in lower and higher eukaryotes, e.g. Rec1p in Ustilago maydis, Rad1p in S. pombe, hRad1p in humans (16Lydall D.

In the following, we will refer to the S. cerevisiae proteins unless a species designation is given.) The phenotype of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants defective in the homologous protein revealed other areas besides checkpoint arrest that may be affected by such a protein in multicellular eukaryotes: ionizing-radiation-induced apoptosis and expression of telomerase in germ cells (37Ahmed S.

Rad17p shares structural similarities with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), forming homotrimeric ring structures around DNA and commonly referred to as a “sliding clamp” that tethers replicative polymerases onto their template (40Thelen M.P. Venclovas C. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rad17p forms a stable three-way complex with two additional checkpoint proteins resembling PCNA: Ddc1p and Mec3p (41Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 42Paciotti V. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4199-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Complexes of similar structure have been identified in S. pombe (43Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44Caspari T.

Molecular modeling suggests indeed the formation of a PCNA-like ring complex by Rad17p, Ddc1p, and Mec3p (36Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,40Thelen M.P. Venclovas C. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but direct evidence for such a structure is missing. Interestingly, 3′→5′ exonuclease activity seems to be associated with this complex. Purified Rec1p (the U. maydis Rad17p homologue) has such activity (38Thelen M.P. Onel K. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 747-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas contradicting results have been reported for the human protein (32Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I. Yon J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18332-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Freire R. Murguı́a J.R. Tarsounas M. Lowndes N.F. Moens P.B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2560-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, such activity was also demonstrated for the human Ddc1p homologue (48Bessho T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The significance of these findings remains unclear. An exonuclease may be required to convert DNA damage such as double strand breaks, single strand breaks, and gaps into a recognized arrest-triggering substrate or to facilitate a yet to be defined repair function of the Rad17p complex. S. cerevisiae Rad24p is another potential sensor protein required for damage-induced cell cycle arrest that may interact with the Rad17p·Ddc1p·Mec3p complex. Rad24p forms a stable complex with four of five subunits of replication factor C (Rfc2p-Rfc5p) (49Naiki T. Shimomura T. Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 50Shimomura T. Ando S. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because replication factor C recognizes primer-template structures and functions as a “clamp-loader” to recruit PCNA, it is tempting to speculate about a similar relationship between the Rad24p·Rfc complex and the PCNA-like Rad17p·Ddc1p·Mec3p heterotrimer (9Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). There are indeed indications for physical interaction of S. pombeand human Rad17p and Rad24p protein homologues (44Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 52Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Rad24p-containing complex might function as the initial damage sensor by binding to a double-stranded/single-stranded DNA junction, recruit the Rad17p sliding clamp complex and somehow create a platform that enables cross-talk with and activation of downstream-acting kinases such as Rad53p. With respect to Rad53p kinase activation and subsequent transcriptional regulation following UV irradiation, Rad17p and Rad24p have indeed been placed in the same epistasis group, separate from Rad9p (24de la Torre-Ruiz M.-A. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2687-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), yet another potential sensor protein of unknown function interacting with Rad53p (53Emili A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 54Sun Z.X. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 218: 272-274Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The last candidate for a damage sensor among the budding yeast checkpoint proteins is Mec1p, a protein kinase with similarity to phosphoinositol kinases, that represents the yeast homologue of the ATR protein (for ATM and rad related) (55Zakian V.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 685-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, it is related to the protein mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (ATM), a human cancer prone syndrome, characterized at the cellular level by multiple checkpoint defects and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (56Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 2000; 18: 6135-6144Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar,57Meyn M.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5991-6001PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the involvement of Mec1p in arrest and transcriptional signaling in all cell cycle stages in response to various types of DNA damage and to inhibition of replication (58Siede W. Allen J.B. Elledge S.J. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5841-5843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), a function as a universal signal transducer was initially assumed. However, more recent data hint at a role more proximal to the damage recognition step. First, phosphorylation of assumed sensor proteins such as Ddc1p or Rad9p, which occurs rapidly after DNA damage is largely dependent on Mec1p (42Paciotti V. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4199-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 53Emili A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Second, phosphorylation of S. pombecheckpoint protein Rad26p in response to DNA damage has been found to be only dependent on the S. pombe Mec1p homologue Rad3p but not on any other checkpoint protein, thus placing Rad3p at the very beginning of the signal transduction pathway (60Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In support of its potential role as a damage sensor, the Xenopus homologue was found to partition to the DNA fraction following external addition of broken DNA to extracts (61Costanzo V. Robertson K. Ying C.Y. Kim E. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M. Grieco D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In summary, the basic mechanisms of DNA damage recognition during the course of checkpoint arrest and the molecular organization of the sensor proteins involved are far from clear and many scenarios can be envisioned. For instance, several separate damage-sensing complexes may exist that detect different types or structural aspects of DNA damage with different affinity. To explain the high sensitivity and specificity of the system, a re-inforcing cross-talk between sensors as the precondition for the origination of a transducible signal may be assumed. In the present study, we attempted to identify novel protein-protein interactions of S. cerevisiae Rad17p that may be enabled or increased in response to DNA damage. Using a novel application of the yeast two-hybrid system, we found an elevated level of self-interaction of Rad17p following checkpoint activation by inhibition of DNA ligase or upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents such as 4-NQO or camptothecin. Although a similar region of Rad17p is critical for both Rad17p-Rad17p and Rad17p-Mec3p interactions, homomeric complex formation was independent of the Rad17p-Mec3p-Ddc1p interaction and was differentially influenced by amino acid substitutions. In addition, several novel point mutations that abolish Rad17p function were identified. For yeast two-hybrid experiments we used anADE+ derivative of Y190, originally from S. Elledge (62Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar), and CG1945 (63Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddel C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) as reporter strains. A thermoconditional ligase-deficient cdc9 reporter strain (WS3019/89) was created by crossing Y190 with a cdc9–1 strain. WS3019/89 was also reverted to wild-type by transformation with aCDC9+ PCR fragment. Strain BY4741trp1Δ (from the Euroscarf yeast stock center) was used for co-immunoprecipitation studies. For complementation experiments, we used strain SX46A (20Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) deleted for RAD17. Complete chromosomal deletions of RAD17, MEC3, orTOP1 were created by PCR amplification of existing transplacements with kanMX4 in BY4741-derived strains (Euroscarf), followed by transformation of the target strain by the lithium acetate method (64Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Media recipes can be found elsewhere (65Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1994Google Scholar). For two-hybrid experiments, an in-frame fusion of full-length Rad17p (minus the N-terminal three amino acids) with the Gal4p DNA-binding domain was constructed from vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH) and a subcloned library plasmid insert (30Siede W. Nusspaumer G. Portillo V. Rodriguez R. Friedberg E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations of Rad17p (Δ136, Δ100) were made by digesting the resulting plasmid pGBT9-Rad17 withPacI and blunt-ending before re-ligation (Δ136) or by subcloning of an EcoRI fragment of pGBT9-Rad17 into pGBT9 (Δ100). The amino acid substitutions L119A, I120A, F121L, F121D, and F121A in Rad17p were introduced by PCR using primers that included at their 5′ ends sequence homology to the pGBT9 vector. pGBT9-Rad17 was gapped with SmaI and PacI and co-transformed with each PCR product into yeast strain Y190, resulting in reconstitution of plasmids with mutated RAD17 coding sequence by recombination (66Ma H. Kunes S. Schatz P.J. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These plasmids were recovered and verified following electroporation of Escherichia coli with yeast DNA preparations (67Rose M.D. Berger S.L. Kimmel A.R. Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego1987: 481-504Google Scholar). C-terminal fusions of Rad17p or [E128K]Rad17p with the transcriptional activation region of Gal4p were made in pCAD1, a vector containing codons 768–881 of Gal4p downstream of the ADH1promoter (Ref. 68Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, kindly provided by Megan Keniry, University of Oregon). We also constructed an N-terminal fusion of full-length Mec3p with the Gal4p transcriptional activation domain in vector pGAD424 using the described PCR/recombination strategy. For immunoprecipitation experiments, we epitope-tagged Rad17p on inducible overexpression plasmids containing TRP1 orLEU2 as selectable markers. First, a GST-Rad17 fusion was constructed in vector pYEX4T1 (CLONTECH). We transferred the GST-Rad17p fusion to pEGLh6 (provided by Z. Wang, University of Kentucky) and thus created a galactose-inducible His6-GST-Rad17p fusion (plasmid pEGLh6-GST-Rad17). Similarly, RAD17 was cloned into pEGTHa (69Xin H. Lin W. Sumanasekera W. Zhang Y. Wu X. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), resulting in an HA-Rad17p fusion under the control of the galactose inducibleGAL1/GAL10 promoter. A centromeric plasmid containing full-length untagged RAD17 under control of its chromosomal promoter was constructed from pWSU174 (30Siede W. Nusspaumer G. Portillo V. Rodriguez R. Friedberg E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and vector YCp50. Further construction details and primer sequences can be provided upon request. Following co-transformation of yeast strains Y190, CG1945, or WS3019/89, individual colonies were streaked on synthetic medium plates without tryptophan and leucine and grown for 2 days. To test forHIS3 reporter gene activation in the presence of DNA damage, 3 × 106 (strains Y190, WS3019/89) or 1.2 × 107 (strain CG1945) cells were spread per plate of medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, containing 25 mm (Y190, WS3019/89) or 1.25 mm (CG1945) aminotriazole. Filter paper discs containing 10 µl of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (Sigma, 100 µg/ml in Me2SO) or camptothecin (Sigma, 10 mg/ml in Me2SO) were placed in the center of each plate. Growth was evaluated after 6 days of incubation at 30 °C or at 33 °C forcdc9–1 strains. The two-hybrid yeast cDNA library used here was developed by S. Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston). Strains containing epitope-tagged Rad17p were grown overnight in synthetic omission medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, supplemented with 2% sucrose. Cultures were diluted 5-fold into fresh synthetic omission medium, supplemented with 2% galactose and 0.5% sucrose and incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were resuspended in twice the original culture volume of YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, 0.5% sucrose). After 30 min at 30 °C, 4-NQO was added to a final concentration of 0.25 µg/ml to a portion of the culture at a titer of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Samples of ∼1 × 109 cells were harvested after 6 h of continued incubation at 30 °C. Cell samples were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (50 mm TRIS, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, pH 7.5) (70Bailly V. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) containing 15 µl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8215). Zirkonium beads (Biospec Products) were added, and cells were lysed by fast vortexing. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein (6–8 mg) of clarified extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 µl of HA-affinity matrix (3F10 rat monoclonal antibody agarose beads, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 300 µl of buffer B. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer B and eluted with 100 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following standard SDS-PAGE and semi-dry electroblotting, nitrocellulose membranes were first incubated in 5% (w/v) dry milk, 20 mm TRIS, 136 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.6), then with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Covance, 1:5,000 dilution) or anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody 4C10 (Covance, 1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:5,000). If needed, Western blots were reprobed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Synchronization with hydroxyurea (Sigma), radiation treatment with UV or 137Cs γ-irradiation, detection of survival and cell cycle arrest on solid medium were performed as described previously (71Liu Y. Vidanes G. Lin Y.-C. Mori S. Siede W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1132-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Conventional two-hybrid screening has previously revealed that the yeast checkpoint protein Rad17p forms a stable complex with Mec3p and Ddc1p (41Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To identify novel protein-protein interactions with Rad17p, we speculated that certain interactions may only be detectable under conditions of checkpoint activation. Consequently, we performed a two-hybrid screen while exposing the reporter strain to DNA damage. We used a fusion of Rad17p with the Gal4p DNA-binding domain (BD) on plasmid pGBT9-Rad17 and a yeast cDNA plasmid library fused to the Gal4p activation domain (AD). Instead of including"
https://openalex.org/W2095124360,"Single Rap1p DNA-binding sites are poor activators of transcription of yeast minimal promoters, even when fully occupied in vivo. This low efficiency is due to two independent repression mechanisms as follows: one that requires the presence of histones, and one that requires Hrs1p, a component of the RNA polymerase II mediator complex. Both repression mechanisms were greatly reduced for constructs with tandemly arranged sites. In these constructs, UASrpg sequences (ACACCCATACATTT) activated better than telomere-like sequences (ACACCCACACACCC) in an orientation-dependent manner. Both mutations in the SWI/SNF complex and a deletion of amino acids 597–629 of Rap1p (Tox domain) decreased synergistic effects of contiguous telomeric sites. Conversely, deletion of amino acids 700–798 of Rap1p (Sil domain) made UASrpg and telomeric sites functionally indistinguishable. We propose that the Sil domain masks the main transactivation domain of Rap1p in Rap1p-telomere complexes, where the Tox domain behaves as a secondary activation domain, probably by interacting with chromatin-remodeling complexes. Rap1p DNA-binding sites in ribosomal protein gene promoters are mainly UASrpg-like; their replacement by telomeric sequences in one of these promoters (RPS17B) decreased transcription by two-thirds. The functional differences between UASrpgs and telomeric sequences may thus contribute to the differential expression of Rap1p-regulated promoters in vivo.

It activates the transcription of a large number of heavily transcribed genes, including those encoding glycolytic enzymes, ribosomal proteins, and several components of the transcriptional machinery. It also behaves as a transcriptional repressor, as it is essential for silencing the HML andHMR loci. Finally, Rap1p binds to yeast telomeres and is required for their structural stability and transcriptional repression (reviewed in Refs. 1Shore D.

Chambers A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have shown it builds up structurally distinct complexes with two versions of its consensus binding sequence, the UASrpg sequence (5′-ACACCCATACATTT-3′) and the telomere consensus sequence (5′-ACACCCACACACCC-3′) (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and chemical footprinting data indicate that, when bound to telomeric sequences, the two nearly identical Myb-like domains of the Rap1p DNA-binding domain make very similar contacts to two identical DNA half-sites (ACACCC), (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Koenig P. Giraldo R. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Cell. 1996; 85: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Taylor H.O.B. O'Reilly M. Leslie A.G.W. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Some of these contacts are not possible in Rap1p-UASrpg complexes, because of the presence of Ts in the second half-site (ACATTT). We thus proposed that high affinity binding of Rap1p to a UASrpg requires rearrangement of the C-terminal moiety of the DNA-binding domain of Rap1p (6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); such a rearrangement appears not to be necessary for binding to different versions of the telomeric sequence (8Taylor H.O.B. O'Reilly M. Leslie A.G.W. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Wahlin J. Cohn M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structural differences between different Rap1p-DNA complexes have functional significance (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); here, we provide a further genetic analysis showing that these complexes are functionally different because they activate transcription through different mechanisms. The very low transcriptional activity of synthetic reporters encompassing a single UASrpg or telomeric site in Rap1p-based activation is inconsistent with the identical affinity of Rap1p for single and tandemly arranged sites in vitro (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we show that single sites are completely occupied in vivo, despite their low transcriptional activity, by two approaches. First, we observed the footprint of Rap1p in a single UASrpg in vivo, using the characteristic KMnO4-hypersensitivity site at the base T8 of the UASrpg when occupied (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Gilson E. Roberge M. Giraldo R. Rhodes D. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Second, we measured the ability of a single UASrpg to block activation through an overlapping UASgal site, an experimental design known as binding interference (11McDonnell D.P. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When assayed as tandem repeats, UASrpgs showed a strong synergistic effect, which was orientation-dependent, whereas telomeric sequences showed a lower synergism, irrespective of orientation (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the results from single sites, which were not affected by the orientation or the version of the site (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One of the main goals of this study was the identification of mutations affecting these functional differences. We thus tested many mutations affecting key steps of transcriptional activation; and those that clarify the mechanisms of transactivation by Rap1p are included in this paper and are described below. For histone depletion, histone H4 can be selectively depleted in the yeast strain UKY403, in which its sole copy is under the control of the repressible GAL1 promoter (12Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This strain loses 50% of its normal complement of nucleosomes when transferred from a galactose-containing medium, where it grows normally, to one containing glucose, where it stops growing after a single cell cycle (12Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Nucleosome loss activates many (but not all) yeast reporters in vivo (12Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13Kim U.-J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It affects transcription of about 25% of yeast genes either by increasing (15%) or decreasing (10%) the mRNA levels (14Wyrick J.J. Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Causton H.C. Shore D. Grunstein M. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). 2For additional information see the following web page: web.wi.mit.edu/young/chromatin/. These results show the pivotal role of histones in both activation and silencing of many yeast genes. HRS1 was identified as a suppressor of a hyper-recombinant phenotype produced by hpr1 mutations (15Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of theHRS1 gene impairs transcription of many chromosomal genes, but it also enhances transcription of many promoters when assayed as episomal plasmids, by an unknown mechanism (15Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hrs1p is part of the mediator complex of RNA polymerase II, which is required for the transcription of a variety of promoters (16Myers L. Gustafsson C. Hayashibara K. Brown P. Kornberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 335-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutations in certain components of this complex also show this paradoxical phenotype,i.e. inhibition of some genes and activation of others (18Tabtiang R.K. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4707-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chromatin remodeling is mediated by multisubunit complexes that alter nucleosome structure in an ATP-dependent manner (19Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Here we assay mutations in two of these complexes, the SWI/SNF complex and the RSC complex. These complexes have distinct roles in the cell. The SWI/SNF complex is relatively rare, dispensable, and associated with transcriptional activation, and the RSC complex is abundant, essential, and related to cell cycle progression (19Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The relevance of these complexes in transcription regulation has been much debated. Deletion of key components of the SWI/SNF complex affects the levels of about only 1% of the yeast transcripts (20Sudarsanam P. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winston F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3364-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 21Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). However, the SWI/SNF complex is required for mitotic transcription, probably because of the condensed state of mitotic chromatin (22Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Human and yeast SWI/SNF complexes directly reorganize the chromatin structure in vitro to facilitate the binding of transcription factors (23Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar,24Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Rap1p is a large protein (827 amino acids) with multiple functions, some of which are associated with various domains in the primary protein structure (see Ref. 3Morse R.H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 51-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar for a review). Analysis in vivo of the functional regions within Rap1p revealed that the DNA-binding domain (amino acids 342–596) is the only portion of Rap1p essential for growth (25Graham I. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, removal of the so-called activation (Act) domain (amino acids 627–690, (26Hardy C.F. Balderes D. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) strongly decreases growth rates and compromises the transcription of several, but not all, Rap1p-regulated genes (25Graham I. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Deletion of the so-called silencing (Sil) domain (amino acids 700–798) results in a milder growth defect, an increase in the transcription of several Rap1p-regulated genes, and the loss of transcriptional silencing through Rap1p both at telomeres and at the HML and HMR loci (25Graham I. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Hardy C.F. Balderes D. Shore D. Mol. Cell.

This domain is the target for interactions with telomeric proteins Rif1p, Rif2p, Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p (26Hardy C.F. Balderes D. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Hardy C.F. Sussel L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 29Culotta V.C. Howard W.R.

Finally, deletion of amino acids 597–629 (the Tox domain) has minor physiological effects but increases the amount of mutated Rap1p present in the cell (25Graham I. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Hardy C.F. Balderes D. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It also eliminates the cellular toxicity produced by the overexpression of Rap1p both inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (32Freeman K. Gwadz M. Shore D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chambers A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Rap1p alleles truncated at the C-terminal domain, as well as sir mutants, show a general de-repression in telomere-proximal genes (14Wyrick J.J. Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Causton H.C. Shore D. Grunstein M. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).2 Our results indicate that the architecture of Rap1p-based promoters determines their ability to alleviate various overlapping mechanisms of transcriptional repression. Single sites partially counteracted histone repression, but their transcriptional activation was limited by a putative Hrs1p-mediated transcriptional control. Tandemly arranged telomeric sites eliminated both types of repression, but the resulting complex was not fully active because of internal inhibition in the Rap1p molecule by the Sil domain. The characteristic high activation through tandemly arranged UASrpgs, which we refer to as the RPG effect (6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), appeared in this context as the result of the suppression of this internal inhibition. We propose that this is probably mediated by the remodeling of the C-terminal portion of the Rap1p molecule required for its binding to UASrpgs (6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the RPG effect is unknown. No mutation has been reported so far to abolish it, and so the question cannot be directly addressed. We present two complementary approaches as follows: a whole yeast genome search for UASrpg and telomeric sequences in gene promoters, and the substitution of a UASrpg by a telomeric sequence in a natural, Rap1p-controlled promoter. Both analyses suggest that the functional differences between both types of sequences apply to natural promoters and that they control the levels of expression of Rap1p-regulated genes in vivo. The yeast strains used in this paper are listed in TableI. Strain YPH499 was from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center (YGSC), Berkeley, CA. Strain SCR101ΔU was constructed by transformation of the parental SCR101 (35Gonçalves P. Maurer K. van Nieuw Amerongen G. Bergkamp-Steffens K. Mager W. Planta R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with a deleted version of the URA3 gene, lacking the sequences between the endogenous StuI and EcoRV sites (36Gartenberg M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11461-11465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated directly onto SD plates (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 20 g/liter glucose, and 2% agar (Difco)) supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids (Difco) plus 0.1% tryptophan, 0.02% uracil, and 900 mg/liter 5-fluoroorotic acid (Fluorochem, UK (37Boeke J. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar)). Plasmid pSLFΔ-178K is a derivative of pLGΔ-312 (38Hahn S. Hoar E. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8562-8566Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), constructed by S. L. Forsburg. It contains the sequences from −178 (XhoI) to theBamHI site of the CYC1 promoter. Plasmids pRPG and pTEL were constructed by inserting copies of the appropriate oligonucleotides into the XhoI site of pSLFΔ-178K (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotide sequences (upper sequences only) are as follows: RPG1, 5′-TCGACACCCATACATT-3′; TEL1, 5′-TCGACACCCACACACCC-3′; RPG2, 5′-TCGACACCCATACATTTACACACACCCATACATT-3′; TEL2, 5′-TCGACACCCACACACCCACACACACCCACACACCC-3′; and RPG2-12, 5′-TCGACACTCATACATTTACACACACTCATACATT-3′. For convenience, the orientation of these oligonucleotides in the upper strand will be referred to as “direct.” In vivo binding interference experiments were performed by synthetic UASs containing either Gal4p-binding sites (pMD1) or overlapping Gal4p and Rap1p-binding sites (pGR5). These synthetic UASs were cloned into the KpnI site of pSLFΔ-178. Their sequences are as follows: MD1, 5′-CCAAATACGGGTGTCAGTCCTCCGGAGTA-3′; GRC5, 5′-AAATGTACGGGTGTCAGTCCTCCGGAGTA-3′. RPS17B promoter variants were constructed from a 335-bp genomic fragment from theRPS17B promoter from 10 bp upstream of the UASrpg to the first AUG (see Fig. 6, panel A). This fragment was fused in-frame to the β-galactosidase gene from pSLFΔ-178K in its unique BamHI site to give the plasmid pSN36. DNA sequences −332/−238, encompassing two UASrpgs and a poly(T) track (Fig. 6, panel A), were replaced by tandem repeats of either RPG sequences (ACACCCATACATTTACACACACCCATACATTT, pSR320) or telomeric sequences (ACACCCACACACCCACACACACCCACACACCC, pST47). Sequences of all constructs were determined by the T7 polymerase method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids pRAP, pRAPΔSil, and pRAPΔTox have been described elsewhere (25Graham I. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Table IStrains used in this studyNameRelevant genotypeSourceMHY308MATa ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2–3,-112 lys2–801 ura3–52 trp1-Δ419 Δhhf1∷HIS3Δhhf2∷LEU2/ pMH310(TRP1 CEN3 ARS1 HHF2)Han & Grunstein, 1988UKY403MATa ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2–3,112 lys2–801 ura3–52 trp1-Δ419 Δhhf1∷HIS3Δhhf2∷LEU2/ pUK421(TRP1 CEN3 ARS1 UASgal-Hhf2)Han & Grunstein, 1988AYW3–1BMATα ade2 his3 ura3 trp1 leu2-k∷URA3-ADE2∷leu2-kSantos-Rosa et al., 1996SSAB-2CAYW3–1B Δhrs1∷LEU2Santos-Rosa et al., 1996CY26MATa ade2 his3 leu2 lys1 ura3 trp1J.

Assays were performed by permeabilization of the whole cells with chloroform and SDS (39Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Alternatively, yeast protein extracts were obtained using Y-PER (Pierce) and used for β-galactosidase assays as described (40Rose M. Botstein D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 883-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Results from the two systems were similar; on average, the Y-PER method gave about 30% more activity than the permeabilization method. Strains MHY308 and UKY403 containing the reporter plasmids were grown overnight at 30 °C in selective medium (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 g/liter of the appropriate markers) with 20 g/liter galactose as carbon source, to anA 600 between 0.6 and 1.2. Each culture was then halved, spun down, and resuspended: one part in YEP (10 g/liter peptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, Pronadisa, Spain) plus 20 g/liter glucose and the other part in YEP+ 20 g/liter galactose. These cultures were incubated for 6 h at 30 °C and processed for β-galactosidase activity determination. We used a modification of the protocol described (41Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). YPH499 cells transformed with the appropriate reporters were grown in 5 ml of selective SD medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 20 g/liter glucose, and the appropriate markers at 0.1 g/liter) to saturation at 30 °C. The saturated culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of fresh SD medium and left to grow at 30 °C until anA 600 of 1. The culture was then spun down, resuspended in 1 ml, and divided into 2 aliquots, one to be used as untreated control. The other was treated with 100 mmKMnO4 for 1 min at room temperature; the reaction was terminated by adding 5 volumes of 0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA, and 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Both modified and control cells were spun down and resuspended in 500 µl of Solution A (0.1m EDTA, 1 m sorbitol, pH 7.5). Genomic DNA was extracted as detailed below. Thereafter, DNA from untreated cells was treated with 10 mm KMnO4 for 2 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm EDTA, and 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 7. DNA was extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. Cells resuspended in 500 µl of Solution A were spheroplasted by adding β-mercaptoethanol to 10 mm and 500 µg of Zymoliase (Seikagaku, Japan) and were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were spun down and resuspended in 500 µl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA. After addition of 50 µl of 10% SDS and vigorous vortexing, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 65 °C. After incubation, 200 µl of 5 m potassium acetate was added, mixed thoroughly, and left on ice for 30 min. Proteins were then spun down in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. DNA on the supernatant was then was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) until no interphase was visible and then precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. DNA samples treated with KMnO4 (in vivo or in vitro) were incubated with 1 mpiperidine for 30 min at 90 °C. The reaction products were extended with the primer 5′-CTAAAGTTGCCTGGCCATCC-3′, which hybridizes to theCYC1 promoter 59 bp downstream from the XhoI site in the lower strand. After denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C, the oligonucleotide was annealed for 2 min at 60 °C and extended with the Stoeffel fragment of DNA polymerase I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 min at 72 °C. The extension products were then re-denatured for 45 s at 94 °C. This cycle was repeated 40 times. Extension products were analyzed in a polyacrylamide sequencing gel with 8m urea. Promoters from all the yeast genomes (positions −600/1 from the ATG) were searched for putative Rap1p-binding sequences with the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools package (42van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), using the consensus matrix for Rap1p from S. cerevisiae Promoter Data base (43Ball C.A. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sequences containing one or more putative sites were re-scanned for Rap1p sites by the MathInspector program (44Quandt K. Frech K. Karas K. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar, 45Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Sub-telomeric genes were discarded. Additional information was obtained from theSaccharomyces Genome Data base web page (46Cherry J.M. Adler C. Ball C. Chervitz S.A. Dwight S.S. Hester E.T. Jia Y. Juvik G. Roe T. Schroeder M. Weng S. Botstein D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). We treated yeast cells bearing plasmids including UASrpg sites with KMnO4 in vivo. This treatment damaged specific DNA bases, which can be observed by reiterated extension of appropriate oligonucleotides. Fig.1 shows results from YHP499 strain clones either non-transformed (panel A) or transformed with pRPG1 (panel B) or pRPG2 (panel C) plasmids. We observed two bands for each UASrpg, corresponding to bases T8 and A7 (lower and upper band of each pair in Fig. 1, respectively). This pattern differed from the single strong KMnO4-hypersensitivity site at position T8 observedin vitro with end-labeled DNA fragments (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Idrissi F.Z. Piña B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Gilson E. Roberge M. Giraldo R. Rhodes D. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, when purified supercoiled plasmids were bound in vitro to Rap1p (or to its DNA-binding domain), treated with KMnO4, and analyzed by reiterated primer extension, we observed a two-band pattern identical to the one shown in Fig. 1 (not shown). We concluded that Rap1p distorted DNA in vivo as it does in vitro. The intensity of the KMnO4 hypersensitivity sites inpanels B and C of Fig. 1 suggests that both constructs were similarly occupied in vivo, despite their very distinct transcriptional activity (about 20-fold (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), see below). We verified that the bands shown in Fig. 1 were actually originated by the binding of Rap1p to the UASrpg sequences by repeating the experiment with strains transformed with the plasmid pRPG2-12. This construct bears two mutated sites (RPG-12 (47Vignais M.L. Huet J. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14669-14674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); it displays a severely reduced affinity for Rap1p binding (47Vignais M.L. Huet J. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14669-14674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a negligible transcriptional activation (5Idrissi F.-Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Piña B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This construct did not show the characteristic KMnO4 hypersensitivity sites due to Rap1p binding (Fig. 1, panel D). Gal4p-binding sites (UASgal) consists of two palindromic CGG sequences separated by 11 nucleotides (48Liang S.D. Marmorstein R. Ha"
