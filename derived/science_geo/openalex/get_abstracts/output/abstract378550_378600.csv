https://openalex.org/W2137797806,"Large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies have become an important tool in human genomics, mostly focused on disease but also on adaptive variations such as skin colour. The technique is now shown to be similarly useful in plants. Atwell et al. report a GWA study of over a hundred phenotypes in naturally occurring inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. The results range from significant associations, usually for single genes, to more difficult-to-interpret findings that indicate confounding by complex genetics and population structure. The accompanying paper by Todesco et al. demonstrates the ability of this technique to detect major-effect gene loci. Using forward genetics and GWA analyses, they show that variation at a single locus (ACD6) in Arabidopsis underlies phenotypic variation in vegetative growth as well as resistance to infection. The strong enhancement of resistance mediated by one of the alleles at this locus explains its persistence in natural populations throughout the world, despite it drastically reducing new leaf production. Here, large-scale genome-wide association studies were carried out with the naturally occurring inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, which can be genotyped once and phenotyped repeatedly. The results range from significant associations, usually corresponding to single genes, to findings that are more difficult to interpret, because confounding by complex genetics and population structure makes it hard to distinguish true associations from false. Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases1,2, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation and traits of agricultural importance. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits3. Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of GWA studies in A. thaliana and suggests that the approach will be appropriate for many other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2056257661,"Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis."

In recent years, progress has been achieved in exploring and making use of the fundamental properties of such interfaces, and it has become clear that these electron systems offer the potential for possible future devices.

https://openalex.org/W1998457769,"Although mammalian hearts show almost no ability to regenerate, there is a growing initiative to determine whether existing cardiomyocytes or progenitor cells can be coaxed into eliciting a regenerative response. In contrast to mammals, several non-mammalian vertebrate species are able to regenerate their hearts, including the zebrafish, which can fully regenerate its heart after amputation of up to 20% of the ventricle. To address directly the source of newly formed cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration, we first established a genetic strategy to trace the lineage of cardiomyocytes in the adult fish, on the basis of the Cre/lox system widely used in the mouse. Here we use this system to show that regenerated heart muscle cells are derived from the proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we show that proliferating cardiomyocytes undergo limited dedifferentiation characterized by the disassembly of their sarcomeric structure, detachment from one another and the expression of regulators of cell-cycle progression. Specifically, we show that the gene product of polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) is an essential component of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the source of proliferating cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration and indicate that stem or progenitor cells are not significantly involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2128934324,"Direct imaging and chemical identification of all the atoms in a material with unknown three-dimensional structure would constitute a very powerful general analysis tool. Transmission electron microscopy should in principle be able to fulfil this role, as many scientists including Feynman realized early on. It images matter with electrons that scatter strongly from individual atoms and whose wavelengths are about 50 times smaller than an atom. Recently the technique has advanced greatly owing to the introduction of aberration-corrected optics. However, neither electron microscopy nor any other experimental technique has yet been able to resolve and identify all the atoms in a non-periodic material consisting of several atomic species. Here we show that annular dark-field imaging in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope optimized for low voltage operation can resolve and identify the chemical type of every atom in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride that contains substitutional defects. Three types of atomic substitutions were found and identified: carbon substituting for boron, carbon substituting for nitrogen, and oxygen substituting for nitrogen. The substitutions caused in-plane distortions in the boron nitride monolayer of about 0.1 A magnitude, which were directly resolved, and verified by density functional theory calculations. The results demonstrate that atom-by-atom structural and chemical analysis of all radiation-damage-resistant atoms present in, and on top of, ultra-thin sheets has now become possible."
https://openalex.org/W2149161770,"Recent studies indicate that mammals, including humans, maintain some capacity to renew cardiomyocytes throughout postnatal life. Yet, there is little or no significant cardiac muscle regeneration after an injury such as acute myocardial infarction. By contrast, zebrafish efficiently regenerate lost cardiac muscle, providing a model for understanding how natural heart regeneration may be blocked or enhanced. In the absence of lineage-tracing technology applicable to adult zebrafish, the cellular origins of newly regenerated cardiac muscle have remained unclear. Using new genetic fate-mapping approaches, here we identify a population of cardiomyocytes that become activated after resection of the ventricular apex and contribute prominently to cardiac muscle regeneration. Through the use of a transgenic reporter strain, we found that cardiomyocytes throughout the subepicardial ventricular layer trigger expression of the embryonic cardiogenesis gene gata4 within a week of trauma, before expression localizes to proliferating cardiomyocytes surrounding and within the injury site. Cre-recombinase-based lineage-tracing of cells expressing gata4 before evident regeneration, or of cells expressing the contractile gene cmlc2 before injury, each labelled most cardiac muscle in the ensuing regenerate. By optical voltage mapping of surface myocardium in whole ventricles, we found that electrical conduction is re-established between existing and regenerated cardiomyocytes between 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. After injury and prolonged fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition to arrest cardiac regeneration and enable scar formation, experimental release of the signalling block led to gata4 expression and morphological improvement of the injured ventricular wall without loss of scar tissue. Our results indicate that electrically coupled cardiac muscle regenerates after resection injury, primarily through activation and expansion of cardiomyocyte populations. These findings have implications for promoting regeneration of the injured human heart."
https://openalex.org/W2038958116,"Preventing Radiation Damage Inside a nuclear reactor, long-term exposure to radiation causes structural damage and limits the lifetimes of the reactor components. Bai et al. (p. 1631 ; see the Perspective by Ackland ) now show, using three simulation methods able to cover a wide range of time and length scales, that grain boundaries in copper can act as sinks for radiation-induced defects. The boundaries are able to store up defects, in the form of interstitials, which subsequently annihilate with vacancies in the bulk. This recombination mechanism has a lower energy barrier than the bulk equivalent, and so provides a lower-cost route for the copper to self-heal."

Here we report a complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequence retrieved from a bone excavated in 2008 in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. It represents a hitherto unknown type of hominin mtDNA that shares a common ancestor with anatomically modern human and Neanderthal mtDNAs about 1.0 million years ago. This indicates that it derives from a hominin migration out of Africa distinct from that of the ancestors of Neanderthals and of modern humans. The stratigraphy of the cave where the bone was found suggests that the Denisova hominin lived close in time and space with Neanderthals as well as with modern humans."

Currently, expensive precious metals, such as platinum, are required to remove these pollutants. Kim et al. (p. 1624 ; see the Perspective by Parks ) show that a strontium-doped perovskite catalyst, prepared from more abundant (and cheaper) elements, may help to lower the cost of NO x treatments and thus ultimately make diesel a more cost-effective automotive fuel. Under conditions realistically simulating exhaust streams, the catalyst rivaled platinum in accelerating NO x decomposition."

An antibody isolated from survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic was recently shown to cross-neutralize 2009 H1N1 viruses. Xu et al.

These studies reveal an epitope that is conserved in the pandemic viruses, but divergent in other known H1 HAs, from the 1930s to the present. This antigenic similarity explains the age-related immunity to the 2009 H1N1 influenza."

But if the lattice mismatch between the two materials is too large or messy, fractured interfaces result. Zhang et al. (p. 1634 ) describe a synthesis strategy to obtain spherical nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture that does not depend on heteroepitaxy.

https://openalex.org/W2089414860,"Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Determining the coronary artery developmental program could aid understanding of the disease and lead to new treatments, but many aspects of the process, including their developmental origin, remain obscure. Here we show, using histological and clonal analysis in mice and cardiac organ culture, that coronary vessels arise from angiogenic sprouts of the sinus venosus-the vein that returns blood to the embryonic heart. Sprouting venous endothelial cells dedifferentiate as they migrate over and invade the myocardium. Invading cells differentiate into arteries and capillaries; cells on the surface redifferentiate into veins. These results show that some differentiated venous cells retain developmental plasticity, and indicate that position-specific cardiac signals trigger their dedifferentiation and conversion into coronary arteries, capillaries and veins. Understanding this new reprogramming process and identifying the endogenous signals should suggest more natural ways of engineering coronary bypass grafts and revascularizing the heart."

https://openalex.org/W2121391430,"Tumor manipulation of host immunity is important for tumor survival and invasion. Many cancers secrete CCL21, a chemoattractant for various leukocytes and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, which drive lymphoid neogenesis. CCL21 expression by melanoma tumors in mice was associated with an immunotolerant microenvironment, which included the induction of lymphoid-like reticular stromal networks, an altered cytokine milieu, and the recruitment of regulatory leukocyte populations. In contrast, CCL21-deficient tumors induced antigen-specific immunity. CCL21-mediated immune tolerance was dependent on host rather than tumor expression of the CCL21 receptor, CCR7, and could protect distant, coimplanted CCL21-deficient tumors and even nonsyngeneic allografts from rejection. We suggest that by altering the tumor microenvironment, CCL21-secreting tumors shift the host immune response from immunogenic to tolerogenic, which facilitates tumor progression."

Randel et al.

This mechanism represents a pathway for pollutants to enter the global stratosphere, where they might affect ozone chemistry, aerosol characteristics, and radiative properties."
https://openalex.org/W2034923684,"Exceptional genomic stability is one of the hallmarks of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the genes contributing to this stability remain obscure. We previously identified Zscan4 as a specific marker for two-cell embryo and ES cells. Here we show that Zscan4 is involved in telomere maintenance and long-term genomic stability in ES cells. Only 5% of ES cells express Zscan4 at a given time, but nearly all ES cells activate Zscan4 at least once during nine passages. The transient Zscan4-positive state is associated with rapid telomere extension by telomere recombination and upregulation of meiosis-specific homologous recombination genes, which encode proteins that are colocalized with ZSCAN4 on telomeres. Furthermore, Zscan4 knockdown shortens telomeres, increases karyotype abnormalities and spontaneous sister chromatid exchange, and slows down cell proliferation until reaching crisis by passage eight. Together, our data show a unique mode of genome maintenance in ES cells."

H3 lysine 27 trimethylation and H3 lysine 4 trimethylation are only detected after MZT, and evidence is provided that the bivalent chromatin domains in cultured ES cells also exist in embryos. To study the changes in chromatin structure that accompany zygotic genome activation and pluripotency during the maternal–zygotic transition (MZT), the genomic locations of histone H3 modifications and RNA polymerase II have been mapped during this transition in zebrafish embryos. H3 lysine 27 trimethylation and H3 lysine 4 trimethylation are only detected after MZT; evidence is provided that the bivalent chromatin domains found in cultured embryonic stem cells also exist in embryos. After fertilization the embryonic genome is inactive until transcription is initiated during the maternal–zygotic transition1,2,3. This transition coincides with the formation of pluripotent cells, which in mammals can be used to generate embryonic stem cells. To study the changes in chromatin structure that accompany pluripotency and genome activation, we mapped the genomic locations of histone H3 molecules bearing lysine trimethylation modifications before and after the maternal–zygotic transition in zebrafish. Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is repressive, and H3K4me3, which is activating, were not detected before the transition. After genome activation, more than 80% of genes were marked by H3K4me3, including many inactive developmental regulatory genes that were also marked by H3K27me3. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the same promoter regions had both trimethylation marks. Such bivalent chromatin domains also exist in embryonic stem cells and are thought to poise genes for activation while keeping them repressed4,5,6,7,8. Furthermore, we found many inactive genes that were uniquely marked by H3K4me3. Despite this activating modification, these monovalent genes were neither expressed nor stably bound by RNA polymerase II. Inspection of published data sets revealed similar monovalent domains in embryonic stem cells. Moreover, H3K4me3 marks could form in the absence of both sequence-specific transcriptional activators and stable association of RNA polymerase II, as indicated by the analysis of an inducible transgene. These results indicate that bivalent and monovalent domains might poise embryonic genes for activation and that the chromatin profile associated with pluripotency is established during the maternal–zygotic transition."
https://openalex.org/W2172079193,"Yin-Yang T Cell Signaling Immune responses are kept in check by CD4 + regulatory T cells (T reg ) that suppress other immune cells, including CD4 + effector T cells (T eff ). T reg and T eff cells have many signaling components in common, yet triggering through their T cell receptors (TCRs) leads to very different outcomes. Zanin-Zhorov et al. (p. 372 , published online 25 March) compared the recruitment of signaling molecules to the immunological synapse after TCR triggering in T reg and T eff cells. Although T reg cells do form synapses, signaling molecules that promote T eff activation, such as protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ), were not recruited. Inhibition or depletion of PKC-θ in T reg cells led to suppressive activity against T eff cells, whereas costimulation enhanced PKC-θ recruitment and less suppression. Together, this suggests that PKC-θ is inflammatory in both T reg and T eff cells; however, by excluding it from the synapse, T reg cells are able to maintain suppression in the face of TCR signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2152948641,"There is accumulating evidence that soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers, rather than amyloid fibrils, are the principal pathogenic species in Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we have developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for high-molecular-weight (HMW) Aβ oligomers. Analysis of Aβ oligomers derived from synthetic Aβ 1-42, by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), revealed that our ELISA specifically detected HMW Aβ oligomers of40–200 kDa. Using this ELISA, we detected significantly higher (P<0.0001) signals in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 25 patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to 25 age-matched controls. As a test for discriminating between the AD/MCI and control groups, the area under the curve in receiver operating characteristic analysis for the CSF HMW Aβ oligomers was greater than that for CSF Aβx-42. Furthermore, the CSF levels of HMW Aβ oligomers showed a negative correlation with Mini-Mental State Examination scores in the AD/MCI group. We conclude that the CSF HMW Aβ oligomers detected by our ELISAcould be useful as a diagnostic marker for AD, and also as a potential surrogate marker for disease severity.

https://openalex.org/W2047222566,"Crystal engineering of nanoporous structures has not yet exploited the heme motif so widely found in proteins. Here, we report that a derivative of iron phthalocyanine, a close analog of heme, forms millimeter-scale molecular crystals that contain large interconnected voids (8 cubic nanometers), defined by a cubic assembly of six phthalocyanines. Rapid ligand exchange is achieved within these phthalocyanine nanoporous crystals by single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformations. Differentiation of the binding sites, similar to that which occurs in hemoproteins, is achieved so that monodentate ligands add preferentially to the axial binding site within the cubic assembly, whereas bidentate ligands selectively bind to the opposite axial site to link the cubic assemblies. These bidentate ligands act as molecular wall ties to prevent the collapse of the molecular crystal during the removal of solvent. The resulting crystals possess high surface areas (850 to 1000 square meters per gram) and bind N2 at the equivalent of the heme distal site through a SCSC process characterized by x-ray crystallography."

https://openalex.org/W1996459334,"The Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line is the primary observational signature of star-forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and has enabled the compilation of large samples of galaxies with which to study cosmic evolution. The resonant nature of the line, however, means that Lya photons scatter in the neutral interstellar medium of their host galaxies, and their sensitivity to absorption by interstellar dust may therefore be enhanced greatly. This implies that the Lya luminosity may be significantly reduced, or even completely suppressed. Hitherto, no unbiased empirical test of the escaping fraction (f_esc) of Lya photons has been performed at high redshifts. Here we report that the average fesc from star-forming galaxies at redshift z = 2.2 is just 5 per cent by performing a blind narrowband survey in Lya and Ha. This implies that numerous conclusions based on Lya-selected samples will require upwards revision by an order of magnitude and we provide a benchmark for this revision. We demonstrate that almost 90 per cent of star-forming galaxies emit insufficient Lya to be detected by standard selection criteria. Both samples show an anti-correlation of fesc with dust content, and we show that Lya- and Ha-selection recovers populations that differ substantially in dust content and fesc."
https://openalex.org/W2135897497,"The orexigenic effect of ghrelin is mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). Recent evidence also indicates that ghrelin promotes feeding through a mechanism involving activation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (FAS). This results in decreased hypothalamic levels of malonyl-CoA, increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) activity, and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species. We evaluated whether these molecular events are part of a unique signaling cascade or whether they represent alternative pathways mediating the orexigenic effect of ghrelin. Moreover, we examined the gender dependency of these mechanisms, because recent evidence has proposed that ghrelin orexigenic effect is reduced in female rats. We studied in both genders the effect of ghrelin on the expression of AgRP and NPY, as well as their transcription factors: cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB and its phosphorylated form, pCREB), forkhead box O1 (FoxO1 and its phosphorylated form, pFoxO1), and brain-specific homeobox transcription factor (BSX). In addition, to establish a mechanistic link between ghrelin, fatty acid metabolism, and neuropeptides, we evaluated the effect of ghrelin after blockage of hypothalamic fatty acid beta oxidation, by using the CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir. Ghrelin-induced changes in the AMPK-CPT1 pathway are associated with increased levels of AgRP and NPY mRNA expression through modulation of BSX, pCREB, and FoxO1, as well as decreased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers in a gender-independent manner. In addition, blockage of hypothalamic fatty acid beta oxidation prevents the ghrelin-promoting action on AgRP and NPY mRNA expression, also in a gender-independent manner. Notably, this effect is associated with decreased BSX expression and reduced food intake. Overall, our data suggest that BSX integrates changes in neuronal metabolic status with ARC-derived neuropeptides in a gender-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2161247940,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an important bioactive sphingolipid involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, 2 important processes that influence the growth, survival, and spread of tumors. S1P acts as an extracellular mediator through binding to 5 highly specific S1P receptors, S1P1–5. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1), one of 2 known sphingosine kinase enzymes responsible for S1P production, appears to be overexpressed in many tumors. Although a role for S1P in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis has been established, it is unclear whether S1P secreted from cancer cells has a paracrine function in a tumor environment. Here we investigated whether modulation of cellular SK1 could initiate a paracrine angiogenic and lymphangiogenic switch. We found that SK1 overexpression in HEK cells or its down-regulation in glioma or breast cancer cells modulated extracellular S1P levels accordingly, which in turn increased or decreased both migration and tube formation in cocultured vascular or lymphatic endothelial cells. In contrast, down-regulation of sphingosine kinase 2 in both glioma and breast cancer cells had no appreciable effect on cellular or secreted S1P levels. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF and VEGF-C down-regulation in cancer cells appeared insufficient to block the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic switch triggered by these cells. Moreover, S1P initiated endothelial cell sprouting in 3-dimensional collagen matrices, which is representative of a multistep angiogenic process.

https://openalex.org/W2031170847,"Regulation of cell volume is of great importance because persistent swelling or shrinkage leads to cell death. Tissues experience hypertonicity in both physiological (kidney medullar cells) and pathological states (hypernatremia). Hypertonicity induces an adaptive gene expression program that leads to cell volume recovery or apoptosis under persistent stress. We show that the commitment to apoptosis is controlled by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, the master regulator of the stress response. Studies with cultured mouse fibroblasts and cortical neurons show that mutants deficient in eIF2alpha phosphorylation are protected from hypertonicity-induced apoptosis. A novel link is revealed between eIF2alpha phosphorylation and the subcellular distribution of the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). Stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha promotes apoptosis by inducing the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1, which attenuates internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation of anti-apoptotic mRNAs, including Bcl-xL that was studied here. Hypertonic stress induced the eIF2alpha phosphorylation-independent formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs, structures that harbor translationally arrested mRNAs) and the eIF2alpha phosphorylation-dependent accumulation of hnRNP A1 in SGs. The importance of hnRNP A1 was demonstrated by induction of apoptosis in eIF2alpha phosphorylation-deficient cells that express exogenous cytoplasmic hnRNP A1. We propose that eIF2alpha phosphorylation during hypertonic stress promotes apoptosis by sequestration of specific mRNAs in SGs in a process mediated by the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1."
https://openalex.org/W2155628305,"Strong correlations can dramatically modify the thermodynamics of a quantum many-particle system. Especially intriguing behaviour can appear when the system adiabatically enters a strongly correlated regime, for the interplay between entropy and strong interactions can lead to counterintuitive effects. A well known example is the so-called Pomeranchuk effect, occurring when liquid 3He is adiabatically compressed towards its crystalline phase. Here, we report on a novel anomalous, isentropic effect in a spin mixture of attractively interacting fermionic atoms in an optical lattice. As we adiabatically increase the attraction between the atoms we observe that the gas, instead of contracting, anomalously expands. This expansion results from the combination of two effects induced by pair formation in a lattice potential: the suppression of quantum fluctuations as the attraction increases, which leads to a dominant role of entropy, and the progressive loss of the spin degree of freedom, which forces the gas to excite additional orbital degrees of freedom and expand to outer regions of the trap in order to maintain the entropy. The unexpected thermodynamics we observe reveal fundamentally distinctive features of pairing in the fermionic Hubbard model."

In both mitosis and nuclear trafficking, Ran functions by modulating the interaction between nuclear transport factors and a range of target proteins. Thus, in nuclear protein import, for example, cargo proteins destined for nuclear import bind to transport factors (importins) in the cytoplasm, where Ran is in the GDP-bound form. This cargo:carrier complex then equilibrates between the two compartments through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). In the nucleus, RanGTP dissociates the import complex, releasing the cargo, after which the transport factors are recycled to the cytoplasm where the Ran GTP is hydrolyzed, freeing the transport factors for another import cycle. However, during an open mitosis, the nuclear envelope is disassembled and instead Ran and some nuclear transport factors are used to orchestrate microtubule dynamics related to spindle generation (reviewed in Ref. 3Clarke P.R. Zhang C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).

Heald R. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the absence of RanGTP, the nuclear protein import factor importin-β binds to the importin-α adaptor, and this interaction frees importin-α to bind molecules such as TPX2 that have a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). A common form of NLS is the “classical” NLS that contain one (“monopartite”) or two (“bipartite”) clusters of basic residues (12Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The microtubule assembly function of TPX2 is inhibited when it is sequestered by importin-α. However, in the vicinity of the chromosomes, RanGTP binds to importin-β, releasing importin-α. The importin-β binding domain of importin-α (the IBB domain) in combination with other factors (6Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

It was originally proposed that TPX2 functioned in spindle assembly through an interaction between its N terminus and the Aurora A kinase (1Gruss O.J. Vernos I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This interaction is important in regulating Aurora A activity and, for example, the reduced cellular activity and mislocalization the Aurora A(S155R) mutant protein are because of loss of interaction with TPX2 (16Bibby R.A.

However, subsequent studies have indicated that the C terminus of TPX2 is crucial for its microtubule nucleation function, possibly by way of interacting with the kinesin-like protein Xklp2 and targeting it to the spindle poles (17Brunet S.

Overall, TPX2 appears to represent a key node in a complex network of protein:protein interactions that is required for spindle assembly (10Groen A.C. Maresca T.J. Gatlin J.C. Salmon E.D.

Previous work on the binding of classical NLSs to importin-α has established consensus sequence motifs for both monopartite and bipartite NLSs and has examined the contributions made by the different side chains involved (reviewed in Ref. 12Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Importin-α is a banana-shaped molecule constructed from a series of tandem “ARM” repeats, each of which is based on a motif containing three α-helices (20Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). NLSs bind to the inner concave surface of importin-α through interactions with a series of strategically located Trp, Asn, and acidic residues (reviewed in Refs. 5Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 6Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 12Lange A.

In addition to the ARM repeats, importin-α also has a region of ∼70 residues at its N terminus that binds to importin-β. This importin-β-binding domain (IBB) also has an auto-inhibitory role such that, when it is not bound to importin-β (most commonly when RanGTP is bound to importin-β), it can bind to the inner surface of importin-α and reduce its affinity for bound NLSs (13Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the NLS is then completed using additional factors, such as Cse1/CAS (5Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 6Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). NLSs are either monopartite, consisting of a single cluster of positively charged residues, or bipartite, based on two positively charged clusters separated by ∼10 residues, although in some cases somewhat longer linkers have been observed (21Lange A. McLane L.M. Mills R.E. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. Traffic. 2010; 11: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The residues binding to the major site are designated P1-P5 and those binding to the minor site as P′1-P′4 (Fig. 3D). Monopartite NLSs bind primarily to a site, generally referred to as the “major NLS-binding site,” located on ARM repeats 2–4, whereas bipartite NLSs bind to both this site and a second “minor” site, located on ARM repeats 7 and 8 (20Conti E.

It is crucial to have Lys in position P2 (25Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) to enable salt-bridge formation with Asp-192 and even mutation to Arg shows greatly reduced nuclear accumulation (29Harreman M.T.

Position P4, conversely, makes a smaller contribution to the binding energy (25Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and shows much greater variability between different NLSs. Positions P3 and P5 are usually Lys or Arg and make intermediate contributions to the binding energy (25Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The binding of Lys and Arg in positions P′1 and P′2 is thought to be the primary interaction at the minor NLS-binding site, with reduced contributions being made by the residues at positions P′3 and P′4 (24Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34189-34198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Hodel M.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27981-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although TPX2 binds to importin-α, it does not contain a classical NLS and instead employs a sequence including Lys-284 and Arg-285 (31Schatz C.A. Santarella R. Hoenger A. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues prevents importin-α from inhibiting TPX2-mediated microtubule assembly, as does mutation of the two sites on importin-α that are responsible for binding NLSs (7Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. Schatz C.A. Guarguaglini G. Kast. J. Wilm M. Le Bot N. Vernos I. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 31Schatz C.A. Santarella R. Hoenger A. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is to some extent paradoxical that importin-α can inhibit TPX2 so effectively in mitotic cells because a great number of normally nuclear proteins that contain classical NLSs will become accessible following nuclear envelope breakdown. Here we characterize the TPX2:importin-α interaction more fully, using a combination of structural and biochemical approaches, to establish how TPX2 binds to importin-α. We find two regions of TPX2 that interact with importin-α, one of which contains primarily residues 284–287 identified earlier (31Schatz C.A. Santarella R. Hoenger A. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and a second region that contains primarily residues 327–330. Of these regions, residues 284–287 bind more strongly and are the primary determinant of the interaction. However, these residues unexpectedly bind to the minor NLS-binding site on importin-α rather than the major site. Instead, residues 327–330 bind to the major NLS-binding site even though they do not correspond closely to the consensus binding sequence seen with classical monopartite NLSs. The predominant role of the minor NLS-binding site in the TPX2:importin-α interaction may account to some extent for ability of importin-α to bind TPX2 in the presence of many other proteins that contain a monopartite NLS and opens the possibility of generating small molecule inhibitors that may selectively inhibit this interaction. A fragment (TPX2270–350) corresponding to residues 270–350 of Xenopus TPX2 (GI: 46249461) was cloned into pGEX-TEV (14Matsuura Y. Stewart M. Nature. 2004; 432: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and expressed as GST fusions in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL cells at 20 °C overnight. Untagged mouse importin-α lacking the IBB domain (residues 70–529, ΔIBB-importin-α) was expressed as described (15Matsuura Y. Stewart M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3681-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. After harvesting, the two sets of cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT by high-pressure cavitation (15k psi). Clarified cell lysates were mixed and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h. After washing the beads extensively, the complex was released from the resin by overnight digestion with His-TEV protease (S219V mutant; Ref. 32Kapust R.B. Tözsér J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The complex was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 column in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. GST fusions containing the SV40 NLS or nucleoplasmin NLS were expressed and purified as described (33Matsuura Y. Lange A. Harriman M.T. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GST-TPX2270–289 and GST-TPX2290–350 were expressed from pGEX-TEV, whereas TPX2276–291-GFP and TPX2276–351-GFP were expressed from pET28a. Xenopus and mouse ΔIBB-importin-α constructs were expressed from pET30a as His/S-fusions. The cDNAs employed were for mouse: importin-α1, GI: 13879578; importin-α3, GI: 20073210; mouse-α4, GI: 2007072; importin-α6, GI: 13436001; and importin-α2; GI: 6754474; for Xenopus: importin-α1a, GI: 67678145; importin-α2, GI: 27696874; and importin-α5.2, GI: 48734621. Mutations in Xenopus ΔIBB-importin-α1a and mouse ΔIBB-importin-α2 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to create the following mutant constructs: mouse ΔIBB-importin-αED (D192K/E396R), mouse ΔIBB-importin-αE (E396R), mouse ΔIBB-importin-αD (D192K), Xenopus ΔIBB-importin-αED (D189K, E389R), Xenopus ΔIBB-importin-αED (E389R), and Xenopus ΔIBB-importin-αD (D189K). The resultant cDNAs were then cloned into pET30a using BamHI and EcoRI sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL cells at 20 °C overnight. His/S tagged importin-α constructs, TPX2276–291-GFP, and TPX2276–351-GFP were purified over Ni-NTA (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Proteins were further purified by gel filtration over Superdex 75 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. GST fusion proteins for pull-down experiments were purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. For standard pull-down assays, clarified bacterial cell lysates expressing the respective GST fusions were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with cell lysates expressing the various importin-α constructs. For competition pull-down experiments, GST-NLS fusion proteins (4.5 μg) were bound to 10 μl of glutathione Sepharose and incubated with ΔIBB-importin-α (10 μg) ± 30 μm of the indicated TPX2-GFP constructs in 100 μl of binding buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and 2 mm DTT) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3× in 500 μl of binding buffer, and bound proteins were subsequently eluted with SDS-sample buffer. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Crystals of the TPX2:importin-α complex were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion in which 2-μl drops of protein solution were mixed with 2 μl drops of well buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1.1–1.2 m ammonium sulfate and 10 mm DTT and equilibrated in Linbro plates at 18 °C. Diffraction data were collected from single crystals soaked briefly in crystallization buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol and flash frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen stream. A native data set was obtained using beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Research facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France (Table 1). The crystals had P212121 orthorhombic symmetry with and were isomorphous to the crystals formed by the complex between importin-α: and the nucleoplasmin NLS (Ref. 23Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar; PDB accession code 1EYJ). The importin-α chain was positioned by rigid body refinement and then subjected to iterative cycles of refinement and rebuilding using PHENIX (34Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W.

Acta Cryst. 2004; D60: 2126-2132Crossref Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), after which there was clear difference density located in both NLS-binding pockets and many side chains of the bound peptide could be identified unequivocally. TPX2 residues 283–288 were built into the density located at the minor site whereas residues 322–331 were built into the major site. There was very clear side-chain density for the residue in position P1 in the major NLS-binding site, which confirmed that the principal TPX2 NLS was not bound in this position (because the corresponding residue would be Gly). A final model was obtained after further cycles of refinement and rebuilding and the addition of five sulfate ions and 227 waters.

However, the Xenopus TPX2 NLS that binds to importin-α involves a sequence around two basic residues at positions 284 and 285 that does not fit the classical NLS consensus (31Schatz C.A.

Although the precise boundaries of the TPX2 NLS had not been established in earlier work, we found that a fragment containing residues 270–289 (TPX2270–289) was able to bind a range of vertebrate importin-α constructs from which the autoinhibitory IBB domain had been deleted (Fig. 2). The ΔIBB-importin-α constructs mimic the importin-α:β complex that binds NLSs in vivo (12Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Thus, GST-TPX2270–289was able to bind specifically to ΔIBB constructs of Xenopus importin-α1a, -α2, and -α5.2 and also mouse importin-α1, -α2, -α4, and -α6, from crude bacterial lysates, whereas negligible binding was seen to GST alone. This result was consistent with the TPX2 NLS having the broad binding specificity seen with classical NLSs. Attempts to crystallize ΔIBB-importin-α complexed with TPX2276–289 only resulted in very small crystals that were not suitable for data collection. Therefore, we screened complexes of ΔIBB-importin-α bound to a range of longer TPX2 fragments and found that the complex formed with TPX2 residues 270–350 yielded crystals with P212121 orthorhombic symmetry that diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation (Table 1). The crystals were isomorphous with those obtained previously for the importin-α:nucleoplasmin-NLS complex (Ref. 23Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar; PDB accession number 1EYJ) and rigid body refinement enabled the importin-α chain to be modeled using the structure determined previously. After initial refinement and rebuilding, there was clear density located over both the minor and major NLS binding pockets (Fig. 3A). Although this density was not continuous, the sequence of fragments corresponding to residues 283–288 and 322–331 of TPX2 could be built easily into the difference density and, after adding five sulfates and 227 waters, resulted in a final structural model with an R-factor of 18.3% (Rfree 21.2%), excellent geometry (Table 1) and a MolProbity (39Davis I.W.

We present observations of the ratio of heavily-obscured to unobscured quasars as a function of cosmic epoch up to z~3, and show that a simple physical model describing mergers of massive, gas-rich galaxies matches these observations. In the context of this model, every obscured and unobscured quasar represent two distinct phases that result from a massive galaxy merger event. Much of the mass growth of the SMBH occurs during the heavily-obscured phase. These observations provide additional evidence for a causal link between gas-rich galaxy mergers, accretion onto the nuclear SMBH and coeval star formation."

Here we report ROS-mediated induction of apoptosis by xanthohumol (XN) from hops. XN at concentrations of 1.6-25 microM induced an immediate and transient increase in superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-*)) formation in 3 human cancer cell lines (average+/-SD EC(50) of maximum O(2)(-*) induction=3.1+/-0.8 microM), murine macrophages (EC(50)=4.0+/-0.3 microM), and BPH-1 benign prostate hyperplasia cells (EC(50)=4.3+/-0.1 microM), as evidenced by the O(2)(-*)-specific indicator dihydroethidium. MitoSOX Red costaining and experiments using isolated mouse liver mitochondria (EC(50)=11.4+/-1.8 microM) confirmed mitochondria as the site of intracellular O(2)(-*) formation. Antimycin A served as positive control (EC(50)=12.4+/-0.9 microM). XN-mediated O(2)(-*) release was significantly reduced in BPH-1 rho(0) cells harboring nonfunctional mitochondria (EC(50)>25 microM) and by treatment of BPH-1 cells with vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), or the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTMPyP. In addition, we demonstrated a rapid 15% increase in oxidized glutathione and a dose-dependent overall thiol depletion within 6 h (IC(50)=24.3+/-11 microM). Respiratory chain complexes I-III were weakly inhibited by XN in bovine heart submitochondrial particles, but electron flux from complex I and II to complex III was significantly inhibited in BPH-1 cells, with IC(50) values of 28.1 +/- 2.4 and 24.4 +/- 5.2 microM, respectively. Within 15 min, intracellular ATP levels were significantly reduced by XN at 12.5 to 50 microM concentrations (IC(50)=26.7+/-3.7 microM). Concomitantly, XN treatment caused a rapid breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis induction. Pre- or coincubation with 2 mM NAC and 50 microM MnTMPyP at various steps increased XN-mediated IC(50) values for cytotoxicity in BPH-1 cells from 6.7 +/- 0.2 to 12.2 +/- 0.1 and 41.4 +/- 7.6 microM, and it confirmed XN-induced O(2)(-*) as an essential trigger for apoptosis induction. In summary, we have identified mitochondria as a novel cellular target of XN action, resulting in increased O(2)(-*) production, disruption of cellular redox balance and mitochondrial integrity, and subsequent apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2132876679,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prevalent and complex disease, characterized by the variable coexistence of obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinaemia, and hypertension. The alarming rise in the prevalence of metabolic disorders makes it imperative to innovate preventive or therapeutic measures for MetS and its complications. However, the elucidation of the pathogenesis of MetS has been hampered by the lack of realistic models. For example, the existing animal models of MetS, i.e., genetically engineered rodents, imitate certain aspects of the disease, while lacking other important components. Defining the natural course of MetS in a spontaneous animal model of the disease would be desirable. Here, we introduce the Nile grass rat (NGR), Arvicanthis niloticus, as a novel model of MetS. Studies of over 1100 NGRs in captivity, fed normal chow, revealed that most of these animals spontaneously develop dyslipidemia (P < 0.01), and hyperglycemia (P < 0.01) by 1 yr of age. Further characterization showed that the diabetic rats develop liver steatosis, abdominal fat accumulation, nephropathy, atrophy of pancreatic islets of Langerhans, fatty streaks in the aorta, and hypertension (P < 0.01). Diabetic NGRs in the early phase of the disease develop hyperinsulinemia, and show a strong inverse correlation between plasma adiponectin and HbA1c levels (P < 0.01). These data indicate that the NGR is a valuable, spontaneous model for exploring the etiology and pathophysiology of MetS as well as its various complications.—Noda, K., Melhorn, M.

In this study, we investigated the biochemical features and maturation process of SpyCEP, starting from a recombinant form of the protease expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. We show that active recombinant SpyCEP differs from other bacterial proteases in that it is constituted by 2 noncovalently linked fragments derived from autocatalytic processing, an N-terminal fragment of 210 aa bearing one of the 3 catalytic triad residues, and a 1369-residue C-terminal polypeptide containing the remaining 2 catalytic amino acids. The same type of organization is present in the enzyme obtained from S. pyogenes. Furthermore, N-terminal SpyCEP is not involved in the folding of the mature enzyme. The 2 protease fragments were separately expressed in E. coli as soluble polypeptides that, when combined, reconstituted a fully active enzyme complex. Therefore, SpyCEP appears to possess a completely new structural architecture that has not been described so far for other microbial proteases.—Zingaretti, C., Falugi, F., Nardi-Dei, V., Pietrocola, G., Mariani, M., Liberatori, S., Gallotta, M., Tontini, M., Tani, C., Speziale, P., Grandi, G., Margarit, I.

We report an Australian tyrannosauroid, represented by a pubis from the late Early Cretaceous of Victoria. This demonstrates that these extraordinarily successful predators were not restricted to Laurasia. The advanced morphology and small size of the specimen shows that tyrannosauroids with the characteristic short arms and robust skulls probably had a global distribution in the Early Cretaceous.

https://openalex.org/W2017507172,"Recent studies have implicated Epac2, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the Rap subfamily of monomeric G proteins, as an important regulator of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. Although the Epac proteins were originally identified as cAMP-responsive activators of Rap1 GTPases, the role of Rap1 in β-cell biology has not yet been defined. In this study, we examined the direct effects of Rap1 signaling on β-cell biology. Using the Ins-1 rat insulinoma line, we demonstrate that activated Rap1A, but not related monomeric G proteins, promotes ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Using isolated rat islets, we show that this signaling event is rapamycin-sensitive, indicating that it is mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1-p70 S6 kinase pathway, a known growth regulatory pathway. This newly defined β-cell signaling pathway acts downstream of cAMP, in parallel with the stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, to drive ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Activated Rap1A promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, islet cell hypertrophy, and islet cell proliferation, the latter exclusively through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, suggesting that Rap1 is an important regulator of β-cell function. This newly defined signaling pathway may yield unique targets for the treatment of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes."

MTs exist as networks that dynamically and rapidly reorganize during different phases of the cell cycle. Spontaneous growth as well as shortening at the ends is indispensable for functional rearrangement. For example, they form the mitotic spindle during M phase, which mediates chromosome segregation during cell division based on the nature of dynamic rearrangement of MTs (reviewed in Refs. 1Desai A.

Many cellular events involving MTs are driven not only by autonomous polymerization and dissociation of tubulin but also by MT-severing enzymes.

In general, AAA-ATPases are believed to act as protein unfoldases that promote various cellular events, including dissociation of protein complexes, MT severing, protein degradation, protein translocation across organelle membranes, vesicle fusions, and multivesicular body formation (reviewed in Refs. 14Lupas A.N.

MIT domains are small helical domains involved in protein-protein interactions that are conserved among Vps4, spartin, spastin, and some other proteins (24Ciccarelli F.D. Proukakis C. Patel H. Cross H. Azam S. Patton M.A. Bork P. Crosby A.H. Genomics. 2003; 81: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In this study, we present the solution structure of kp60-NTD. We show that this structure is closely related to that of the MIT domain. In this context, the overall molecular architecture of kp60 resembles other MIT domain-containing type I AAA-ATPases, such as the MT-severing enzyme spastin and the ESCRT-III disassembling enzyme Vps4 (Fig. 1A). Because the isolated kp60-NTD solely binds tubulin in vitro, the domain is a novel tubulin binding domain. Finally, the key residues of kp60-NTD for binding tubulin were determined. A model for MT binding is further discussed, which allows us to propose a model for the mechanism of MT severing by katanin.

In our previous study, we successfully isolated a folded structural domain from the kp60 N-terminal region (termed kp60-NTD) (17Iwaya N. Goda N. Unzai S. Fujiwara K. Tanaka T. Tomii K. Tochio H.

Akiyama Y. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 594-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and FUGUE (23Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar)) can detect substantial similarities between kp60-NTD and MIT domains. MIT domains are small helical domains involved in protein-protein interactions that are conserved among Vps4, spartin, spastin, and some other proteins (24Ciccarelli F.D. Proukakis C. Patel H. Cross H. Azam S. Patton M.A. Bork P. Crosby A.H. Genomics. 2003; 81: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In this study, we present the solution structure of kp60-NTD. We show that this structure is closely related to that of the MIT domain. In this context, the overall molecular architecture of kp60 resembles other MIT domain-containing type I AAA-ATPases, such as the MT-severing enzyme spastin and the ESCRT-III disassembling enzyme Vps4 (Fig. 1A). Because the isolated kp60-NTD solely binds tubulin in vitro, the domain is a novel tubulin binding domain. Finally, the key residues of kp60-NTD for binding tubulin were determined. A model for MT binding is further discussed, which allows us to propose a model for the mechanism of MT severing by katanin."

Here we report the development of an amphipathic peptide linker that enables postformulation editing of payloads without the need for reformulation to achieve multiplexing capability for lipidic nanocarriers. To exemplify the flexibility of this peptide linker strategy, 3 applications were demonstrated: converting nontargeted nanoparticles into targeting vehicles;adding cargo to preformulated targeted nanoparticles for in vivo site-specific delivery;and labeling living cells for in vivo tracking. This strategy is expected to enhance the clinical application of molecular imaging and/or targeted therapeutic agents by offering extended flexibility for multiplexing targeting ligands and/or drug payloads that can be selected after base nanocarrier formulation.—Pan, H., Myerson, J.

https://openalex.org/W2146494711,"A two-dimensional gas of electrons is a powerful test-bed of the fundamental physics of interacting particles, and has been much studied in the context of integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. The latest observations of this system by Oliver Dial and colleagues reveal that it still holds some surprises in store: they observe prominent structure in the high-energy single particle spectrum that cannot be readily explained by existing models of this otherwise thoroughly investigated system. A two-dimensional gas of electrons is a powerful test-bed for the fundamental physics of interacting particles, and has been much studied in the context of integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. The latest observations of this system reveal prominent structure in the high energy single particle spectrum that cannot be readily explained with existing models of this system. The two-dimensional electron system is a powerful laboratory for investigating the physics of interacting particles. Application of a large magnetic field produces massively degenerate quantum levels known as Landau levels; within a Landau level the kinetic energy of the electrons is suppressed, and electron–electron interactions set the only energy scale1. Coulomb interactions break the degeneracy of the Landau levels and can cause the electrons to order into complex ground states. Here we observe, in the high energy single particle spectrum of this system, salient and unexpected structure that extends across a wide range of Landau level filling fractions. The structure appears only when the two-dimensional electron system is cooled to very low temperatures, indicating that it arises from delicate ground state correlations. We characterize this structure by its evolution with changing electron density and applied magnetic field, and present two possible models for understanding these observations. Some of the energies of the features agree qualitatively with what might be expected for composite fermions, which have proven effective for interpreting other experiments in this regime. At the same time, a simple model with electrons localized on ordered lattice sites also generates structure similar to that observed in the experiment. Neither of these models alone is sufficient to explain the observations across the entire range of densities measured. The discovery of this unexpected prominent structure in the single particle spectrum of an otherwise thoroughly studied system suggests that there exist core features of the two-dimensional electron system that have yet to be understood."
https://openalex.org/W2110360571,"Several studies with mast cells from knock-out mice have suggested that the tyrosine kinase Fyn and its downstream substrate Gab2 may play a role in high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI)-mediated mast cell activation. To better understand the role of these two molecules and of Syk, we transiently transfected mast cells with small interference RNA (siRNA) targeted to Fyn, Gab2, or Syk to specifically decrease their expression. The siRNA suppression of Gab2 but not Fyn reduced activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway as demonstrated by the change in phosphorylation of Akt; this indicates that Gab2 but not Fyn regulates this pathway. The decreased expression of Gab2 and Fyn had minor effects on degranulation. There were also some minor changes in activation of the NFAT or NFkappaB transcription factors in cells with reduced expression of Fyn or Gab2. Decreased Gab2 but not Fyn reduced the FcepsilonRI-induced activation of the Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinases and the release of TNF-alpha. In contrast, decreased expression of Syk dramatically reduced FcepsilonRI-induced degranulation, activation of NFAT and NFkappaB. Therefore, the reduction in expression of these proteins in mast cells indicates that Syk is the major regulator of FcepsilonRI-mediated reactions, whereas Fyn has minor if any effects and Gab2 regulates primarily late events including MAP kinase activation and release of cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2096532524,"Monitoring the dynamics of protein-protein interactions in their natural environment remains a challenge. Resonance energy transfer approaches represent a promising avenue to directly probe these interactions in real time. The present study aims at establishing a proof of principle that bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) can be used to study the regulation of protein-protein interaction in cells from transgenic animals. A transgenic mouse line coexpressing the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor fused to Renilla luciferase (beta(2)AR-Rluc) and beta arrestin-2 fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP2-beta arr2) was generated. The fusion proteins were found to be functional in the transgenic animals and the beta(2)AR-Rluc maintained pharmacological properties, comparable to that of the native receptor. Sufficiently high luminescence signal was generated to allow detection of BRET in testis cells where the beta(2)AR-Rluc transgene was expressed at levels significantly higher than that of the endogenous receptor in this tissue but remain within physiological range when compared with other beta(2)AR-expressing tissues. Stimulation with a beta-adrenergic agonist led to a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in BRET, which reflected ligand-promoted recruitment of beta arr2 to the receptor. Our study demonstrates that BRET can be used to monitor the dynamic regulation of protein-protein interactions in cells derived from transgenic mice."

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1980; 42: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). SRs affect biological outcomes by regulating target gene mRNA levels through transcriptional activation and active repression. The glucocorticoid (GC) steroids are the primary stress hormones released by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in humans and regulate numerous physiological processes, including homeostasis, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism (2Chrousos G.P.

Disruption of GC signaling is a component of many diverse disease states, including depression, leukemia, and asthma. Natural and synthetic GCs are among the most prescribed drugs for their anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressive profiles. However, long term GC treatment may result in severe side effects including diabetes, glaucoma, and osteoporosis (2Chrousos G.P. Kino T.

The first localized step in translating a glucocorticoid signal toward a genomic outcome is the binding of GC to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the cytosol. In the absence of hormone, GR is sequestered outside the nucleus where it is stabilized by regulatory complexes of chaperone proteins, which include Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, HOP, and p23 (5Pratt W.B.

GR is a modular scaffolding protein, consisting of three major functional domains. The N-terminal 400 residues comprise a mostly unstructured region that harbors a transcriptional activation region dubbed activation function 1 (AF-1). AF-1 can bind co-regulator proteins, and its transcriptional activity is not ligand-dependent (20Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol.

Residues 430–500 compose a direct DNA binding domain that is the most well conserved domain across all nuclear receptors (NRs) (22Baumann H. Paulsen K. Kovács H. Berglund H. Wright A.P.

Kaptein R. Science. 1990; 249: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). GR forms homodimers through this domain and uses zinc finger motifs coded in this region to recognize and bind specific glucocorticoid binding sequences associated with target genes on DNA (25Kumar R. Thompson E.B. J Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study elucidated a role for the DNA binding domain and the specific glucocorticoid binding sequence to which it is bound in allosteric, interdomain communication through the receptor (26Meijsing S.H. Pufall M.A. So A.Y. Bates D.L. Chen L. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 2009; 324: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 250 residues of GR encompass the ligand binding domain (LBD), which initiates the cell response to GCs. GR preference for its natural hormone cortisol evolved through mutations in the LBD ∼400 million years ago when it diverged from the mineralocorticoid receptor (27Ortlund E.A. Bridgham J.T. Redinbo M.R. Thornton J.W. Science. 2007; 317: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the molecular basis of its evolved specificity involves mutations at the receptor-hormone interface as well as sets of permissive mutations to other regions of the LBD shown to be critical in stabilizing a functional receptor conformation (27Ortlund E.A. Bridgham J.T. Redinbo M.R. Thornton J.W. Science. 2007; 317: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28Bridgham J.T. Ortlund E.A. Thornton J.W.

Well conserved through the nuclear receptor superfamily, the LBD is a three-layered α-helical sandwich structure whose hydrophobic core is completed by lipophilic hormone binding to the protein interior (30Wagner R.L.

Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The surface of the nuclear receptor LBD typically contains at least two protein-protein interaction sites; they are a dimerization surface, more prevalent in the class II receptors (thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor) that are regulated by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (33Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar), and a co-regulator protein docking site, termed activation function-2 (AF-2). Composed of residues from helices 3, 4, 5, and 12, AF-2 is a shallow, mainly hydrophobic groove surrounded by polar residues that allows for specific docking of co-regulators to the LBD surface (34Darimont B.D.

Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The intrinsic functionality of co-regulators is varied, with many implicated in chromatin remodeling and recruitment of the basal transcription machinery (44Belandia B. Parker M.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 45Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). As their docking to nuclear receptors typically follows ligand binding and subsequent localization to the nucleus, co-regulators represent a vital, cell-specific layer of control that can be employed to modify the cellular response to hormone. Both co-activators and co-repressors interact with NR LBDs by docking short, amphipathic, helical segments at the AF-2 surface (34Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J.

The canonical co-activator NR box is composed of the sequence LXXLL, where L is leucine, and X is any amino acid. The most well characterized co-activators, the p160 family (40Hong H. Kohli K.

Interestingly, many NRs assayed show different patterns of co-regulator binding based on the identity of the ligand in the binding pocket, implying allosteric coupling between the two sites. This report presents the first quantitative assessment of coupling between GR LBD key functional sites. Allosteric modulation of ligand binding kinetics by co-regulators at the AF-2 surface is revealed and characterized using fluorescence polarization (FP). A similar technique is applied to determine and quantify the pattern of co-regulator binding to agonist-bound GR LBD using a library of 18 NR box peptides from physiologically important co-regulators. Additionally, the mechanism of action of a recently discovered mutation with profound functional consequences in the cell is elucidated (57Ricketson D. Hostick U. Fang L. Yamamoto K.R. Darimont B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Together these results represent a first step in the development of a quantitative framework for the description of coupling between the co-regulator docking site and the ligand binding site. Human GR LBD (520–777, F602S, C638D with/without M752I) was expressed as a His6 fusion protein from a modified pACYCDuet vector in Escherichia coli strain BL21Star. The encoded GR sequence was optimized for expression in E. coli (GeneArt, Burlingame, CA). Expression and purification were carried out as described (58Kroe R.R. Baker M.A. Brown M.P. Farrow N.A. Gautschi E. Hopkins J.L. LaFrance R.R. Kronkaitis A. Freeman D. Thomson D. Nabozny G. Grygon C.A. Labadia M.E. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 128: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage of the His6 tag was carried out during dialysis into storage buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm TCEP, 0.04% CHAPS, 10 μm dexamethasone. Ligand-free GR for fluorescence studies was prepared in two manners. For GRSD (F602S, C638D), ligand removal was accomplished by passage over a NAP-25 desalting column (GE Healthcare). For GRM752I (F602S, C638D, M752I), dialysis into storage buffer without dexamethasone followed by passage over a NAP-25 column was necessary. NR box peptides were obtained from Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, CA) with the exception of SRC1-3 and SRC3-3, which were generous gifts of Dr. R. K. Guy. SRC1-3 and SRC3-3 each contain a non-native N-terminal cysteine residue to allow for easy coupling of fluorescent probes. All other NR box sequences are wild type. Peptide sequences are as follows: SRC1-2, CPSSHSSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPS; SRC1-3, CESKDHQLLRYLLDKDEKDL; SRC1-4, AQQKSLLQQLLTE; SRC2-1, SKGQTKLLQLLTCSS; SRC2-2, KHKILHRLLQDSS; SRC2-3, KENALLRYLLDKDD; SRC3-3, CKKENNALLRYLLDRDDPSD; PGC1α-1, EPSLLKKLLLAPAN; ARA70-2, TSEKFKLLFQ; Hsp90-1, NLCKIMKDILEK; Hsp90-2, GWTANMERIMKAQ; DAX1-1, QWQGSILYNMLMSAK; DAX1-2, PRQGSILYSMLTSAK; DAX1-3, PRQGSILYSLLTSSK; SHP-1, ASHPTILYTLLSPGP; SHP-2, APVPSILKKILLEEPNS; SMRT-1, RVVTLAQHISEVITQDYTR; SMRT-2, TNMGLEAIIRKALMGKYD. All fluorescence polarization experiments were carried out in black, non-binding surface, 384-well plates (Corning) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm TCEP, 0.04% CHAPS at room temperature. Kinetic measurements were performed on a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). For association measurements, GR was incubated with the specified peptide for 15 min at room temperature followed by the addition of dexamethasone-fluorescein (Invitrogen) at t = 0. Final concentrations of components were 1 μm GR, 10 μm peptide, and 20 nm dexamethasone-fluorescein. Timed measurements were taken typically every 30 s or 1 min until after the reaction had reached equilibrium. Dissociation was initiated by the addition of 50 μm unlabeled dexamethasone, and measurements were taken until equilibrium was reached. Data were fit using nonlinear regression to one-phase association or one-phase decay models in Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). All values reported represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. All fluorescence polarization experiments were carried out in black, non-binding surface, 384-well plates (Corning), in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm TCEP, 0.04% CHAPS at room temperature. 1 μm GRSD or 500 nm GRM752I was incubated with 40 nm fluorescein-labeled dexamethasone (dex-fl) until equilibrium was reached. GR·dex-fl was diluted 1:1 into samples of peptide from 200 μm to 30 nm prepared by serial dilution. Final concentrations of components were 500 nm GRSD, 20 nm dex-fl, 100 μm–15 nm peptide or 250 nm GRM752I, 20 nm dex-fl, 50 μm–7.5 nm peptide. Steady-state affinity measurements were performed on an Analyst AD, Analyst HT, or SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Data were fit by nonlinear regression to a one-site saturation binding model in Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). All values reported represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. SRC1-3 and SRC3-3 peptides were synthesized with a non-native cysteine at the N terminus to allow easy coupling to fluorescent probes (51Moore J.M. Galicia S.J. McReynolds A.C. Nguyen N.H.

Maleimide-Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was coupled to each peptide in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 0.4 mm TCEP at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with β-mercaptoethanol, and the peptides were separated from free probe using a Superdex Peptide column on an Akta Explorer FPLC (GE Healthcare). Peptide concentration was determined using λ = 280 nm absorbance, with the appropriate correction factor applied to account for the Alexa Fluor 555 contribution to the signal. Binding measurements were made in either FP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.04% CHAPS, 0.2 mm TCEP) or FP plus 10 μm dex at room temperature on a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). NR box-fluor, present at 20 nm in all wells, was titrated with GR from 10 μm to 4.5 nm. Isotherms were analyzed and fit by nonlinear regression to a single-site saturation binding model in Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).

Biochemical interrogation of GR LBD and its various interaction partners has long been hindered by difficulty in obtaining stable, functional receptors for in vitro studies. The majority of published work using recombinantly expressed GR LBD, including this study, has been aided by incorporation of solubility-enhancing mutations discovered by yeast screens of GR activity (58Kroe R.R.

To assess the functionality of purified GR LBD, binding kinetics of dex-fl (Fig. 1A) were measured using fluorescence polarization (Fig. 2). dex-fl is a fluorescent analogue of the potent, synthetic GC dexamethasone that has been shown to bind GR with a similar affinity (65Lin S.

https://openalex.org/W2154760216,"Interleukin-31 (IL-31) is a recently described T cell-derived cytokine, mainly produced by T helper type 2 cells and related to the IL-6 cytokine family according to its structure and receptor. IL-31 is the ligand for a heterodimeric receptor composed of a gp130-like receptor (GPL) associated with the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR). A link between IL-31 and atopic dermatitis was shown by studying the phenotype of IL-31 transgenic mice and IL-31 gene haplotypes in patients suffering from dermatitis. In this study, we generated a potent IL-31 antagonist formed by external portions of OSMR and GPL fused with a linker. This fusion protein, OSMR-L-GPL, consisting of 720 amino acids, counteracted the binding of IL-31 to its membrane receptor complex and the subsequent signaling events involving the STATs and MAPK pathways. Neutralizing effects were found in IL-31-sensitive cell lines, including brain-derived cells and primary cultures of keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1984002284,"NORE1A is a Ras-binding protein that belongs to a group of tumor suppressors known as the Ras association domain family. Their growth- and tumor-suppressive function is assumed to be dependent on association with the microtubule cytoskeleton. However, a detailed understanding of this interplay is still missing. Here, we show that NORE1A directly interacts with tubulin and is capable of nucleating microtubules. Strikingly, the ability to stimulate nucleation is regulated in a dual specific way either via phosphorylation of NORE1A within the Ras-binding domain by Aurora A kinase or via binding to activated Ras. We also demonstrate that NORE1A mediates a negative effect of activated Ras on microtubule nucleation. On the basis of our results, we propose a novel regulatory network composed of the tumor suppressor NORE1A, the mitotic kinase Aurora A, the small GTPase Ras, and the microtubule cytoskeleton."
