https://openalex.org/W2029768920,"The origin, termination, and length of axonal growth after focal central nervous system injury was examined in adult rats by means of a new experimental model. When peripheral nerve segments were used as ""bridges"" between the medulla and spinal cord, axons from neurons at both these levels grew approximately 30 millimeters. The regenerative potential of these central neurons seems to be expressed when the central nervous system glial environment is changed to that of the peripheral nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1983851236,"Vitamin A is known to exert an important influence on epithelial differentiation. The fetal calf serum supplement of cell-culture medium contains enough of the vitamin to affect the differentiation of cultured keratinocytes derived from epidermis and from other stratified squamous epithelia. The cellular and molecular properties of the cultures are altered when the medium is supplemented with serum from which the vitamin A has been removed by solvent extraction (delipidized serum). Cell motility is reduced, the adhesiveness of cells increases and pattern formation is prevented. In both epidermal and conjunctival keratinocytes, removal of vitamin A leads to the synthesis of a 67 kd keratin characteristic of terminally differentiating epidermis and to much reduced synthesis of the 52 kd and 40 kd keratins typical of conjunctiva. These changes, both cellular and molecular, are reversed by the addition of retinyl acetate to the medium containing delipidized serum. Cell motility and pattern formation are restored, and detachment of the most mature cells from the surface of the stratified epithelium is promoted. Synthesis of the 67 kd keratin is prevented and the synthesis of the 40 and 52 kd keratins is stimulated. The nature of the keratins synthesized is regulated by the concentration of vitamin A, and each cell type adjusts its synthesis differently at a given vitamin concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2087354339,"Fibroblasts contain a specific internalization pathway that carries hormones as well as some proteins and viruses from the cell surface to the cell interior. Initially, the ligands bind to mobile receptors that are randomly distributed on the cell surface. Next the ligand-receptor complexes are trapped and concentrated in specialized regions of the membrane termed bristle-coated pits. From the pit a smooth-walled vesicle containing the ligand forms and carries the ligand to the cell interior. Because of its role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, this vesicle has been termed a ""receptosome."""
https://openalex.org/W1521920054,"Activated is an oxygenated iron drug complex which embodies the drug's DNA-cleaving activity. This activity is exercised on DNA, if present, but if DNA is absent, the drug itself is inactivated. Hyperfine interactions in the EPR spectra of activated bleomycin prepared with 57Fe(II) and 17O2 demonstrate the presence of iron as Fe(III) and of bound oxygen originating in dioxygen. Bleomycin can also be activated with Fe(III) and either H2O2 or ethyl hydroperoxide. These latter reactions do not produce a ferrous intermediate nor do they require O2. But O2 is required for the reaction of activated bleomycin with DNA to yield the malondialdehyde-like chromogens used to monitor DNA degradation. The attack on DNA is quantitatively concurrent with the decay of activated bleomycin, however generated."

The purified interferon exhibited a single band of Mr = approximately 19,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid analysis and the NH2-terminal sequence were consistent with the sequence predicted from the DNA. Some of the purified product contained NH2-terminal methionine; the terminal methionine was removed from the rest of the chains."
https://openalex.org/W2087811918,"We examined the keratin proteins of nine cell lines cultured from human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the epidermis and oral epithelium. All of these lines contained the four major keratins (46 kd, 50 kd, 56 kd and 58 kd) found in normal keratinocytes cultured from these epithelia. A 40 kd protein was also present in the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction of three of the lines. The 40 kd protein had an isoelectric point of 5.3, near that of the 46 kd and 50 kd keratins. It was precipitated by an antiserum against total s. corneum keratins, and also by an antiserum against purified 46 kd keratin. An antiserum raised against the purified 40 kd protein had a high titer against the 40 kd protein, detected by immunoprecipitation, and did not crossreact with the 46–58 kd keratins. The anti-40 kd serum stained, by indirect immunofluorescence, a cytoplasmic filament network in cells of the SCC lines that synthesize the 40 kd protein. These filaments were of a pattern indistinguishable from that stained by antiserum against total s. corneum keratins, and the pattern was not altered by pretreatment of the cells with colcemid. The anti-40 kd serum did not stain the SCC lines that do not synthesize the 40 kd protein; normal human newborn foreskin keratinocytes or fibroblasts; or 3T3, HeLa or XB cells. Keratinocytes cultured from uninvolved epidermal or oral tissue of patients whose tumors had given rise to SCC lines that synthesize the 40 kd protein were also not stained by the anti-40 kd serum. Synthesis of the 40 kd protein was greatly reduced in tumors formed by the SCC lines that make this protein in culture. Partial proteolytic digestion maps of the 40 kd protein were unique, but very similar to those of the 46–58 kd keratins. These results constitute strong evidence that the 40 kd protein is a keratin, and is neither a breakdown product nor an incomplete translation product of a gene for one of the larger keratins. It is the smallest epidermal keratin yet to be described. The 40 kd keratin may be the product of a normally unexpressed gene or transcript that often becomes activated during the course of keratinocyte transformation. Like the larger keratins, the level of its expression is regulated and is different in cells growing in vivo and in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1991881272,"Regulation of the putative peptide neurotransmitter substance P was examined in the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion of the neonatal rat. Surgical decentralization (denervation) of the superior cervical ganglion increased ganglion substance P content. In cultured ganglia, the amount of substance P increased more than 50-fold after 48 hours, and this rise was dependent on protein and RNA synthesis. Veratridine prevented the increase in substance P in vitro, and tetrodotoxin blocked the veratridine effect; this suggests that sodium influx and membrane depolarization prevent substance P elevation. Immunohistochemical analysis of cultured ganglia indicated that substance P was present in the perikarya of principal sympathetic neurons and in ganglionic nerve processes. Transsynaptic impulses, through the mediation of postsynaptic sodium influx, may decrease substance P in sympathetic neurons."

The IFN-B was administered intrathecally by serial lumbar punctures. There was no significant change in the exacerbation rates of ten multiple sclerosis control patients before and during the period of observation. The IFN-B recipients have now been on the study a mean of 1.5 years, the controls, 1.2 years. The clinical condition of five of the IFN-B recipients and one of the control patients has improved, whereas the condition of five of the controls and one of the IFN-B recipients has deteriorated (P < .036). These findings warrant cautious optimism about the efficacy of intrathecal IFN-B in altering the course of multiple sclerosis and support concepts of a viral or dysimmune etiology of the disease."

We have now demonstrated that mouse IgG3 antibodies to the phosphocholine (PC) determinant of pneumococcal C-carbohydrate5,6 and to type 3 pneumococcal polysaccharide are highly protective against experimental type 3 pneumococcal infection. This is the first demonstration that antibodies of the IgG3 subclass can protect against bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W1566206070,"While folate binding proteins have been described in serum and a variety of tissues, the function of these proteins is unknown. A particulate folate binding protein from human placenta has been isolated and characterized following solubilization with Triton X-100. The protein was purified 61,000-fold using affinity chromatography on pteroylglutamic acid-Sepharose as the major purification step. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the purified protein gave a single band with a Mr = 38,500. Stoichiometry of binding indicated that 1 mol of folate was bound per mol of protein. The protein was a glycoprotein that contained 12% carbohydrate. Antiserum was raised in a rabbit, and on immunodiffusion, gave a single precipitin line with the purified placental folate binding protein. Immunoprecipitation studies using this antiserum indicated that the purified placental folate binding protein shared antigenic determinants with both the large Mr and small Mr folate binding proteins from human milk. Immunofluorescent studies with this antiserum and human erythrocytes revealed the presence of an immunologically similar protein on the plasma membrane of these cells suggesting that this protein may function as a folate receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1501360839,"We have investigated the ATPase activity of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen by using monoclonal antibodies as specific probes of enzymatic activity. Three hybridoma cell lines secreting anti-T antigen antibodies were derived from mice that were immunized with D2 T antigen, an SV40 T antigen-related protein. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by these hybridomas bind to three distinct T-antigen determinants. In order to bind to T antigen, the three antibodies required amino acid residues coded by the region of the A gene between 0.37 and 0.29 map unit. Two of these antibodies (DL3C3 and DL3C4) strongly inhibited T antigen ATPase activity. The third antibody (DL3C5) only weakly inhibited the ATPase activity possibly by decreasing the affinity of T antigen for ATP. These results demonstrate that the ATPase activity is intrinsic to T antigen and suggest that the ATPase function of T antigen maps on the SV40 A gene between 0.37 and 0.29 map unit. A T antigen-specific ATPase assay capable of detecting low levels of T antigen in crude extracts of SV40 infected cells was developed by using 3C5 to immobilize an active form of the enzyme. These results indicate that monoclonal antibodies can be used as probes of enzyme structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W1582995886,"Recently, we have found that defibrination of rats with Malayan pit viper venom induces a 10-38-fold increase in the levels of translatable fibrinogen mRNA in the liver. We have used this response to obtain cDNA clones for the three polypeptide chains of rat fibrinogen. A large cDNA library was created in pBR322 from induced rat liver polyadenylated RNA by the poly(dG, dC)-tailing method. Part of this library was screened using colony hybridization with [32P]cDNA prepared from induced and noninduced rat liver RNA. Colonies consistently giving a more intense signal with the induced [32P]cDNA were considered possible fibrinogen recombinants and were used for hybrid selection and translation of mRNA. In this way, cDNA clones for each of the three fibrinogen mRNA's were identified. Analysis of polyadenylated RNA by Northern blotting indicates that the three chains are synthesized from mRNA's of 2300, 2050, and 1950 nucleotides for the alpha, beta, and gamma chains, respectively. The fact tha each of the three chains has a separate mRNA indicates that the highly coordinated regulation of the three messages for rat fibrinogen does not occur by translation of a common cytoplasmic RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1520592610,"Previous studies of the human cell line RPMI-2650 (wild type) and its canavanine-resistant variants have demonstrated differences in argininosuccinate synthetase activity as follows: canavanine-resistant much greater than wild type grown in citrulline greater than wild type grown in arginine (Su, T.-S., Beaudet, A. L., and O'Brien, W. E. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 2956-2960). A recombinant plasmid containing a 1.55-kilobase insert complementary to the mRNA for human argininosuccinate synthetase was isolated by the combined use of differential colony hybridization and immunoprecipitation of the products of plasmid-selected mRNA translation. Both blot and dot hybridization analysis of polyadenylated RNA indicated a major mRNA species of 1.67 kilobase in all cells, and the levels of mRNA correlated well with the levels of enzyme activity: canavanine-resistant, 180; wild type grown in citrulline, 7; and wild type grown in arginine, 1. One major mRNA species of 1.67 kilobase and one minor species of 2.68 kilobase were observed in wild type and canavanine-resistant cell lines. Reassociation kinetics of pAS1 with genomic DNA from human liver, canavanine-resistant cells, and wild type cells were not significantly different. Blot hybridization of genomic DNA revealed no detectable differences between wild type cells, canavanine-resistant cells, and human leukocytes. The data demonstrated that there were multiple copies, perhaps 10 or more, of argininosuccinate synthetase-like sequences in human DNA and that the canavanine-resistant phenotype was not due to gene amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1982230371,"Neurogenic factors released by antidromic nerve stimulation are thought to be in part responsible for the vasodilation and breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier that follows trauma to the eye. Substance P is one candidate for the mediation of the inflammatory response since it is thought to be a neurotransmitter in sensory afferents and since exogenous substance P is capable of eliciting a response characteristic of inflammation. In rabbits, intravitreal or topical application onto the eye of a specific substance P antagonist, [d-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]SP, inhibited not only the irritant effects of exogenous substance P but also the inflammatory response to a standardized trauma (infrared irradiation of the iris). These observations suggest that substance P, or a related peptide, is a neurogenic mediator of the inflammatory response in the eye."

https://openalex.org/W1965939160,"The frameshift suppressor sufJ acts to correct a set of +1 frameshift mutations having very different sequences at their mutant sites. This suppressor acts by reading a 4 base codon located near, but not at, the site of each suppressible mutation. Suppression thus necessitates out-of-phase translation of the short stretch of mRNA between the site of action of the suppressor tRNA and the site of the frameshift mutation. We have identified the site read by sufJ by mutationally creating a series of such sites in the neighborhood of a previously nonsuppressible frameshift mutation. Each of the newly generated sites was formed by base substitution. Four independently generated sites were analyzed by DNA sequencing. At each site the quadruplet codon ACCX was generated (where X is A, U or C). Thus sufJ is able to read a 4 base codon in which any of three bases is acceptable in the fourth position. This is the first frameshift suppressor that does not read a run of three repeated bases in the first three positions of its codon."

D., Tsuchiya, D., Sandlin, D. E., and Holroyde, M. J. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 4444-4448). In the present paper, we have studied the characteristics of the O-glycosylating enzyme, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosamine transferase, from a membrane extract of bovine submaxillary glands using 11 synthetic peptide substrates in which the Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro was varied. The effect of these changes was measured by determining the apparent Km and Vmax values of the substrates. The studies thus far reveal: threonine cannot be glycosylated without a carboxyl triprolyl sequence; the alpha amino acid group of the threonine must be blocked; the nature of the group NH2-terminal to the threonine affects the kinetics of the reaction; and one residue can be between the threonyl and the triprolyl sequence. The triprolyl sequence in a protein may be an important signal for O-glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1668473167,"When pancreatic acini are exposed to the peptide caerulein (an analogue of the hormone cholecystokinin) or the cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine, they exhibit a rapid release of intracellular Ca2+ and a rise in the level of cGMP, accompanied by discharge of secretory proteins. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulates protein discharge without affecting the level of cGMP, while N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) elevates cGMP, but does not elicit discharge (Gunther, G. R., and Jamieson, J. D. (1979) Nature 280, 318-320). To clarify the relationships among these events, the effect of tPA and MNNG on Ca2+ efflux in guinea pig acini was determined. Cells were incubated in medium containing 45Ca2+ and transferred to medium with nonradioactive Ca2+ before adding the agents to be tested. Caerulein (10(-9) M), carbamylcholine (10(-5) M), and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (5 micrograms/ml) all caused the release of 40-60% of the cell-associated 45Ca2+ within 3 min. In contrast, acini incubated with 10(-7) M TPA, 10(-4) M MNNG, or no added agents retained over 80% of their 45Ca2+ after 22 min. TPA caused significant secretory discharge within the first 15 min and did not block CA2+ efflux stimulated by other secretagogues. TPA-induced discharge requires energy and the presence of sufficient Ca2+ in the extracellular medium. These observations are consistent with a model in which the rapid release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm triggers an increase in the level of cGMP and, by a separate series of events, protein discharge. TPA may act at a later point on the pathway to discharge, but before an obligatory step requiring Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1671928837,"The lysyl amino groups of bovine trypsin were covalently modified by acetylation, succinylation, or reductive methylation. The enzymatically active derivatives were still capable of reaction with alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), although to a lesser extent than native enzyme. The resulting enzyme-alpha 2M complexes, however, were much more susceptible to dissociation by sodium dodecyl sulfate than complexes formed with unmodified trypsin. The bound modified enzymes could be released from the alpha 2M complex with an excess of native thrombin. In addition, anhydrotrypsin displaced methyl trypsin from its complex and the anhydro derivative was bound in its place. The data provide evidence for two types of noncovalent intermediates; those formed from lysyl-modified enzymes show proteolysis of the alpha 2M to the nominal 85,000 fragment, whereas anhydrotrypsin forms a complex with apparently intact alpha 2M chains. A model is proposed for the reaction of alpha 2M with proteases in which one or both of these noncovalent intermediates is formed. Conversion of this form(s) to a stable covalent complex requires unmodified lysyl amino groups on the enzyme, suggesting that these groups may form a covalent bond with the inhibitor, possibly at the site at which methylamine binds."
https://openalex.org/W1537953939,"Anaphylaxis of human lung in vitro is accompanied by prostaglandin (PG) formation. To search for factors capable of generating PG, supernatants prepared by reversed anaphylaxis of human lung tissue were added to guinea pig lung and PG formation examined. The PG-generating activity fractionated between Mr = 500 and 5000 by ultramembrane filtration and was designated prostaglandin-generating factor of anaphylaxis or PGF-A. Partially purified PGF-A was soluble in 80% ethanol and insoluble in chloroform or ethyl acetate. Paper chromatography of anti-IgE-treated human lung preparations revealed a ninhydrin-positive spot at RF 0.27 to 0.41 with PG-generating activity. When subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 or G-25, PGF-A demonstrated peak PG-generating capacity at Mr = 1200 to 1800. Peak fractions were pooled and chromatographed on CM52 cellulose with PGF-A activity eluting at 0.16 to 0.3 M NH4COOH. The pooled peak of PGF-A activity from Sephadex G-25 filtration and CM52 chromatography eluted as a single peak at 0.024 M NH4HCO3 on DE52. Application of the peak off DE52 to a paper chromatogram revealed a single ninhydrin-positive spot with an RF 0.27 to 0.41 with the capacity to generate PGs. Amino acid analysis of three purifications revealed the following: Glu/Asp/Gly/Ser/Thr (6:3:2:1:1). Based on these analyses, a Mr = 1450 was calculated for the PGF-A. Therefore, PGF-A represents a novel mediator of lung anaphylaxis which may be partly responsible for PG generation accompanying allergic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1569825463,"Biogenesis of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase, has been shown to begin with synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes of a precursor, designated pre-ornithine transcarbamylase, which is approximately 4000 daltons larger than its corresponding mitochondrial subunit, followed by post-translational uptake and proteolytic processing of the precursor to its mature counterpart by mitochondria. We now report initial studies on the structure and properties of preornithine transcarbamylase. When this precursor is labeled at the NH2 terminus with N-formyl[35S]methionine and processed by mitochondria, no label is recovered with the mature subunit. This demonstrates that the amino acid extension which is characteristic of the precursor and which is removed during mitochondrial processing is NH2-terminal. This NH2-terminal extension is found intact in two peptides produced by limited proteolysis of the labeled precursor. Moreover, this amino acid extension modifies the behavior of the precursor during immunoprecipitation in the presence of ionic detergents and plays a critical role in facilitating uptake of the precursor by mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1504243091,"Ordinarily, ribonuclease H hydrolyzes poly(rA) . poly(dT) and phiX174DNA-RNA at equal rates. Here we show that in the presence of dextran, the degradation of poly(rA) . poly(dT) is inhibited, while that of phi 174DNA-RNA is not. A similar inhibition by sucrose is found to be due to trace contamination of dextran in the sucrose. Ribose, deoxyribose, and a number of other saccharides fail to inhibit RNase H. In experiments where the two substrates are presented in the presence of the inhibitor, the kinetics indicates that both molecules are recognized by the enzyme, but only the phi X174DNA-RNA is degraded. That is, dextran does not interfere with the recognition site, but rather blocks hydrolysis. It is proposed that the ability of dextran to confer selectivity toward different substrates reveals a potential regulatory mechanism for RNase H activity which may represent a control step in the initiation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1553447735,"Abstract The plasma protease inhibitor alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) was reacted in vitro with cis-dichlorodiamineplastinum(II) (cis-DDP). Following the reaction, alpha 2M demonstrated a significantly decreased ability to bind trypsin as determined by esterase activity assays in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor and studies with radiolabeled trypsin. Inactivation of alpha 2M by cis-DDP was not associated with a conversion to the fast electrophoretic form, as determined on nondenaturing gels, in contrast to the inactivation of alpha 2M by proteases and certain amine salts. The extent of reaction increased with the elevation of temperature within the thermal stability range of the protein; however, variation of pH within the range 6.82-8.55 had little effect. Binding of [14C]methylamine to alpha 2M was not affected by cis-DDP. The conformational change, however, which normally accompanies this reaction did not occur. It is concluded that the alpha 2M thiolesters are most likely not reactive sites for cis-DDP. cis-DDP-treated alpha 2M failed to dissociate into quarter subunits under denaturing and reducing conditions, suggesting cross-linking of subunits. This cross-linking may be responsible for locking the alpha 2M quarternary structure into the slow conformation."

This protein exhibited characteristic bluish green color with amido black and gave an amino acid composition strikingly similar to large basic protein (LBP). It formed a line of identity with LBP when diffused against antiserum to chicken brain basic protein. The concentration of LBP (18.9 micrograms/mg of dry myelin) is 6-fold greater than that of the 21K protein(3.31 micrograms/mg of dry myelin) in rabbit brain myelin. After the intracerebral injection of [32P]orthophosphoric acid, both LBP and 21K protein were found to be phosphorylated. [32P]Phosphate in the purified preparations of these proteins was covalently linked by phosphoester bonds to serine and threonine residues. The specific radioactivity of the 21K protein (84,693 cpm/mg of protein) was not significantly higher than LBP (69,797 cpm/mg of protein)."

https://openalex.org/W1593985503,"Abstract Through the use of a new nucleotide extraction procedure, we had previously shown that relaxed mutants of Escherichia coli exhibit a unique response to amino acid starvation (Lagosky, P. A., and Chang, F. N. (1980) J. Bacteriol. 144, 499-508). The basal level amounts of guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) in both relA and phenotypically relaxed relA+ rplK (relC) strains were shown to decrease at the onset of amino acid limitation and to remain severely depressed throughout the course of the starvation. Upon resupplementation of amino acid-starved relaxed mutants, the production of ppGpp resumes and results in the temporary overaccumulation of this nucleotide beyond its original basal level amount. We now show that the basal level ppGpp content of relaxed bacteria, as well as its subsequent fluctuations in response to amino acid starvation, is inversely correlated with the initial rates of RNA synthesis in these strains. The ability of ppGpp to control the rate of protein synthesis in relA mutants was also examined. It was observed that ppGpp had no apparent direct effect on the initial rates of protein synthesis in relA mutants. The constant inverse correlation which exists between ppGpp content in relA mutants, and their rates of RNa synthesis provide evidence which indicates that basal level ppGpp synthesis has definite physiological significance. It also suggests that the synthesis of basal level ppGpp might be an absolute requirement needed for normal bacterial growth."

https://openalex.org/W1551807437,"Respiring heart mitochondria exchange matrix 42K+ with extramitochondrial K+ at a rapid rate in the presence of Pi (Chavez, E., Jung, D. W., and Brierley, G. P. (1977) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 183, 460-470, 1977). This exchange reaction is strongly inhibited by uncouplers. However, under two rather similar sets of conditions, the addition of an uncoupler results in a rapid, transient increase in the exchange of matrix 42K+ with external K+ when the mitochondria are suspended in KCl or, alternatively, in a net loss of matrix 42K+ from mitochondria suspended in K+-free media. These conditions are: (a) the addition of an uncoupler to respiring mitochondria after the accumulation of a small amount of phosphate salt, and (b) the presence of a Ca2+-chelator or ruthenium red with uncoupler. Loss of 42K+ under these conditions occurs with all substrates tested, is completely blocked by rotenone, and is accompanied by an almost complete oxidation of both NADH and NADPH. In the presence of rotenone and acetoacetate, only NADH is oxidized and 42K+ efflux does not occur. It is concluded that simply dissipating the mitochondrial protonmotive force by addition of an uncoupler is not sufficient to induce release of mitochondrial K+. Uncoupler-induced oxidation of mitochondrial NADPH, in conjunction with elevated internal Pi, opens a rather nonspecific pathway for K+ loss which can be inhibited by ADP and enhanced by Ca2+. The more specific loss of K+ which occurs in the absence of elevated internal Pi when uncoupler and EGTA or ruthenium red are present suggests that K+ efflux is related to the Ca2+-uniporter. Loss of K+ by either of these pathways can be differentiated from efflux of K+ on the endogenous K+/H+ exchanger which functions without dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential."

Methods are currently being developed for real-time monitoring of metabolic processes in vivo and for noninvasive detection of disease and abnormality in living animals. Other nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are providing entirely new approaches for analyses of complex chemical systems. The increased power and popularity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy today are due to many developments in instrumentation and methods that have occurred over the 35-year history of the technique. The most important single advance, particularly in recent years, has been increased sensitivity.

https://openalex.org/W1549566961,"The nature of the receptor for myxobacterial hemagglutinin (MBHA) on the outer surface of Myxococcus xanthus was investigated by studying the binding of 125I-MBHA to vegetative and developmental cells. The amount of binding and hence the number of binding sites/cell appeared to increase 4-fold during development to 2.1 X 10(4) sites/cell. Furthermore, the apparent association constant (Ka) for MBHA increased 3-fold to 3 X 10(7) M-1. Fetuin, a glycoprotein which binds MBHA, blocked the binding of 125I-MBHA to vegetative cells but not developmental cells. Thus, the MBHA binding sites from developmental cells clearly differ from the vegetative binding sites. The Ka for MBHA binding to sheep erythrocytes (3.5 X 10(6) M-1) was an order of magnitude lower than that of developmental M. xanthus cells. The erythrocyte binding sites are also much more sensitive to concanavalin A inhibition than the M. xanthus sites."
https://openalex.org/W1568061347,"Preamylases, synthesized in the RNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system supplemented with porcine pancreatic RNA were identified by their specific immunoprecipitation with anti-amylase. The preamylases have apparent Mr = 55,000 and 58,000 as compared to 52,000 and 55,000 for the purified, secreted alpha-amylase isozymes. In order to establish whether the unprocessed precursors may assume enzymatically active conformations, we have explored a highly sensitive activity gel electrophoresis technique, by which picogram quantities of enzyme can be detected. When standard alpha-amylase and translation products are subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel containing 0.01% starch and CaCl2, active amylase which binds tightly to starch can only migrate as the starch is hydrolyzed. When the gel is subsequently stained with I2, the appearance of clear tracks, the lengths of which are roughly proportional to the logarithm of amylase concentration, signifies the presence of amylase activity. By this approach, we were able to detect amylase activity in a range corresponding to about 100 pg of pure amylase/10 microliters of translation mixture. This value agrees well with an estimate from radioactivity incorporation of total preamylase in the translation mixture, and we consequently conclude that unprocessed preamylase can assume the appropriate conformation to give enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032255672,"Translationally active (in Xenopus oocytes) human alpha interferon (IFN) messenger RNA's (mRNA's) derived from Sendai virus--induced leukocyte cultures display a bimodal distribution of RNA lengths on electrophoresis through agarose-CH3HgOH gels. The major population (alpha s) consists of mRNA of length 0.7 to 1.4 kilobases, while the minor population (alpha L) consists of RNA of length 1.6 to 3.5 kilobases. Induction of human leukocytes in the presence of 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; 100 micromolar) appears to inhibit the accumulation of IFN-alpha s and to enhance that of IFN-alpha L mRNA's (average length about 1.8 kilobases in preparations from DRB-treated cells). Interferons derived from the alpha s mRNA's represent the group of previously recognized alpha interferons while the alpha L interferons are distinguishable from this group by their lower heterospecific activity on bovine cells compared to human cells, their apparent slower mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gels, and their apparent heteroclitic response toward an antiserum to IFN-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1486076941,"Poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from total RNA of swine gastric mucosa by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography, and was translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. Analysis of the translation products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that pepsinogen was a major translation product and was synthesized as two different molecular forms with apparent molecular weights of 45,000 and 43,000. The pepsinogen translated in the in vitro translation system had no autocatalytic activity. The pepsinogen mRNA was further purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, where the mRNA activity for pepsinogen was located around 15 S. At this stage, the translation product of the pooled fractions appeared to be almost exclusively pepsinogen. The peptide maps of the pepsinogen which was translated in vitro and digested by alpha-chymotrypsin and by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease were nearly identical with the corresponding peptide maps of standard pepsinogen. The double-stranded complementary DNA which had been synthesized from the partially purified mRNA by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was cloned in Escherichia coli chi 1776, using plasmid pBR322 as a cloning vector. A colony carrying pepsinogen cDNA sequence was identified by in situ colony hybridization using the cDNA synthesized from the partially purified mRNA as a probe and further by a positive hybridization-translation assay. One of the recombinant clones (pSPcA1) had an insert of about 850 base pairs, and the nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that pSPcA1 codes for swine pepsinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1493393182,"Bovine beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m), the light chain of the histocompatibility antigen, was isolated in crystalline form from colostrum. Previous studies from this laboratory on the solution properties of this protein suggest the existence of a time-dependent multiple aggregation phenomenon. To clarify the molecular states of beta 2-m, its solution properties were studied by ultracentrifugation and spectropolarimetry. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments at pH 5.0 (0.08 M NaCl, 0.02 M sodium phosphate) at concentrations less than 0.3 mg/ml give Mr = 11,800. From sedimentation velocity results, we conclude that bovine beta 2-m is a much more symmetrical and compact molecule than either guinea pig or human beta 2-m. At concentrations above 0.4 mg/ml under the same conditions, sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that a monomer to tetramer reversible self-association occurs. Also, the tetramerization increases with decreasing temperature. beta 2-Microglobulin undergoes an irreversible temperature-dependent association to a much larger aggregate over a period of 7 days, as evidenced by sedimentation equilibrium and velocity results. The rate of this aggregation decreases as the pH approaches the isoelectric point (pH 7) from either side. Furthermore, circular dichroism measured at pH 5.0 under time-dependent aggregating conditions showed a marked increase in the percentage of disordered structure, leading to the conclusion that this effect is a denaturation phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1553620684,"The mechanism by which large premature termination fragments of beta-galactosidase were degraded in Escherichia coli was studied using quantitative immunoprecipitation techniques. Two different lacZ nonsense mutants which produced apparent primary translation products of 96,000 and 109,000 daltons, respectively, were both shown to produce a second beta-galactosidase-related polypeptide of Mr = 90,000. These 90,000-dalton polypeptides appeared to be the same in both strains since they co-migrated when analyzed as a mixture on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and were indistinguishable when analyzed by one-dimensional peptide mapping. Pulse-chase experiments established a stoichiometric precursor-product relationship between the primary mutant gene products (called the A polypeptides) and the common 90,000-dalton polypeptide (called the B polypeptide). No intermediates were detected between the A and B polypeptides. We propose that there is a common pathway for the degradation of these different large fragments of beta-galactosidase. According to this model, the first step would be a specific endoproteolytic cleavage of the primary translation product which produces the 90,000-dalton polypeptide as a common intermediate. The kinetic analysis demonstrated a first order decay of both A and B polypeptides but, surprisingly, the first order rate constant for the decay of A appeared dependent upon the induction regimen. This result suggested that degradation may possibly be autoregulated either by the intracellular level of A or by other intermediates in the degradation pathway."
