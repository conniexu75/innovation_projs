https://openalex.org/W1968280685,"The representation of pain in the cerebral cortex is less well understood than that of any other sensory system. However, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in humans, it has now been demonstrated that painful heat causes significant activation of the contralateral anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory, and primary somatosensory cortices. This contrasts with the predominant activation of primary somatosensory cortex caused by vibrotactile stimuli in similar experiments. Furthermore, the unilateral cingulate activation indicates that this forebrain area, thought to regulate emotions, contains an unexpectedly specific representation of pain."
https://openalex.org/W2047578520,"In Drosophila, neural precursors are formed in a spaced pattern separated by intervening epidermal cells. Segregation of neural and epidermal lineages relies on cellular interactions. Failure of this cell communication, as in the mutants Notch (N), Delta, and shaggy, results in most or all of the cells becoming neural. Cells mutant for N and shaggy, but not Delta, autonomously adopt the neural fate when adjacent to wild-type cells in mosaics. Furthermore, wild-type cells adopt the epidermal fate if adjacent cells express a lower level of N activity than themselves, but produce neural precursors if adjacent cells express a higher level of N activity. This shows that there is competition between the cells and that the N protein is required for the mechanism whereby the cells choose between alternative fates. It also suggests that N acts as a receptor for an inhibitory signal emanating from the neural precursors."

https://openalex.org/W2033162367,We have studied the mechanism by which DNA methylation inhibits transcription both in cell-free nuclear extracts and in the living cell. Repression of transcription in vitro for four different promoters was shown to be an indirect effect. The mediator of repression had properties indistinguishable from those of a methyl-CpG binding protein (MeCP-1) that has been previously identified. Use of differentially methylated promoters and methylated competitors in transient transfection assays suggested that indirect repression via MeCP-1 also occurs in the living cell. This was supported by the fact that MeCP-1-deficient cells showed much reduced repression of methylated genes.
https://openalex.org/W1986730363,"Meiosis-specific double-strand breaks occur at the initiation site for meiotic gene conversion in the yeast ARG4 gene. Here we show that the break fragments end in extensive 3'-overhanging, single-stranded tails. The single-stranded tails very in length, generating a gradient of single-strandedness that parallels the gradient of gene conversion frequencies in ARG4. In strains carrying a rad50S mutation, which blocks meiotic recombination, the extensive single-stranded tails do not form, suggesting that their generation is an obligatory step in meiotic recombination. Using the rad50S mutant, we have mapped the site of the ARG4 break to a small region within the genetically defined recombination initiation site. These results strongly support the double-strand break model of meiotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2004059420,"Relative orientations of the DNA strands within a purine⋅purine⋅pyrimidine triple helix have been determined by affinity cleaving. A purine-rich oligonucleotide bound in the major groove of double-helical DNA antiparallel to the Watson-Crick purine strand. Binding depended upon the concentration of multivalent cations such as spermine or Mg2+, and appeared to be relatively independent of pH. Two models with specific hydrogen-bonding patterns for base triplets (G⋅GC, A⋅AT, and T⋅AT) are proposed to explain the sequence specificity of binding. The two models differ in the conformation about the glycosyl bond (syn or anti) and the location of the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone in the major groove of DNA. This motif broadens the structural frameworks available as a basis for the design of sequence-specific DNA binding molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2147586746,"We report that brefeldin A prevents the assembly of non-clathrin-coated vesicles from Golgi cisternae in a cell-free system. This finding provides a simple molecular explanation for the primary effect of this remarkable compound in blocking constitutive secretion. We further report that when coated vesicle assembly is blocked, extensive tubule networks form that connect previously separate cisternae and stacks into a single topological unit, allowing the intermixing of contents of Golgi cisternae, presumably by lateral diffusion. Formation of the tubule networks requires ATP, cytosol, and the general fusion protein NSF. Tubule networks may be related to the membrane tubules mediating retrograde transport in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2038371209,"The superior colliculus contains neurons that cause displacements of the visual axis (gaze shifts). These cells are arranged topographically in a motor map on which the vector (amplitude and direction) of the coded movement varies continuously with location. How this spatial representation becomes a temporal code (frequency and duration) in the motoneurons is unknown. During a gaze shift, a zone of neural activity moved continuously on the map from an initial location, defining the vector of the desired gaze shift, to a final ""zero"" position containing neurons that were active during fixation. Thus, the spatial-temporal transformation may be accomplished by control of gaze throughout the spatial trajectory of activity on the motor map."
https://openalex.org/W2116227043,"Cell fate in the developing eye is determined by a cascade of inductive interactions. In this process, the sevenless protein — a receptor tyrosine kinase — is required for the specification of the R7 photoreceptor cell fate. We have constructed a gain-of-function sevenless mutation (Sevs11) by overexpressing a truncated sevenless protein in the cells where sevenless is normally expressed. In Sevs11 mutant files, all sevenless-expressing cells initiate neural development. This results in the formation of multiple R7-like photoreceptors per ommatidium. Therefore, sevenless activity appears to be necessary and sufficient for the determination of R7 cell fate. These results illustrate the central role receptor tyrosine kinases can play in the specification of cell fate during development."
https://openalex.org/W1523927558,"Human recombinant stromelysin-1 was shown to cleave four types of collagen (types II, IX, X, and XI) prepared from bovine and rat cartilages at specific sites. Stromelysin-1 cleaved salt-soluble native molecules of type IX collagen into two main triple-helical fragments, COL1 and COL2,3. Protein microsequencing identified the exact cleavage sites in the NC2 domain of all three chains, alpha 1(IX), alpha 2(IX), and alpha 3(IX). Stromelysin-1 also acted as a telopeptidase, in that it efficiently clipped intact molecules of types II and XI collagens at sites just inside their terminal cross-linking hydroxylysine residues. Native molecules of type X collagen were cleaved by stromelysin-1 within their triple helical domains at a COOH-terminal site that reduced the alpha 1(X) chain size by 10 kDa. These findings suggest an important role for stromelysin in the turnover and remodeling of the collagenous matrix of cartilage both normally and in degenerative joint disease."

https://openalex.org/W1575281218,"The interaction of ethidium, a DNA intercalator, with the poly(dA).poly(dT) duplex and the poly (dA).2poly(dT) triplex has been investigated by a variety of spectrophotometric and hydrodynamic techniques. The fluorescence of ethidium is increased when either the duplex or triplex form is present. Binding constants, determined from absorbance measurements, indicate that binding to the triple helical form is substantially stronger than to the duplex, with a larger binding site size (2.8 base triplets compared to 2.4 base pairs). Furthermore, while binding to poly(dA).poly(dT) shows strong positive cooperativity, binding to the triplex is noncooperative. Thermal denaturation experiments demonstrate that ethidium stabilizes the triple helix. Binding to either form induces a weak circular dichroism band in the visible wavelength region, while in the region around 310 nm, there is a band that is strongly dependent on the degree of saturation of the duplex, and which is positive for the duplex but negative for the triplex. Both fluorescence energy transfer and quenching studies provide evidence of intercalation of ethidium in both duplex and triplex complexes. Binding of ethidium leads to an initial decrease in viscosity for both the duplex and triplex structures, followed by an increase, which is greater for the duplex. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ethidium binds to the poly (dA).2poly(dT) triple helix via an intercalative mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1557423604,"Recently, the prototype of a novel class of calcium-independent plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2 activities was identified in the cytosolic fraction of canine myocardium (Wolf, R.A., and Gross, R.W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7295-7303) and subsequently purified and characterized (Hazen, S.L., Stuppy, R.J., and Gross, R.W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10622-10630). We now demonstrate that 15 min of myocardial ischemia utilizing a rabbit Langendorf perfused heart model results in a 10-fold increase in membrane-associated calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity whose detection is entirely dependent upon utilization of plasmalogen substrate. Ischemia-induced phospholipase activity was identified as a membrane bound member of this class of phospholipases A2 by demonstration of: 1) concomitant production of lysoplasmenylcholine and sn-2 fatty acid from plasmenylcholine substrate; 2) maximal enzymatic activity in the absence of calcium ion; and 3) a 16-fold higher maximum reaction velocity utilizing plasmenylcholine compared to phosphatidylcholine substrate at multiple surface concentrations. Ischemia-induced phospholipase A2 activity was specifically localized to the microsomal fraction and could not be solubilized by sonication, salt treatment, exposure to chelators, or utilization of submicellar concentrations of detergent. The appearance of microsomal phospholipase A2 activity did not require ischemia-induced transcription or translation since identical increases in enzymic activity were obtained in hearts previously treated with actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a membrane-associated calcium-independent phospholipase A2 that selectively hydrolyzes plasmalogen molecular species is the likely enzymic mediator of accelerated phospholipid catabolism during early myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2017118719,"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II contains 26-27 tandem copies of a conserved heptapeptide of unknown function. Yeast strains whose CTD contains ten heptamers are viable but defective for transcription of the INO1 gene and cold sensitive for growth. Deletion of the SIN1 gene, which codes for a DNA-binding protein that negatively regulates HO transcription, restores INO1 transcription and reduces the cold sensitivity of such strains. A SIN1 deletion suppresses the lethality of a CTD with nine heptamer repeats but not with seven repeats. These observations indicate a functional relationship between SIN1 and the CTD: the CTD might remove SIN1 from DNA, or removal of SIN1 may be a prerequisite for function of the CTD. The SWI1, SWI2, and SWI3 genes, whose products activate HO transcription by antagonizing SIN1, are also required for INO1 transcription and may assist the CTD. In addition, an intact CTD binds nonspecifically to DNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1948970354,"Reperfusion of ischemic tissues causes a paradoxical injury. Here, we measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as an indicator of tissue damage in perfused rat livers during anoxia and reoxygenation. During anoxia, LDH release was substantially reduced at acidotic pH (pH 6.1-6.9). Using anoxia at pH 6.1 followed by reoxygenation at pH 7.3 to model ischemia and reperfusion, an abrupt release of LDH occurred after reperfusion. A similar release of LDH occurred when pH of anoxic livers was increased to 7.3 without reoxygenation but LDH release did not occur after reoxygenation at pH 6.1. Thus, a rapid increase of pH rather than reoxygenation accounted for tissue injury after reperfusion of ischemic liver."
https://openalex.org/W1607068798,"Cleavage of the membrane-anchored precursor for transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), a rate-limiting step in the generation of soluble TGF-alpha, can be stimulated by phorbol esters acting via protein kinase C. In the present study, activators of other intracellular signaling pathways were tested for their ability to stimulate pro-TGF-alpha cleavage in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a pro-TGF-alpha cDNA. Treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, rapidly increased the rate of pro-TGF-alpha cleavage over 25-fold. This effect of A23187 on pro-TGF-alpha cleavage was dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium and was largely independent of protein kinase C activation. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation of pro-TGF-alpha cleavage via activation of protein kinase C did not require extracellular calcium. Stimulation of pro-TGF-alpha cleavage by serum was largely independent of both protein kinase C and extracellular calcium influx, whereas activators of protein kinase A and protein kinase G did not stimulate pro-TGF-alpha cleavage. These results suggest that regulation of pro-TGF-alpha cleavage is a complex process that can be controlled by extracellular agents via at least three distinct signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1522189944,"Glucocorticoids can mediate the destruction of thymocytes and T cell-derived leukemia cells through a mechanism known as apoptosis. The characteristic feature of apoptosis is fragmentation of DNA at internucleosomal linkers through the activity of a specific endonuclease. In this study, an attempt was made to compare dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in two T cell-derived human leukemia lines (CEM-C1 and CEM-C7) to the cell killing brought about by selected cytotoxic agents. In the CEM-C7 cell line (dexamethasone-sensitive), apoptosis was induced not only by dexamethasone but by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and 25-OH cholesterol. In the CEM-C1 cell line (dexamethasone-resistant) cycloheximide, 25-OH cholesterol, or cell starvation could induce apoptosis. It appears that in leukemic cells apoptosis may be induced by a variety of unrelated toxic agents and is not limited to glucocorticoids.—Bansal, N.; Houle, A.; Melnykovych, G.

https://openalex.org/W1997620423,"The abdominal ganglion of the marine mollusk Aplysia contains a pair of identified neuronal clusters, the bag cells, which control egg laying by means of a number of unique regulatory mechanisms. Each neuron in the bag cell clusters synthesizes several peptides derived from a single prohormone and packages them into separate vesicles. These vesicles are then differentially localized in specific neuronal processes, thus segregating peptides destined for autocrine and hormonal release sites. Therefore in this system, protein trafficking through the secretory pathway organizes multiple peptide neurochemical messengers to efficiently regulate simple behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1488236903,"The potential role of liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) in modulating cellular sterol distribution was examined in mouse L-cell fibroblasts transfected with cDNA encoding L-FABP. L-cells were chosen because they contain only a small amount of endogenous FABP which does not bind [3H]cholesterol, does not enhance intermembrane sterol transfer, and whose content is unaltered by the expression of L-FABP. Transfected L-cells expressed 0.34% of cytosolic protein as L-FABP. Transfection alone with low expression of L-FABP (0.008% of cytosolic protein) had no effect on any of the parameters tested. Three aspects of cellular sterol transfer were examined. First, cellular sterol uptake, monitored by [3H]cholesterol and the fluorescent sterol, delta-5,7,9(11),22-ergostatetraen-3 beta-ol, was increased 21.5 +/- 2.6% (p less than 0.001) in L-cells expressing L-FABP. This increase was not accounted for by increased sterol esterification in the cells expressing L-FABP. Inhibition of both cholesterol transfer and esterification with 3-(decyldimethylsilyl)-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl]propanamide from Sandoz abolished the L-FABP related enhancement of both [3H]cholesterol uptake and esterification. Second, plasma membrane transbilayer distribution of sterol, determined by fluorescence methods indicated that the majority of sterol was in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. In transfected cells expressing L-FABP, twice as much sterol (28 +/- 4%) was present in the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane as compared to that of control cells (15 +/- 2%). Third, expression of L-FABP enhanced sterol transfer from the plasma membrane to microsomes in intact cells. Treatment of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]oleate-loaded cells with sphingomyelinase resulted in increased formation of radiolabeled cholesterol ester, consistent with enhanced microsomal esterification of plasma membrane derived cholesterol. Concomitantly, plasma membrane [3H]cholesterol became less accessible to oxidation by cholesterol oxidase. Sphingomyelinase-stimulated cholesterol esterification was 21 +/- 3% greater in transfected cells. Concomitantly, accessibility of plasma membrane [3H]cholesterol to cholesterol oxidase was decreased 18 +/- 3% in cells expressing L-FABP. These differences are consistent with the ability of L-FABP to influence sterol transport and plasma membrane transbilayer sterol distribution in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521357599,"Calcium is an important regulator of a variety of neuronal activities including gene expression. However, it is not clear how Ca2+ influx affects intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the nucleus. We have taken advantage of laser photometry, the Ca2+-sensitive dye Indo-1 that allows ratio imaging, and confocal microscopy to eliminate the influences of unequal cell geometry and dye distribution. We show that Ca2+ influx into sympathetic neurons causes a significantly greater and faster increase in [Ca2+]i in the nucleus than in the cytosol. The differential increase in nuclear [Ca2+]i was apparent when Ca2+ entered from the extracellular medium during K+ depolarization, ionomycin or acetylcholine treatment, and brief periods of electrical stimulation. When intracellular Ca2+ was mobilized by caffeine the rise in nuclear [Ca2+]i was again greater than in any other region of the neuron. The increased nuclear Ca2+ levels were uniform throughout the nucleus and not associated with the nuclear envelope. The differential rise in nuclear Ca2+ was eliminated by acridine orange binding to nucleic acids. Nonexcitable cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and fibroblasts) did not show differential distribution of Ca2+ after ionomycin treatment. These results support the idea that activity-dependent gene regulation in sympathetic neurons may be mediated by changes in Ca2+ concentration at the level of the chromatin material.—Przywara, D. A.; Bhave, S. V.; Bhave, A.; Wakade, T. D.; Wakade, A. R. Stimulated rise in neuronal calcium is faster and greater in the nucleus than the cytosol. FASEB J. 5: 217–222; 1991."
https://openalex.org/W2074072596,"Multipotent murine stem cell lines (FDC-Pmix) depend on IL-3 for self-renewal and proliferation and can be induced to differentiate into multiple hematopoietic lineages. Single FDC-Pmix cells infected with retroviral vectors expressing GM-CSF are induced to differentiate into granulocytes and macrophages. This results in a complete loss of clonogenic cells if IL-3 is not exogenously supplied; however, multipotent variants can be selected that do not terminally differentiate if cells are kept in the presence of IL-3. Unidirectional and synchronous granulocyte and macrophage differentiation accompanied with loss of self-renewal capacity is induced when IL-3 is removed. Our data indicate that activation of the GM-CSF receptor induces differentiation of stem cells by an instructive mechanism that can be blocked by the activated IL-3 receptor. A model of how receptors can induce proliferation and cell-specific differentiation by two separate pathways is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529101195,"The ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is separated from the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domain by a predicted single transmembrane segment. Antipeptide antibodies prepared against the outer portion of the predicted transmembrane segment confirmed this area was exposed only when cells were treated with permeabilizing agents. To investigate structural requirements for signal transduction by the transmembrane domain, three types of mutant EGF receptor were prepared. The first type was designed to shorten the transmembrane domain, the second to place proline substitutions within this domain, and the third to make amino acid substitutions analogous to those present in the transforming c-erbB2/neu oncoprotein. Mutant human receptors were expressed in null recipient mouse B82L and Chinese hamster ovary cells. All receptors bound EGF and exhibited EGF-stimulated protein tyrosine kinase activity in vivo as assayed using a 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. EGF stimulated growth of cells expressing each mutant receptor with similar dose-response characteristics. In contrast to other growth factor receptors, the transmembrane domain of the EGF receptor is tolerant to a variety of changes which neither mimic EGF action by constitutive activation nor interfere with ligand-induced signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1541626731,"We have previously reported on the isolation of the ret1-1 mutation in yeast, which reduces the efficiency of transcription termination by RNA polymerase III. We have cloned the RET1 gene by complementation of an ochre suppression phenotype in ret1-1 cells. The RET1 gene was mapped to near the HIS3 gene on the right arm of chromosome 15 by using hybridization to OFAGE gels. Sequencing of the RET1 gene has identified its product as the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase III. We have carried out an extensive sequence alignment with other RNA polymerase second-largest subunits and discuss the conservation of several functional domains. The RET1 gene was used to recover the ret1-1 mutant allele from genomic DNA using an integration/excision technique. Plasmid-based fine mapping and fragment swapping were used to localize the ret1-1 mutation for sequencing. We discuss the ret1-1 sequence lesion with regard to possible roles in transcription. In particular, the recessive nature of the ret1-1 mutation may have major implications for our understanding of the transcription process."
https://openalex.org/W1482287596,"Sites of in vivo glycation of human and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase were identified by cleavage of the borotritide-treated enzyme with trypsin, followed by gas-phase sequencing of the resulting tritium-labeled glycated peptides. A blank sequencing result, i.e. failure to detect an amino acid phenylthiohydantoin after completion of an Edman degradation cycle, was ascribed to an N-(1-deoxyhexitolyl)lysyl residue, which represented a glycation site on the original enzyme subunit. In human liver alcohol dehydrogenase the sites affected were the epsilon-amino groups of lysines 10, 39, 231, 248, and 325, which were glycated to the relative extents of 10, 5, 75, 5, and 5%, respectively. The site specificity of in vivo glycation of the horse enzyme is similar; 70-75% of it had occurred at lysine 231. A computer image of the crystal structure of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was examined. As a result, it was proposed that the high rate of glycation at lysine 231 is due to acid-base catalysis of the Amadori rearrangement by the imidazole group of histidine 348. This hypothesis was supported by showing that imidazole groups were close to sites of glycation in several other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1545461596,"Recent studies from this and other laboratories have resulted in the cloning and sequencing of hexokinases from a variety of tissues including yeast, human kidney, rat brain, rat liver, and mouse hepatoma. Significantly, studies on the hepatoma enzyme conducted in this laboratory (Arora, K.K., Fanciulli, M., and Pedersen, P.L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6481-6488) resulted also in its overexpression in Escherichia coli in active form. We have now used site-directed mutagenesis for the first time in studies of hexokinase to evaluate the role of amino acid residues predicted to interact with either glucose or ATP. Four amino acid residues (Ser-603, Asp-657, Glu-708, and Glu-742) believed to interact with glucose were mutated to alanine or glycine, whereas a lysine residue (Lys-558) thought to be directly involved in binding ATP was mutated to either methionine or arginine. Of all the mutations in residues believed to interact with glucose, the Asp-657----Ala mutation is the most profound, reducing the hexokinase activity to a level less than 1% of the wild type. The relative Vmax values for Ser-603----Ala, Glu-708----Ala, and Glu-742----Ala enzymes are 6, 10, and 6.5%, respectively, of the wild-type enzyme. Glu-708 and Glu-742 mutations increase the apparent Km for glucose 50- and 14-fold, respectively, while the Ser-603----Ala mutation decreases the apparent Km for glucose 5-fold. At the putative ATP binding site, the relative Vmax for Lys-558----Arg and Lys-558----Met enzymes are 70 and 29%, respectively, of the wild-type enzyme with no changes in the apparent Km for glucose. No changes were observed in the apparent Km for ATP with any mutation. These results support the view that all 4 residues predicted to interact with glucose from earlier x-ray studies may play a role in binding and/or catalysis. The Asp-657 and Ser-603 residues may be involved in both, while Glu-708 and Glu-742 clearly contribute to binding but are not essential for catalysis. In contrast, Lys-558 appears to be essential neither for binding nor catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1547609801,"We demonstrated previously that preproendothelin mRNA is present in avascular human amnion tissue and in human amnion cells maintained in primary monolayer culture. In this investigation we sought to identify the specific endothelin (ET) gene that is expressed in amnion and to determine whether endothelin is produced by amnion. Using oligonucleotides specific for ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 mRNA, we identified preproET-1 mRNA in human amnion tissue. By radioimmunoassay of ET we found that human amnion tissue explants and amnion cells in culture secrete immunoreactive ET into the medium. PreproET mRNA levels and immunoreactive ET production by human amnion cells in monolayer culture are increased in response to treatment with agents that are known to be present in human amniotic fluid, i.e. epidermal growth factor, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We found that the level of preproET mRNA in amnion cells was low compared with that in human umbilical endothelial cells; treatment with cycloheximide together with a stimulus of ET-1 gene transcription led to a striking increase in the level of preproET mRNA in amnion cells compared with a much weaker response in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that protein synthesis-dependent mechanisms may be of great importance in maintaining low levels of preproET mRNA in amnion tissue and in regulating the amount of preproET mRNA in amnion exposed to stimuli of ET-1 transcription. In addition, we demonstrated that immunoreactive ET is present in human amniotic fluid at the midtrimester of pregnancy and at term. Thus, it is likely that the avascular fetal amnion is one tissue site of origin of ET in amniotic fluid during human pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1568546212,"Electron transfer within milk xanthine oxidase has been examined by the technique of pulse radiolysis. Radiolytically generated N-methylnicotinamide radical or 5-deazalumiflavin radical has been used to rapidly and selectively introduce reducing equivalents into the enzyme so that subsequent equilibration among the four redox-active centers of the enzyme (a molybdenum center, two iron-sulfur centers, and FAD) could be monitored spectrophotometrically. Experiments have been performed at pH 6 and 8.5, and a comprehensive scheme describing electron equilibration within the enzyme at both pH values has been developed. All rate constants ascribed to equilibration between specific pairs of centers in the enzyme are found to be rapid relative to enzyme turnover under the same conditions. Electron equilibration between the molybdenum center and one of the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme (tentatively assigned Fe/S I) is particularly rapid, with a pH-independent first-order rate constant of approximately 8.5 x 10(3) s-1. The results unambiguously demonstrate the role of the iron-sulfur centers of xanthine oxidase in mediating electron transfer between the molybdenum and flavin centers of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1484587086,"As a measure of the transmembrane signals that they transduce, two neurotrophic agents, nerve growth factor (NGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and the muscarinic agonist carbachol were compared for their ability to induce TIS (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-inducible sequences) transcripts, representing a family of immediate early response genes, in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 and the morphologically unresponsive variant PC12nnr5. Three genes, TIS1 (also designated NGFIB), TIS8 (also designated NGFIA), and TIS21, induced in these cells by NGF (Kujubu, D.A., Lim, R.W., Varnum, B.C., and Herschman, H.R. (1987) Oncogene 1, 257-262, 1987), are also induced by bFGF and carbachol. In native PC12 cells the level of expression of TIS8 and TIS21 is similar for all three stimuli, as well as for tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA). In contrast, the induction of TIS1 by NGF and TPA is slight and is only just detectable after stimulation by bFGF, but is strong for carbachol. Thus, although all of these agents can stimulate protein kinase (PK-C), at least one TIS gene can apparently be differentially regulated by these ligands, suggesting that alternative signaling pathways must also exist. In keeping with this view, bFGF, and to a lesser degree NGF, can elicit a TIS gene response in PC12 cells in which PK-C has been down-regulated with TPA. The response to carbachol (and TPA) is effectively blocked under these conditions. Since both NGF and bFGF stimulate neurite outgrowth in such cells, PK-C is apparently not essential, i.e. does not represent the sole mechanism, for signal transduction leading to modulation of gene expression for these factors. Consistent with this model, putative protein kinase inhibitors, K252a and sphingosine, did not inhibit the TIS gene responses to bFGF. However, these agents also failed to block TIS gene responses to carbachol and TPA indicating that they were ineffective as PK-C inhibitors under these conditions. The NGF-induced response was, however, blocked by K252a indicating a unique step in the mechanism of this factor not shared by the other ligands. Sphingosine did not block TIS induction with NGF. The mutant cell line PC12 nnr5 does not respond morphologically to either NGF or bFGF. However, TIS gene responses to bFGF are unaffected, whereas those to NGF are completely abolished. The response to TPA is altered quantitatively but not qualitatively; the induction by carbachol is largely eliminated, apparently as a result of a 90% reduction in muscarinic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2132000733,"ATP-G-actin in the absence of excess ATP and divalent metal ions was treated with ADP in amounts large enough to ensure complete formation of ADP-G-actin. Under these conditions the monomer undergoes a very slow structural transition as seen by the exposure of 2.0 +/- 0.2 thiol groups per actin molecule. Once exposed, the second thiol group reacts with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at a rate approximately 10-fold higher than that of cysteine 374. Labeling experiments with 2,4-dinitrophenyl [1-14C]cysteinyl disulfide followed by digestion and peptide analysis showed (besides reaction with cysteine 374) nearly exclusive labeling of cysteine 10. Since this residue is completely shielded in ATP-G-actin, exchange of ATP for ADP must have caused a partial unfolding of the protein uncovering the side chain of this cysteine. The transition is reversible, because addition of ATP or of excess divalent metal ions restored the conformation with only cysteine 374 exposed. Reversibility of the transition allowed us to directly determine the relative affinities of ATP and ADP to monomeric actin in the absence of Me2+ ions. By determination of the 50% exposure value of cysteine 10 from either side of the equilibrium we found a value of KATP/KADP = 30. The rate of uncovering of the thiol of cysteine 10 at 0 degree C was distinctly slower (t1/2 = 9 h) than its reshielding by the addition of ATP (t1/2 = 3 h). The structural change was accompanied by a decrease in polymerization rate. Relative polymerization rates were determined as ATP-G(1S)-actin:ADP-G(approximately 1S)-actin:ADP-G(2S)-actin = 1.0:0.35:0.1. From the data presented here we conclude that preparations of ADP-G-actin remain undefined unless the number of thiol groups exposed has been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1533010166,"Production of platelet-activating factor 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (PAF), a potent mediator of inflammation, by mononuclear phagocytes varies with their stage of cellular differentiation and the nature of the eliciting stimulus. The human monocytic cell line U937 can be induced to differentiate to a macrophage-like cell following phorbol myristate acetate exposure, and after differentiation, these cells efficiently support replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). U937 cells induced to differentiate with phorbol myristate acetate demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in PAF synthesis. RSV infection of these differentiated U937 cells caused a sustained stimulation of PAF synthesis that paralleled viral replication and was dependent on infectious virus. Virus increased the activity of lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyl-transferase (PAF acetyltransferase) in cell lysates, thus enhancing the anabolic pathway of PAF synthesis without altering the activity of PAF acetylhydrolase, which regulates PAF catabolism. RSV infection of human monocytes also caused a marked increase in [3H] monocytes also caused to uninfected monocytes. Thus, virus infection serves as a novel stimulus to induce PAF synthesis in human mononuclear phagocytes and suggests that increased PAF production may have a critical role in the inflammatory response to RSV."
https://openalex.org/W1528240252,"The mitochondrial energy-linked nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase is a homodimer of monomer Mr = 109,228. Hydropathy analysis of its cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence (1043 residues) has indicated that the molecule is composed of 3 domains: a 430-residue-long hydrophilic N-terminal domain which binds NAD(H), a 200-residue-long hydrophilic C-terminal domain which binds NADP(H), and a 400-residue-long hydrophobic central domain which appears to be made up mainly of about 14 hydrophobic clusters of approximately 20 residues each. In this study, antibodies were raised to the hydrophilic N- and C-terminal domains cleaved from the isolated transhydrogenase by proteolytic digestion, and to a synthetic, hydrophilic pentadecapeptide, which corresponded to position 540-554 within the central hydrophobic domain. Immunochemical experiments with mitoplasts (mitochondria denuded of outer membrane) and submitochondrial particles (inside-out inner membrane vesicles) as sources of antigens showed that essentially the entire N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains of the transhydrogenase, as well as epitopes from the central pentadecapeptide, protrude from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where the N- and C-terminal domains would be expected to come together to form the enzyme's catalytic site. Treatment of mitoplasts with several proteolytic enzymes indicated that large protease-sensitive masses of the transhydrogenase are not exposed on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane, which agreed with the exception that the central highly hydrophobic domain of the molecule should be largely membrane-intercalated. Trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and papain had little or no effect on the mitoplast-embedded transhydrogenase. Proteinase K, subtilisin (Nagarse), thermolysin, and pronase E each split the mitoplast-embedded enzyme into two fragments only, a fragment of approximately 70 kDa containing the N-terminal hydrophilic domain, and one of approximately 40 kDa bearing the C-terminal hydrophilic domain. The cleavage site of proteinase K was determined to be A690 -A691, which is located in a small hydrophilic segment within the central hydrophobic domain. This protease-sensitive loop appears to be exposed on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane. The proteinase K-nicked enzyme containing two peptides of 71 and 39 kDa was isolated from mitoplasts and shown to have high transhydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1529613011,"The spike protein of Semliki Forest virus is composed of three subunits, E1, E2, and E3, which mediate the fusion of the virus membrane with that of the host cell. E2 and E3 are synthesized as a precursor, p62, which is cleaved post-translationally after an Arg-His-Arg-Arg sequence. In vitro mutagenesis of a cDNA clone of the spike proteins was used to specifically alter amino acids in this cleavage site. Cleavage of p62 was completely blocked by mutation of the proximal Arg residue to Phe, without affecting transport or surface expression of the spike protein. The cleavage mutation resulted in the loss of spike protein fusion activity within the physiological pH range. Fusion activity was restored by cleavage with exogenous chymotrypsin and showed the same low pH dependence as that of wild type. The cleavage sensitivity of newly synthesized p62 was investigated by pulse-chase analysis and chymotrypsin treatment in detergent solution. p62 was sensitive to cleavage immediately following its synthesis. Protein trapped in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, monensin, or Brefeldin A treatment was also fully sensitive to cleavage. These results suggest that p62 does not require an organelle-mediated conformational change for processing. Thus, in vivo, the site of p62 processing is probably controlled by the location or activity of the cleavage enzyme, rather than the sensitivity of the p62 substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1582526250,"This study was carried out to determine the intracellular components responsible for the transmembrane current evoked by stimulation of H1-histaminergic receptors in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. Histamine elicited an outward current that was reversed below the K+ equilibrium potential and passed voltage-independent K+ channels. A histamine concentration-dependent rise in outward current and in cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ with similar time courses was observed. The histamine-induced current was not found after depletion of internal Ca2+ stores, suggesting a coupling between internal Ca2+ and K+ current. The time course of the initial increase in inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) caused by histamine differs from that of the internal Ca2+ response. However, a significant concentration-dependent increase in inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins (1,3,4,5)P4) was seen during the whole stimulating period. The role of internal Ca2+, Ins (1,4,5)P3, and Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 on the outward current was also examined by the addition of these substances directly to the cytoplasm. Internal application of Ca2+ increased the amplitude and duration of the histamine-induced current whereas internal EGTA suppressed the outward current. Internal Ins (1,4,5)P3 did not affect the histamine-induced K+ current, Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 inhibited the outward current, and the combination of Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 and Ca2+ abolished this response. The noradrenaline response evoked under normal conditions is not reflected by a change in transmembrane current or a change in Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 but is associated with an increase in Ins (1,4,5)P3 and internal Ca2+. Stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, however, also evoked an outward current after the addition of Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 intracellularly. It is concluded that K+ channels, carrying the histamine outward current, are activated from the combined action of internal Ca2+ and Ins (1,3,4,5)P4."
https://openalex.org/W71914989,"The structure of the RecA-single-stranded DNA complex was investigated by studying the fluorescence emission of poly(deoxy-1,N6-ethenoadenylic acid (poly(d epsilon A)), a fluorescent derivative of poly(dA), under various viscosity conditions. The fluorescence intensity and average lifetime of poly(d epsilon A) are much smaller than those of nonpolymerized monoethenonucleotides (1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5'-triphosphate and 1,N6-ethenoadenine deoxyribose 5'-monophosphate) at low viscosity and reflect intramolecular base-base collisions in the polymer. They considerably increased upon RecA binding, both in the presence and absence of cofactor ATP or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). This increase, as well as the increase in fluorescence anisotropy upon RecA binding, was very similar to that which resulted from sucrose addition to free poly(d epsilon A). These observations point to a decrease in the mobility of DNA bases upon RecA binding. In the presence of cofactor, the fluorescence features became independent of viscosity. This strongly suggests the absence of base motion of significant amplitude on the time scale of the fluorescence lifetime (about 10 ns). In the absence of cofactor, however, these features remained sensitive to viscosity, implying residual local motions of the bases. Such cofactor-dependent rigid attachment of DNA bases to stiff phosphate backbone could facilitate the search for homology between two DNA molecules during recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1489107709,"Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are synthesized by transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from dolichol pyrophosphate to nascent polypeptides. Assembly of the precursor proceeds by highly ordered sequential addition of mannose and glucose to form Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Yeast mutants in asparagine-linked glycosylation (alg), generated by an 3H-Man suicide technique, were assigned to eight complementation groups which define steps in oligosaccharide-lipid synthesis (Huffaker, T.C., and Robbins, P.W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3203-3210). Alg3 invertase oligosaccharides are resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and the lipid-oligosaccharide pool yields Man5Glc-NAc2, suggesting its structure may be that from mammalian cells lacking Man-P-dolichol (Chapman, A., et al. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4441-4446). To test this supposition, the endoplasmic reticulum form of invertase derepressed in alg3,sec18 yeast at 37 degrees C was isolated as a source of oligosaccharides whose processing beyond glucose and/or mannose trimming, if involved, would be prevented. Man8GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 were released by peptide-N-glycosidase F from alg3,sec18 invertase in a 1:5 molar ratio. 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed Man8GlcNAc2 to be the alpha 1,2-mannosidase-trimming product described earlier (Byrd, J. C., Tarentino, A. L., Maley, F., Atkinson, P. H., and Trimble, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14657-14666), while Man5GlcNAc2 was Man alpha 1, 2Man alpha 1,2Man alpha 1,3(Man alpha 1,6)Man beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1, 4GlcNAc. This provides a structural proof for the lipid-linked Man5GlcNAc2 originally proposed from enzymatic and chemical analyses of the radiolabeled mammalian precursor. Experimental evidence indicates that, unlike the mammalian cell mutants which are unable to synthesize Man-P-dolichol, alg3 yeast accumulate Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol due to a defective alpha 1,3-mannosyltransferase required for the next step in oligosaccharide-lipid elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1500970069,"The initial report of Hb Indianapolis described two affected individuals with the phenotype of severe beta-thalassemia that was dominantly inherited. The structure of this variant could not be deduced by standard techniques because of its extreme instability. Because of this limitation, the structure was ascertained by analysis of the abnormal globin chain, which had been radioactively labeled. These studies strongly suggested that the structure of this variant was cysteine beta 112 to arginine. Subsequent to this report, two additional families with Hb Indianapolis were found. The carriers were minimally affected and the abnormal hemoglobin was only mildly unstable. This major difference in phenotypic expression suggested that further investigation of the original family should be carried out. Unfortunately, both of the original carriers of the variant succumbed to their severe anemia prior to the subsequent reports. However, by the use of the polymerase chain reaction, enough DNA was obtained to sequence the third exon of the beta-globin gene in the original family from the DNA scraped off a 10-year-old bone marrow microscope slide. These studies revealed a substitution of leucine to arginine at position 106 of the beta-globin chain. The polymerase chain reaction results may be consistent with the original protein structural data, if incomplete tryptic cleavage of this arginine residue occurred in the original sample. We have renamed this variant Hb Terre Haute in an attempt to avoid confusion with the Cys beta 112----Arg substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1498465552,"To investigate the role of the central helix of skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC), five deletion mutants (Dobrowolski, Z., Xu, G.Q., and Hitchcock-DeGregori, S.E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5703-5710) of chicken TnC in the D/E linker region (K87EDAKGKSEEE97), dEDA, dKG, dKGK, dSEEE, and dKED-AKGK, were assayed for their ability to regulate muscle contraction by testing their effectiveness in restoring force and Ca2+ regulation to TnC-depleted rabbit skinned skeletal muscle fibers. By comparison with rabbit skeletal TnC, wild-type TnC, and chicken TnC, all mutants except dKG equally restored force development and Ca2+ regulation to TnC-depleted skinned muscle fibers. In contrast, approximately 4 times more dKG than rabbit skeletal TnC was required to reach 50% force restoration. Also, the pCa50 for dKG activation of force was significantly decreased. Thus, most of the TnC mutants that we studied did not have significantly altered biological activity in the skinned fiber assay. However, the 2-residue deletion in the central helix (dKG) significantly affected TnC activity. This deletion would be expected to produce a 160 degree rotation in the alpha-helix versus 60 degrees for dKGK and dEDA, 40 degrees in dSEEE, and 20 degrees in dKEDAKGK. Therefore, the change in orientation of the two Ca2(+)-binding domains appears to be a major parameter affecting TnC activity. The shift in the Ca2+ dependence in force activation may result from the inability of the Ca2(+)-specific domain to properly interact with its binding site on troponin I, an interaction which is known to increase the affinity of TnC for Ca2+ (Potter, J.D., and Gergely, J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4628-4633). In addition, the length of the central helix of TnC, Gly92, and the negatively charged cluster, EEE, appear not to be crucial for TnC activity."
https://openalex.org/W1503364330,"One proposed function of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in hepatocytes is to mediate the endocytosis of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine-exposing glycoproteins. Recently we defined a of intracellular H1 subunits of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 which appeared not to be involved in endocytosis (Stoorvogel, W., Geuze, H. J., Griffith, J. M., Schwartz, A. L., and Strous, G. J. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 2137-2148). In addition, a of stably phosphorylated intracellular ASGPR has been detected (Fallon, R. J., and Schwartz, A. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13159-13166). In the current study we integrate these findings and provide evidence for the existence of two types of intracellular nonexchangeable compartments containing ASGPR. A transiently phosphorylated of ASGPR shuttles between the plasma membrane and endosomes, via a pathway identical to that of the transferrin receptor. The second comprises 20% of the total intracellular ASGPR, is stably phosphorylated at a serine residue, and is located in intracellular compartments devoid of recycling transferrin receptor. We refer to this ASGPR as the pool. We furthermore show that the two receptor pools are confined to compartments exhibiting different buoyant densities on sucrose density gradients. ASGPR in the pool is fully glycosylated, suggesting a post-Golgi sorting mechanism for trafficking to this compartment. Possible functions of the silent ASGPR are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2110518641,"Two reduced/alkylated fragments of bovine propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF) that inhibit pp-vWF binding to collagen were isolated. One is a tryptic fragment of molecular mass of about 30 kDa and inhibits the binding at a molar concentration about 20 times higher than the intact pp-vWF. Amino acid sequence of this fragment was determined almost completely, and it was revealed that this fragment corresponded to the carboxyl-terminal region of pp-vWF molecule beginning with Phe557. The other active fragment was obtained by lysyl endopeptidase digestion. This migrated as a 21.5/21-kDa doublet in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but deglycosylation of this doublet resulted in production of single species of 19 kDa. The difference between the doublet constituents, therefore, was of carbohydrate composition. The extent of inhibition of collagen-binding by this 21.5/21-kDa fragment was comparable to that of the 30-kDa fragment, and furthermore, location of this fragment in the molecule was established to be between Phe570 and Lys682. These were the only fragments among those obtained by proteolytic digestions that had significant competitive effect on the binding of intact pp-vWF to collagen. These results strongly suggest that at least one collagen-binding site should be present in the carboxyl-terminal region of bovine pp-vWF extending from residue 570 to 682."
https://openalex.org/W1601521993,"D- and L-aminooxysuccinate were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) from porcine heart. L-Aminooxysuccinate was shown to be a slow binding inhibitor of the pyridoxal phosphate form of the enzyme with a Ki of 160 nM and a half-life of the inhibited complex of 8 min. Kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition followed a two-step mechanism in which the last step was rate-limiting. D-Aminooxysuccinate was not inhibitory up to a concentration of 0.1 mM. These compounds were compared to D- and L-hydrazinosuccinate, which are potent slow binding inhibitors of aspartate aminotransferase with Ki values of 1.5 and 0.5 nM, respectively. Models of all four analogs were built into the active site of the closed form of the enzyme. The energy-minimized conformations of both L-isomers bound to aspartate aminotransferase show better geometry for hydrogen bond and ion pair formation than do the corresponding D-isomers. The aldimine double bond formed by the L-isomers is not coplanar with the pyridoxal phosphate ring in accordance with the spectral properties of the inhibitor complexes that are characterized by broad absorbance bands. This lack of planarity was not evident for the models of D-hydrazinosuccinate and D-aminooxysuccinate."
https://openalex.org/W1537102698,"Incubation of 16-kDa 125I-labeled heparin binding (acidic fibroblast) growth factor type one (HBGF-1) with human hepatoma cells and normal rat hepatocytes resulted in the appearance of a stable 125I-labeled complex with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. The complex could be isolated with specific antibodies against HBGF-1. In contrast to membrane receptor-bound 125I-HBGF-1, the complex was resistant to dissociation by detergents, acid, heat, and reducing or denaturing agents. Formation of a stable complex did not require treatment with cross-linking agents. Appearance of the 40-kDa complex was dependent on time, temperature, and enriched culture medium. Conditions that enhanced or reduced display of specific HBGF-1 membrane receptor sites enhanced or reduced the appearance of the 40-kDa complex. Dansylcadaverine, chloroquine, and staurosporine blocked the appearance of the 40-kDa complex concurrent with the blockage of internalization of the receptor-bound HBGF-1. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis, metabolic labeling with L-[35S]cysteine, and recovery of 16-kDa HBGF-1 from the 40-kDa complex after base treatment suggest involvement of a 24-kDa cellular protein in the complex formation. These results suggest a potentially novel receptor-dependent pathway for metabolism of HBGF-1."
https://openalex.org/W1671170276,"Several DNA-interactive proteins, including the DNA repair enzyme T4 endonuclease V, have been shown to locate their target recognition sites utilizing an electrostatically mediated facilitated diffusion mechanism. Previous work indicates that a decrease in the affinity of endonuclease V for nontarget DNA results in an increased nontarget dissociation rate. This study was designed to investigate the effect of an increase in the affinity of endonuclease V for nontarget DNA. Using a working structural model of the enzyme as a guide, the electrostatic character of endonuclease V was altered. Substitution of Thr-7 with Lys-7 resulted in an enzyme with wild type in vitro characteristics. Mutations which increased the positive charge along a proposed solvent-exposed alpha-helical face had significant effects. The mutants Ala-30, Val-31----Lys-30, Leu-31 and Asn-37----Lys-37 displayed wild type in vitro apurinic-specific and dimer-specific nicking activities. Although the processive dimer-specific nicking rate of the Lys-37 mutant resembled that of wild type, the rate of the Lys-30, Leu-31 mutant was reduced by 60%. In addition, the salt concentration range over which these mutants processively nick dimer-containing DNA has been greatly expanded. Both mutants are shown to have an increased affinity for nontarget DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1480438610,"Helix formation in folding proteins is stabilized by binding of recurrent hydrophobic side chains in one longitudinal quadrant against the locally most hydrophobic region of the protein. To test this hypothesis, we fitted sequences of 247 alpha-helices of 55 proteins to the circular (infinite) template (symbol; see text) to maximize the strip-of-helix hydrophobicity index (the mean hydrophobicity of residues in (symbol; see text) positions). These template-predicted configurations closely matched crystallographic structures in 87% of four- or five-turn helices compared. We determined the longitudinal quadrant distributions of amino acids in the template-fitted, sheet projections of alpha-helices with respect to the best longitudinal, hydrophobic strip on each helix and to the N and C termini, interiors, and entire helices. Amino acids Leu, Ile, Val, and Phe were concentrated in one longitudinal quadrant (p less than 0.001). Lys, Arg, Asp, and Glu were not in the quadrant of Leu, Ile, Val, and Phe (p less than 0.001). Significant quadrant distributions for other amino acids and for termini of the helices were also found."
https://openalex.org/W1586822871,"Abstract To investigate whether differential protein kinase C isozyme expression in phorbol ester-sensitive and -resistant EL4 thymoma cells could account for the difference in phorbol ester responsiveness, we purified and characterized isozymes from the two cell lines. In both cell types, two peaks of protein kinase C activity were resolved on hydroxylapatite following DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-Superose chromatography. Western blot analysis showed that the first peak corresponded to protein kinase C-beta and the second to protein kinase C-alpha. Two-dimensional phosphotryptic mapping of the purified alpha and beta isozymes did not reveal any reproducible differences between sensitive and resistant EL4 cells. Nor were any differences between the cell types observed in the cytosolic versus membrane localization of alpha and beta protein kinase C. Northern blot analysis showed the expression of mRNA for protein kinase C-alpha, -beta, -delta and -epsilon in both cell lines, and the absence of mRNA for gamma or zeta. Although no major differences in expression of alpha, beta, or delta mRNA between sensitive and resistant EL4 cells were detectable, expression of protein kinase C-epsilon mRNA in resistant cells was only 20-25% of that in sensitive. Western blot analysis with anti-protein kinase C-epsilon antibodies showed the presence of the epsilon-isozyme in sensitive cells and the absence of detectable amounts in resistant cells. Although protein kinase C-epsilon constitutes only a small portion of the total protein kinase C in sensitive cells, the possibility is raised that decreased protein kinase C-epsilon expression may contribute to the failure of resistant EL4 cells to respond to phorbol esters."
https://openalex.org/W1517720179,"Chromogranin A (secretory protein-I) is an acidic sulfated glycoprotein found in secretory granules of most endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. In the parathyroid it is co-stored and secreted with parathormone in response to hypocalcemia. Differences in post-translational modifications have been reported between chromogranin A from the bovine adrenal and porcine parathyroid glands. The former has been reported to be sulfated mainly on oligosaccharide residues and apparently includes a proteoglycan form, whereas the latter was previously reported to be tyrosine sulfated with little of the proteoglycan form present. Here we have directly compared 35SO4-labeled parathyroid chromogranin A from the pig and the cow to determine if these reported differences were tissue or species specific. We find that the chromogranin A secreted by the bovine gland contains a proteoglycan form, whereas that from the porcine gland does not. Moreover, chromogranin A of both species is primarily sulfated on oligosaccharide residues with little if any tyrosine sulfate detected. Differences were detected in the structure of sulfated O-linked oligosaccharides in bovine and porcine parathyroid chromogranin A."
https://openalex.org/W1598532853,"The structure of the nucleosome has been under intense investigation using neutron crystallography, x-ray crystallography, and neutron solution scattering. However the dimension of the histone octamer inside the nucleosome is still a subject of controversy. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the octamer obtained from solution neutron scattering of core particles at 63% 2H2O, 37% 1H2O is 33 A, and x-ray crystallography study of isolated histone octamer gives a Rg of 32.5 A, while the reported values using x-ray crystallography of core particles from two individual studies are 29.7 and 30.4 A, respectively. We report here studies of isolated histone octamer and trypsin-limited digested octamer using both neutron solution scattering and small angle x-ray scattering. The Rg of the octamer obtained is 33 A, whereas that of the trimmed octamer is 29.8 A, similar to the structure obtained from the crystals of the core particles. The N-terminal domains of the core histones in the octamer have been shown by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (Schroth, G.P., Yau, P., Imai, B.S., Gatewood, J.M., and Bradbury, E.M. (1990) FEBS Lett. 268, 117-120) to be mobile and flexible; it is likely that these regions are disordered and not seen by x-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W1534268527,"The interactions between the complement components and with immunoglobulins are greatly enhanced by lowering the ionic strength and become readily measurable by physical techniques. Thus, the binding between C1q and IgM was previously shown to be appreciable (k = 1 x 10(6) M-1) at 0.084 M ionic strength (Poon, P.H., Phillips, M.L., and Schumaker, V.N. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9357-9365). We have now found that, at 0.128 M ionic strength, the binding between human C1- (the activated first component of complement) and IgM was strong at physiological concentrations (k = 1 x 10(7) M-1), while under the same conditions binding between C1q and IgM was not observed. To explore the nature of the interactions responsible for this enhanced binding by C1- over C1q, mixtures of the various subcomponents of C1- were studied alone and with IgM. C1r2 did not bind to C1q, even when the ionic strength was reduced to 0.098 M, nor did the presence of C1r2 enhance the binding of C1q to IgM. In contrast, two C1s2 independently bound to C1q (k = 1 x 10(6) M-1), and caused a marked increase in its association with IgM (k = 5 x 10(6) M-1) at 0.098 M ionic strength. No detectable interaction was found between C1s2 and/or C1r2 and IgM in the absence of C1q. Moreover, there was no detectable interaction between the C1(-)-like complex formed between C1r2C1s2 and the collagenous C1q stalks (pepsin-digested C1q) and IgM. These data suggest that the binding of C1s2 to C1q, either alone or together with C1r2, induces a conformational change in C1q which results in additional C1q heads binding to complementary sites on IgM."
https://openalex.org/W1539572972,"The effect of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an irreversible sulfhydryl modifying reagent, on the transport of organic cations in the renal basolateral membrane was examined. The studies were conducted examining the exchange of [3H]tetraethylammonium (TEA) for unlabeled TEA in basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from the outer cortex of rabbit kidneys. NEM inactivated TEA transport in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC50 value of 260 microM. The rate of TEA transport inactivation followed apparent pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. A replot of the data gave a linear relationship between the apparent rate constants and the NEM concentration with a slope of 4.0. The data imply that inactivation involves the binding of at least four molecules of NEM per active transport unit. This is most consistent with the presence of four sulfhydryl groups at this site. The substrate TEA displayed a dose-dependent enhancement of NEM inactivation, with 50% enhancement occurring at 365 microM TEA. Another organic cation, N1-methylnicotinamide, known to share a common transport mechanism with the TEA/TEA exchanger is also capable of increasing the reactivity of sulfhydryl groups to NEM. These results demonstrate that there are essential sulfhydryl groups for organic cation transport in the basolateral membrane. In addition, the capability of organic cations to alter the susceptibility to sulfhydryl modification suggests that these groups may have a dynamic role in the transport process."
https://openalex.org/W1601085348,"Pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (PLP-AMP) inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides competitively with respect to glucose 6-phosphate and noncompetitively with respect to NAD+ or NADP+, with Ki = 40 microM in the NADP-linked and 34 microM in the NAD-linked reaction. Incubation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with [3H]PLP-AMP followed by borohydride reduction shows that incorporation of 0.85 mol of PLP-AMP per mol of enzyme subunit is required for complete inactivation. Both glucose 6-phosphate and NAD+ protect against this covalent modification. The proteolysis of the modified enzyme and isolation and sequencing of the labeled peptides revealed that Lys-21 and Lys-343 are the sites of PLP-AMP interaction and that glucose 6-phosphate and NAD+ protect both lysyl residues against modification. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) also modifies Lys-21 and probably Lys-343. Lys-21 is part of a highly conserved region that is present in all glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases that have been sequenced. Lys-343 corresponds to an arginyl residue in other glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases and is in a region that is less homologous with those enzymes. PLP-AMP and PLP are believed to interact with L. mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase at the glucose 6-phosphate binding site. Simultaneous binding of NAD+ induces conformational changes (Kurlandsky, S. B., Hilburger, A. C., and Levy, H. R. (1988) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 264, 93-102) that are postulated to interfere with Schiff's-base formation with PLP or PLP-AMP. One or both of the lysyl residues covalently modified by PLP or PLP-AMP may be located in regions of the enzyme undergoing the NAD(+)-induced conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W2013159524,AIDS scientists met in February 1991 to discuss international trials of AIDS vaccines because of the urgency in conducting such trials since the US Food and Drug Administration approved 6 vaccines for trails. Major problems discussed were how to insure access to potential AIDS vaccines to developing countries where to conduct future tests of vaccine efficacy and which of the leading institutions should coordinate such an effort. The most difficult issue centered around who assumes the risks and who benefits. Many researchers considered conducting AIDS vaccine trials in developing countries since they have a large population varied in age and gender at high risk of HIV infection. Assuming an HIV vaccine is effective additional questions must be addressed: How can a developing country afford a vaccine at free market prices? If that country does get the vaccine should not other developing countries also get it? Who will pay for it and distribute it? WHO has already contacted ministries of health about AIDS trials. Other organizations e.g. the US Centers for Disease Control and the US National Institutes of Health also already involved in international AIDS vaccine research do not want to be kept out of the Phase III trials. Some recommended that WHO be the international umbrella others suggested that no organization control all the research. Nevertheless the vaccine will be produced in a rich country and if left to the free market it will be too expensive. 1 suggestions is a 2-tiered pricing plan in which rich countries pay higher prices thereby subsidizing the price in poor countries. Another is a patent exchange where the vaccine developers donate the vaccine patent to an international organization and they in turn can get an extension on an existing patent. Another alternative includes removing AIDS vaccines from the private sector altogether.
