https://openalex.org/W2022120692,"If we accept the evidence at face value, we are led to conclude that emmer was probably domesticated in the upper Jordan watershed and that einkorn was domesticated in southeast Turkey. Barley could have been domesticated almost anywhere within the arc bordering the fertile crescent. All three cereals may well have been harvested in the wild state throughout their regions of adaptation long before actual farming began. The primary habitats for barley, however, are not the same as those for the wheats. Wild barley is more xerophytic and extends farther downslope and into the steppes and deserts along the wadis. It seems likely that, while all three early cereals were domesticated within an are flanking the fertile crescent, each was domesticated in a different subregion of the zone."
https://openalex.org/W2042174116,"Adult males of Anolis conspersus capture prey of significantly larger size and occupy perches of significantly greater diameter and height than do adult females; similarly, these three dimensions of the niche are significantly larger for adult females than for juveniles. Adult males on the average eat a smaller number of prey, and the range in size of prey is larger. The relationship between the average length of the prey and that of the predator is linear when the predator size is above 36 millimeters, but becomes asymptotic when it is below that value. Subadult males as long as adult females eat significantly larger food than do the latter, but only in the larger lizards is this correlated with a relatively larger head. Anolis conspersus selects prey from a wide range of taxa and shows no obvious intraspecific specialization not connected to differences in microhabitat and prey size. The efficiency of this system for solitary species is pointed out."
https://openalex.org/W3206083229,"The small-watershed approach to problems of nutrient cycling has these advantages. (i) The small watershed is a natural unit of suitable size for intensive study of nutrient cycling at the ecosystem level. (ii) It provides a means of reducing to a minimum, or virtually eliminating, the effect of the difficult-to-measure variables of geologic input and nutrient losses in deep seepage. Control of these variables makes possible accurate measurement of nutrient input and output (erosion) and therefore establishes the relationship of the smaller ecosystem to the larger biospheric cycles. (iii) The small-watershed approach provides a method whereby such important parameters as nutrient release from minerals (weathering) and annual nutrient budgets may be calculated. (iv) It provides a means of studying the interrelationships between the biota and the hydrologic cycle, various nutrient cycles, and energy flow in a single system. (v) Finally, with the small-watershed system we can test the effect of various land-management practices or environmental pollutants on nutrient cycling in natural systems."

Results obtained within 6 months of the lake formation show that log fo(o2) normally varies linearly with the reciprocal of the absolute temperature, and that chemical changes occurring in the cooling tholeiitic basalt are reflected in the fo(o2) values measured in the holes."
https://openalex.org/W2125471453,"The isotopic compositions of lead and the concentrations lead, uranium, and thorium in samples of oceanic tholeiite and alkali suites are determined, and the genetic relations of the oceanic basalts are discussed. Lead of the oceanic tholeiites has a varying lead-206: lead-204 ratio between 17.8 and 18.8, while leads of the alkali basalt suites from Easter Island and Guadalupe Island are very radiogenic with lead-206: lead-204 ratios between 19.3 and 20.4 It is concluded that (i) the isotopic composition of lead in oceanic tholeiite suggests that the upper mantle source region of the tholeiite was differentiated from and original mantle material more than 1 billion years ago and that the upper mantle is not homogeneous at the present time, (ii) less than 20 million years was required for the crystal differentiation within the alkali suite from Easter Island, (iii) no crustal contamination was involved in the course of differentiation of rocks from Easter Island; however, some crustal contamination may have affected Guadalupe Island rocks, and (iv) alkali basalt may be produced from the tholeiite in the oceanic region by crystal differentiation. Alternatively the difference in the isotopic composition of lead in oceanic basalts may be produced by partial melting at different depths of a differentiated upper mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2063491164,"The mechanism of many organic oxidation and reduction reactions can be described in terms of the formation and reaction of free radicals with metal complexes. Redox (trace-metal) catalysis also involves the oxidation and reduction of radical intermediates with a metal species which oscillates between several oxidation states (4). The oxidation and reduction of free radicals with metal complexes follow two general mechanisms, electron transfer and ligand transfer. Direct analogy exists with wholly inorganic descriptions of outer-sphere and innersphere processes. In an electron transfer or outersphere mechanism the redox process is derived largely by transfer of an electron from reductant to oxidant, with only indirect contributions from the solvent and ligand. Carbonium ion intermediates and transition states are important considerations, and the scission of the beta-hydrogen bond is minor during oxidation of alkyl radicals to alkenes. In contrast, ligand transfer or inner-sphere mechanism demands maximum involvement of the ligand in the transition state. Free-radical character prevails; cationic contributions from the organic moiety are minimal. Oxidation and reduction are conjugate processes. In an electron transfer mechanism the oxidation of alkyl radicals to carbonium ions is conceptually represented by a microscopic reverse reaction in which a carbonium ion is reduced to an alkyl radical. A similar duality exists in the interconversion of carbanions and free radicals by metal complexes. The reversibility of the ligand transfer process is easier to observe. For example, the chlorine-transfer oxidation of alkyl radicals is represented by a microscopic reverse reduction of alkyl chlorides to alkyl radicals by cuprous chlorides. A ligand transfer counterpart of the reduction of radicals R*+Cu(II)Cl(n)<---->R-Cl+Cu(I)Cl(n-1) can also be described. Hopefully, these simple redox mechanisms will be utilized in rationalizing complex reactions and formulating new syntheses. The limited number of examples cited in this short review represent only an introduction to the vast area of chemical research to be tapped in the study of the mechanisms and the synthetic utility of oxidation-reduction reactions and catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2093745848,"Aluminum-26 has been detected in a sample of sediment from the South Pacific. The disintegration rate of 0.8 disintegration per minute per kilogram of dry sediment is considerably higher than that expected from cosmic-ray spallation of atmospheric argon; it appears to result mainly from accretion of activity induced in interplanetary dust by solar-flare particles. This finding is in keeping with Wasson's published estimates regarding the magnitude of this effect, and confirms the order-of-magnitude correctness of the solar-particle flux and terrestrial accretion rate of interplanetary dust used in that calculation."

Results indicate that the spacecraft will probably not impact on the moon before it completes its photographic mission, but that it will probably do so in about 8 months. Preliminary indications are that the moon has a relatively large pear-shaped component and that the gravitational properties will be of considerable scientific interest."

https://openalex.org/W1995031857,"In summary, there are certain issues that need to be dealt with if a coherent system of victim compensation is to be created. 1) Is the victim's entitlement to compensation qualified by his behavior in connection with the crime? If a Texas tycoon visits a clip joint, flashes a fat roll of bills, and gets hit on the head and rolled, is he entitled to compensation? If a man enters into a liaison with another's wife and gets shot by the husband, should his dependents be compensated? If a woman goes walking alone in a disreputable neighborhood and is assaulted, is she entitled to compensation? Unless the answer to such questions is a flat ""yes,"" the adjudication of victim compensation as a ""right"" would be embarkation upon a vast sea of confusion. On the surface it may seem simpler to bypass the issue of ""right"" and declare for victim compensation as a matter of social policy-a logical extension of the welfare state approach. But the apparent simplicity may quickly prove illusory, in light of the second issue. 2) Is the victim's entitlement to compensation on the basis of indigency to be qualified by the requirement that an offender be apprehended and his guilt determined by a court? There are two levels to this problem. First, if a severely injured man reports to police that he has been mugged and robbed and if the police cannot apprehend a suspect, how is the administrator of compensation to know that the man is in fact the victim of a crime? The administrator of compensation must determine whether the episode was a criminal act or an argument-and who started it, and who precipitated the violence. What shall be the role of the witnesses, and of investigators? More important is the second level of the problem: How will law-enforcement of ficials and the courts evaluate the testimony of the victim if compensation of the victim may be at stake? In the evaluation of proposals for victim compensation, criminologists may need to think very hard about such questions and about the probable effects on the administration of criminal justice. These are pragmatic problems; there is a third problem which may at this time seem speculative, but is, nevertheless, quite important. 3) To what extent will a particular proposal for victim compensation contribute to a temptation-opportunity pattern in victim behavior? In previous studies it has been pointed out that large numbers of our fellow Americans have tended to acquire casual money-handling habits-generically designated ""carelessness""-which contribute to the national growth of criminality. How the victim helps the criminal was sketched in reports of those studies (10). It was made abundantly clear that human beings in our affluent society cannot be assumed to be prudent or self-protective against the hazards of crime. Even when the ""victim"" is not overtly acting to commit a crime-as in the case of the property owner who hires an arsonist-he often tempts the offender. Among the victims of burglary-statistically the most prevalent crime in the United States-are a substantial number of Americans who keep cash, jewelry, and other valuables carelessly at home or in hotel rooms to which the burglar has easy access through door or window. Victims of automobile theft-one of the fastest growing classes of crime-include drivers who leave the vehicle or its contents invitingly accessible to thieves. And so on with other classes of crime. As pointed out in previous studies, when victim behavior follows a temptation-opportunity pattern, it (i) contributes to a ""climate of criminal inducements,"" (ii) adds to the economic resources available to criminal societies, and (iii) detracts from the ability of lawenforcement agencies to suppress the growth of crime."

Thtee separate balloons have flown for more than 6 months at 200 millibars, proving capability of the long life that had been hoped for at such middle altitudes and providing preliminary trajectory data for the Southern Hemisphere. Icing problems at lower altitudes have not yet been solved. We expect future flight durations of several years at higher altitudes. If successful, the new balloons will be useful platforms for experimenters concerned with study of large-scale and long-term effects in the stratosphere."
