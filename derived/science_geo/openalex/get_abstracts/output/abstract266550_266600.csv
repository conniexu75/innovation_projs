https://openalex.org/W2077990096,"The chemical composition of the lunar surface material at a maria landing site has been determined by the alpha-scattering technique. Oxygen, silicon, and aluminum have been identified in the preliminary evaluation of the data. The general chemical composition is similar to that of a silicate of a basaltic type."
https://openalex.org/W2088209646,A pediplain in the Chilean Atacama Desert formed during Oligocene and Miocene time when the aridity of the region started and was later displaced by north-trending faults associated with the Andean uplift. Block basins and some horsts were later concealed by Upper Tertiary and Quaternary orogenic sediments and ignimbrites.
https://openalex.org/W2063974875,"Enchenopa binotata is a complex of six treehopper species that have diverged along host plant lines. When females were forced to oviposit on ""adopted"" host plants, few eggs were deposited. Fewer eggs hatched on ""adopted"" hosts and those that did hatch did so in response to the phenology of the ""adopted"" host. Mortality of nymphs on ""adopted"" hosts was substantially higher than on native hosts. These and other data support a sympatric model of speciation through shifts in host plants."

https://openalex.org/W2074408490,"A high molecular weight crystalline protein, possessing the properties of ring spot virus and differing markedly from tobacco mosaic virus protein in its physical, chemical and serological properties, has been isolated by means of an ultracentrifuge from Turkish tobacco plants diseased with tobacco ring spot virus. Ultracentrifugal methods were also used to demonstrate that high molecular weight proteins are characteristic of other virus diseases. The concentration of the different virus proteins in the host was found to differ greatly. The quantity ultracentrifuge, used in conjunction with an analytical ultracentrifuge, has proven to be a powerful tool for the concentration, purification and crystallization of high molecular weight virus proteins and to be indispensable in the case of unstable viruses existing in low concentration in the host."

https://openalex.org/W2062519439,"Expulsion of anal fluid from the upturned abdomen was demonstrated to serve a defensive function in the thrips Bagnalliella yuccae. An allomone in the anal exudate was identified as gamma-decalactone, a fruity-smelling compound that repelled potential predators. Chemical defenses may contribute to the ability of thrips to maintain large aggregations."
https://openalex.org/W2029776743,"Material of basaltic composition at the Surveyor V landing site implies that differentiation has occurred in the moon, probably due to internal sources of heat. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that extensive volcanic flows have been responsible for flooding and filling the mare basins. The processes and products of lunar magmatic activity are apparently similar to those of the earth."
https://openalex.org/W2021135296,"Surveyor V landed in a small crater, 8.5 meters wide and 12.5 meters long, which was probably formed by drainage of surficial fragmental debris into a subsurface fissure. The lunar surface debris layer is exposed in the walls of this crater. At depths below about 10 centimeters, the debris appears to be composed mainly of shock-compressed aggregates, ranging from a few millimeters up to 3 centimeters in diameter, set in a matrix of less-coherent finer particles. Rocky chips and fragments larger than a millimeter are dispersed as a subordinate constituent of the debris."
https://openalex.org/W2049036895,"Gaseous respiration by central mudminnows (Umbra limi), particularly their use of bubbles composed of gas mixtures other than air, may have evolved as an adaptation to the oxygen-depleted, carbon dioxide-rich water of winterkill lakes. Under simulated winterkill conditions, mudminnows frequently engulfed gaseous bubbles. Use of bubbles was not related to varying methane or nitrogen content (0 to 80 percent) when all bubbles contained 20 percent oxygen. When the oxygen content of bubbles varied (0 to 20 percent), fish visited bubbles randomly but remained longer and took fewer ""breaths"" at bubbles with high oxygen content. High temperature (16 degrees to 34 degrees C) and low pH (6.8 to 4.5) did not stimulate increased air-breathing when dissolved oxygen was sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W2100432328,"During the Surveyor V landing, a footpad with an attached permanent magnet assembly slid for about a meter through lunar surface material at a depth of about 10 centimeters. Subsequent pictures showed material adhering to the magnetic pole edges, where the magnetic field strength is greatest. Comparison of these pictures with those made under simulated laboratory conditions permits three conclusions. (i) Iron is present on the lunar surface in one of the forms attracted to a 500-gauss magnet. (ii) A 1-percent addition by volume of powdered free iron to a powdered terrestrial rock represents an upper limit for the lunar results. (iii) The lunar results are most similar to a terrestrial plateau basalt with no addition of free iron."

https://openalex.org/W2091479290,"The mechanical properties of the lunar soil at the Surveyor V landing site seem to be generally consistent with values determined for soils at the landing sites of Surveyor I and III. These three maria sites are hundreds of kilometers apart. However, the static bearing capability may be somewhat lower than that at the previous landing sites (2 x 10(5) to 6 x 10(5) dynes per square centimeter or 3 to 8 pounds per square inch). The results of the erosion experiment, the spacecraft landing effects, and other observations indicate that the soil has significant amounts of fine-grained material and a measurable cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W4234365067,"Surveyor V has provided the first direct chemical analysis of the lunar surface. In addition, the amount of ferromagnetic material was measured. More than 18,000 television pictures were taken, and a variety of scientific data were obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2094800975,"Astronomical observations in Arizona recorded the passage of one, and possibly more, volcanic dust clouds between January and June 1982. On 15 May the increase in extinction in visible wavelengths at Tucson was more than 40 percent or 0.4 in optical depth. At Flagstaff, 325 kilometers north, the increase in extinction on the same day was 25 percent. A detailed time history of atmospheric extinction plus evidence for nongray absorption from the cloud is presented."
