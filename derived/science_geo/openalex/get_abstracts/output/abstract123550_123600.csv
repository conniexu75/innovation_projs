We have recently isolated MT1-MMP complexed with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2) and demonstrated that MT1-MMP exhibits gelatinolytic activity by gelatin zymography (Imai, K., Ohuchi, E., Aoki, T., Nomura, H., Fujii, Y., Sato, H., Seiki, M., and Okada, Y. (1996) Cancer Res. 56, 2707-2710). In the present study, we have further purified to homogeneity a deletion mutant of MT1-MMP lacking the transmembrane domain (ΔMT1) and native MT1-MMP secreted from a human breast carcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-231 cells) and examined their substrate specificities. Both proteinases are active, without any treatment for activation, and digest type I (guinea pig), II (bovine), and III (human) collagens into characteristic 3/4 and 1/4 fragments. The cleavage sites of type I collagen are the Gly775-Ile776 bond for α1(I) chains and the Gly775-Leu776 and Gly781-Ile782 bonds for α2(I) chains. ΔMT1 hydrolyzes type I collagen 6.5- or 4-fold more preferentially than type II or III collagen, whereas MMP-1 (tissue collagenase) digests type III collagen more efficiently than the other two collagens. Quantitative analyses of the activity of ΔMT1 and MMP-1 indicate that ΔMT1 is 5-7.1-fold less efficient at cleaving type I collagen. On the other hand, gelatinolytic activity of ΔMT1 is 8-fold higher than that of MMP-1. ΔMT1 also digests cartilage proteoglycan, fibronectin, vitronectin and laminin-1 as well as α1-proteinase inhibitor and α2-macroglobulin. The activity of ΔMT1 on type I collagen is synergistically increased with co-incubation with MMP-2. These results indicate that MT1-MMP is an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme sharing the substrate specificity with interstitial collagenases, and suggest that MT1-MMP plays a dual role in pathophysiological digestion of extracellular matrix through direct cleavage of the substrates and activation of proMMP-2.

We examined interactions of the epothilones with purified tubulin and additional cell lines, including a paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma line with an altered β-tubulin. The epothilones, like paclitaxel, induced tubulin to form microtubules at low temperatures and without GTP and/or microtubule-associated proteins. The epothilones are competitive inhibitors of the binding of [3H]paclitaxel to tubulin polymers. The apparent Ki values for epothilones A and B were 1.4 and 0.7 μM by Hanes analysis and 0.6 and 0.4 μM by Dixon analysis. In the paclitaxel-sensitive human cell lines we examined, epothilone B had greater antiproliferative activity than epothilone A or paclitaxel, while epothilone A was usually less active than paclitaxel. A multidrug-resistant colon carcinoma line and the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian line retained sensitivity to the epothilones. With Potorous tridactylis kidney epithelial (PtK2) cells examined by indirect immunofluorescence, microtubule bundles appeared more rapidly following epothilone B treatment, and there were different proportions of various mitotic aberrations following treatment with different drugs.

Many facets of cellular growth depend on microtubules. They provide support for organelles and membranes, resist compressive forces, provide tracks for intracellular vesicular transport and sorting, and form spindle fibers for chromosomal separation and segregation (1Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York1994Google Scholar). Composed of the heterodimeric protein tubulin, microtubules are dynamic structures that undergo periods of slow growth and rapid shortening both in vitro and in cells (2Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar, 3Schulze E. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1020-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Cassimeris L. Pryer N.K. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2223-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cellular functions of microtubules probably depend on this phenomenon. Jordan et al. (5Jordan M.A. Toso R.J. Thrower D. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9552-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) have shown that significant alterations of dynamic instability occur with a variety of antimitotic drugs that interact with tubulin. An increasing number of such compounds, displaying great structural diversity, have become available, and the most potent of these agents were initially isolated from natural sources (6Hamel E. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 207-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Typically, such compounds inhibit tubulin polymerization, and all lead to mitotic arrest.

Recently, three non-taxoid compounds have also been shown to stabilize microtubules. The macrolides EpA and EpB, from the bacterium Sorangium cellulosum (11Bollag D.M. McQueney P.A. Zhu J. Hensens O. Koupal L. Liesch J. Goetz M. Lazarides E. Woods C.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar), and the polyhydroxylated alkatetraene lactone Dcd (structures in Fig. 1), from the marine sponge Discodermia dissoluta (12ter Haar E. Kowalski R.J. Hamel E. Lin C.M. Longley R.E. Gunasekera S.P. Rosenkranz H.S. Day B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), share with Ptx the ability to arrest cells in mitosis, cause formation of bundles of intracellular microtubules in non-mitotic cells, and induce the formation of hyperstable tubulin polymers. Because the initial studies with the epothilones were performed with microtubule protein (11Bollag D.M. McQueney P.A. Zhu J. Hensens O. Koupal L. Liesch J. Goetz M. Lazarides E. Woods C.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar), we decided it was important to examine the interactions of these new drugs with purified tubulin and characterize the effects of MAPs and GTP on these interactions. We compared interactions between tubulin and Ptx with those between tubulin and the epothilones under a variety of conditions. Of particular interest to us was the nature of the binding site of the epothilones on microtubules because of the lack of structural similarity between the taxoids, Dcd, and the epothilones. Despite this dissimilarity, we observed a competitive pattern of inhibition by EpA and EpB on the binding of [3H]Ptx to polymer formed with purified tubulin. EpB was the most effective compound in inducing assembly of tubulin polymers, while the potency of EpA was similar to that of Ptx. We also report initial studies on the antiproliferative effects of EpA and EpB in cultured cells. With Potorous tridactylis kidney epithelial (PtK2) cells, we confirmed the cellular reorganization of microtubules described by Bollag et al. (11Bollag D.M. McQueney P.A. Zhu J. Hensens O. Koupal L. Liesch J. Goetz M. Lazarides E. Woods C.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar). We found that EpB was more potent than Ptx and EpA, which tended to be less potent than Ptx, in inhibiting the growth of five human tumor cell lines. The epothilones retained their potency in cell lines resistant to Ptx. EpA and EpB were isolated from S. cellulosum (11Bollag D.M. McQueney P.A. Zhu J. Hensens O. Koupal L. Liesch J. Goetz M. Lazarides E. Woods C.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar). The compounds were generously provided by Dr. Michael Goetz of Merck Research Laboratories. Ptx and [3H]Ptx (19-23 mCi/mmol) were obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI (Rockville, MD). Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and control samples contained equivalent amounts of solvent. Heat-treated MAPs and electrophoretically homogeneous tubulin were prepared from bovine brain (13Hamel E. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4173-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Tubulin was freed from unbound nucleotide by gel-filtration chromatography, reconcentrated, and dialyzed against 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.9) as described elsewhere (8Grover S. Rimoldi J.R. Molinero A.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3927-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The tubulin was centrifuged to remove aggregated protein and stored in liquid nitrogen in 0.2-ml aliquots. Human Burkitt lymphoma CA46 cells were a gift from Dr. P. O'Connor, NCI (Bethesda, MD); P. tridactylis kidney epithelial (PtK2) cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. The human ovarian carcinoma line 1A9 (14Behrens B.C. Hamilton T.C. Masuda H. Grotzinger K.R. Whang- Peng J. Louie K.G. Knutsen T. McKoy W.M. Young R.C. Ozols R.F. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 414-418PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate a Ptx-resistant line, 1A9 (PTX22), by incubating the cells with increasing concentrations of Ptx in the presence of verapamil. 2P. Giannakakou, D. L. Sackett, Y.-K. Kang, Z. Zhang, J. Regis, T. Fojo, and M. Poruchynsky, manuscript in preparation. The human colon carcinoma line SW620 and its subline SW620AD-300, which overexpresses P-glycoprotein, were described elsewhere (15Lai G.M. Chen Y.-N. Mickley L.A. Fojo A.T. Bates S.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Culture media and FCS were from Life Technologies, Inc., Permanox and glass slides from Nunc, murine monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody and GTP from Sigma, and Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG and ProLong antifade fluorescent mounting media from Molecular Probes. GTP and ddGTP (from Pharmacia) were repurified by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Cells were grown in 5-ml suspension cultures at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI medium supplemented to 2 mM glutamine, 12% FCS, 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and varying drug concentrations. The initial inoculum was 105 cells/ml. For determination of IC50 values, cells were grown for 72 h and counted in a Coulter counter. The IC50 drug concentration inhibited increase in cell number by 50%. Cells were continually incubated in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS, 12 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 2 mM glutamine. The medium for the Ptx-resistant ovarian line also contained 5 μg/ml verapamil (to inhibit expression of P-glycoprotein) and 15 ng/ml Ptx. Prior to drug treatment, the Ptx-resistant ovarian cells were removed from Ptx-containing media for 5-7 days. Drug effects were determined in 96-well microtiter plates, with cells fixed and stained for protein (16Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8824) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of PtK2 cells, grown on 25-cm2 plates, were suspended by incubation with 7 ml/plate of 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA in Hank's balanced salt solution. Suspended cells were diluted 1:40 with MEM containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate and allowed to attach and grow for 24 h at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere on sterile, eight-well Permanox or glass cell-culture slides (300 μl/well, 103 cells/well). Medium was removed and attached cells were incubated in supplemented MEM containing 10 μM drug at 37°C. After various incubation times, medium was removed, and cells were rinsed with PBS at 37°C. Attached cells were fixed in −20°C methanol for 10 min, rinsed three times with PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% FCS for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific antibody binding sites. The blocking buffer was removed, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with antibody to β-tubulin (200 μl/well, 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer). Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 45 min with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (150 μl/well, 1:50 dilution in PBS). Following removal of the secondary antibody by two washes with PBS, diaminopropidium iodide (2 μg/ml) dissolved in PBS was added to stain DNA. Slides were wet-mounted in ProLong according to the manufacturer's procedures. Cells were examined with a Nikon Optiphot-2 epifluorescence microscope and photographs taken with Kodak T-MAX 100 film. Polymerization was followed turbidimetrically at 350 nm in Gilford model 250 spectrophotometers equipped with electronic temperature controllers. Base-line levels were established with the reaction mixtures, containing all components except drug, held at 0°C. Drug was added and mixed into the reaction mixture, and the reaction was followed as indicated at 0°C. Temperature settings were changed as indicated, rising in the reaction mixtures at 0.5°C/s and falling at 0.1°C/s. For all binding studies, tubulin polymer was preformed in the absence of drugs for 30 min at 37°C in reaction mixtures containing 2 μM tubulin, 20 μM ddGTP, and 0.75 M monosodium glutamate (2 M stock solution adjusted to pH 6.6 with HCl). This condition induced nearly complete assembly of tubulin into polymer (data not presented; cf. Refs. 17Hamel E. del Campo A.A. Lin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2501-2508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hamel E. Lustbader J. Lin C.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Hamel E. Vaughns J. Getahun Z. Johnson R. Lin C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Mixtures of EpA or EpB with [3H]Ptx in varying concentrations were added to preformed polymer and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Bound [3H]Ptx was separated from free [3H]Ptx by centrifugation of the reaction mixtures at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 20 min at room temperature. Greater than 90% of added protein sedimented under these conditions even in the absence of drug. Protein and radiolabel in both supernatants and pellets (dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH overnight and neutralized with 0.1 M HCl) were quantitated by the Lowry procedure and liquid scintillation counting. Data from at least three independent experiments were combined for data analysis. During polymerization reactions 10 μl aliquots were removed at various times and placed on 200-mesh carbon-coated, Formvar-treated, copper grids. Samples were stained with several drops of 0.5% uranyl acetate and examined in a Zeiss model 10CA electron microscope. Table I summarizes inhibitory effects of EpA, EpB, and Ptx on the growth of five human tumor cell lines. In all cases EpB was more potent than Ptx or EpA. Burkitt cells treated with EpA or EpB accumulated in mitotic arrest (data not presented; cf. Ref. 11Bollag D.M. McQueney P.A. Zhu J. Hensens O. Koupal L. Liesch J. Goetz M. Lazarides E. Woods C.M.

The MDR colon carcinoma line SW620AD-300, with over a 1000-fold increased resistance to Ptx relative to its parental line, had sensitivity to EpA and EpB similar to that of the parental line.Table I.Inhibitory effects of Ptx, EpA, and EpB on growth of human cancer cellsDrugIC50 (relative resistance)aThe drug concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%.

Open table in a new tab The ovarian carcinoma cells were evaluated because of the characterization of the biochemical properties of tubulins derived from the parental line and from a Ptx-resistant line2 that strongly indicate that resistance was caused by an altered β-tubulin. It is therefore notable that the parental and Ptx-resistant lines had nearly equal sensitivity to both EpA and EpB while retaining significant resistance to several potent taxoids we have examined, including docetaxel and 2-debenzoyl-2-meta-azidobenzoylpaclitaxel. 3P. Giannakakou, P. G. I. Kingston, and E. Hamel, unpublished observations. PtK2 cells were used to evaluate the effects of EpA, EpB, and Ptx on intracellular microtubules. IC50 values, determined by counting both adherent and detached cells, were 40, 44, and 120 nM for EpA, EpB, and Ptx, respectively. We confirmed the findings of Bollag et al. (11Bollag D.M. McQueney P.A. Zhu J. Hensens O. Koupal L. Liesch J. Goetz M. Lazarides E. Woods C.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar) that EpA and EpB, like Ptx, enhance intracellular microtubule assembly. Fig. 2 illustrates the effects of these drugs on cellular microtubules at 2, 6, and 24 h. Panels A-C show control cells; D-F, cells treated with Ptx; G-I, with EpB; and J-L, with EpA. All three drugs caused microtubules to become more bundled and to develop multiple regions of nucleation (arrows in Fig. 2, E, G, and K) in interphase cells (those with nuclei). Bundling of microtubules at 2 h was more extensive following EpB treatment than treatment with the other drugs. After 24 h (Fig. 2, F, I, and L), microtubules were found almost exclusively in large bundles. Each drug examined produced similar cellular changes overall, but a few morphological differences were noted, especially in mitotic cells. A variety of mitotic aberrations were observed as early as 2 h and were maximal at 6 h (Table II). With 10 μM drug, normal spindles were never observed, and microtubule organization in mitotic cells (those with condensed chromosomes and no apparent nuclear membrane) was distinct from that in interphase cells. This suggests that, despite the high stability of microtubules formed in biochemical systems with these drugs (see below), substantial microtubule turnover occurs in cells (cf. Refs. 5Jordan M.A. Toso R.J. Thrower D. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9552-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar and 20Derry W.B. Wilson L.

Open table in a new tab Most mitotic cells could be placed in one of three categories (Table II). Each subtype was observed following treatment with all three drugs, but relative proportions varied. Ptx produced more punctate-stained spindle aberrations (Fig. 2, D and E, arrowheads), probably representing multiple microtubule organizing centers or spindle poles. Short filaments resembling astral microtubules were attached to the multiple spindle poles, and these are listed as “aster spindles” in Table II. Astral microtubules appeared to be longer in epothilone-treated cells than in Ptx-treated cells. With EpB most mitotic cells had complex arrays of relatively long microtubules that formed a spiral pattern. Such “spiral spindles” had only one apparent or two poorly separated microtubule organizing centers (Fig. 2H, arrowhead). The third distinct type of mitotic cell was most abundant following treatment with EpA. These “spike spindles” (not shown) had short clusters of thick microtubules originating from one or two microtubule organizing centers, and they may represent a variant of the aster spindles resulting when the microtubule organizing center remained intact. We do not know if these aberrant spindles represent any sort of progression, although the spikes were observed only at the later time points, and with both EpA and Ptx asters were observed before either spirals or spikes. Finally, additional mitotic cells had patterns of microtubule organization that did not fit any of these categories (Fig. 2J, arrowhead). Ptx and other taxoids induce tubulin assembly under conditions where the reaction usually does not occur, and taxoid-induced polymers are more stable than normal microtubules. Thus, with these drugs assembly can occur at low temperatures and in the absence of MAPs and/or exogenous GTP, and the polymers formed are resistant to disassembly by calcium, dilution, or low temperatures (7Schiff P.B.

Lazarides E. Woods C.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar) showed that EpA and EpB induced the assembly of microtubule protein in the absence of GTP at 37°C, with substoichiometric (relative to tubulin) concentrations of the scarcer EpB inducing more extensive assembly than an equivalent concentration of EpA or Ptx, which had nearly identical activities. They also showed that microtubules induced by the epothilones were resistant to cold- or calcium-induced disassembly. However, no studies were performed with purified tubulin and MAPs to define their relative importance in the interactions of polymer with the epothilones, nor was assembly at low temperatures evaluated. To address these issues we performed the experiments presented in Fig. 3, examining assembly reactions induced by the epothilones and Ptx. Assembly was followed at a series of progressively higher temperatures, and polymer stability was evaluated by a final incubation at 0°C. Panel A presents reactions with both MAPs and GTP, panel B with MAPs only, and panel C with GTP only. Equimolar concentrations (10 μM) of tubulin and drug were used. EpB always caused the most vigorous polymerization of tubulin, while the relative activities observed with EpA and Ptx depended on the reaction condition. In the presence of GTP and MAPs (Fig. 3A), the only condition that supported microtubule assembly without drug, EpB and to a lesser extent EpA, induced tubulin polymerization at 0°C, whereas assembly with Ptx required a higher temperature. Assembly was near its maximum with all compounds after 10 min at 25°C, with the highest turbidity reading obtained with EpB. When the reaction temperature was reduced to 0°C, there was a slight decrease in turbidity with EpA and Ptx but not with EpB. Tubulin polymer formed without drug disassembled to near base-line level at 0°C, and, without drug, assembly required a 25°C incubation. Electron micrographs of aliquots taken from reaction mixtures after 1 h at 0°C with all three drugs showed that microtubules remained intact (data not shown). Addition of 5 mM CaCl2 at 0°C resulted in nearly complete disassembly of Ptx and EpA polymers, while the EpB polymer remained intact (data not shown). This total stability of the EpB-induced polymer is thus identical to that observed with Dcd (12ter Haar E. Kowalski R.J. Hamel E. Lin C.M. Longley R.E. Gunasekera S.P. Rosenkranz H.S. Day B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). When reaction mixtures contained tubulin and MAPs but no GTP (Fig. 3B), more vigorous assembly occurred with EpA or EpB than with Ptx. The epothilones induced assembly at 10°C, and maximum turbidity readings occurred at 25°C. With Ptx, no assembly occurred until the temperature reached 25°C, and a 37°C incubation was required for maximum assembly. When the temperature was returned to 0°C, little disassembly occurred with any of the drug-induced polymers. A different pattern was obtained when GTP, but not MAPs, was added (Fig. 3C). While each drug nucleated polymer growth at 25°C, under this reaction condition greater apparent activity (see below) was observed with Ptx than with EpA. EpB induced near maximum turbidity at 25°C, whereas Ptx and EpA caused modest reactions. At 37°C, little additional assembly occurred with EpB, but further polymerization was observed with Ptx and EpA. The turbidity reading with Ptx was nearly twice that which occurred with EpA. When the reaction temperature was returned to 0°C, the epothilone-induced polymer was somewhat more resistant to disassembly than the Ptx-induced polymer. In the absence of both GTP and MAPs, none of the drugs stimulated significant tubulin polymerization at 10 μM drug + 10 μM tubulin. Reactions did occur at higher concentrations of tubulin or drug. The ability of the taxoids, Dcd, and the epothilones to induce assembly at low temperatures and without MAPs and/or GTP are probably manifestations of the ability of these agents to cause hypernucleation of tubulin polymerization. Perhaps the best quantitative measure of this property is the [T]cr. We recently reported on [T]cr values obtained with a series of taxoids that included compounds both more and less active than Ptx (8Grover S. Rimoldi J.R. Molinero A.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3927-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The quantitative results were in excellent agreement with the qualitative effects of these agents on assembly at low temperatures and in the absence of MAPs or GTP. We therefore compared [T]cr values of the 37°C reactions induced by the epothilones with those induced by Ptx at 10 μM drug (Table III).Table III.[T]cr values for assembly with Ptx, EpA, and EpBDrug[T]cr± S.E.MAPs and GTPaWithout drug, the [T]cr under this reaction condition was 3.0 ± 0.05 μM.MAPs onlyGTP onlyNo MAPs or GTPμMPtx0.24 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.44.3 ± 0.422 ± 1EpA0.28 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.819 ± 2EpB0.19 ± 0.30.80 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.37.4 ± 1a Without drug, the [T]cr under this reaction condition was 3.0 ± 0.05 μM.

Their phenotype is similar to that of the C. elegans unc-18 mutation, which is thought to affect synaptic vesicle docking to the active zone. This suggests a crucial role for the unc-13 gene product in the mediation or regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Munc13-1 is one of three closely related rat homologues of unc-13. Based on the high degree of similarity between unc-13 and Munc13 proteins, it is thought that their essential function has been conserved from C. elegans to mammals. Munc13-1 is a brain-specific peripheral membrane protein with multiple regulatory domains that may mediate diacylglycerol, phospholipid, and calcium binding. In the present study, we demonstrate by three independent methods that the C terminus of Munc13-1 interacts directly with a putative coiled coil domain in the N-terminal part of syntaxin. Syntaxin is a component of the exocytotic synaptic core complex, a heterotrimeric protein complex with an essential role in transmitter release. Through this interaction, Munc13-1 binds to a subpopulation of the exocytotic core complex containing synaptobrevin, SNAP25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa), and syntaxin, but to no other tested syntaxin-interacting or core complex-interacting protein. The site of interaction in syntaxin is similar to the binding site for the unc-18 homologue Munc18, but different from that of all other known syntaxin interactors. These data indicate that unc-13-related proteins may indeed be involved in the mediation or regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis by modulating or regulating core complex formation. The similarity between the unc-13 and unc-18 phenotypes is paralleled by the coincidence of the binding sites for Munc13-1 and Munc18 in syntaxin. It is possible that the phenotype of unc-13 and unc-18 mutations is caused by the inability of the respective mutated gene products to bind to syntaxin."

https://openalex.org/W2048237085,"Liposomes that destabilize at mildly acidic pH are efficient tools for delivering water-soluble drugs into the cell cytoplasm. However, their use <i>in vivo</i> is limited because of their rapid uptake from circulation by the reticuloendothelial system. Lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEG-PE) prolongs the circulation time of liposomes by steric stabilization. We have found that addition of PEG-PE to the membrane of pH-sensitive liposomes composed of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) confers steric stability to these vesicles. This modification significantly decreases the pH-dependent release of a charged water-soluble fluorophore, calcein, from liposomes suspended in buffer or cell culture medium. However, the ability of such liposomes to release calcein intracellularly, measured by a novel flow cytometry technique involving dual fluorescence labeling, remains unaltered. As expected, the release of calcein from liposomes endocytosed by cells is inhibited upon pretreatment of the cells with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, an inhibitor of endosome acidification. The unique properties of these liposomes were also demonstrated <i>in vivo</i>.

INTRODUCTIONBundles of actin filaments, found in many cellular structures, including stress fibers, contractile rings, microvilli, and microspikes at the leading edges of motile cells, are formed mainly due to the functions of actin-bundling or cross-linking proteins. To date, a number of actin-bundling or cross-linking proteins have been characterized and demonstrated to play different roles in each of the cellular structures (for reviews, see Refs. 1Matsudaira P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar and 2Otto J.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The 55-kDa actin-bundling protein from HeLa cells has been purified as a major component of actin gels, which are formed by adding exogenous actin into cytoplasmic extracts (3Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It binds to actin in a stoichiometry of 1:4 and cross-links F-actin into bundles in vitro. The protein is a globular and monomeric protein (3Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical study has revealed that the 55-kDa protein is localized both in stress fibers and microspikes in cultured cells (4Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein is involved in the formation of actin bundles in vivo.The in vitro characteristics of the HeLa 55-kDa protein is very similar to that of sea urchin fascin. Sea urchin fascin, isolated from cytoplasmic extracts of sea urchin eggs (5Kane R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Kane R.E. J.

Thus, those studies have demonstrated that echinoid fascin plays crucial roles in forming actin bundles.Molecular cloning of sea urchin fascin by Bryan et al. (13Bryan J. Edwards R. Matsudaira P.

Recently, fascin cDNAs have been cloned from Xenopus (17Holthuis J.C. Schoonderwoert V.T. Martens G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and mouse (18Edwards R.A. Herrera-Sosa H. Otto J. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that fascin constitutes a widely distributed gene family.Drosophila singed mutants exhibit gnarled bristle development and female sterility (19Mohr O. Z. Indukt. Abstammungs. Vererbungsl. 1922; 28: 1-22Google Scholar). In normal Drosophila bristles, 7-11 bundles of microfilaments are attached to the plasma membrane. However, in developing bristles of sn mutants, the number of actin bundles is greatly reduced and disorganized (20Overton J. J. Morphol. 1967; 122: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Tilney L.G. Tilney M.S. Guild G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cant et al. (22Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have shown that the recombinant sn gene product (Drosophila fascin) can produce actin bundles with 12-nm transverse cross-banding, which is also observed in the microfilament bundles in bristles. In addition, Drosophila fascin is present in normal bristles, but the absence of Drosophila fascin in sn mutants correlates with the development of gnarled bristles. Female sterility of sn mutants is caused by the defects in the transfer of cytoplasm from nurse cells to the oocytes. The nurse cells of sn mutants lack cytoplasmic actin bundles, so that the nurse cell nuclei are allowed to plug up the ring canals to block cytoplasmic transfer (22Cant K. Knowles B.A. Mooseker M.S. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).There must be mechanisms that control fascin-actin interactions in a variety of biological activities. For example, actin bundles containing fascin are formed in response to cell adhesion to thrombospondin 1 (24Adams J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1977-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fertilization of sea urchin eggs (8Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and treatment of starfish oocytes with the maturation-inducing hormone 1-methyladenine (25Otto J.J. Schroeder T.E. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Filopodia of fibroblasts that contain fascin-actin bundles are known to be highly motile structures, constantly extending and retracting during cell locomotion. We have found that fascin is phosphorylated in vivo on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment and also in vitro by protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CGSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitolr-fascinrecombinant fascinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidMARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate. at the same sites (26Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12632-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of fascin results in the reduction of its actin binding ability, suggesting that phosphorylation may be one of the mechanisms that regulate fascin-actin interactions (26Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12632-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).To further understand the fascin-actin interaction and its regulation, we dissected the actin binding domain and PKC phosphorylation site of fascin. We found that at least one of the actin-binding sites was located in the C terminus, and that the major PKC phosphorylation site was in the N terminus (Ser-39). We generated a mutant fascin replacing the phosphorylation site with Ala. Actin binding of the mutant was no longer regulated by phosphorylation, indicating that phosphorylation at the N terminus regulates the fascin-actin interaction.DISCUSSIONOur results indicate that actin binding of human fascin is regulated by phosphorylation at the N terminus. The major phosphorylation site, Ser-39, has a PKC consensus motif, (S/T)X(K/R) (35Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is present in all fascins, including mouse, Drosophila, Xenopus, and sea urchin fascins (23Edwards R.A. Bryan J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the site is located in one of the most conserved regions among all fascins, and in particular, the sequences surrounding this site are virtually identical among human, mouse, and Xenopus fascins, suggesting that phosphorylation may universally control actin binding of all vertebrate fascins.The sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site may constitute an actin binding site in the N terminus. Ser-39 is located in a 15-amino acid sequence of fascin (residue 29-42, FGFKVNASASSLKKK) which, as pointed out by Mosialos et al. (16Mosialos G. Yamashiro S. Baughman R.W. Matsudaira P. Vara L. Matsumura F. Kieff E. Birkenbach M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7320-7328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows similarity to the actin binding site of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) (the residue 151-166, FSFKKSFKLSGFSFKK) (36Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 40Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The actin binding site of MARCKS contains three PKC phosphorylation sites (37Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Graff J.M. Rajan R.R. Randall R.R. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and importantly, phosphorylation by PKC at these sites inhibits the binding of MARCKS to actin in a way similar to the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of fascin-actin interactions. Furthermore, the cluster of basic amino acids have been identified to be responsible for actin binding of several actin-binding proteins (for review, see Ref. 39Vandekerckhove J. Vancompernolle K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of fascin, the phosphorylation site is followed by three lysine residues. If this stretch of basic amino acids constitutes the actin binding site, phosphorylation will give negative charges, and the inhibition of actin binding through phosphorylation is neatly explained.Fascin is a globular protein, and correct folding is important for its actin binding. It is thus quite possible that phosphorylation at the N terminus not only directly inhibits binding of the putative N-terminal actin binding site but also affects the actin binding of the C terminus. This notion is supported by the result that the actin binding constant of phosphorylated r-fascin was considerably lower than that of the purified C terminus. Furthermore, we observed that trypsin digested phosphorylated fascin much more rapidly than the nonphosphorylated form (data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation induces a conformational change.Fascin should have two actin binding domains in a single molecule (3Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified C-terminal fragments were able to bind to actin and to make the F-actin aggregate into bundles. This observation, however, does not lead to the conclusion that the C terminus has two actin binding domains, because the C-terminal fragments formed dimers. Rather, we think it likely that the N and C termini each have one actin binding site from the following reasons. First, as described above, the N terminus has a sequence that shows similarity to the actin binding site of MARCKS. Second, the actin binding affinity of the C terminus was two to three times lower than that of intact r-fascin, suggesting that the N terminus may be involved in the binding of intact fascin to actin. Last, Edwards et al. (33Edwards R.A. Cohen N. Snyder S. Bryan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (suppl. abstr.): 398aGoogle Scholar) have recently made a similar approach using proteolysis of recombinant murine fascin, in which the 30-kDa C-terminal fragment binds to but does not bundle F-actin.Proper folding is essential for fascin to show its actin binding ability. Full-length fascin with actin binding ability can be produced in bacteria at a low culture temperature of 25°C but not at 37°C. At 37°C virtually all fascins became insoluble, indicating that expressed fascin had adopted an incorrect conformation. Furthermore, bacterially expressed fascin truncates, which lack less than 20 amino acids of its N or C terminus, did not bind to actin, even though they were expressed as soluble proteins at a lower culture temperature. In addition, although the C terminus produced by proteolysis of intact r-fascin binds to actin, the same C-terminal fragment, when bacterially expressed, shows no actin binding ability, confirming that bacterially produced fascin truncates do not fold correctly.A possible next step for the structural analyses is the identification of residues critical for actin binding through the expression of mutants with charged residues replaced with polar residues. Such studies must be carefully interpreted, however, because we currently have no basis to judge whether such mutants are conformationally altered. We are collaborating with Dr. S. Almo (Albert Einstein University) to obtain three-dimensional structural information through crystallography. We have successfully prepared excellent crystals of bacterially expressed full-length fascin, which diffracts to 3.0 Å. A heavy atom search is now in progress.We speculate that one of the actin binding domains is located in the C terminus, and the other is possibly in the N terminus. Phosphorylation at the N terminus by PKC is likely to inhibit both actin binding sites. We have generated an A-fascin mutant, the actin binding of which is not regulated by phosphorylation. To verify the physiological significance of phosphorylation at Ser-39, we plan to examine, through transfection, what effects this unphosphorylatable mutant will have on the organization of the microfilament cytoskeleton, in particular, motility of fascin-containing filopodia. INTRODUCTIONBundles of actin filaments, found in many cellular structures, including stress fibers, contractile rings, microvilli, and microspikes at the leading edges of motile cells, are formed mainly due to the functions of actin-bundling or cross-linking proteins. To date, a number of actin-bundling or cross-linking proteins have been characterized and demonstrated to play different roles in each of the cellular structures (for reviews, see Refs. 1Matsudaira P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar and 2Otto J.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The 55-kDa actin-bundling protein from HeLa cells has been purified as a major component of actin gels, which are formed by adding exogenous actin into cytoplasmic extracts (3Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It binds to actin in a stoichiometry of 1:4 and cross-links F-actin into bundles in vitro. The protein is a globular and monomeric protein (3Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical study has revealed that the 55-kDa protein is localized both in stress fibers and microspikes in cultured cells (4Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein is involved in the formation of actin bundles in vivo.The in vitro characteristics of the HeLa 55-kDa protein is very similar to that of sea urchin fascin. Sea urchin fascin, isolated from cytoplasmic extracts of sea urchin eggs (5Kane R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Kane R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is the first actin-bundling protein to be characterized in vitro (7Bryan J. Kane R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fascin is recruited to the cortical cytoskeleton to form microvilli at fertilization of eggs (8Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and filopodia of coelomocytes, phagocytic cells from the coelomic cavity (9Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J.

Those structures have actin bundle cores with an 11-nm transverse cross-banding pattern (11Burgess D.R. Schroeder T.E. J.

Biol. 1978; 125: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, those studies have demonstrated that echinoid fascin plays crucial roles in forming actin bundles.Molecular cloning of sea urchin fascin by Bryan et al. (13Bryan J. Edwards R. Matsudaira P. Otto J. Wulfkuhle J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetics. 1991; 129: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas fascin shows no apparent homology with the other known actin-binding proteins. Subsequently, the HeLa 55-kDa actin-bundling protein has been demonstrated to be a human homologue of the sn product and sea urchin fascin (15Duh F.M. Latif F. Weng Y. Geil L. Modi W. Stackhouse T.

We found that at least one of the actin-binding sites was located in the C terminus, and that the major PKC phosphorylation site was in the N terminus (Ser-39). We generated a mutant fascin replacing the phosphorylation site with Ala. Actin binding of the mutant was no longer regulated by phosphorylation, indicating that phosphorylation at the N terminus regulates the fascin-actin interaction. DISCUSSIONOur results indicate that actin binding of human fascin is regulated by phosphorylation at the N terminus. The major phosphorylation site, Ser-39, has a PKC consensus motif, (S/T)X(K/R) (35Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is present in all fascins, including mouse, Drosophila, Xenopus, and sea urchin fascins (23Edwards R.A. Bryan J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the site is located in one of the most conserved regions among all fascins, and in particular, the sequences surrounding this site are virtually identical among human, mouse, and Xenopus fascins, suggesting that phosphorylation may universally control actin binding of all vertebrate fascins.The sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site may constitute an actin binding site in the N terminus. Ser-39 is located in a 15-amino acid sequence of fascin (residue 29-42, FGFKVNASASSLKKK) which, as pointed out by Mosialos et al. (16Mosialos G. Yamashiro S. Baughman R.W. Matsudaira P. Vara L. Matsumura F. Kieff E. Birkenbach M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7320-7328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows similarity to the actin binding site of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) (the residue 151-166, FSFKKSFKLSGFSFKK) (36Aderem A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and importantly, phosphorylation by PKC at these sites inhibits the binding of MARCKS to actin in a way similar to the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of fascin-actin interactions. Furthermore, the cluster of basic amino acids have been identified to be responsible for actin binding of several actin-binding proteins (for review, see Ref. 39Vandekerckhove J. Vancompernolle K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of fascin, the phosphorylation site is followed by three lysine residues. If this stretch of basic amino acids constitutes the actin binding site, phosphorylation will give negative charges, and the inhibition of actin binding through phosphorylation is neatly explained.Fascin is a globular protein, and correct folding is important for its actin binding. It is thus quite possible that phosphorylation at the N terminus not only directly inhibits binding of the putative N-terminal actin binding site but also affects the actin binding of the C terminus. This notion is supported by the result that the actin binding constant of phosphorylated r-fascin was considerably lower than that of the purified C terminus. Furthermore, we observed that trypsin digested phosphorylated fascin much more rapidly than the nonphosphorylated form (data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation induces a conformational change.Fascin should have two actin binding domains in a single molecule (3Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified C-terminal fragments were able to bind to actin and to make the F-actin aggregate into bundles. This observation, however, does not lead to the conclusion that the C terminus has two actin binding domains, because the C-terminal fragments formed dimers. Rather, we think it likely that the N and C termini each have one actin binding site from the following reasons. First, as described above, the N terminus has a sequence that shows similarity to the actin binding site of MARCKS. Second, the actin binding affinity of the C terminus was two to three times lower than that of intact r-fascin, suggesting that the N terminus may be involved in the binding of intact fascin to actin. Last, Edwards et al. (33Edwards R.A. Cohen N. Snyder S. Bryan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (suppl. abstr.): 398aGoogle Scholar) have recently made a similar approach using proteolysis of recombinant murine fascin, in which the 30-kDa C-terminal fragment binds to but does not bundle F-actin.Proper folding is essential for fascin to show its actin binding ability. Full-length fascin with actin binding ability can be produced in bacteria at a low culture temperature of 25°C but not at 37°C. At 37°C virtually all fascins became insoluble, indicating that expressed fascin had adopted an incorrect conformation. Furthermore, bacterially expressed fascin truncates, which lack less than 20 amino acids of its N or C terminus, did not bind to actin, even though they were expressed as soluble proteins at a lower culture temperature. In addition, although the C terminus produced by proteolysis of intact r-fascin binds to actin, the same C-terminal fragment, when bacterially expressed, shows no actin binding ability, confirming that bacterially produced fascin truncates do not fold correctly.A possible next step for the structural analyses is the identification of residues critical for actin binding through the expression of mutants with charged residues replaced with polar residues. Such studies must be carefully interpreted, however, because we currently have no basis to judge whether such mutants are conformationally altered. We are collaborating with Dr. S. Almo (Albert Einstein University) to obtain three-dimensional structural information through crystallography. We have successfully prepared excellent crystals of bacterially expressed full-length fascin, which diffracts to 3.0 Å. A heavy atom search is now in progress.We speculate that one of the actin binding domains is located in the C terminus, and the other is possibly in the N terminus. Phosphorylation at the N terminus by PKC is likely to inhibit both actin binding sites. We have generated an A-fascin mutant, the actin binding of which is not regulated by phosphorylation. To verify the physiological significance of phosphorylation at Ser-39, we plan to examine, through transfection, what effects this unphosphorylatable mutant will have on the organization of the microfilament cytoskeleton, in particular, motility of fascin-containing filopodia. Our results indicate that actin binding of human fascin is regulated by phosphorylation at the N terminus. The major phosphorylation site, Ser-39, has a PKC consensus motif, (S/T)X(K/R) (35Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

DNA polymerases (pol) from procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms incorporate nucleotides opposite abasic lesions in accordance with the A-rule. However, recent in vivo data demonstrate that A is not preferentially incorporated opposite abasic lesions in eucaryotes. Purified human DNA polymerases β and α are used to measure the specificity of nucleotide incorporation at a site-directed tetrahydrofuran abasic lesion, in 8-sequence contexts, varying upstream and downstream bases adjacent to the lesion. Extension past the lesion is measured in 4 sequence contexts, varying the downstream template base. Pol α strongly favors incorporation of dAMP directly opposite the lesion. In marked contrast, pol β violates the A-rule for incorporation directly opposite the lesion. In addition to incorporation taking place directly opposite the lesion, we also analyze misalignment incorporation directed by a template base downstream from the lesion. Lesion bypass by pol β occurs predominantly by “skipping over” the lesion, by insertion of a nucleotide complementary to an adjacent downstream template site. Misalignment incorporation for pol β occurs by a novel “dNTP-stabilized” mechanism resulting in both deletion and base substitution errors. In contrast, pol α shows no propensity for this type of synthesis.

Loss of purine and pyrimidine bases is a significant source of DNA damage in procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms. Abasic (apurinic and apyrimidinic) lesions occur spontaneously in DNA; in eucaryotes it has been estimated that about 104 depurination and 102 depyrimidation events occur per day (1Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). An equally important source of abasic DNA lesions results from the action of DNA glycosylases, most notably uracil glycosylase which excises uracil arising primarily from spontaneous deamination of cytosine (1Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). A DNA template with an abasic lesion presents a strong block to DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, which can be partially alleviated by induction of the SOS response (3Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Banerjee S.K. LeClerc J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although most abasic lesions are removed by a base excision repair pathway involving the combined action of various enzymes, e.g. N-glycosylase, endonuclease, phosphodeoxyribosyl phosphodiesterase, polymerase and ligase (4Weiss B. Grossman L. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 60: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar), a small fraction of lesions persist and are replicated leading to a high probability of a mutation occurring. When an abasic lesion is copied in vivo in E. coli, A is predominantly incorporated opposite the lesion (3Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Banerjee S.K. LeClerc J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Schaaper R.M. Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In agreement with E. coli data (3Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Banerjee S.K. LeClerc J.E.

Although neighboring sequence contexts have been observed to perturb relative nucleotide incorporation efficiencies (3Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Banerjee S.K. LeClerc J.E.

Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the strong conclusion, until recently, remained that DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases generally behave in accordance with the A-rule. A physically intuitive basis for the A-rule emanates from NMR studies showing that when A is opposite an abasic lesion it stacks in an intrahelical configuration causing virtually no distortion of the DNA helix (11Cuniasse P. Sowers L.C. Eritja R. Kaplan B. Goodman M.F. Cognet J.A. LeBret M. Guschlbauer W. Fazakerley G.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8003-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Kalnik M.W. Chang C.N. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the other bases, G may either be inter- or extrahelical depending on temperature, while the pyrimidine bases stack poorly and are likely to be extrahelical (13Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol.

Recent studies in eucaryotes, however, suggest that the A-rule may not be a universal mechanism for preferential incorporation of A opposite noncoding template lesions. Sarasin and co-workers (14Neto J.B.C. Gentil A. Cabral R.E.C. Sarasin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19718-19723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cabral Neto J.B. Caseira Cabral R.E.

In a study of mutagenesis at apurinic sites in normal and ataxia telangiectasia human lymphoblastoid cells, Drinkwater and co-workers (16Klinedinst D.K. Drinkwater N.R. Molecular Carcinogenesis. 1992; 6: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found that incorporation of G was favored. Kunz, Demple and co-workers (17Kunz B.A. Henson E.S. Roche H. Ramotar D.

Ohtsuka and co-workers (18Kamiya H. Suzuki M. Komatsu Y. Miura H. Kikuchi K. Sakaguchi T. Murata N. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) observed activation of a c-Ha-ras gene by an abasic site-induced point mutation having preferential incorporation of T opposite the lesion. A second ras-activating point mutation was located at the 5′-site adjacent to the abasic lesion (18Kamiya H. Suzuki M. Komatsu Y. Miura H. Kikuchi K. Sakaguchi T. Murata N. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in a shuttle vector system in yeast cells, Gibbs and Lawrence discovered a “C-rule” where incorporation of C occurred opposite a site-directed abasic lesion 80% of the time (19Gibbs P.E.M. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the light of an accumulating body of evidence indicating significant differences in the processing of abasic lesions in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells, it is important to measure nucleotide incorporation specificities for eucaryotic DNA polymerases, especially the eucaryotic repair enzyme pol β, which has no known procaryotic counterpart. In this paper, we use human pol β and pol α to measure deoxyribonucleotide incorporation and extension efficiencies at a site-directed tetrahydrofuran abasic analog. The incorporation efficiencies were measured in the presence of different upstream and downstream nucleotides adjacent to the template abasic lesion. We distinguish between two types of incorporation mechanisms: “direct” incorporation and a novel form of “misalignment” incorporation. Direct incorporation refers to nucleotide insertions occurring directly opposite a lesion, and misalignment incorporation is defined by nucleotide insertions occurring opposite a normal template base downstream from the lesion, on a misaligned primer-template terminus. The novel form of misalignment incorporation, carried out by pol β, does not conform to misaligned p/t DNA structures reported previously (20Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shibutani S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11703-11710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We use the term “dNTP-stabilized misalignment” to refer to our model for pol β-catalyzed misalignment incorporation at abasic lesions, which will be distinguished from a “standard misalignment” model presented previously (20Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol.

We are concerned primarily with two issues germane to translesion synthesis. First, we address the degree to which pol β and pol α incorporate nucleotides via direct incorporation in compliance with the A-rule. Second, we determine the extent to which the polymerases utilize direct and misalignment synthetic mechanisms to catalyze lesion bypass. Human pol β was purified as described (23Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B. Widen S.G. Notario V. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The turnover number for pol β is from 0.5-0.8 nucleotides s−1 when assayed using poly(dA)-oligo(dT) at 20°C, pH 7.4. Human pol α (2000 units/mg, see Ref. 24Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22739-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a generous gift of Dr. T. S. F. Wang, refers to the large catalytic subunit of holoenzyme and was purified as described (24Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22739-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both highly purified enzyme preparations were free of detectable 3′-exonuclease activities. 1 DNA polymerase unit is defined as the incorporation of 1 nmol of dNMP into DNA per h at 37°C. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from U. S. Biochemicals. Nonradioactive nucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Abasic (1,4-anhydro-2-deoxy-D-ribitol) phosphoramidite was synthesized as described previously (25Eritja R. Walker P.A. Randall S.K. Goodman M.F. Kaplan B.E. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1987; 6: 803-814Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 42-mer templates containing a single abasic site and control templates with no abasic site were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer, as were the different primers. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides with a 5′-phosphate group used to form gaps for pol β were synthesized by Lynn Williams at the University of Southern California Comprehensive Cancer Center. For studies of insertion opposite an abasic site by pol β, a 5-nucleotide gap with an abasic site in its center was formed by annealing a 42-mer template, 5′-TTC TAG GTT TGC TAA CAT ACT TCN XMA TAA GGA GTC TTA ATC-3′, where the X designates the tetrahydrofuran abasic lesion; N and M are, respectively, the downstream and upstream nearest-neighbor bases to be varied (Fig. 1, a and b). The upstream oligonucleotide primer was 5′-GAT TAA GAC TCC TTA-3′, and the downstream oligonucleotides used to form a 5-nucleotide gap for pol β was 5′-AAG TAT GTT AGC AAA CCT AGA A-3′. The downstream oligodeoxyribonucleotide was phosphorylated at its 5′-end (Fig. 1). The 5′-phosphate group on the downstream oligonucleotide and a gap size of fewer than six nucleotides are necessary for processive behavior by pol β (26Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same studies with pol α used no downstream oligonucleotide; pol α activity was inhibited by approximately 2-fold in a short gap filling reaction (data not shown). For studies of misaligned versus direct extension, the same templates were used but with upstream primers that were three nucleotides longer and covered the abasic site with A, C, G, or T. These templates were also annealed to a downstream oligonucleotide one nucleotide shorter than the one in the insertion assays without the first 5′-A, to form a 3-nucleotide gap (Fig. 1c). All primers and templates were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5′-End labeling of primers with 32P was carried out using T4-polynucleotide kinase in a reaction containing 56 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 7 mM MgCl2, 13 mM dithiothreitol, 18.5 nM DNA, 0.4 μM [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol), and T4-polynucleotide kinase (3 units/97-μl reaction). Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 60 min and terminated by boiling at 100°C for 5 min. Annealing reactions for pol β were carried out by incubating 7.5 nM primer, 7.5 nM template, 38 nM downstream oligonucleotide in pol β reaction buffer (35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6.7 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol) at 37°C for 1 h followed by a gradual cooling to room temperature. For pol α, p/t DNA was annealed by incubating 7.5 nM primer with 7.5 nM template in pol α reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by a gradual cooling to room temperature. Prior to carrying out kinetics experiments, time courses were run to determine conditions for measuring insertion and extension efficiencies at abasic template sites. Reactions were performed by mixing equal volumes (5 μl) of annealed primer-template and deoxyribonucleotide in reaction buffer (see annealing conditions). The final concentration of primer-template in all reactions was 3.75 nM. Pol β (0.2 units) or pol α (0.2 units) were added and the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Four p/t DNA constructs were used to measure incorporation opposite the model abasic (tetrahydrofuran) lesion. Although incubation times of about 2 min were sufficient to measure incorporation opposite the lesion for many of the mispairs, there remained a number of sequence contexts in which incorporation could not be detected, or where there was only slight incorporation or extension at or beyond the lesion. We found it necessary to use 30-min incubation times to detect incorporation bands for each of the templates over the range of dNTP concentrations used for the kinetic measurements. We estimate that about half of the template-primers have been extended during the 30-min incubation so that approximately 35% of the p/t DNA encounter a polymerase once, 10% twice, and 5% three times. Since there was no significant difference in the fraction of primers utilized during each experiment, the relative incorporation and extension efficiencies are not biased by the occurrence of multiple polymerase-p/t DNA encounters (27Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For each reaction, the dNTP substrate for incorporation opposite X was varied in concentration over a range of 10 μM to 1.5 mM. For the time courses, the substrate concentration used for incorporation opposite the lesion was held constant at 1 mM. The reactions were carried out under running start conditions and contained from 5 to 50 μM dTTP for incorporation opposite two dAMPs upstream of the lesion. The dTTP concentrations were chosen to extend the primers as rapidly as possible subject to the constraint that no measurable dTMP was incorporated opposite the lesion itself. Reactions were terminated by adding 2 volumes of 20 mM EDTA in 95% formamide to chelate Mg2+ prior to heating, heating to 100°C for 5 min, and placing the reactions on ice for about 5 min. The samples were then loaded on an 18% polyacrylamide gel and the extended single-stranded DNA primers were separated according to length by electrophoresis (9Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A gel fidelity analysis was used to determine the kinetics of incorporation of each of the four deoxynucleotides opposite the lesion as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration (9Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integrated polyacrylamide gel band intensities were measured on a PhosphorImager using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The nucleotide incorporation efficiency (apparent Vmax/Km) opposite a lesion, measured in a running-start reaction, can be obtained by measuring IX/IX-1, where IX is the integrated gel band intensity of a primer extended to the site opposite the lesion and beyond, and IX-1 is the integrated gel band intensity of a primer extended to a site just prior to the lesion (9Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plot of IX/IX-1 as a function of the target dNTP substrate concentration results in a rectangular hyperbola whose slope in the linear region is given by apparent Vmax/Km. Apparent Km and relative Vmax values were obtained using a nonlinear least squares fit to the rectangular hyperbola. In p/t DNA sequence contexts where incorporation and extension were relatively inefficient, plots of IX/IX-1 versus dNTP concentration showed little or no curvature; in these cases, apparent Vmax/Km values were obtained by a least squares fit of the data to a straight line. The same analysis was also used to calculate apparent kinetic constants for extension beyond an abasic site (following subsection). Based on a series of time course measurements, kinetic data were obtained using 30-min incubations. The data for both enzymes were in the linear range for incorporation and extension at the abasic lesions for each of the p/t DNA constructs, with the possible exception of dAMP incorporation opposite X by pol α. We note, however, that the relative efficiencies of incorporation of dAMP compared to dGMP opposite X are consistent with previous measurements using pol α to copy a tetrahydrofuran moiety (9Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out as described above except that the abasic site was covered by the upstream primer with A, C, G, or T (see, e.g. Fig. 1c). These reactions were carried out using standing-start conditions. The reactions were run in the presence of only one nucleotide, either the one complementary to the first base downstream of X or to the second nucleotide downstream of the lesion. The concentration of dNTPs was varied between 10 and 500 μM, and the reactions were run for 30 min. The extension efficiency, Vmax/Km, is proportional to (IX+1/Io) × 1/t, where IX+1 is the integrated band intensity for band(s) extended beyond the abasic lesion, Io is the integrated band intensity of the unextended primer band located opposite the lesion, and t is the reaction time. The proportionality constant is the same for incorporation of A, T, G, or C opposite X in all sequence contexts (29Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) so that a comparison of the ratio IX/IX-1 for each nucleotide provides a direct measure of the relative extension efficiencies. In cases where Io is not ≫IX+1, then Io is replaced in the equation for fext by Io+ 0.5 IX+1 to correct for the change in concentration of input p/t DNA during the course of the reaction (30Petruska J.

Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants were determined for binding of pol β or pol α to the p/t DNA used in the extension assays as described in Ref. 31Creighton S. Huang M.-M. Cai H. Arnheim N.

To investigate the specificity of nucleotide incorporation opposite abasic template sites using eucaryotic pol β and pol α, template DNAs were synthesized with a site-directed model (tetrahydrofuran) abasic lesion (25Eritja R. Walker P.A. Randall S.K. Goodman M.F. Kaplan B.E. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1987; 6: 803-814Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) placed adjacent to each of the four different upstream and downstream nearest-neighbor bases (Fig. 1). The abasic lesion is denoted by the symbol X. Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed to determine nucleotide incorporation efficiencies opposite X (9Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23567-23572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and efficiencies of extension downstream from X (30Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C. Cheong C.

Nucleotide incorporation kinetics for pol β and pol α were measured in running-start reactions, by varying the downstream base adjacent to the lesion. In the running-start reaction, two Ts are incorporated prior to encountering an abasic lesion, followed by incorporation of dNMPs A, C, G, or T, at different concentrations, opposite the lesion, X. Representative kinetic data are presented in which G is the base immediately downstream from the lesion (Fig. 2). The data illustrate that pol β incorporated all four nucleotides opposite X, favoring misalignment incorporation of dCMP which is complementary to the template base to the 5′-side of the lesion (Fig. 2a, dCTP lanes). In contrast, pol α strongly favored incorporation of dAMP and to a lesser extent dGMP (Fig. 2b). Pol α also catalyzed incorporation of dCMP, but with exceedingly low efficiency (Fig. 2b, dCTP lanes). Two distinct mechanisms are responsible for the incorporation of C in this p/t configuration: (i) direct incorporation of dCMP opposite X and (ii) misalignment incorporation of dCMP opposite the downstream template G. Note that misalignment synthesis, where the incoming dNTP stabilizes a misaligned p/t structure, has not been reported previously. We refer to this novel type of synthesis as “dNTP-stabilized” misalignment synthesis to distinguish it from the standard “Streisinger” misalignment synthesis (20Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Streisinger G.

Genet. 1990; 24: 189-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the p/t DNA forms a transiently misaligned structure (Fig. 3). Time courses, covering a range from 2 to 60 min, were performed to measure nucleotide incorporation opposite X with the same p/t sequence used for the kinetic analysis shown in Fig. 2 (data not shown). The time course data were consistent with the kinetic data, i.e. the same polymerase-specific differences in the abilities of the two human polymerases to incorporate nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion were observed at each reaction time point. Pol α behaved in accordance with the A-rule since it readily incorporated dAMP, and less readily dGMP, opposite the lesion, whereas incorporation of pyrimidines opposite X was barely detectable, even following a lengthy (60 min) reaction period (data not shown). Pol β did not follow the A-rule since it incorporated all four dNMPs opposite X in a relatively impartial manner at each time point (data not shown). Analysis of the data for each of the four downstream nearest-neighbors demonstrates pol β-catalyzed incorporations were most efficient when the downstream template base was complementary to the incoming dNTP substrate (Fig. 4a, Vmax/Km values indicated by arrows pointing downward along the diagonal). The large apparent Vmax/Km values along the diagonal suggest that a major fraction of misincorporations taking place opposite the lesion are actually “correct” incorporations in which an incoming dNTP is positioned opposite its complementary template base immediately downstream from the lesion. Except in the case of a downstream template A, misincorporations by pol β are dominated by this mechanism. Nucleotide misincorporations caused by p/t misalignments, as documented by Kunkel and co-workers (20Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contain a “looped out,” i.e. extrahelical base (in this case a looped out abasic moiety) stabilized by H-bonded base pairs surrounding the looped out moiety (see, e.g. Fig. 3, standard misalignment structure). However, the misalignment incorporations found for pol β in running-start reactions (Fig. 4a) are novel because, there is no base pair available downstream from the lesion to stabilize a putatively looped out X (Fig. 3, dNTP-stabilized misalignment structure). Instead, stabilization of the misaligned structure occurs when a dNTP complementary to the template base downstream from X binds in the active site of pol β. The incorporation pattern for pol α (Fig. 4b) dif"

Such anionic liposomes were more efficiently engulfed by Sertoli cells than were the other neutral liposomes. Also, the number of spermatogenic cells that exposed phosphatidylserine to the surface increased when cells were maintained in single culture.

The best characterized member of this family is a group of low molecular mass (∼15 kDa) enzymes that require Ca2+ for catalytic activity and show maximal activity in an alkaline (pH 8.5) medium (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This group of enzymes, called secreted PLA2 (sPLA2; types 1-3), include snake and bee venoms and mammalian pancreatic and synovial PLA2 enzymes. The more recently characterized 87-kDa cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) requires only μM Ca2+ for binding to the interface and shows maximal activity at neutral pH (2Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is widely distributed in cell types and may be specifically linked to eicosanoid metabolism. Finally, there is a group of enzymes (iPLA2) that do not require Ca2+ for maximal activity. As recently reviewed (3Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), few of these enzymes have been purified, and in contrast to sPLA2 and cPLA2, little molecular information is available. Therefore, although the iPLA2 enzymes are widely distributed, relatively little is known about their intragroup relationships and specific functions. Based on biochemical characteristics, Ackermann and Dennis (3Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have divided the iPLA2 enzymes into three subgroups: lysosomal iPLA2, brush-border membrane iPLA2, and intracellular (cytosolic/membrane) iPLA2. A distinguishing characteristic of the lysosomal iPLA2 group is maximal activity in acidic medium, and accordingly, we have designated the enzyme in this report as aiPLA2.iPLA2 activity in rat lung homogenates was first described ∼25 years ago (4Ohta M. Hasegawa H. Ohno K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and activity at acid pH was subsequently demonstrated in rabbit lung (5Heath M.F. Jacobson W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), rat granular pneumocytes (lung alveolar type II cells) (6Chander A.C. Fisher A.B. Straus III, J.F. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and rat and human alveolar macrophages (7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Franson R.C. Waite M. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activity has been localized further to the lung lamellar bodies (the surfactant secretory organelle) and the lysosomal fraction (5Heath M.F. Jacobson W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol.11, L335-L341)Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, lung aiPLA2 activity is inhibited by a phospholipid transition-state analogue, 1-hexadecyl-3-trifluoroethylglycero-sn-2-phosphomethanol (MJ33), while Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity in the lung homogenate is insensitive (7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using MJ33 as a probe, we previously purified a protein with aiPLA2 activity to apparent homogeneity (10Wang R. Dodia C.R. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This protein had a molecular mass of ∼15 kDa and a unique N-terminal amino acid sequence. Subsequent attempts to reproduce the isolation yielded similar enzyme activity, although the molecular mass of the isolated protein was ∼26 kDa. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the larger enzyme, as described in this report, does not contain the previously determined N-terminal sequence. Consequently, we believe that aiPLA2 described in this report is different from the previously isolated protein.Amino acid sequencing (35 residues) of tryptic digests of the 26-kDa protein isolated from rat lung revealed 100% identity to deduced amino acids from the nucleotide sequence (previously unpublished) of a clone isolated from a human myeloblast cDNA library (11Nagase T.

This report provides evidence that the protein expressed by this cDNA is aiPLA2 and provides the first molecular cloning for this group of enzymes.DISCUSSIONiPLA2 enzymes have been shown to be widely distributed and ubiquitously expressed in most mammalian tissue, underlining their potential importance in cellular functions (3Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although mammalian iPLA2 enzymes have been isolated and characterized from various sources, there is scant molecular information due to difficulties associated with purification and insufficient yield. To date, the only iPLA2-type enzyme that has been sequenced is a PAF hydrolase (28Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpg B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), which also has properties of a low density lipoprotein-associated PLA2 (29Tew D.G. Southan C. Rice S.O.J. Lawrence M.P. Li H. Boyd H.F. Noores K. Gloger I.S. Macphee C.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, little is known about the structure or mechanisms of iPLA2 enzymes or their relationship to other PLA2 enzymes. Here, we describe the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a human iPLA2 (aiPLA2) that shows maximal activity in an acidic medium.Evidence for aiPLA2 Activity of Expressed ProteinExpression of the HA0683 cDNA using both the wheat germ and Xenopus oocyte systems demonstrated PLA2 activity. In vitro translated aiPLA2 did not show any PLA1 or lysophospholipase activity, excluding the possibility that the combined activities of those two enzymes could have accounted for the measured PLA2 activity. Furthermore, assays of activity with both wheat germ- and oocyte-expressed enzyme based on recoveries of labeled free fatty acid from sn-2-fatty acyl-labeled DPPC and labeled lyso-PC from choline-labeled DPPC were nearly identical, indicating PLA2 for the lipolytic activity. The pH 4 optimum for activity and the Ca2+ independence indicated that the protein encoded by the HA0683 cDNA clone has enzymatic properties that correspond to the activity profile for the partially purified rat lung enzyme as well as the activity previously demonstrated in homogenates of rat lungs and granular pneumocytes (7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander M. Jain M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Northern analysis demonstrated that this gene is highly expressed in rat lung and granular pneumocytes (Fig. 9). aiPLA2 activity was significantly inhibited by MJ33, a competitive inhibitor of acidic Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity in lung homogenates and subcellular organelles (lysosomes and lamellar bodies) (7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander M. Jain M. Biochem.

Unlike other iPLA2 enzyme activities that have been characterized, the activity of the expressed protein was not affected by the presence of detergent (Triton X-100), and neither it nor the isolated rat lung enzyme was affected by the inhibitor BEL or the activator ATP (27Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7295-7303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that aiPLA2 presented in this report is distinct from the iPLA2 enzymes previously purified from the P388D1 macrophage cell line (20Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and from cardiac muscle (27Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7295-7303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative activity of PAF acetylhydrolase, a Ca2+-independent enzyme that can cleave short-chain acyl groups at the sn-2-position (22Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was negligible. The isolated rat enzyme and the expressed protein are differentiated from sPLA2 and cPLA2 by their Ca2+ independence and pH profile as well as by insensitivity to inhibitors (pBPB, 2-mercaptoethanol, and AACOCF3).Properties of the Predicted ProteinThe HA0683 cDNA encodes a mature protein of 224 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 25.0 kDa. We have shown in a wheat germ in vitro translation system that mRNA transcribed from this clone results in the expression of a protein of 25.8 kDa in size, in reasonable agreement with the predicted mass of the deduced amino acid sequence and with the estimated mass of aiPLA2 isolated from rat lung. The predicted protein has 32 (14.3%) negatively charged and 30 (13.4%) positively charged residues, with no predicted charge clusters and a predicted pI of 6.0 (32Brendel V. Bucher P. Nourbakhsh I.R. Blaisdell B.E. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Nonpolar residues account for 107 (48%) of the 224 amino acids in the predicted sequence. A hydrophobicity plot of the predicted protein did not indicate any extended regions of high hydrophobicity, consistent with the fact that aiPLA2 was isolated as a soluble protein.Note Added in ProofWe have now cloned and sequenced the actual 5′ end of the aiPLA2 RNA using a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Frohman, M. A. (1993) Methods Enzymol. 218, 340-358) and found an additional 24 nucleotides but no upstream ATG translational start codon.Sequence Homology to Other ProteinsSearches for similarity to the HA0683 cDNA sequence at the protein (SWISSPROT protein data base) and DNA (GenBank™ data base) levels did not identify any phospholipases. Therefore, aiPLA2 is apparently not related to any of the phospholipases previously sequenced. The predicted aiPLA2 enzyme contains a 5-amino acid sequence, GXSXG (double underline in Fig. 3), that has been described as a lipase motif and may represent the active serine of the catalytic triad SDH (33Drewenda A.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Inhibition by DENP supports a serine-based mechanism for aiPLA2 activity. The motif has been described in serine proteases and in neutral lipases. Of note, it has also been described in PAF acetylhydrolase (low density lipoprotein-associated PLA2) (28Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpg B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W.

Thus, the motif is present in both iPLA2 enzymes (aiPLA2 and PAF acetylhydrolase) that have been cloned, although it is not observed in sPLA2 or cPLA2.From the protein data base, the amino acid sequence with the most similarity to an HA0683-encoded protein was a hypothetical 29.5-kDa protein from yeast (SWISSPROT ID YBG4) (34Scherens B. el Bakkoury M. Vierendeels F. Dubois E. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1355-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which matched at 99 out of 261 amino acid positions. A search for similarity to the deduced N-terminal sequence of aiPLA2 revealed homology to two human unknown proteins isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from liver (SWISSPROT ID P30041) (35Hochstrasser D.F. Frutiger S. Paquet N. Bairoch A. Ravier F. Pasquali C. Sanchez J.C. Tissot J.D. Bjellqvist B. Vargas R. Appel R.D. Hughes G.J.

These sequences, consisting of 14 and 12 amino acids, respectively, showed 100% homology to the predicted aiPLA2 sequence following its deduced start site. Electrophoresis showed molecular masses of 23.5 kDa for the liver protein (35Hochstrasser D.F. Frutiger S. Paquet N. Bairoch A. Ravier F. Pasquali C. Sanchez J.C. Tissot J.D. Bjellqvist B. Vargas R.

Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), with an identical pI of 6.2. The similarities in N-terminal sequence, size, and pI to the parameters predicted for the HA0683-encoded protein suggest that these human proteins of unknown function may represent aiPLA2, indicating widespread distribution for the enzyme. Although originally isolated from a human myeloid cell line, HA0683 hybridized to RNA from all tissues and cell lines tested (11Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since aiPLA2 may be a lysosomal enzyme, its widespread distribution would be expected.

The best characterized member of this family is a group of low molecular mass (∼15 kDa) enzymes that require Ca2+ for catalytic activity and show maximal activity in an alkaline (pH 8.5) medium (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This group of enzymes, called secreted PLA2 (sPLA2; types 1-3), include snake and bee venoms and mammalian pancreatic and synovial PLA2 enzymes. The more recently characterized 87-kDa cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) requires only μM Ca2+ for binding to the interface and shows maximal activity at neutral pH (2Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is widely distributed in cell types and may be specifically linked to eicosanoid metabolism. Finally, there is a group of enzymes (iPLA2) that do not require Ca2+ for maximal activity. As recently reviewed (3Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), few of these enzymes have been purified, and in contrast to sPLA2 and cPLA2, little molecular information is available. Therefore, although the iPLA2 enzymes are widely distributed, relatively little is known about their intragroup relationships and specific functions. Based on biochemical characteristics, Ackermann and Dennis (3Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have divided the iPLA2 enzymes into three subgroups: lysosomal iPLA2, brush-border membrane iPLA2, and intracellular (cytosolic/membrane) iPLA2. A distinguishing characteristic of the lysosomal iPLA2 group is maximal activity in acidic medium, and accordingly, we have designated the enzyme in this report as aiPLA2.iPLA2 activity in rat lung homogenates was first described ∼25 years ago (4Ohta M. Hasegawa H. Ohno K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and activity at acid pH was subsequently demonstrated in rabbit lung (5Heath M.F. Jacobson W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), rat granular pneumocytes (lung alveolar type II cells) (6Chander A.C. Fisher A.B. Straus III, J.F. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and rat and human alveolar macrophages (7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Franson R.C. Waite M. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activity has been localized further to the lung lamellar bodies (the surfactant secretory organelle) and the lysosomal fraction (5Heath M.F. Jacobson W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol.11, L335-L341)Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, lung aiPLA2 activity is inhibited by a phospholipid transition-state analogue, 1-hexadecyl-3-trifluoroethylglycero-sn-2-phosphomethanol (MJ33), while Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity in the lung homogenate is insensitive (7Fisher A.B. Dodia C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using MJ33 as a probe, we previously purified a protein with aiPLA2 activity to apparent homogeneity (10Wang R. Dodia C.R. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This protein had a molecular mass of ∼15 kDa and a unique N-terminal amino acid sequence. Subsequent attempts to reproduce the isolation yielded similar enzyme activity, although the molecular mass of the isolated protein was ∼26 kDa. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the larger enzyme, as described in this report, does not contain the previously determined N-terminal sequence. Consequently, we believe that aiPLA2 described in this report is different from the previously isolated protein.Amino acid sequencing (35 residues) of tryptic digests of the 26-kDa protein isolated from rat lung revealed 100% identity to deduced amino acids from the nucleotide sequence (previously unpublished) of a clone isolated from a human myeloblast cDNA library (11Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This report provides evidence that the protein expressed by this cDNA is aiPLA2 and provides the first molecular cloning for this group of enzymes."

This functional overlap, as well as receptor binding subunits shared by IL-15 and IL-2, suggests tertiary structural similarities between these two cytokines. In this study, recombinant human IL-15 was PEGylated via lysine-specific conjugation chemistry in order to extend the circulation half-life of this cytokine. Although PEGylation did extend the β-elimination circulation half-life of IL-15 by greater than 50-fold, the biological activity of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-IL-15 was significantly altered. Specifically, PEG-IL-15 lost its ability to stimulate the proliferation of CTLL but took on the properties of a specific IL-15 antagonist in vitro. In comparing sequence alignments and molecular models for IL-2 and IL-15, it was noted that lysine residues resided in regions of IL-15 that may have selectively disrupted receptor subunit binding. We hypothesized that PEGylation of IL-15 interferes with β but not α receptor subunit binding, resulting in the IL-15 antagonist activity observed in vitro. The validity of this hypothesis was tested by engineering site-specific mutants of human IL-15 as suggested by the IL-15 model (IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S block β and γ receptor subunit binding, respectively). As with PEG-IL-15, these mutants were unable to stimulate CTLL proliferation but were able to specifically inhibit the proliferation of CTLL in response to unmodified IL-15. These results supported our model of IL-15 and confirmed that interference of β receptor subunit binding by adjacent PEGylation could be responsible for the altered biological activity observed for PEG-IL-15.

The overlapping biological activities of IL-15 and IL-2 can be explained, at least in part, by the composition of the multisubunit receptor complexes for these two cytokines. The high affinity IL-2R complex consists of at least three chains, designated α, β, and γ, and interaction of IL-2 with both the β and γ chains is necessary for initiation of signaling events (6Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IL-15 receptor complex also consists of at least three subunits. It shares use of the common β and γ chains of the IL-2R complex but contains an α subunit that is distinct from IL-2Rα (3Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A.

Similar to the IL-2R complex, interaction of IL-15 with both the β and γ subunits is necessary for initiation of signaling.

The IL-2Rα subunit binds IL-2 with very low affinity (Ka = 108), whereas the IL-15Rα subunit binds IL-15 with unusually high affinity (Ka = 1011).

Whereas protein mutagenesis allows for specific investigation of protein structure to function relationships, other protein modification techniques may also influence specific protein-ligand interactions. The process of conjugating chains of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto proteins such as IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, asparaginase, immunoglobulins, hemoglobin, and others has traditionally been used to prolong circulation half-lives in vivo, enhance solubility, and reduce immunogenicity (16Katre N.V.

Francis G.E. Fisher D. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Sys. 1992; 9: 249-304PubMed Google Scholar). However, PEGylation has also been found to reduce or alter biological activities, the extent of which depends on the degree of conjugation, the type of conjugation chemistry used, and the specific location on the protein where the conjugation has occurred. The independent variation of two biological activities has also been demonstrated with immunoglobulin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor by selectively PEGylating regions of these proteins involved with one biological function while not interfering with the other (19Suzuki T. Kanbara N. Tomono T. Hayashi N. Shinohara I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Knüsli C. Delgado C. Malik F. Dómine M. Tejedor M.C. Irvine A.E.

These examples likely demonstrate the importance of the location of lysine residues within the tertiary protein structure when using lysine-specific PEG conjugation chemistry. In this paper we describe the PEGylation of IL-15 and the in vivo and in vitro characterization of this molecule. Whereas the pharmacokinetics were enhanced following PEGylation of IL-15, the biological activity of this molecule was significantly altered. Specifically, PEG conjugation eliminated the CTLL proliferative activity of IL-15 and generated a molecule that functioned as a specific antagonist in vitro. We hypothesize that lysine-specific PEGylation of IL-15 resulted in steric interference of the region of IL-15 that interacts with the β receptor subunit, while not affecting the region of IL-15 that interacts with the α receptor subunit. This hypothesis is based on sequence alignment of IL-15 with IL-2 and the construction of a molecular model of IL-15. Two mutants of IL-15, designed to disrupt either β or γ receptor subunit binding, were prepared to verify the accuracy of these regions of the IL-15 model. The in vitro characterization of these IL-15 mutants was consistent with the predictions of the molecular model and supported the hypothesis concerning PEGylated IL-15. Furthermore, when taken together, the PEGylation and mutagenesis data support the model of IL-15 in which each of the receptor subunits, α, β, and γ bind to IL-15 in a spatial orientation similar to that established for IL-2. The cloning of simian IL-15 has been described (1Grabstein K.H. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Rauch C. Srinivasan S. Fung V. Beers C. Richardson J. Schoenborn M.A. Ahdieh M. Johnson L. Alderson M.R.

Paxton R.J. Aggarwal B.B. Gutterman J.U. Human Cytokines, Handbook for Basic and Clinical Research. Vol. II. Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA1996: 135-145Google Scholar). All of the PEGylation studies described below were carried out with simian IL-15, and all of the mutagenesis studies were carried out with human IL-15. Human and simian IL-15 are 96% identical at the amino acid level, and the number and position of lysine residues are identical. Also, the binding characteristics and biological activity of human and simian IL-15 as measured by CTLL-2 cell proliferation are identical. 2J. Eisenman and C. Beers, unpublished results. Human IL-15 was used in all studies as the control material. Briefly, for the expression of either human or simian IL-15, cDNA encoding IL-15 from either species was ligated into a yeast expression vector that directs secretion of the recombinant protein into the yeast medium (22Price V.

Supernatants were collected following ultrafiltration of the yeast broth, and IL-15 was purified as described previously (21Giri J.G. Paxton R.J. Aggarwal B.B. Gutterman J.U.

Site-specific mutants of huIL-15 (IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S) were generated by two separate PCR amplifications. In the primary PCR reaction, amplification was with primer pairs that either introduced the appropriate mutation or amplified the wild-type sequence. In the secondary PCR reaction, material from the first round was reamplified with a primer set that introduced restriction sites necessary for cloning into the yeast expression vector. The mutagenic oligonucleotides had the sequence 5′-AATGTAATAAGTTCTTTGAAAAAAATT-3′ (Asp8→Ser, 5′ sense oligo), and 5′-GTTGATGAACATAGAGACAATATG-3′ (Gln108→Ser, 3′ antisense oligo). PCR amplification was performed under standard conditions using Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and cycling conditions of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 45°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles, using approximately 10 ng of wild-type human IL-15 cDNA as template. Approximately 20 ng of gel purified product from the primary amplification was used as the template for the secondary PCR amplification, which used nonmutagenic, flanking oligonucleotides that appended the necessary restriction enzyme sites. Cycling conditions were denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 60°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min for a total of 20 cycles. Amplification products were gel purified and digested with Asp718 (Boehringer Mannheim) and NcoI (New England Biolabs) and ligated into the 2-μm yeast expression vector pIXY456, which contains the ADH2 promoter and the α-factor leader. Ligations were transformed into Escherichia coli DH10b cells by electroporation. Plasmid DNA from single transformants was sequenced to confirm sequence integrity and used to transform S. cerevisiae XV2181. Purification of the mutant proteins was carried out by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). Recombinant human IL-2 (des-alanyl-1-, Ser125 human interleukin-2, Aldesleukin, Proleukin®) was obtained from Chiron Corp. (Emeryville, CA). PEG conjugation reactions were carried out with 5-kDa PEG, which was obtained in the activated form of succinimidyl carbonate PEG from Shearwater Polymers (Huntsville, AL). PEGylation of simian IL-15 was carried out in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.5. For PEGylation of IL-2, the addition of 0.1% SDS improved the solubility of IL-2 and the extent of PEGylation. Reactions with both IL-15 and IL-2 were carried out in 0.5-ml volumes at 100 μg/ml for in vitro characterization studies. Larger volumes were prepared for in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Succinimidyl carbonate PEG was added to the reaction mixtures at molar ratios of PEG to lysine of 1:1, 3:1, 10:1, and 100:1 (7 lysine residues + 1 N terminus per IL-15 molecule and 11 lysine residues + 1 N terminus per IL-2 molecule). All reactions were allowed to proceed overnight at 4°C. For subsequent in vivo pharmacokinetics experiments, PEG-IL-15 was dialyzed against PBS to remove residual N-hydroxysuccinimide, a byproduct of succinimidyl carbonate PEG hydrolysis. Protein concentrations of IL-15, PEG-IL-15, and PEG-IL-2 species were determined by amino acid analysis. PEG-IL-15 and PEG-IL-2 were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, SE-HPLC, and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. In the chromatography experiments, a Waters HPLC system (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA) was equipped with two 300 × 8 mm SEC-250 Biosil columns (Bio-Rad), which were run in series in order to resolve the various PEG-modified species. For the mass spectroscopy experiments, PEG-IL-15 (PEG to lysine ratio of 100 to 1) was first purified by SE-HPLC in order to reduce residual levels of unconjugated PEG and other reaction byproducts. PEG-IL-15 samples were further prepared by buffer exchange with water and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml. PEG-IL-15 (0.5 μl) was applied to targets along with a sinapinic acid matrix (0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml solution in 50:50 acetonitrile/water), allowed to air dry, and then analyzed with a Finnigan Mat LaserMat time-of-flight laser desorption mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Experiments were performed to compare the circulation half-lives of IL-15 and PEG-IL-15 (PEG:lysine ratio of 10:1). Groups (3 mice per group) of 10-12-week-old female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were injected intravenously with 10 μg of protein in a total volume of 150 μl. Following the injections, mice were sacrificed and blood samples were collected at 3, 5, 15, and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, 40, and 48 h via cardiac puncture, and the plasma was analyzed by CTLL-2 competitive inhibition assay, CTLL-2 proliferation assay, and IL-15 ELISA. The ELISA used a murine monoclonal capture antibody (M111, Immunex designation) and a murine monoclonal antibody for detection (M112, Immunex designation). These antibodies were found to bind to both the PEGylated and unmodified forms of IL-15, but with different affinities. Therefore, amino acid-analyzed standards of both IL-15 and PEG-IL-15 were used as controls in the ELISA experiments. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the PEGylated and unmodified forms of IL-15 in the blood were determined and the apparent elimination rate constant (K) and half-life (t1/2) for each form of the molecule were calculated using a pharmacokinetics half-life program on a RS/1 system. The log linear portion of the blood concentration/time curve was used to calculate K with t1/2 determined as t1/2 = ln2K. Half-life values are presented as t1/2± S.E., where S.E. indicates the standard error in fitting the log linear line to the data points in calculating the K value. The distribution (t1/2α) and elimination (t1/2β) half-lives were calculated using a biphasic pharmacokinetics program that related the respective log linear concentration/time curves to specific K and t1/2 values. Bioactivity of IL-15, IL-2, PEG-IL-15, PEG-IL-2, IL-15D8S, and IL-15Q108S were assessed using a modified CTLL-2 cell [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (23Gillis S. Ferm M.M. Ou W. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 2027-2032PubMed Google Scholar). CTLL-2 competitive inhibition assays were performed by adding suboptimal amounts of IL-15 (final concentration, 50 pg/ml) or IL-2 (20 pg/ml) to all assay wells after serial dilution of samples and prior to addition of cells. The amino acid sequences for huIL-15 and huIL-2 have been previously reported (21Giri J.G. Paxton R.J. Aggarwal B.B. Gutterman J.U. Human Cytokines, Handbook for Basic and Clinical Research. Vol. II. Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA1996: 135-145Google Scholar, 24Taniguchi T. Matsui H. Fujita T. Takaoka C. Kashima N. Yoshimoto R. Hamuro J. Nature. 1983; 302: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In spite of the overwhelming clues to the structural similarities between these cytokines based on their functional similarities and common receptor usage, the amino acid sequences show only weak sequence identities. This is not uncommon among members of the helical cytokine family, of which IL-2 is a member (25Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 159-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Wlodawer A. Pavlovsky A. Gustchina A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Those amino acid sequences that are conserved between IL-2 and IL-15 were used for alignment. In particular, amino acid residues of each cytokine presumed to define the α helical structure were aligned first. Secondary consideration was given to the conserved cysteine and other conserved residues found in the loop regions that connect each α helix. This alignment strategy required the placement of gaps in either the IL-2 or IL-15 sequence in the loop regions that connect the α helices. A three-dimensional computer model of IL-15 was generated using FOLDER, a distance geometry based homology modeling package (27Srinivasan S. March C.J. Sudarsanam S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Sudarsanam S. March C.J. Srinivasan S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the model, a “template” sequence was defined that included the structurally conserved amino acid residues within the α helices as defined by other cytokines within the four-helix bundle cytokine family (25Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 159-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other amino acids included in the template sequence were short loop regions between or flanking the α helices. The IL-15 model was then generated using the template sequence and the established coordinates for IL-2 (PDB code 3ink) (29Brandhuber B.J. Boone T. Kenney W.C. McKay D.B. Science. 1987; 238: 1707-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Bazan J.F. Science. 1992; 257: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Amino acids in the template sequence of IL-2 were the only residues used to derive structural constraints between atoms of the corresponding amino acids in the IL-15 sequence. For all the other amino acids of IL-15, for which there are no corresponding amino acids in the template sequence, only chemical, steric and loop closure constraints were used to define spatial locations (27Srinivasan S. March C.J. Sudarsanam S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and SE-HPLC were used to characterize and separate PEG-IL-15 and PEG-IL-2 species, respectively. Heterogeneous mixtures of PEG-IL-15 and PEG-IL-2 were produced, depending on the PEG:lysine ratio used in the conjugation reaction (Fig. 1). At high PEG:lysine ratios, significant smearing of the bands on the gels was observed. SE-HPLC was used to separate PEGylated species for further analysis (Fig. 2), and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy of PEG-IL-15 (PEG:lysine ratio of 100:1 in reaction mixture) confirmed at least seven distinct species ranging in size from 14,000 to approximately 50,000 kDa in intervals of about 5,000 kDa (Fig. 3).Fig. 2A, SE-HPLC of PEG-5000, IL-15, and PEG-IL-15 at PEG:lysine ratios of 1:1, 3:1, 10:1, and 100:1.

Based on these data, pharmacokinetic circulation half-lives were measured for IL-15 (t1/2α = 0.9 ± 0.3 min; t1/2β = 16.0 ± 1.7 min) and PEG-IL-15 (t1/2α = 87.6 ± 8.2 min; t1/2β = 2445 ± 167 min). Also, the circulation half-life of IL-15 was estimated by CTLL-2 proliferation assay (t1/2α = 1.0 ± 0.7 min; t1/2β = 16.5 ± 4.7 min), and the circulation half-life of PEG-IL-15 was estimated by CTLL-2 inhibition assay (t1/2α = 107 ± 41 min; t1/2β = 859 ± 133 min). PEG-IL-15 clearly was eliminated more slowly than un-PEGylated IL-15; t1/2β was slower by a factor of 52 (by CTLL-2 analysis) or 153 (by ELISA). CTLL-2 bioassays were used to measure the bioactivity of each of the molecules investigated in this study (Fig. 5). Biological activity was measurable for IL-2, IL-15, and PEG-IL-2 (PEG:lysine ratio of 100:1). Similar specific activities were measured for IL-15 and IL-2, whereas the bioactivity of PEG-IL-2 was lower than these by 2 orders of magnitude. No bioactivity could be measured for PEG-IL-15 (PEG:lysine ratio of 100:1), IL-15D8S, or IL-15Q108S. Nonconjugated PEG did not inhibit CTLL-2 proliferation at concentrations used in the PEGylated cytokine assays (data not shown). Intermediate bioactivities were measured for PEG-IL-15 and PEG-IL-2 with PEG:lysine ratios of 1:1, 3:1, and 10:1 (data not shown). The ability of PEGylated forms of IL-15 and IL-2 and mutated forms of IL-15 to specifically inhibit the bioactivity of unmodified IL-15 or IL-2 was measured. The specific inhibitory effects of PEG-IL-15, IL-15D8S, and IL-15Q108S on the biological activity of a standard solution of IL-15 (50 pg/ml) are clearly demonstrated (Fig. 6). No such inhibitory effect was found for PEG-IL-2 in this assay (Fig. 7). It should be noted that the mutated forms of IL-15 were able to inhibit IL-15 binding at concentrations of approximately three orders of magnitude lower than those required to inhibit IL-15 binding with PEG-IL-15. A 2000-5000-fold molar excess of PEG-IL-15 (based on protein weight) was required to obtain 100% inhibition of IL-15 induced bioactivity, whereas only a 10-20-fold molar excess of IL-15D8S or IL-15Q108S was required to obtain 100% inhibition of IL-15 induced bioactivity. None of the cytokines investigated in this study were able to inhibit the biological activity of a standard solution of IL-2 (20 pg/ml) (Fig. 7).Fig. 6CTLL-2 inhibition bioassay shows the ability of cytokines to bind to CTLL-2 cells and inhibit the activity of IL-15.

A disulfide bridge is conserved between IL-15 (Cys42-Cys88) and IL-2 (Cys58-Cys105), and one disulfide bridge unique to IL-15 (Cys35-Cys85) has been proposed (1Grabstein K.H. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Rauch C. Srinivasan S. Fung V. Beers C. Richardson J. Schoenborn M.A. Ahdieh M. Johnson L. Alderson M.R. Watson J.D. Anderson D.M. Giri J.G. Science. 1994; 264: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). The structural significance of the sequence alignment can be evaluated by the number and site of identities within the four blocks defining the four α helices. The conserved EFLXXXXXXXQXXI (Xs are nonidentical amino acids) in the D-helix, the conserved CXXXEL in B-helix, the conserved cysteine within the loop that connects the C-helix and D-helix, and conserved DLXXI in the A-helix further support the expected structural similarities between the two cytokines. Conservation of XDX in the A-helix and XQX in the D-helix also suggests similar receptor binding modes between these two cytokines because XDX and XQX of IL-2 are known to be involved in β and γ receptor binding, respectively. Furthermore, the level of identities found within the four helices are no lower than those between other helical cytokines that are known to belong to helical cytokines family using crystal structure analysis (25Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 159-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ribbon models of IL-2 and IL-15 are illustrated in Fig. 9, A-D. The side chains of amino acid residues of IL-2 that are known to influence binding to the α, β, and γ receptor subunits are highlighted in Fig. 9A. As a result of sequence alignment and spatial comparison between IL-2 and IL-15, residues on IL-15 hypothesized to interact with β and γ receptor subunits were identified (Asp8 and Gln108, respectively). The positions of single point mutations made for IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S are illustrated in Fig. 9B. Potential PEGylation sites (lysine residues and the N terminus) are highlighted for IL-2 and IL-15 in Fig. 9, C and D, respectively. In comparing these figures, it is evident that potential PEGylation sites are absent in the region of IL-15 that, by comparison with IL-2, may bind IL-15Rα. Also, potential PEGylation sites in the region of IL-15 which may bind IL-15Rβ were noted. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that PEG-IL-15 (as well as IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S) could still bind to IL-15Rα but would not signal through the βγ receptor complex. Our initial goal for PEGylation of IL-15 was to extend its circulation half-life in a manner similar to that reported for IL-2 (31Knauf M.J. Bell D.P. Hirtzer P. Luo Z.-P. Young J.D. Katre N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15064-15070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zimmerman R.J. Aukerman S.L. Katre N.V. Winkelhake J.L. Young J.D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6521-6528PubMed Google Scholar). Toward this end, both IL-15 and IL-2 were PEGylated with lysine-specific, succinimidyl carbonate-activated PEG. The physical characteristics of PEG-IL-15 were found to be very similar to those of PEG-IL-2. Specifically, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SE-HPLC demonstrated similar distinct banding patterns that were attributable to the number of PEG conjugates on each protein molecule (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Also, pharmacokinetic studies carried out in a murine system demonstrated a significant enhancement of the circulation half-life of PEG-IL-15 in comparison with unmodified IL-15 (Fig. 4), an observation similar to that reported in the literature for PEG-IL-2 (31Knauf M.J. Bell D.P. Hirtzer P. Luo Z.-P. Young J.D. Katre N.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15064-15070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the physical similarities of PEG-IL-15 and PEG-IL-2, the biological activity of IL-15 was significantly altered by PEGylation, whereas the activity of IL-2 was largely unaffected by PEGylation. Specifically, PEG-IL-15 was inactive in the CTLL-2 bioassay (Fig. 5) but was able to competitively inhibit the biological activity of unmodified IL-15 (Fig. 6). By comparison, the biological activity of PEG-IL-2 was only slightly reduced relative to unmodified IL-2 (Fig. 5). In order to account for the discrepancies in the biological activity of PEG-IL-15 and PEG-IL-2, a critical analysis of the spatial orientation of the binding domains of each cytokine was carried out. The sequences of IL-15 and IL-2 were aligned (Fig. 8), and a molecular model of IL-15 was constructed (Fig. 9, B and D). On the basis of this model, we hypothesized that IL-15 and IL-2 could bind to their respective α subunits and to their and common β and γ receptor subunits through a similar spatial orientation of each cytokine. To test this hypothesis, muteins were generated at positions Asp8 or Gln108, which by analogy with mutagenesis studies carried out on IL-2, would interfere with β or γ receptor subunit binding, respectively. The resulting muteins, IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S, were tested for their biological activity in vitro. As with PEG-IL-15, each of the muteins was inactive in the CTLL-2 bioassay (Fig. 5) but was able to competitively inhibit the biological activity of unmodified IL-15 (Fig. 6). These results supported the model of IL-15 and confirmed our rationale for mutating IL-15 at positions Asp8 and Gln108. The antagonistic activity of IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S, as well as that of PEG-IL-15, could best be explained by the model. Disruption of binding to either the β or the γ receptor subunit would prevent signal transduction and cell proliferation, while still allowing competitive binding to the αβγ receptor complex through IL-15Rα. In further support of this conclusion, neither IL-15D8S nor IL-15Q108S was able to inhibit the bioactivity of IL-2, which binds to a unique IL-2Rα subunit but signals through the common βγ receptor subunit complex (Fig. 7). That PEGylation of IL-15 could disrupt β or γ receptor subunit binding is seen by the presence of two lysine residues at positions Lys10 and Lys11 (Fig. 9D). PEG conjugation to either of these residues could sterically interfere with β receptor binding to the region of IL-15 containing Asp8. Equally important in the IL-15 model is the observation that no lysine residues are present in the region hypothesized to bind to the α receptor subunit (approximately between residues 21 and 33). The closest lysine residues to the hypothesized α receptor subunit binding domain are Lys11 in helix A and Lys35 near the carboxyl end of the strand separating helix A and B. In contrast to IL-15, no lysine residues exist on IL-2 in regions that would interfere with either β or γ receptor subunit binding, and two lysine residues (Lys35 and Lys43) are known to interact with the IL-15Rα subunit (Fig. 9C) (9Weir M.P. Chaplin M.A. Wallace D.M. Dykes C.W. Hobden A.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6883-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Weigel U. Meyer M. Sebald W. Eur. J.

A. 1991; 88: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations are also consistent with the in vitro biology results in which PEG-IL-2 retains biological activity (Fig. 5) but is unable to act as a specific antagonist in vitro in the presence of unmodified IL-2 (Fig. 7). For the bioassay and pharmacokinetic studies, we chose to use forms of PEGylated molecules that were heavily PEG-modified in order to avoid heterogeneous mixtures of non-PEG and PEG-modified proteins. However, even in mixtures that were highly PEGylated, characterization by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy identified a heterogeneous population of PEGylated species (Fig. 3). Because multiple species of PEG-IL-15 conjugates were present in these samples, the specific activity could be expected to be reduced (i.e. some species of IL-15 may exist that have not been PEG conjugated at either position Lys10 or position Lys11). It should also be considered that a single chain of PEG may be extended in solution such that a chain attached at one site may interfere with the protein-receptor interactions at another distant site. Each of these possibilities is consistent with our CTLL-2 bioassay data, in which the concentration of PEG-IL-15 required to inhibit the activity of unmodified IL-15 was approximately 100-fold higher than that required for similar activities of IL-15D8S and IL-15Q108S (Fig. 6). The technique of protein PEGylation is usually considered in the context of extending the half-life of circulating proteins, reducing protein antigenicity, or improving the resistance of a given protein to proteolysis. In this study, we have demonstrated the potential use of PEG as a probe for protein structure and function. The observation that PEG can selectively interfere with a specific biological function has been reported previously in the literature. For example, in the process of PEGylating IgG, the complement-fixing activity of this molecule can be reduced, whereas its ability to bind antigen remains unaltered (19Suzuki T. Kanbara N. Tomono T. Hayashi N. Shinohara I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, in the process of PEGylating granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, neutrophil priming can be maintained or even enhanced, whereas the colony-stimulating activity of this molecule is reduced (20Knüsli C. Delgado C. Malik F. Dómine M. Tejedor M.C. Irvine A.E. Fisher D. Francis G.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 82: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fact, the knowledge that PEGylation of proteins can interfere with protein-ligand interactions in general has led investigators to introduce cysteine residues in recombinant proteins to enable site-specific PEGylation and reduce the possibility of steric interference from PEG (33Goodson R.J. Katre N.V. Biotechnology. 1990; 8: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Benhar I. Wang Q. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13398-13404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has also been used to eliminate lysine residues in locations where lysine-specific PEGylation could interfere with specific protein function (35Wang Q.C. Pai L.H. Debinski W. FitzGerald D.J. Pastan I. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4588-4594PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that protein PEGylation may also be used as a complementary technique to protein engineering in order to sterically control protein-ligand interactions. Protein-ligand interactions typically involve many amino acids over the surfaces of proteins: e.g. lysozyme/antibody (36Amit A.G. Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Poljak R.J. Science. 1986; 233: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), trypsin/trypsin inhibitor (37Janin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 100: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and growth hormone/receptor (38de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). By traditional protein engineering techniques, amino acid residues must be systematically mutated over a wide target region in order to uncover key residues or combinations of residues that are critical to protein function. In the case of protein PEGylation, the extended polymer chain may serve to sterically interfere with protein-protein interactions over a fairly large region on the surface of a protein molecule. In the particular example of IL-15 described in this paper, the likely PEGylation of residues Lys10 and/or Lys11 were sufficient to block the action of the nonadjacent critical residue, Asp8. The potential exists (by introducing specific amino acid residues in critical regions) to PEG modify other ligands that bind multisubunit receptors in order to make specific antagonists (e.g. growth hormone, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, etc.). These molecules should have the added attributes conferred by PEG conjugation, including extended serum half-life. This approach could be particularly useful when single point mutations are insufficient to block the binding of specific receptor subunits.

In A431 cells treated with laminin for different time periods, the regulation of 67LR expression correlated with expression of the α6 integrin subunit but not with the expression of other laminin receptors. Moreover, cytokine treatment resulted in down-modulated expression of the α6 integrin subunit and the 67LR. Co-regulation of the expression of the two receptors was further suggested by the observation that specific down-modulation of the α6-chain by antisense oligonucleotides was accompanied by a proportional decrease in the cell surface expression of 67LR. Biochemical analyses indicated co-immunoprecipitation of 67LR and the α6 subunit with an anti-α6 but not an anti-β1 monoclonal antibody. Co-regulation of 67LR and α6 subunit expression, together with the physical association between the two receptors, supports the hypothesis that 67LR is an auxiliary molecule involved in regulating or stabilizing the interaction of laminin with the α6β4 integrin.

INTRODUCTIONThe cytoplasm of human lens cells is composed predominantly of a group of soluble globular proteins known as the crystallins. The crystallin proteins in the human lens are categorized as the α- and β/γ-crystallin families (1Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The structure, stability, and short range order of the crystallins are thought to contribute to the transparency of the vertebrate ocular lens (2Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin is the most abundant of the crystallins in the vertebrate lens and is composed of two Mr 20,000 subunits, αA and αB, which associate to form high molecular weight oligomers ranging from approximately 3 × 105 to 1.2 × 106 daltons (3Augusteyn R.C. Parkhill E.M. Stevens A. Exp. Eye. Res. 1992; 54: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The two proteins are derived from single copy genes that share approximately 55% identity (1Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The α-crystallins also share sequence similarity with the small heat shock proteins of numerous species (4de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A.M. Voorter E.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of the α-crystallins have not been elucidated, but it is possible that they share the two-domain structure found in other crystallins (5Wistow G.

Shinohara H. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7718-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αB-crystallin gene has been shown to contain a heat shock element in its promoter that may be subject to a heat-regulated control mechanism (31Klemenz E. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).The chemical nature of the interactions between human α-crystallins and other proteins is poorly understood because of the difficulty with isolation of sufficient quantities of unmodified protein from human lenses. For this reason, recombinant techniques have been used to characterize structure-function relationships of the individual α-crystallin subunits. The conformational properties of substrate proteins bound to recombinant human αA-crystallin was recently reported (32Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); however, unlike human αB-crystallin, human αA-crystallin lacks a heat shock element in its promoter, is not induced by stress or pathological conditions, and has a limited expression pattern in the body. In this article we report expression and characterization of the small heat shock protein human αB-crystallin cloned from a fetal lens cDNA library. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration that human αB-crystallin displays molecular chaperone activity. The recombinant expression system described here provided an excellent source of unmodified human αB-crystallin that assembled into a high molecular weight oligomer, and displayed chaperone-like activity against protein aggregation.DISCUSSIONHuman lens crystallins undergo extensive posttranslational modifications during the aging process (41Ringens P.J. Hoenders H.J. Bloemendal H. Exp. Eye. Res. 1982; 34: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42Ringens P.J. Hoenders H.J. Bloemendal H. Exp. Eye.

FASEB J. 1987; 1: 32-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Cherian M. Abraham E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These modifications lead to protein heterogeneity, which has precluded the successful purification of large amounts of homogenous human crystallins to be used for biophysical, functional, and structural analyses. Here we report for the first time expression and characterization of functional human αB-crystallin in E. coli.DNA primers designed against the 5′- and 3′-ends of the αB coding region successfully amplified a ∼525-base pair cDNA from a human fetal lens cDNA library, confirming that this gene is transcriptionally active in the human lens (data not shown). The amplified coding region for this crystallin was subcloned into a bacterial expression plasmid and expressed in the bacterial cytoplasm as a soluble fusion protein coupled to MBP. After cleavage and separation from MBP, SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that the recombinant protein migrated to its predicted molecular weight (Mr∼22,000). This polypeptide was recognized by antiserum raised against human αB-crystallin purified directly from lens homogenates. N-terminal chemical sequencing demonstrated that after the first four vector-derived amino acids (ISEF) the recombinant human αB-crystallin was 100% identical to the deduced amino acid sequence predicted from the exon sequence of the human αB-crystallin gene (36Dubin R.A. Ally A.H. Chung S. Piatigorsky J. Genomics. 1990; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal methionine of the recombinant αB-crystallin is preceded by four additional residues (isoleucine, serine, glutamic acid, and phenylalanine), circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the reassociated αB resembled the secondary structures previously reported for total purified bovine α-crystallin as well as recombinant and purified bovine αA-crystallin (12Merck K.B. Groenen P.J.T.A. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kantorow M.

Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).On a size exclusion chromatography column recombinant human MBP-αB and αB-crystallin eluted as high molecular weight oligomers similar in size (between 2.3 × 105 and 4.4 × 105) to total α-crystallin purified directly from human eye lenses (45Siezen R.J. Thomson J.A. Kaplan E.D. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6088-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MBP-αB fusion protein was able to associate into a high molecular weight oligomer despite the presence of the Mr 42,700 N-terminal fusion partner MBP. Assuming molecular weights of 1.3 × 106 for MBP-αB and 4.4 × 105 for αB-crystallin, both the human MBP-αB and αB-crystallin displayed molecular chaperone activity, as demonstrated by their complete suppression of the aggregation of ADH at a molar ratio of approximately 50:1 (ADH:crystallin). When the molecular weights of the subunits of MBP-αB and αB-crystallin were used (6.5 × 104 and 2.2 × 104, respectively), complete suppression of the aggregation of ADH was observed at a molar ratio of approximately 2.5:1 (ADH:crystallin). A systematic evaluation of the precise stoichiometry involved in the suppression of ADH aggregation by MBP-αB and αB-crystallin will need to be addressed in the future.It was recently demonstrated using site-directed mutagenesis that specific residues at the C terminus of recombinant bovine αA-crystallin influenced its reassociation and chaperone activity (46Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. van Boekel M.A.M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To date, no mutants of human αB-crystallin have been characterized; however, in the studies presented here the presence of four extra N-terminal residues had no observable effect on the secondary structure, reassociation, and chaperone activity of recombinant human αB-crystallin. Strikingly, human MBP-αB formed a large functional structure and was able to completely suppress the aggregation of ADH at concentrations identical to those used with recombinant human αB-crystallin alone. Taken together, these results contribute to the evidence that the well conserved C-terminal domain of the α-crystallins is responsible for the proper assembly into large functional oligomers (5Wistow G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Merck K.B. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude-Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).At the amino acid level αB-crystallin is remarkably well conserved among mammalian species. This high degree of conservation among species may indicate a critical function for αB-crystallin in nonlens cells, in which expression occurs in response to environmental and pathological stress. The successful expression of functional recombinant human αB-crystallin creates the first opportunity to characterize the chemical basis of the interactions between αB and other proteins in lens and nonlens cells under normal and pathological conditions.

Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolae membranes in vivo. Caveolin has been proposed to function as a plasma membrane scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate signaling molecules within caveolae, including heterotrimeric G proteins (α and βγ subunits). In this regard, caveolin interacts directly with Gα subunits and can functionally regulate their activity. To date, three cDNAs encoding four subtypes of caveolin have been described in vertebrates. However, evidence for the existence of caveolin proteins in less complex organisms has been lacking.Here, we report the identification, cDNA sequence and genomic organization of the first invertebrate caveolin gene, Cavce (for caveolin from Caenorhabditis elegans). The Cavce gene, located on chromosome IV, consists of two exons interrupted by a 125-nucleotide intron sequence. The region of Cavce that is strictly homologous to mammalian caveolins is encoded by a single exon in Cavce. This suggests that mammalian caveolins may have evolved from the second exon of Cavce. Cavce is roughly equally related to all three known mammalian caveolins and, thus, could represent a common ancestor. Remarkably, the invertebrate Cavce protein behaves like mammalian caveolins: (i) Cavce forms a high molecular mass oligomer, (ii) assumes a cytoplasmic membrane orientation, and (iii) interacts with G proteins. A 20-residue peptide encoding the predicted G protein binding region of Cavce possesses “GDP dissociation inhibitor-like activity” with the same potency as described earlier for mammalian caveolin-1. Thus, caveolin appears to be structurally and functionally conserved from worms to man. In addition, we find that there are at least two caveolin-related genes expressed in C. elegans, defining an invertebrate caveolin gene family. These results establish the nematode C. elegans as an invertebrate model system to study caveolae and caveolin in vivo.

Caveolae are vesicular organelles that represent a subdivision of the plasma membrane (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 2Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although they are found in most cell types, caveolae are most numerous in adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and muscle cells (smooth, skeletal, and cardiac). In transmission electron micrographs they can be distinguished by their characteristic shape: ∼50-100-nm vesicles located at or near the plasma membrane (3Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Palade G.E. J.

Functionally, caveolae have been implicated in a variety of signal transduction related events, including signaling from G protein-coupled receptors and growth factor receptors (5Anderson R.G.W.

These molecules appear to be tightly associated as a discrete complex with caveolin as shown using a polyhistidine-tagged form of caveolin for detergent-free affinity purification of caveolae membranes (18Song K.S.

Caveolin is thought to play an important structural role in the formation of caveolae membranes. In this regard, caveolin may act as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate specific caveolin-interacting lipids and proteins within caveolae microdomains (19Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E.

In support of this notion, caveolin forms a high molecular mass homo-oligomer (19Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, caveolin interacts only with the GDP-liganded conformation of these molecules and caveolin can function as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) 1The abbreviations used are: GDIGDP dissociation inhibitorGAPGTPase-activating proteinmAbmonoclonal antibodyMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)ESTexpressed sequence tag. for heterotrimeric G proteins, holding the G protein in the inactive conformation (24Li S.

Caveolin expression appears to drive caveolae formation. For example, caveolae organelles and caveolin protein are induced ∼10-25 fold during adipocyte differentiation (25Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C.

A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Conversely, caveolin protein expression is down-regulated in response to cell transformation by activated oncogenes (such as H-ras (G12V) and v-abl); down-regulation of caveolin protein coincides with the disappearance of caveolae from these transformed cells (28Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Also, recombinant overexpression of caveolin in caveolin-deficient cells can lead to the formation of caveolae in lymphocytes (29Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and insect Sf21 cells (30Li S. Song K.S. Koh S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, there are certain cell lines which morphologically contain caveolae, but fail to express caveolin (31Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). This finding has suggested that other caveolin-related proteins may exist that are immunologically distinct from caveolin. In support of this notion, two novel caveolin-related proteins have recently been identified and cloned. These proteins, termed caveolin-2 and caveolin-3, are the products of separate caveolin genes (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 32Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Thus, caveolin (retermed caveolin-1) is the first member of a multigene family (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Caveolins 1, 2, and 3 are structurally homologous proteins but are immunologically distinct molecules; they have different but overlapping tissue distributions (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 32Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). For example, the expression of caveolin-3 is absolutely muscle-specific (skeletal and cardiac muscle cells) (32Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 34Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S.

Caveolin-1 is not expressed in these striated muscle tissues, but smooth muscle cells co-express caveolins 1 and 3 (34Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin-1 and −2 are co-expressed in adipocytes and share the same overlapping tissue distribution (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, a given mammalian cell, such as smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts, may co-express up to three or four immunologically distinct caveolin protein products. Due to the complexity inherent in studying mammalian systems, we have chosen to search for caveolin genes in model invertebrate organisms. Here, we report the identification of the first invertebrate caveolin gene, Cavce, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cavce is roughly equally related to all three known mammalian caveolins and, thus, could represent a common ancestor. The identification and sequencing of Cavce represents a starting point for reverse genetics experiments designed to isolate animals mutated in a caveolin gene. The cDNAs for mammalian caveolins 1, 2, and 3 were as we described previously (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The C. elegans EST clone yk74b2 was obtained from Dr. Yuji Kohara (Gene Library Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal IgG and mouse monoclonal IgG (mAb 2297) directed against caveolin-1 were the generous gift of Dr. John R. Glenney (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Anti-Myc IgG (9E10) and anti-FLAG (M2) IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and IBI, respectively. Other reagents were from the following commercial suppliers: prestained protein markers, fetal bovine serum, and other cell culture reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.); and Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Peptide synthesis was performed by the Biopolymers Facility at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Epitope-tagged forms of the Cavce cDNA were subcloned into the MCS (KpnI/XbaI) of the vector pCB7 for expression in COS-7 cells. A Myc epitope was incorporated into the N terminus (MEQKLISEEDLNGG-Cavce) and a FLAG epitope tag was incorporated into the C terminus (Cavce-GGDYKDDDDK); GG was placed as a spacer between the epitopes and the Cavce coding sequence, as performed previously for caveolins 1, 2, and 3 (11Kurzchalia T.

Constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, as described previously. Expression was detected using mAb 9E10 that recognizes the Myc epitope or mAb M2 that recognizes the FLAG epitope. The molecular mass of Cavce was estimated as described previously for mammalian caveolins 1, 2, and 3 (19Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc.

Solubilized material was loaded atop a 5-40% linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (340,000 × g) for 10 h in an SW60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradient fractions were collected from above and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Molecular mass standards for velocity gradient centrifugation were as described previously (19Sargiacomo M.

Note that caveolin-2 is a dimer of ∼40 kDa, and it correctly migrates between the 29-kDa and 66-kDa molecular mass standards using this velocity gradient system (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M.

Transfected COS-7 cells were briefly washed three times with PBS and fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and treated with 25 mM NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and washed with PBS (three times, 10 min each). For double-labeling, the cells were then successively incubated with PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin containing: (i) 50 μg/ml each of normal goat and donkey IgGs, (ii) a 1:400 dilution of mAb 9E10 and 40 μg/ml anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal IgG, and (iii) lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml). Alternatively, a 1:400 dilution of anti-FLAG IgG (mAb M2) was utilized in step (ii). The first incubation was 30 min, while primary and secondary antibody reactions were 60 min each. Cells were washed three time with PBS between incubations. Slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent and observed under a Bio-Rad MR600 confocal fluorescence microscope. Transfected COS-7 cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes were used to prepare caveolin-enriched membrane fractions, essentially as we have described previously (24Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M.

After two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells (two confluent 100-mm dishes) were scraped into 2 ml of 500 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. Homogenization was carried out sequentially in the following order using: (i) a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes); (ii) a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10 s bursts; Kinematica GmbH, Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY); and (iii) a sonicator (three 20-s bursts; Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT). The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 M NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 35% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mM sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16-20 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band confined to the 5-35% sucrose interface was observed that contained caveolin, but excluded most other cellular proteins. Gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (mAb 2297; 1:400) or with 9E10 ascites (1:500) to visualize epitope-tagged Cavce. For immunoblotting, incubation conditions were as described by the manufacturer (Promega; Amersham Corp.), except we supplemented our blocking solution with both 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% non-fat dry milk (Carnation). The amount of caveolin-1 and Cavce that remains associated with caveolin-enriched fractions was estimated by immunoblotting, as described elsewhere (37Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J.

Quantitation was performed with a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer. To ensure that these estimates were made in the linear range, we used multiple autoradiographic exposures and monitored their linearity using the densitometer, essentially as described previously (39Lodish H.F.

Briefly, the assay was performed for 20 min at 37°C in the presence of 20 μM Mg2+ with 10 nM G protein. The GTPγS binding assay was performed as we described elsewhere (42Okamoto T. Katada T.

The Cavce-derived polypeptide contained the sequence DCVWRLNHTVFTAVRLFIYR, corresponding to amino acids 132-151 of Cavce. Probes corresponding to the cDNAs of both caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 were labeled with digoxigenin, according to the manufacter's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). These labeled probes were used to screen a previously described λ-2 murine genomic library (43Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A total of 100,000 plaque-forming units were screened; three independent genomic clones were isolated for caveolins 2 and 3. To determine possible intron-exon boundaries, we performed PCR with the following primers based on the known cDNA sequences of caveolin-2 and caveolin-3. The caveolin-2 primers were: 2-1, 5′-ATGGACGACGACTCCTACAGC-3′; nucleotides 1-21; 2-2, 5′-ATCGTCCTACGCTCGTACACAATGGAG-3′, anti-parallel to nucleotides 386-412; and 2-3, 5′-TCAATCCTGGCTCAGTTGCA-3′, anti-parallel to nucleotides 431-450. The caveolin-3 primers were: 3-1, 5′-ATGATGACCGAAGAGC-3′, nucleotides 1-16; 3-2, 5′-GATCCAGTGCATCA-3′, nucleotides 339-352; 3-3, 5′-AGTGCCCTCGGGCTCCGC-3′, anti-parallel to nucleotides 136-153; 3-4, 5′-GGCCCAGATGTGGCAGA-3′, anti-parallel to nucleotides 290-306; and 3-5, 5′-TTAGCCTTCCCTTCGCAGCAC-3′, anti-parallel to nucleotides 436-456. In all cases, the cDNAs for caveolins 2 and 3 were used as a positive control. To obtain the Cavce-2 cDNA, a C. elegans cDNA library was used as the substrate for PCR. Primers were designed based on genomic sequences obtained by the C. elegans Genome project (accession no. Z77655; cosmid C56A3). The primers were as follows (restriction sites are underlined): 5′-CCGGCCATGACTCGTCAGAATACTTCC-3′ and 5′-CCGGCCGAATCTTAAACATGATGAATGTGTTT-3′. As expected an ∼1-kb band was observed. After gel purification, this product was subjected to direct double-stranded DNA sequencing in both directions. This product was also subcloned into the MCS (EcoRI/BamHI) of the vector pBS II KS+ for additional DNA sequencing and further analysis. C. elegans (N2 strain) were used as the source to purify poly(A)+ RNA. mRNA isolation as well as agarose gel electrophoresis and transfer to nylon membranes was performed as described previously (45Otsuka A.J.

INTRODUCTIONReceptor endocytosis is a fundamental process with many diverse functions. Endocytosis of some receptors, such as the transferrin receptor, is required for the uptake of nutrients by many cell types. These receptors internalize constitutively, without the need to bind ligand. In contrast, agonist binding is required for internalization of receptors for many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of these receptors contributes to receptor desensitization, resensitization, and down-regulation, critical processes that regulate cellular responses.The main pathway for constitutive and agonist-induced endocytosis is by clathrin-coated pits, although alternative pathways involve non-coated vesicles or caveolae (2Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis probably requires interaction of specific receptor motifs with components of the endocytic machinery (3Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-containing motifs of six residues forming a tight β-turn are common, and interchangeable endocytic signals are found in the intracellular domains of constitutively internalized and tyrosine kinase receptors (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 4Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A.

In constitutively internalized receptors, they may be continuously exposed to the endocytic machinery, whereas agonist-induced internalization of the signaling receptors may require receptor modification to expose a cryptic endocytic motif. Thus, a point mutation that inactivates the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor abolishes agonist-induced internalization, probably by preventing exposure of an endocytic motif (5Opresko L.K.

In contrast, deletion of the entire tyrosine kinase domain abolishes the endocytic switch and results in constitutive endocytosis, which is probably due to continuous exposure of endocytic motifs.Although regions in the C-tail and TMD 1The abbreviations used are: TMDtransmembrane domainNK1Rneurokinin 1 receptorSPsubstance Pcy3-SPcyanine 3.18-labeled substance PARadrenergic receptorKNRK cellsKirsten murine sarcoma virus transformed rat kidney cellswtwild-typePCRpolymerase chain reaction.

Agonist-induced internalization may require activation of signaling mechanisms or receptor phosphorylation. Arguing against the first possibility are observations with receptor mutants that either signal normally and show impaired internalization or exhibit impaired coupling to G-proteins and normal internalization (13Cheung A.H. Dixon R.A.F. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 775-779Google Scholar, 14Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

SP is a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems, stimulates smooth muscle contraction and exocrine gland secretion, and induces neurogenic inflammation, actions that are mediated in part by the NK1R (23Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). SP stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycling of the NK1R in multiple cell types (19Garland A.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2622-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is important to identify endocytic motifs of the NK1R since receptor endocytosis and recycling determine the ability of a cell to respond to SP (24Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M. Krause J.E. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 438-446PubMed Google Scholar). Although much is known about the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the NK1R that interact with receptor agonists and antagonists (25Gether U. Johanson T.E. Snider R.M. Lowe J.A. Nakanishi S. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Fong T.M. Cascieri M.A. Yu H. Bansal A. Swain C. Strader C.D. Nature. 1993; 362: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), there is little information about NK1R domains that are necessary for endocytosis. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to identify motifs for SP-induced endocytosis of the NK1R. Based on our knowledge of endocytic motifs of single TMD receptors and on the limited information on G-protein-coupled receptors, we mutated the rat NK1R and investigated the effects of the mutations on agonist-induced endocytosis. We identified Tyr-containing motifs in the C-tail and TMD VII of the NK1R that are important for endocytosis and which resemble motifs of the single TMD receptors.RESULTSTo identify regions of the NK1R that are important for endocytosis, we generated a series of mutants (Fig. 1).C-terminal TruncationsFirst, we progressively truncated the C-tail (designating receptors as “δ” followed by number of the last residue). The intracellular C-tail of the rat NK1R extends 99 residues from the plasma membrane (309-407). Tyr, Ser, and Thr residues, usually 30-50 residues from the plasma membrane, have been implicated in endocytosis of several G-protein-coupled receptors (8Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20285-20290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rodriguez M.C. Xie Y.-B. Wang H. Collison K. Segaloff D.L. Mol.

The C-tail of the NK1R contains three Tyr residues (Tyr-331, Tyr-341, and Tyr-349) that are conserved between species and which may be important for endocytosis. Tyr residues 341 and 349 are surrounded by six Ser and Thr residues. We designed four truncated receptors to remove varying portions of the C-tail (Fig. 1): δ354, lacking part of the tail with no conserved Tyr residues; δ342, lacking Tyr-349 and a portion of the surrounding Ser and Thr residues; δ324, lacking Tyr-349, Tyr-341, Tyr-331 and the remaining Ser and Thr residues; and δ311, in which the entire C-tail including the putative palmitoylation site was deleted. NK1R-δ311 corresponds to the naturally truncated, potentially alternatively spliced NK1R variant (33Fong T.M. Anderson S. Yu H. Huang R. Strader C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kage R. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence with the Flag antibody revealed that NK1R-wt, NK1R-δ354, NK1R-δ342, and NK1R-δ324 were normally located at the plasma membrane (not shown). However, NK1R-δ311 was mostly found intracellularly in vesicles, suggesting mistargeting, and was not further evaluated.For all mutants, we initially measured the time course of receptor endocytosis using 125I-SP. Cells were incubated with 125I-SP for 60 min at 4°C, washed, and incubated at 37°C for 0, 5, or 10 min. They were washed with acid to separate cell surface from internalized label. We used these results to identify mutants with significant alterations in endocytosis. These were analyzed in more detail by measuring internalization of 125I-SP at 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 min. The data points from 0, 1, and 2 min were fitted to a linear function; the initial rate of internalization was calculated from the slope and is expressed as % internalization/min.When NK1R-wt cells were incubated with 125I-SP at 4°C and immediately washed with acid, 13.8 ± 1.7% of the specifically bound counts were in the acid-resistant, internalized fraction. After 5 min at 37°C, 57.2 ± 2.0% of specific counts were internalized. The initial internalization rate was 9.9 ± 0.9%/min (r2 for linear regression = 0.995) (Fig. 2A). At 4°C, 8-20% of specific counts were internalized by NK1R-δ354, -δ342, or -δ324 cells. After 5 min the proportion of specific counts that were internalized was 50.6 ± 0.5% for NK1R-δ354, 21.1 ± 0.8% for NK1R-δ342, and 32.8 ± 3.5% for NK1R-δ324, significantly less than for NK1R-wt (p < 0.05 compared with NK1R-wt, Table I). These differences were also significant at 10 min. The initial rates of internalization were measured for NK1R-δ342 and NK1R-δ324 cells, since they showed the largest defects in endocytosis. The initial rat of internalization was 2.4 ± 0.5%/min (r2 = 0.999) for NK1R-δ342 cells and 3.0 ± 0.6%/min (r2 = 0.971) for NK1R-δ324 cells, significantly slower than for NK1R-wt cells (p < 0.05 compared with NK1R-wt, Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Internalization of 125I-SP by wild-type and mutated NK1R.

When NK1R-wt cells were incubated with cy3-SP at 4°C and immediately fixed, cy3-SP was confined to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). After 2 min at 37°C, there was minimal detectable surface labeling, and cy3-SP was found in superficial endosomes. After 5 min, cy3-SP was mostly present in perinuclear endosomes (Fig. 3), and the distribution was similar at 10 and 30 min. In NK1R-δ354, -δ342, and -δ324 cells at 4°C, cy3-SP was confined to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). In NK1R-δ354 cells, a substantial amount of cy3-SP remained at the plasma membrane after warming, and endosomes containing cy3-SP remained in a superficial location and did not proceed to a perinuclear region (Fig. 3). The largest defect in internalization was observed in NK1R-δ342 cells, in which cy3-SP was retained at the plasma membrane and was rarely detected in endosomes even after 30 min (Fig. 3). In NK1R-δ324 cells, cy3-SP was also detected at the plasma membrane at all time points and there was minimal internalization (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Confocal photomicrographs showing distribution of cy3-SP in NK1R-wt, NK1R-δ354, NK1R-δ342, or NK1R-δ324 cells. Cells were incubated with cy3-SP at 4°C and either fixed immediately or washed and incubated at 37°C for 5 min and then fixed. At 4°C, cy3-SP was confined to the plasma membrane in all cell lines. After 5 min at 37°C, cy3-SP was in perinuclear endosomes in NK1R-wt cells and retained at the plasma membrane or superficial endosomes in NK1R-δ354, NK1R-δ342, or NK1R-δ324 cells.

In NK1R-wt cells, SP induced a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i with an EC50 of 0.55 nM (Table I). SP also increased [Ca2+]i in NK1R-δ354, -δ342, and -δ324 cells, but SP was more potent, and the dose-response curves were shifted to the left between 3- and almost 7-fold (Fig. 4A, Table I). Maximal responses were similar for NK1R-wt and the truncated receptors. Those receptors with the largest defects in internalization were further characterized by determining the KD and Bmax of the receptors. The KD for 125I-SP binding was 7.4 ± 1.6 nM and the Bmax was 58.4 ± 4.9 fmol/105 cells for NK1R-wt (Table I). The KD and Bmax were similar in NK1R-δ342 and -δ324 cells. Thus, although we do not know the reason for increased sensitivity of truncated receptors to SP, their impaired ability to internalize cannot be explained by defective signaling, and defects in ligand binding cannot explain the impaired endocytosis of these truncated receptors.Fig. 4SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization measured in cells expressing wild-type and mutated NK1R using Fura-2/AM.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated potential Tyr-containing internalization motifs in the C-tail of the NK1R by mutating conserved residues. Individual mutation of the conserved tyrosines (Tyr-331, Tyr-341, and Tyr-349) in the C-tail to Ala significantly reduced the extent of internalization of 125I-SP but to different degrees. Thus, after 5 min at 37°C, 50.5 ± 2.3% of specific counts were internalized by NK1R-Y331A, 48.1 ± 3.8% by NK1R-Y341A cells, and 40.6 ± 3.9% by NK1R-Y349A cells, compared with 57.2 ± 2.0% for NK1R-wt cells (p < 0.05 compared with NK1R-wt, Table I). The greatest effect, for the Y349A mutant, represents a reduction in the extent of internalization of 30%. A double Tyr-341 and Tyr-349 mutation did not have an additive effect on attenuation of endocytosis. The initial internalization rates were 6.3 ± 0.8%/min (r2 = 0.980) for NK1R-Y341A and 4.0 ± 0.6%/min (r2 = 0.981) for NK1R-Y349A cells and, therefore, significantly slower than for NK1R-wt cells (9.9 ± 0.9%/min) (p < 0.05 compared with NK1R-wt, Fig. 2B).At 4°C, cy3-SP was confined to the plasma membrane in all mutants involving Tyr residues in the C-tail (NK1R-Y341A and NK1R-Y349A, Fig. 5; NK1R-Y331A and NK1R-Y341A/Y349A not shown). After 5 min at 37°C, cy3-SP was retained at the plasma membrane and found in superficial and perinuclear endosomes in cells expressing NK1R-Y331A (not shown) and NK1R-Y341A (Fig. 5). In NK1R-Y349A cells, cy3-SP was mostly retained at the plasma membrane and in superficial endosomes after 5 min, although there were a few perinuclear vesicles containing cy3-SP (Fig. 5). This is in contrast to NK1R-wt cells, in which cy3-SP was mostly found in many perinuclear endosomes after 5 min (Fig. 3).Fig. 5Confocal photomicrographs showing distribution of cy3-SP in NK1R-Y341A and NK1R-Y349A cells. Cells were incubated with cy3-SP at 4°C, and either fixed immediately or washed and incubated at 37°C for 5 min and then fixed. At 4°C, cy3-SP was confined to the plasma membrane in both cell lines. After 5 min at 37°C, cy3-SP was retained at the plasma membrane (see NK1R-Y349A) or superficial endosomes (see NK1R-Y341A), with minimal progression to perinuclear endosomes compared with NK1R-wt (Fig. 3).

Maximal Ca2+ responses were similar. The KD and Bmax were similar to NK1R-wt except for the Y341 mutant, where the KD was ~4-fold lower. Thus, defects in endocytosis are unlikely to be the result of markedly abnormal binding and signaling.Tyrosine Mutations in TMD VIIA Tyr-containing motif (NPX2-3Y) in TMD VII is highly conserved within G-protein-coupled receptors and may be a common endocytic motif (7Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined this possibility for the NK1R by mutating Tyr-305 in TMD VII to Phe or Ala. Phe can replace Tyr in many, but not all, proteins without a significant effect on internalization, whereas Ala substitutions usually abolish the signal (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar).Mutation of Tyr-305 to Phe significantly reduced the extent of endocytosis of NK1R, as measured by internalization of 125I-SP. Thus, after 5 min at 37°C, only 40.3 ± 4.7% of specific counts were internalized by NK1R-Y305F cells, which represents a reduction of internalization by 30% compared with NK1R-wt cells (p < 0.05 compared with NK1R-wt, Table I). Mutation of Tyr-305 to Ala resulted in increased internalization at 4°C, although there was low specific binding compared with the other mutants. After 60 min at 4°C, 29.4 ± 7.1% of specific counts were internalized in NK1R-Y305A cells, compared with 13.8 ± 1.7% in NK1R-wt cells (Table I). However, after 5 min at 37°C, the proportion of internalized 125I-SP was similar for NK1R-Y305A and NK1R-wt cells. The initial internalization rates were 7.9 ± 1.1%/min (r2 = 1.000) for NK1R-Y305F cells and 7.1 ± 1.0%/min (r2 = 0.921) for NK1R-Y305A cells (Fig. 2C). These rates were slower than for NK1R-wt cells but not statistically significant different.At 4°C, cy3-SP was confined to the plasma membrane of NK1R-Y305F cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, there was only very weak surface binding of cy3-SP in NK1R-Y305A cells, and cy3-SP was also detected in vesicles at 4°C (Fig. 6). In NK1R-Y305F cells after 5 min at 37°C, cy3-SP remained at the cell surface and in superficial endosomes, indicating diminished internalization of NK1R-Y305F compared with NK1R-wt (Fig. 6). However, in NK1R-Y305A cells, cy3-SP was found in perinuclear endosomes after 5 min (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Confocal photomicrographs showing distribution of cy3-SP in NK1R-Y305A and NK1R-Y305F cells.

In NK1R-Y305A cells at 4°C, there was weak binding of cy3-SP to the plasma membrane (arrow) and detection of some cy3-SP in endosomes (arrowhead), whereas after 5 min at 37°C there was stronger labeling in endosomes. In NK1R-Y305F cells at 4°C, there was strong binding of cy3-SP to the plasma membrane, whereas after 5 min at 37°C cy3-SP was retained at the cell surface and found in superficial vesicles, with minimal progression to perinuclear endosomes compared to NK1R-wt (Fig. 3).

Although no precise structural information has yet been published for these peptides using either high field NMR or x-ray techniques, previous CD spectroscopic measurements have indicated that con-G and con-T are folded in a stable α-helical conformation (7Zhou L.-M.

Gray W.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8508-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, there is some dispute over whether these structures are stabilized by Ca2+ (4Chandler P. Pennington M. Maccecchini M.-L. Nashed N.T. Skolnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17173-17178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhou L.-M. Szendrei G.I. Fossom L.H. Maccecchini M.-L. Skolnick P. Otvos L.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and furthermore, whether Ca2+ is essential to the biological function of the conantokin peptides (7Zhou L.-M. Szendrei G.I. Fossom L.H. Maccecchini M.-L. Skolnick P. Otvos L.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To investigate this intriguing problem we have synthesized con-G and con-T using Boc chemistry and investigated their solution structures in detail by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The effects of the solution environment including pH, monovalent cation (K+), divalent cations (Zn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+), EDTA, and TFE on the structures of con-G and con-T were monitored by CD spectroscopy. Both peptides were also examined under several conditions by 1H NMR spectroscopy and their three-dimensional structures were calculated based on the NMR-derived restraints. All coded Boc-L-amino acids and reagents used during chain assembly were peptide synthesis grade supplied by Auspep Ptd. Ltd. (Parkville, Victoria). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was purchased from Laboratory Supply Pty. Ltd. (Coorparoo, Queensland). Deionized water was used throughout and prepared by a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Waters). Screw-cap glass peptide synthesis reaction vessels (10 ml) with a sintered glass filter were obtained from Embel Scientific Glassware (Queensland). An all-Kel-F apparatus (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) was used for HF cleavage. Argon, helium, and nitrogen were all ultrapure grade (CIG, Australia). The sequences of the two conantokins are: conantokin-G, Gly-Glu-Gla-Gla-Leu-Gln-Gla-Asn-Gln-Gla-Leu-Ile-Arg-Gla-Lys-Ser-Asn-NH2; and conantokin-T, Gly-Glu-Gla-Gla-Tyr-Gln-Lys-Met-Leu-Gla-Asn-Leu-Arg-Gla-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Lys-Asn-Ala-NH2. The linear conantokins were assembled manually using solid phase methodology with Boc chemistry (15Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Both peptides were assembled on p-methylbenzhydrylamine-resin·;HCl on a 0.2 mmol scale. The following side chain protected amino acids were employed: Asn(xanthyl), Lys(2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl), Glu(γ-cyclohexyl), Arg(p-toluenesulfonyl), Ser(benzyl), Gln(xanthyl), and Gla(γ-cyclohexyl)2. A 4-fold excess of Boc amino acids was used based on the original substitution of p-methylbenzhydrylamine-resin·;HCl. Boc-L-Gla(γ-cyclohexyl)2-OH·;DCHA was coupled with a 1.25 mol excess. Boc-Gla(γ-cyclohexyl)2 was synthesized as described previously (8Nishiuchi Y. Nakao M. Nakata M. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1993; 42: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All amino acids were activated using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (0.5 M in dimethylformamide) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine and coupled for 10 min, except for Boc-Gla(γ-cyclohexyl)2 which was coupled for 60 min. Boc protecting groups were removed using 100% trifluoroacetic acid and the peptides were cleaved from the resin using HF. The peptide resin (415 mg, 94.3 mmol) was treated with HF (9 ml) in the presence of p-cresol (1 ml) at −5°C for 2 h. Crude peptide was precipitated with cold ether, washed with cold ether, then extracted into 20% acetic acid and lyophilized to yield 201 mg (86%) of crude con-G. The crude peptide was purified on a conventional reverse-phase Vydac C18 silica preparative column using a linear gradient (0-80% B) over 80 min at a flow of 8 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B was 90% acetonitrile/water containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. Sample absorbance was recorded at 230 nm. Highly pure fractions were collected and lyophilized and pure con-G was further lyophilized 3 times from deionized water. ES-MS: [M + H]+ 2264.6 (calculated 2265.2).

Mass spectra were acquired on a PE-SCIEX API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ionspray atmospheric pressure ionization source. Mass spectra were typically acquired in 5-15 min on an Apple Macintosh IIfx computer and processed using the software package MacSpec (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). Interpretation of the spectra was aided by MacBiospec (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). Venom was isolated from the dissected venom ducts of individual C. geographus and C. tulipa collected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (16Jones A. Bingham J.-P. Gehrmann J. Bond T. Loughnan M. Atkins A. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrosc. 1996; 10: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Soluble venom components were extracted with 30% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, freeze-dried, and stored at −20°C. Venom was redissolved in 5% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at ≈1 mg/ml prior to HPLC purification. Comparative HPLC analyses were performed on the native peptides, the synthetic peptides, and a mixture of native and synthetic peptides (1:1). HPLC analyses were performed on an analytical HPLC system (ABI 140B dual syringe pump gradient HPLC system) using a Vydac C18 5-μm column (2.1 × 250 mm). Chromatograms were achieved using a linear gradient of 0-80% B over 160 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B was 90% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. Synthetic samples of con-G and con-T both co-eluted with the native samples (data not shown) which confirmed that the synthetic and native materials were identical. Preparative HPLC was performed immediately on a calcium loaded con-G sample (CaCl2, 6.5 mM) following CD analysis. CD analysis of the repurified peptide showed no helix formation to be present. This is indicated by the lack of minima at 208 and 222 nm (data not shown). Thus HPLC chromatography under acidic conditions is sufficient to remove Ca2+ bound to con-G. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco spectrometer (J-710) with a 0.1-cm path length cuvette at 20°C. Both peptides were dissolved in a 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a 75 μM concentration, for all experiments. The secondary structure was estimated by analysis of the spectrum between 190 and 250 nm. Mean residue ellipticity [θ]MR is expressed in degrees-square centimeter per decamole ((deg·;cm2)/dmol). Experimental estimates of helical contents were determined from the [θ]222 measurements. An estimate of helical content was determined using an equation developed by Chakrabartty et al. (17Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Padmanabhan S. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) (−40,000 (1-2.5/n); n = number of residues), where −40,000 and 0 (deg·;cm2)/dmol are the values for 100% and 0%α-helix, respectively. This equation is used only as a qualitative estimate of peptide helicity. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit. Peptide concentrations were 2 mM. Spectra of con-G were obtained in 95% H2O, 5% D2O with no CaCl2 (pH 5.5), 1:1 (pH 5.5) and 5:1 (pH 3.5 and 5.5) ratios of CaCl2 to peptide, and in 33% TFE. Spectra of con-T were obtained in 95% H2O, 5% D2O with no CaCl2 (pH 5.5) and a 5:1 (pH 5.5) ratio of CaCl2 to peptide, and in 33% TFE. 1H NMR spectra recorded were DQF-COSY (18Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 177: 479-485Crossref Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), NOESY (19Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) with mixing times of 100-300 ms and TOCSY (21Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 65 ms. All spectra were recorded at 280 K, except for some additional spectra at 298 K. Spectra were run over 6024 Hz with 4 K data points, 400-600 free induction decays, 16-64 scans, and a recycle delay of 1 s (1.5 s for DQF-COSY). In NOESY and TOCSY spectra, the solvent was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence (22Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed using UXNMR. Free induction decays were multiplied by a polynomial function and apodized using a 60 or 90° shifted sine-bell function in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. Baseline correction using a fifth polynomial was applied and chemical shift values were referenced externally to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate at 0.00 ppm. 3JNH-Hα coupling constants were measured from high resolution one-dimensional spectra (32 K) and compared to those obtained from the DQF-COSY spectra which were strip transformed to 8K × 1K and extracted using the Lorentzian line-fitting routine in the program Aurelia (Bruker GMBH). Peak volumes in NOESY spectra were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak corresponding to upper bounds on interproton distances of 2.7, 3.5, 5.0, or 6.0 Å, respectively. Lower distance bounds were set to 1.8 Å. Appropriate pseudoatom corrections (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) were made and distances of 1.5 Å and 2.0 Å were added to the upper limits of restraints involving methyl and phenyl protons, respectively. 3JNH-Hα coupling constants were used to determine ϕ dihedral angle restraints (24Pardi A. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated (coordinates have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Databank) using the simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR (25Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3801-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 26Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) version 3.1 using the geometric forcefield, parallhdg.pro. Starting structures were generated using random (ϕ, ψ) dihedral angles and energy minimized (500 steps) to produce structures with correct local geometry. The structures were subjected to a total of 30 ps of high temperature molecular dynamics before cooling and energy minimization (1000 steps). Structure refinements were performed using energy minimization (2000 steps) under the influence of the CHARMM forcefield (27Brooks B. Bruccoleri R. Olafson B.O. States D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar). Structures were compared using pairwise and average RMSDs for the Cα, C, and N atoms (X-PLOR version 3.1) and by calculating angular order parameters for the backbone dihedral angles (28Pallaghy P.K. Duggan B.M. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Hyberts S.G. Goldberg M.S. Havel T.S. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 736-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Structure visualization was performed using INSIGHT II (Biosym Technology Inc.). CD spectra were used as a qualitative gauge of peptide secondary structure. The CD spectra of con-G and con-T both exhibit minima at 208 and 222 nm at high concentrations of CaCl2 (9.2 and 4.5 mM, respectively), which is the characteristic signature for α-helix. Increasing the CaCl2 concentration further did not enhance the α-helix content in either peptide, nor did the addition of 50% TFE to the CaCl2 (9.2 mM) solution of con-G (Fig. 1A). For con-G, there is clearly a CaCl2 concentration dependence. In the absence of CaCl2 almost no helical structure was observed (7%) but on increasing the CaCl2 concentration, the percentage of helical structure rose steadily to a maximum of 45% (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when this experiment was performed with con-T, no CaCl2 concentration dependence was observed. Instead, con-T showed a high degree of helical content (50%) in buffer solution alone (Fig. 1B). Although the addition of CaCl2 did not affect the percentage of α-helix present in con-T, the addition of 50% TFE to a 4.5 mM CaCl2 solution increased the α-helical content to 63%. The same result was obtained in 100% TFE (Fig. 1B). As the conantokin peptides apparently bind to, or affect allosterically, the putative combined polyamine/Mg2+ binding site on the NMDA receptor (30Reynolds I.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1001-1007PubMed Google Scholar, 31Saacan A.I. Johnson K.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 705-710PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine the effects of Mg2+ on the structure of con-G and con-T and to explore the possibility that other positively charged ions could stabilize the structures in the same manner as CaCl2. The CD spectra showing the effects of cation concentration on con-G are given in Fig. 1C. As anticipated, monovalent potassium ion did not stabilize the structure of con-G. On the other hand, Cu2+ stabilizes the peptide as efficiently as Ca2+. Most striking were the effects of Mg2+ and Zn2+, which provided greater stabilization to the con-G structure than Ca2+, with estimated α-helix contents of 68 and 69%, respectively. As seen in Fig. 1D, different cations did not significantly affect the helical content of con-T, which was estimated to be 50%. CD spectra showing the effects of the addition of EDTA to a fixed concentration of peptide (con-G) and CaCl2 are given in Fig. 1E. In this experiment, the degree of α-helix present for con-G in CaCl2 is substantially decreased by the presence of EDTA. This indicates that EDTA chelates some of the CaCl2. However, the minimum α-helix content is greater than that calculated for con-G in buffer alone, even when a large excess of EDTA (20 mM) is added to the CaCl2 solution. Furthermore, it was shown that addition of 3.0 mM EDTA to a con-G solution with no CaCl2 present had no effect on the peptide structure. The CD results show that the structure of con-T is predominantly helical in aqueous buffer and more so in TFE. Cations such as Ca2+, Cu2+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ have no significant effect on the helix content of this peptide (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the structure of con-G, which is not highly helical in buffer, is greatly affected by the presence of Ca2+, presumably with the Gla residues being involved in the Ca2+-binding interaction. For con-G, the degree of helicity correlated to the amount of Ca2+ present. In the presence of excess EDTA, there is apparently substantial Ca2+ which remains chelated to the peptide, either inaccessible to, or in equilibrium with, EDTA. The CD studies show that con-G is selective for divalent cations, with monovalent cations having little influence on the structure of this peptide. No cation selectivity was observed for con-T. This study provides evidence that Mg2+ and Zn2+ induce greater helical content than Ca2+ and Cu2+ in con-G. Due to the large number of residues with similar spin-types the two-dimensional spectra of con-G and, to a lesser extent con-T, are severely overlapped under the conditions used. Despite this, assignment was possible by a careful analysis of NOESY, TOCSY, and DQF-COSY spectra (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). An example of the NOESY spectrum of con-G in H2O showing the sequential assignment is given in Fig. 2. The complete chemical shift assignments of con-G and con-T are supplied as supplementary material. The deviations of Hα chemical shifts from their random coil values provide information on peptide backbone structure (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 32Pastore A. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 165-176Google Scholar). For con-G in H2O, there are some large negative secondary Hα shifts indicative of α-helix from Asn8 to the C terminus (Fig. 3). The magnitude of the secondary shift is greatest in region 9-13. The addition of TFE did not alter the pattern of secondary shift, but greatly enhanced the magnitude of secondary shift for each residue, indicating that the α-helix is stabilized over the entire peptide. Similarly, the addition of CaCl2 to con-G accentuated the negative secondary shifts. At pH 3.5, the secondary shifts of residues 5-6 and 8-9 are enlarged, while at pH 5.5, α-helix is further stabilized over the whole peptide. This is consistent with the Ca2+-induced secondary structure stabilization. Furthermore, since the helix content increased at a higher pH, this suggests that the Ca2+ binds to the negatively charged Gla side chains. The large negative secondary Hα shifts of con-T (Fig. 4) indicate that this peptide is extremely helical, even in H2O (residues 3-21) and more so in TFE (residues 2-21). The effects of Ca2+ on the Hα shifts were minimal, supporting the CD data which clearly indicated that there was no overall structural stabilization in this case. However, an exception to this is the secondary Hα shift of Gla10, which is shifted to a positive value, in the presence of Ca2+ at pH 5.5. It is noteworthy that this is also observed for con-G, under the same conditions. Although this implies helix disruption, it may instead be due to an underestimate of the random coil shift of Gla (this is not available in the literature and the value for Glu was used in its place). A summary of the observed sequential and medium-range NOEs for con-G is given in Fig. 5. No long range NOEs were detected under any of the conditions used. Although many medium-range NOEs (Hα-Hβi+3, Hα-HNi+2, and HαHβi+3) were present, consistent with α-helical secondary structure, the peak overlap meant that it was not possible to detect many NOEs that may be expected based on the extent of α-helix deduced from the chemical shift data. This is most evident in the data collected at pH 5.5 in the presence of Ca2+. In this case, the combined effects of large line widths and peak overlap were deleterious to spectral quality, resulting in few observable connectivities in the NH-Hα region. Increasing the temperature to 298 K sharpened the line widths, however, the accompanying decrease in correlation time resulted in low NOE intensities. Despite this, from decreases in the Hα-NHi+1/NH-NHi+1 ratios, and from the observation of key medium-range NOEs, it is clear that the α-helical content, present over the region encompassed by residues 5-17 in the absence of CaCl2, increased in the presence of CaCl2 to incorporate the entire peptide. In particular, the strengths of the non-overlapped Hα-Hβi+3 NOEs, i.e. from Leu5-Asn8 and Gla10-Gla14 increase significantly in the presence of CaCl2 at pH 5.5. At pH 3.5 and in the presence of CaCl2 there is less difference in NOE strengths compared with con-G at pH 5.5, providing further support that the Gla side chains need to be charged for optimal helix stability and Ca2+ chelation. The two-dimensional spectra of con-T were more dispersed in the NH region"
https://openalex.org/W1994940934,"Estrogen receptors (ER) are ligand-inducible transcription factors regulated by Ser(Thr)-<i>O</i>-phosphorylation. Many transcription factors and eukaryotic RNA polymerase II itself are also dynamically modified by Ser(Thr)-<i>O</i>-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine moieties (<i>O</i>-GlcNAc). Here we report that subpopulations of murine, bovine, and human estrogen receptors are modified by <i>O</i>-GlcNAc. <i>O</i>-GlcNAc moieties were detected on insect cell-expressed, mouse ER (mER) by probing with bovine milk galactosyltransferase, followed by structural analysis. Wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose affinity chromatography also readily detected terminal GlcNAc residues on subpopulations of ER purified from calf uterus, from human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), or from mER produced by <i>in vitro</i> translation. These data suggest that greater than 10% of these populations of estrogen receptors bear <i>O</i>-GlcNAc. Site mapping of insect cell expressed mER localized one major site of <i>O</i>-GlcNAc addition to Thr-575, within a PEST region of the carboxyl-terminal F domain. Based upon their relative resistance to both hexosaminidase and to <i>in vitro</i> galactosylation, <i>O</i>-GlcNAc moieties appear to be largely buried on native mER. This dynamic saccharide modification, like phosphorylation, may play a role in modulating the dimerization, stability, or transactivation functions of estrogen receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2000496244,"We examined the DNA sequence and transcription factor requirements for cAMP-induced transactivation of the human renin promoter using Calu-6 cells that express human renin mRNA endogenously. A series of constructs containing 896 base pairs of human renin 5′-flanking DNA fused to the luciferase gene and containing either the native, a consensus, or a nonfunctional cAMP response element (CRE) were used to assess DNA sequence requirements mediating the cAMP response. Expression vectors encoding the CREB-1 transcription factor, a dominant negative mutant form of CREB-1, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) were used to assess transcription factor requirements mediating the cAMP response. Forskolin treatment alone only caused a 2-3-fold activation of the HREN promoter in Calu-6 cells, but nearly a 10-fold activation in JEG-3 cells, which do not express renin but are highly responsive to cAMP. Gel shift assays revealed the binding of five specific DNA-protein complexes consisting of the ATF-1 and CREB-1 transcription factors, one of which was an ATF-1·;CREB-1 heterodimer suggesting the potential for regulation of CREB-1 activity by ATF-1. However, over-expression of CREB-1 did not significantly enhance forskolin-induced human renin transcriptional activity. Transfection of both Calu-6 and JEG-3 cells with a PKA expression vector resulted in a 10-fold induction of human renin transcriptional activity in constructs containing the native or consensus CRE and 5-fold activation in a construct containing a nonfunctional CRE. We confirmed that the PKA response has both a CREB-dependent and CREB-independent component by demonstrating that the PKA response was abolished by co-transfection of a dominant negative mutant form of CREB-1 into cells containing the native or consensus CRE construct but not in cells containing the nonfunctional CRE construct. We therefore conclude that the human renin promoter can be transcriptionally activated in a renin expressing cell line through the cAMP-PKA pathway and is mediated by both a CREB-dependent and CREB-independent mechanism. We examined the DNA sequence and transcription factor requirements for cAMP-induced transactivation of the human renin promoter using Calu-6 cells that express human renin mRNA endogenously. A series of constructs containing 896 base pairs of human renin 5′-flanking DNA fused to the luciferase gene and containing either the native, a consensus, or a nonfunctional cAMP response element (CRE) were used to assess DNA sequence requirements mediating the cAMP response. Expression vectors encoding the CREB-1 transcription factor, a dominant negative mutant form of CREB-1, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) were used to assess transcription factor requirements mediating the cAMP response. Forskolin treatment alone only caused a 2-3-fold activation of the HREN promoter in Calu-6 cells, but nearly a 10-fold activation in JEG-3 cells, which do not express renin but are highly responsive to cAMP. Gel shift assays revealed the binding of five specific DNA-protein complexes consisting of the ATF-1 and CREB-1 transcription factors, one of which was an ATF-1·;CREB-1 heterodimer suggesting the potential for regulation of CREB-1 activity by ATF-1. However, over-expression of CREB-1 did not significantly enhance forskolin-induced human renin transcriptional activity.

We therefore conclude that the human renin promoter can be transcriptionally activated in a renin expressing cell line through the cAMP-PKA pathway and is mediated by both a CREB-dependent and CREB-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1966096400,"The transcription bubble formed in the binding complex of T7A1 promoter upon Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was analyzed by chemical probes, namely by single-strand specific reagents, to map the unpaired bases in the bubble, and by FeEDTA, to analyze the accessibility of the DNA backbone. The latter probe could also be used as a local hydroxyl radical probe placed close to the Mg2+-binding site in the active center. The data show that the transcription bubble consists of two parts, an Mg2+-dependent part and an Mg2+-independent part, both having individual transition temperatures. The data further suggest that formation of a transcription active open complex is preceded by a transition state complex having enhanced affinity for those Mg2+ ions presumably participating in the formation of the catalytic site. Our data also suggests that the three catalytically active Mg2+ ions in RNA polymerase are functionally not equivalent. One/two of the three Mg2+ ions are responsible for the polymerization, the other two/one for enlargement of the transcription bubble.

One/two of the three Mg2+ ions are responsible for the polymerization, the other two/one for enlargement of the transcription bubble. The transcription bubble is a characteristic attribute of the eubacterial transcription-competent complex. Although no three-dimensional structural information on the transcription bubble is yet available, one can visualize it as a region in which the DNA strands are separated in order to facilitate “reading” of the sequence information for RNA synthesis. The transcription bubble is initially formed upon polymerase binding upstream of the start point of RNA synthesis (1Siebenlist U. Nature. 1979; 279: 651-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Jacobsen J.H. Sausier J.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1225-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Gamper H.B. Hearst J.E. Cell. 1982; 29: 81-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It changes its size and position when RNA synthesis proceeds, as analysis in subsequent steps of RNA synthesis between registers 11 and 20 has revealed (4Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The position of the upstream lagging end of the transcription bubble remains constant in the registers 11-18, while the position of the downstream lagging end moves downstream in accordance with progress of RNA synthesis. In this way the size of the transcription bubble increases from 11 base pairs in the 11-mer complex to 18 base pairs in the 18-mer complex. If RNA synthesis proceeds beyond register 18, the transcription bubble collapses in the upstream region. As a consequence, it shrinks to its initial size of 11 base pairs. While information about the transcription bubble in the RNA synthesizing complex is rather detailed, there is no correspondingly large body of information on the transcription bubble in the binary complex. The concept of the transcription bubble (5vonHippel P.H. Bear D.G. Winter R.B. Berg O.G. Rodriguez R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Promoters: Structure and Function. Praeger, New York1982: 3-31Google Scholar, 6Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Brooks L.K. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umberger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella thaphimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington1987: 1241-1275Google Scholar) was developed from the finding that the transcription active complex, the open complex, is preceded by the closed complex in which the promoter DNA is assumed to be base paired (7Chamberlin M.J. Chamberlin M.J. Losick R. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 159-192Google Scholar). These two complexes are distinguished from each other by their characteristic temperature sensitivity toward heparin. The closed complex exists below 17°C and is heparin-sensitive (8Walter G. Zillig W. Palm P. Fuchs E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 3: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), while the open complex exists above 17°C and is heparin-resistant. The validity of this concept was proven by showing that the temperature dependence of DNA strand separation and heparin sensitivity can be correlated (7Chamberlin M.J. Chamberlin M.J. Losick R. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 159-192Google Scholar, 9Metzger W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Isomerization of the binding complex is a reaction scheme which holds good for most factor-independent promoters. This scheme had to be modified by the finding that the RNA polymerase promoter complex undergoes at least two further isomerization steps before the final transcription active open complex is formed. These transition complexes are the intermediate complex (10Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the Mg2+-independent and the Mg2+-dependent complexes (13Suh W.C. Leirmo S. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7815-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transition state complexes have been defined by kinetic studies in which concentrations of the reactants, temperature, and ionic strength were varied (10Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Suh W.C. Leirmo S. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7815-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is plausible that by lowering the temperature, transition state complexes can be “frozen” and accumulated. However, correspondence between time-dependent and temperature-dependent isomerization steps has not been convincingly demonstrated. Having these reservations in mind, chemical probing studies at different temperatures can provide useful information on structural changes of transition state complexes. It has been shown that RNA polymerase has contact with the promoter in the closed complex from base position −53 to −4 (14Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol.

In the intermediate complex the protected region is extended downstream to position +21 (14Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Probing of the A1 promoter using FeEDTA-generated hydroxyl radicals has revealed that closed and intermediate complexes differ not only in size but also in the kind of interaction. In the closed complex the polymerase faces one side of the DNA (14Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a result which is in line with neutron solution studies (17Heumann H. Lederer H. Baer G. May R.P. Kjems J.K. Crespi H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 210: 115-125Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the intermediate complex, domains of RNA polymerase wrap around the DNA in the region between base position −15 and +18 covering both DNA strands and including the starting point of RNA synthesis (14Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a finding which is in line with information obtained from electron microscope studies (18Darst S.A. Kubalek E.W. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The footprint of the open complex visible above 30°C does not differ from that of the intermediate complex except for a region of the template strand at base position −1 which shows enhanced reactivity toward FeEDTA. It has been suggested by Schickor (14Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that this hyper-reactivity reflects enhanced accessibility of the template strand due to DNA strand separation. Record and colleagues (16Craig M.L. Suh W.-Ch. Record T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) found a similar effect in the Mg2+ containing complex and explained it by a charge effect. We show here that the enhanced cleavage is due to interaction of the FeEDTA probe with the RNA polymerase promoter complex. FeEDTA acts as local hydroxyl radical source, presumably by binding at or near the site occupied by the catalytically active Mg2+, similar to the recent observation with Fe2+ (19Zaychikov E. Martin E. Denissova L. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Kashlev M. Heumann H. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mustaev A. Science. 1996; 273: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A previous study concerned Mg2+-dependence of the transcription bubble of λPr, a promoter which in order to form a transcription active complex, requires supercoiling of the promoter DNA. Our study focuses an the Mg2+ effect on the linear promoter A1. Using this promoter, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase forms a transcription active complex at 37°C with promoter DNA in the relaxed state. In this study three different probes for analysis of unpaired thymidines, adenines, and cytidines were applied, allowing us to determine the size of the transcription bubble precisely within 1 base pair. RNA polymerase was isolated from E. coli as described in Ref. 17Heumann H. Lederer H. Baer G. May R.P. Kjems J.K. Crespi H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 210: 115-125Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Promoter fragment A1-130 containing the sequence of the T7A1 promoter between −69 and +61 was prepared as described (20Heumann H. Lederer H. Kammerer W. Palm P. Metzger W. Baer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 3′-end labeling and 5′-end labeling was performed as described in Ref. 14Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. The radioactivity of the preparations was typically 1 μCi/pmol. For some experiments promoter fragment A1-220 (representing A1 promoter sequence between −96 and +123) was used. End labeling was performed by filling the BamHI termini with deoxy-[α-32P]NTP, subsequent removal of the short fragments near one of the termini with either HaeIII (non-template strand labeling) or AluI (template strand labeling), and final purification of the end-labeled promoter fragment with QIAGEN PCR purification kit. Sequencing ladders were obtained by A+G cleavage with formic acid and A>C cleavage with NaOH (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambroock J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). A1 promoter fragment (1 μg of A1-130 or 2 μg of A1-220 containing typically 105 cpm of the corresponding radioactive fragment) and 12 μg of RNA polymerase were incubated for 5 min at 37°C in 50 μl of 8 mM Hepes, pH 8, containing 6 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed for 1-2 h against proper buffer using the floating membrane filter technique (Millipore, VS 0.025 μm). Hydroxyl radical cleavage was conducted in a similar way as described in Ref. 9Metzger W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar. Three drops, 1.2 μl each, of 2 mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 4 mM EDTA, 3% H2O2, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol were separately placed onto the inner wall of a Eppendorf tube. The cleavage was started by simultaneous mixing of them with 10 μl of binary complex formed as described above. Cleavage was performed for 4 min at 37°C. The reaction mixture was then quickly passed through a nitrocellulose filter (13-mm Sartorius) and washed with 200 μl of 8 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl in order to get rid of free DNA. The DNA was eluted from the filter using a 100-μl solution containing 1% SDS, 0.3 M sodium acetate, and 0.1 mg/ml carrier DNA (15 min at 37°C) and precipitated with 300 μl of ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 80% formamide containing 0.02% bromphenol and xylene cyanol. The solution was heated for 2 min at 95°C and applied on a 8% sequencing gel. As a control, free DNA was cleaved. For that purpose the polymerase promoter complex was destroyed by addition of SDS, final concentration 0.5%, and subsequently subjected to all cleavage reactions, as described above. The reaction was stopped by addition of 15 μl of 2% glycerol, 0.6 M NaAc, 0.1 mg/ml carrier DNA and by precipitation with 90 μl of ethanol. The cleavage with potassium peroxonitrite was performed as described in Ref. 22Götte M. Marquet R. Isel C. Anderson V.E. Keith G. Gross H.J. Ehresmann B. Heumann H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar. Binary complex was dialyzed against 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. One μl of 60 mM KOONO in 0.3 M KOH was added to 20 μl of a solution containing the binary complex (final pH of the solution was pH 8). After 30 s of the incubation (the reaction is finished actually within a few seconds) the carrier DNA was added and the mixture precipitated with ethanol. The reaction was performed in two steps, first the single strand specific reagent was added for modification of the corresponding bases and subsequently the DNA was cleaved at the modified base by applying piperidine. One μl of a freshly prepared solution of 10 mM OsO4, 15 mM bipyridine was added to 10 μl of binary complex. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 min. The cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 0.6 M NaAc, containing 0.1 mg/ml carrier DNA and precipitation with 60 μl of ethanol. One μl of freshly prepared 0.1 M KMnO4 solution was added to 10 μl of binary complex. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 min. The cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 0.6 M NaAc, containing 0.1 mg/ml carrier DNA and precipitation with 60 μl of ethanol. One μl of freshly prepared 3% diethyl pyrocarbonate was added to 10 μl of binary complex. The reaction mixture was incubated for 4 min at 37°C. The cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 50 mM imidazole, 0.6 M NaAc, pH 7, 0.1 mg/ml DNA and precipitation with 60 μl of ethanol. The cleavage was conducted according to Ref. 23Kirkegaard K. Buc H. Spassky A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar. At first, DNA in the binary complex was methylated by addition of 1 μl of 100 mM dimethyl sulfate to 10 μl of the binary complex. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 37°C. The methylation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 0.1 M imidazole, 0.6 M NaAc, containing 0.1 mg/ml carrier DNA. The DNA was precipitated with 60 μl of ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of water. Subsequently 10 μl of 1-butanol and 20 μl of hydrazine were added in order to cleave the methylated cytosines. The reaction mixture was incubated at 0°C for 5 min. After precipitation with ethanol, the DNA was subjected to piperidine treatment. The pellet was dissolved in 90 μl of 10% piperidine and incubated at 90°C for 20 min. Ten μl of 5 M LiCl was then added and DNA precipitated with 300 μl of ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in 5-10 μl of 80% formamide containing 0.02% of bromphenol and xylene cyanol. The samples were heated at 90°C for 2 min, chilled on ice, and then applied on 22 × 50-cm (wedge thickness from 0.2 to 0.4-mm) slab of 6 or 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and 50 mM TBE buffer. Gels were run at 55 W for 1-1.5 h using heating plates (55°C). The gels were incubated for 15 min in 10% acetic acid, then washed twice with water (total washing time: 1 h), dried, and exposed to x-ray film (3 M). For quantification, gels were exposed to Fuji Imager plate BAS IIIS, which was scanned with Bas-1000 PhosphorImager. Scans were processed with MacBas software. Binary complexes were prepared at different temperatures in the presence of MgCl2, as described above. One μl of “initiation mixture” (1 mM ApUpC + 1 mM GTP + 1 mM CTP + 0.1 mM ATP +≈100 nCi [α-32P]ATP) was added to 10 μl of the binary complex and incubated for 5 min at the same temperature (initial experiments have shown that the kinetics is linear for at least 10 min). The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 20 mM EDTA in formamide, and 5 μl was analyzed on 20% sequencing gel. The gel was visualized by PhosphorImager, and the bands corresponding to 20-mer product were quantified. E. coli RNA polymerase was incubated at 37°C with DNA containing the sequence of the strong promoter A1 of the phage T7, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complex was subjected to analysis with two kinds of probes, namely single strand-specific reagents in order to map the transcription bubble, and FeEDTA as a hydroxyl radical source in order to map the RNA polymerase on the DNA. The DNA was subsequently analyzed on a sequencing gel to determine the cleavage sites. Three types of single strand-specific reagents were applied, namely (a) dimethyl sulfate, which methylates cytosines at the N-3 position, thus activating them toward hydrazine (Hz) (23Kirkegaard K. Buc H. Spassky A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); (b) OsO4, which oxidizes thymidines at the C5-C6 double bond (24Palecek E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), (c) diethyl pyrocarbonate, which attacks purines with strong preference for adenines at the N-7 position (25Buckle M. Buc H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4388-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). KMnO4 was also used as an alternative to OsO4. Two sets of experiments were performed with the radioactive label either in the template or in the non-template strand, each consisting of three samples, namely DNA (a) without RNA polymerase as reference, (b) in the complex with RNA polymerase without Mg2+, and (c) in the complex with RNA polymerase and Mg2+. Each of these samples was treated with OsO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and dimethyl sulfate/Hz, then cleaved at the modified nucleotides with piperidine and analyzed on a sequencing gel, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Since dimethyl sulfate modifies guanines with high yield, probing by dimethyl sulfate or Hz alone was included as a control experiment. Fig. 1 shows the results obtained at the template strand (Fig. 1A) and the non-template strand (Fig. 1B). The accessible bases indicated in Fig. 1, A and B, are shown in a schematic representation in Fig. 2. Accessibility is defined here as enhanced reactivity of a base upon polymerase binding. A base pair is considered as being part of the transcription bubble if one of the two complementary bases is accessible.Fig. 2Schematic representation of the accessibility patterns obtained by applying FeEDTA generated hydroxyl radicals and single strand-specific reagents on the binary complex. The results of the patterns determined as described in the legends to Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 are summarized. The modified adenines (A), thymidines (T), and cytidines (C) are displayed in rectangular boxes. The extent of accessibility is indicated by the background, namely fully accessible by white, medium by gray, and non-accessible by black background. Guanines changing their reactivity toward dimethyl sulfate upon polymerase binding are circled. The horizontal bars represent the results of hydroxyl radical footprinting as revealed at Fig. 5. Fully protected regions are marked in black, partly protected in gray. The hyper-sensitive region in the template strand centered at position −1 is indicated by the black rhombi.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the above definition, the pattern obtained by each reagent provided an upper and a lower limit of the transcription bubble at both ends. By combining the results from all three reagents, the bubble could be located accurately within 1 base pair. Fig. 2 shows that the upstream lagging end of the bubble is situated at base position −12 and the downstream lagging end at base position −1, if the incubation of the complex was performed in the absence of Mg2+. Comparison of the accessibility patterns with and without Mg2+ (Fig. 2) shows that Mg2+ has two effects. In the presence of Mg2+ the transcription bubble is enlarged downstream to base position +2 and the interaction between RNA polymerase and DNA is enhanced, as indicated by a reduced modification of some bases. Thus A(−4) and A(−6) in the non-template strand (Fig. 1B) are protected in the Mg2+ containing complex and modified in the Mg2+ free complex. The thymidine at base position −8 in the non-template strand shows a similar, although less pronounced, effect to that observed with the adenines mentioned above. T(−8) is moderately accessible for OsO4 in the Mg2+ free complex and not accessible in the Mg2+ containing complex. There is an exception to this scheme. Cytidine at position −3 in the template strand is inaccessible without Mg2+ and moderately accessible if Mg2+ is added. Guanine is the only base for which no probe has been suggested which would allow a differentiation between paired or unpaired state. Dimethyl sulfate is assumed to methylate guanines irrespective of whether they are base paired or not. Our probing studies using dimethyl sulfate alone show that this is not correct. Dimethyl sulfate has a preference for guanines in the single stranded region, as indicated by the improved cleavage of G(−3) in the non-template strand and G(−1) and G(−2) in the template strand, as the patterns in Fig. 1, A and B, show. G(−9) in the template strand deviates from the pattern described above in that it is protected, while the complementary C(−9) is accessible. This might be due to a similar effect to that observed with A(−4) and A(−6). These bases are fully or partly protected, although the complementary base is accessible, reflecting perhaps improved interaction with RNA polymerase. G(−5) at the template strand is not affected at all by RNA polymerase binding, either in the presence or absence of Mg2+. It is interesting to note that some of the guanines located outside of the transcription bubble show differences in the accessibility depending on whether Mg2+ is present or not. G(−13) and G(−14) in the non-template strand are protected, indicating strong interaction of these bases with RNA polymerase. It is surprising that G(+12) in the template strand is enhanced, although this base is not part of the transcription bubble according to the criteria developed above. We assume that this is due to distortion, perhaps bending of the DNA. The mapping studies on the transcription bubble in the previous paragraph allowed differentiation between two parts of the transcription bubble, namely an Mg2+-independent part reaching from base position −12 to −1 and an Mg2+-dependent part reaching from base position +1 to +2. In order to analyze whether the two parts show different melting behaviors, the Mg2+ containing complex was analyzed in the temperature range from 4 to 37°C. For the purpose of this analysis, it was sufficient to probe only the accessibility of thymidines, since the Mg2+ dependent part of the transcription bubble comprising the bases at position +1 and +2 (see Fig. 2) consists of AT pairs only. The binding complex was formed in the presence of Mg2+, as described above, and subjected to treatment with KMnO4 or OsO4 at the temperatures indicated. The resulting accessibility patterns obtained at the non-template strand and the template strand are shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. 4A, respectively.Fig. 4Temperature dependence of the thymidines accessibility in the template strand. The lanes show the accessibility patterns of thymidines in the temperature interval between 0 and 45°C, as indicated, by applying KMnO4. All other conditions are the same, as described in the legend to Fig. 3 for the non-template strand. The plot in C shows a quantification of the accessibility studies on the template strand using the same promoter A1 but upon binding of polymerase from T. maritima, a thermophilic organism. The data were taken from Ref. 26Meier T. Schikor P. Wedel A. Cellai L. Heumann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The thymidine patterns obtained at different temperatures were quantified and the resulting intensities were plotted, in Fig. 3B for the template strand and in Fig. 4B for the non-template strand. The plot revealed that the thymidines have different transition temperatures (Tm) which are compiled in Table I along with the corresponding enthalpies (ΔH). Two groups of thymidines could be identified according to their transition temperatures, namely thymidines belonging to the Mg2+-dependent and those belonging to the Mg2+-independent part of the transcription bubble. The transition temperatures of the thymidines in the Mg2+-independent part are between Tm = 10-15°C, while those of the Mg2+-dependent part are shifted to higher temperature by about 15°C, as shown in Table I. The positive enthalpy values for the transition indicate that the formation of the transcription bubble is enthalpy driven, in line with a suggestion from Suh et al. (13Suh W.C. Leirmo S. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7815-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Table ITransition temperatures (T1/2) and free energy (ΔH) for unpaired thymidines in the Mg2+ containing complexT1/2ΔH°CkJE. coliTemplate strandT(+1)29.4 ± 1.0122 ± 17T(−4) + T(−6)15.6 ± 1.5105 ± 23T(−10) + T(−12)11.3 ± 1.5119 ± 25Non-template strandT(−11)10.6 ± 3.0151 ± 61T(−7)11.4 ± 0.5255 ± 34T(+2)22.4 ± 0.8188 ± 34Initial RNA synthesis activity32.4 ± 0.9107T. maritimaTemplate strandT(−10) + T(−12)45 ± 1240 ± 30T(−4) + T(−6)70 ± 5140 ± 80 Open table in a new tab It is interesting to note that the base at the starting point of RNA synthesis, T(+1), has a transition temperature of Tm = 29°C, whereas T(+2) located further downstream has a lower transition temperature of Tm = 22°C. In this context it is worth noting that the temperature dependent accessibility of T(+1) correlates with the temperature dependence of the initiation reaction for RNA synthesis, as shown in Fig. 4B. In order to analyze whether charge or shielding effects, especially in the presence of Mg2+, influence the cleavage pattern, we compared the patterns obtained with KMnO4 and OsO4. Both reagents attack the same positions of thymidines, but have different charges and sizes. Probing of the thymidines of the non-template strand using both probes (Fig. 3A) revealed that the pattern is qualitatively the same but differs quantitatively. When KMnO4 is used, the yield of cleavage is generally higher, and moreover cleavage of T(−12) in the template strand is more pronounced. Otherwise no difference was observed between the two reagents with respect to temperature or Mg2+ dependence of the transcription bubble. For comparison purposes, the transition temperatures of the Mg2+-dependent and the Mg2+-independent part of the transcription bubble of another eubacterial RNA polymerase, Thermotoga maritima, a thermophilic organism, was included in Fig. 4C. The data were taken from a previously published study (26Meier T. Schikor P. Wedel A. Cellai L. Heumann H.

https://openalex.org/W2040506200,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNAs encoding structural proteins contain multiple inhibitory/instability elements (INS), which decrease the efficiency of viral protein expression. We have previously identified a strong INS element (INS-1) within the p17gag coding region. Here we show that poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) binds preferentially to INS-1 within the p17gag mRNA, but not to a mutated mRNA in which INS-1 function is eliminated. Competition experiments performed in the presence of different nucleic acids and homoribopolymers demonstrated preferential binding of PABP1 to the INS-1-containing RNA. In contrast to HeLa cells and several lymphoid cell lines, certain human glioma cell lines exhibit high levels of gag expression in the absence of Rev upon transient transfection with wild type gag expression vectors. We analyzed extracts of different cell lines and found that the binding of PABP1 to INS-1 RNA is significantly diminished in glial cell extracts. The expression levels of gag correlate with the absence of binding of PABP1 to the INS-1 RNA in cellular extracts. These results suggest a role for PABP1 in the inhibition of gag expression mediated through INS-1."

We have also found that intracellular Ca2+ levels and protein kinase C activity are requisite participants in this potentially pathogenic process. In these studies, we further investigated the mechanisms involved in the oxidation of LDL lipids by activated human monocytes, particularly the potential contributions of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) signaling pathway. The most well-studied cPLA2, has a molecular mass of 85 kDa and has been reported to be regulated by both Ca2+ and phosphorylation. We found that cPLA2 protein levels and cPLA2 enzymatic activity were induced upon activation of human monocytes by opsonized zymosan. Pharmacologic inhibition of cPLA2 activity by AACOCF3, which has been reported to be a specific inhibitor of cPLA2 as compared with sPLA2, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cPLA2 enzymatic activity and LDL lipid oxidation by activated human monocytes, whereas sPLA2 activity was not affected. To corroborate these findings, we used specific antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit cPLA2. We observed that treatment with antisense oligonucleotides caused suppression of both cPLA2 protein expression and enzymatic activity as well as monocyte-mediated LDL lipid oxidation. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide treatment caused a substantial inhibition of O2·¯production by activated human monocytes. In parallel experimental groups, cPLA2 sense oligonucleotides did not affect cPLA2 protein expression, cPLA2 enzymatic activity, O2·¯production, or monoctye-mediated LDL lipid oxidation.

The protein, solubilized with detergent (3-[cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid or cholate), was purified to near-homogeneity by a single nickel-chelate chromatography step. The Kv1.3 protein expressed in vaccinia virus-infected cells and its purified counterpart are both modified by a ∼2-kDa core-sugar moiety, most likely at a conserved N-glycosylation site in the external S1-S2 loop; absence of the sugar does not alter the biophysical properties of the channel nor does it affect expression levels. Purified Kv1.3 has an estimated size of ∼64 kDa in denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, consistent with its predicted size based on the amino acid sequence. By sucrose gradient sedimentation, purified Kv1.3 is seen primarily as a single peak with an approximate mass of 270 kDa, compatible with its being a homotetrameric complex of the ∼64-kDa subunits. When reconstituted in the presence of lipid and visualized by negative-staining electron microscopy, the purified Kv1.3 protein forms small crystalline domains consisting of tetramers with dimensions of ∼65 × 65 Å. The center of each tetramer contains a stained depression which may represent the ion conduction pathway.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Four families of mammalian genes, Kv1-Kv4, comprising 19 members, encode a diversity of Kv channels (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Each of these proteins contains 500-600 amino acids, typically long N and C termini, six putative transmembrane segments (S1-S6), and an additional membrane-associated loop (P-region) between S5 and S6. Several functional domains have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis in these Kv proteins (see Ref. 2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar), and the outer vestibule of the pore has been topologically mapped using structurally defined high affinity scorpion toxins as molecular calipers (3Aiyar J.

The Drosophila Shaker protein has been transiently expressed at high levels in COS cells, but the poor transfection efficiency (10% of cells express protein) precludes its use as a reliable source for protein purification (7Sun T. Naini A.A. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9992-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although expression with the baculovirus system has been more efficient, yields from this system have still been insufficient (8Li M. Unwin N. Stauffer K.A. Jan Y. Jan L.Y. Curr.

In addition, the quality of the overexpressed protein is seriously compromised since a significant portion of this protein is localized within inclusion bodies, rendering it insoluble in nondenaturing detergent, and very little of the protein is glycosylated (7Sun T.

Lipid-bilayer reconstitution of these purified channels for biophysical characterization has not been demonstrated.The goals of this study are as follows: (a) to characterize a mammalian heterologous overexpression system for the purification of appropriately glycosylated, membrane-associated mammalian Kv1 protein; (b) to determine the biophysical properties of purified Kv1 protein reconstituted into lipid bilayers; and (c) to verify the tetrameric nature of the channel using sucrose density sedimentation and negative-staining electron microscopy. The Kv protein we have used for this analysis is Kv1.3, which represents the type “n” channel of T-lymphocytes, and regulates the membrane potential of these cells (11Grissmer S. Dethlefs B.

Utilizing this expression system, recombinant Kv1.3 protein was purified to near-homogeneity from a membrane fraction, and this protein appeared biochemically uniform, bearing a core glycosylation moiety and associating as an apparent tetramer. Additionally, this protein produced voltage-dependent, K(-selective, MgTX- and ShK-sensitive currents when reconstituted into lipid bilayers and formed small crystalline domains, visible by electron microscopy, composed of 65 × 65-Å tetramers.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents, Cell Lines, VirusesRestriction Enzymes and ReagentsThe VV transfer vector, pTM1, was a gift from Dr. Bernard Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Reagents used in these experiments included the following: restriction enzymes, CHAPS, and imidazole (Boehringer Mannheim), Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), chelating-Sepharose and Mono Q columns (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), sodium cholate, tunicamycin C2 analog, tetraethylammonium, and protease inhibitors (Sigma). [35S]L-Methionine (1175Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Margatoxin (MgTX) was purchased from BACHEM (King of Prussia, PA), and stichodactylatoxin (ShK) and kaliotoxin (KTX) from Peptides International (Louisville, KY).AntibodiesA horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse monoclonal antibody (Ab) specific for a 12-residue epitope derived from gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 (T7-Tag, also referred to as anti-gene 10 Ab) was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI), and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG was obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).Cell Lines and Vaccinia VirusesAfrican Green monkey kidney cells (CV-1), rat basophilic leukemic (RBL) cells, the WR strain of VV, and the recombinant VV which expresses T7 RNA polymerase under control of the p7.5 VV promoter (vTF7-3 or VV:T7; 17) were acquired from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). CV-1 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. RBL cells were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mML-glutamine.Vaccinia Virus for the Heterologous Expression of Kv1.3 Protein in Mammalian CellsGeneration of VV:Kv1.3 Construct and Recombination into Vaccinia—We generated the pTH1 vector by inserting a 144-base pair NcoI/HindIII fragment (the HindIII site was blunt-ended by a fill-in reaction) from the pTrcHis vector (a kind gift from Dr. Leonard Wittwer of the Invitrogen Corp., Sorrento Valley, CA) into the pTM1 vector (17Elroy-Stein O.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) at NcoI/StuI sites. The 144-base pair insert contained sequences coding for an initiator methionine followed by a hexahistidine repeat, a serologically detectable epitope from bacteriophage T7 (gene 10), an enterokinase cleavage site, and a multiple cloning site. The coding region was flanked by a T7 promoter and terminator, and the 5′-noncoding region was derived from encephalomyocarditis virus which provides an internal ribsome binding site for efficient translation initiation. The protein coding region of mouse Kv1.3 gene was inserted into pTH1 as a 2-kilobase BglII/EcoRI fragment excised from the pMK3T construct (11Grissmer S. Dethlefs B. Wasmuth J.J. Goldin A.L.

A. 1990; 87: 9411-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the integrity of the construct was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. We recombined the Kv1.3-pTH1 plasmid into VV to generate the VV:Kv1.3 recombinant using standard methods (19Karschin A. Thorne B.A. Thomas G. Lester H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 408-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Dual Infection of CV-1 CellsCV-1 or RBL cells were doubly infected with 5-10 multiplicity of infection of VV:Kv1.3 and VV:T7 (see 19); in these cells, T7 RNA polymerase synthesis controlled by the VV early p7.5 promoter leads to T7-mediated transcription and Kv1.3 protein production. After 2-16 h, the cells were subjected to either patch clamp or immunofluorescence analysis or were harvested for protein purification.Assessment of Levels of Kv1.3 Expression in CV-1 CellsElectrophysiologyPatch-clamp experiments were carried out in either whole-cell or outside-out patch configuration. The external mammalian Ringer solution contained in mM: 160 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. The internal pipette solution contained in mM: 140 KF, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 11 K2-EGTA. Biophysical and pharmacological studies were performed as described previously for native Kv1.3 (11Grissmer S. Dethlefs B. Wasmuth J.J. Goldin A.L. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence AnalysisThe anti-gene 10 Ab was used for cellular localization of Kv1.3. The specificity of this Ab was determined by Western blotting and peptide competition (data not shown), the expected size of the Kv1.3 protein being ∼64 kDa. At selected times cells were pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 4% paraformaldehyde, and placed on ice for 10 min. A firm cell pellet was made by spinning the cells at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After an additional incubation on ice for 30 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was gently removed from the microcentrifuge tube and infiltrated with 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.3 M sucrose overnight at 40C. Thick 0.5-μm cryosections of the pellets were prepared (21Milici A.J. Porter G.A. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 19: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and then incubated with the anti-gene 10 Ab or control mouse IgG (1:100) for 1 h followed by incubation with 5 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. Exposure-matched fluorescence micrographs were taken on a Nikon FXA microscope.Purification of Kv1.3Solubilization of Membrane ProteinCV-1 cells, coinfected with VV:Kv1.3 and VV:T7, were harvested 24 h postinfection using Versene buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mM EDTA, 0.0015% phenol red). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of hypo-osmotic lysing buffer (2 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Cells were Dounce-homogenized (Kontes pestel A) and centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min. The low-speed pellet was retained, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentifugation at 108,000 × g for 40 min to collect small cellular membranes. The low- and high-speed pellets were combined and solubilized for 1 h with rotation at 40C in Native buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM KCl, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and containing either 2% CHAPS or 1.5% cholate). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 106,000 × g for 15 min at 40C.Nickel-Chelate ChromatographyAll chromatography was performed using the SMART System (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Chelating Sepharose was bound with nickel as recommended by the manufacturer and then washed with 10 column volumes of Native buffer. After loading the solubilized protein, the column was washed with Native buffer to an A280 <0.02. The column was then washed with a High Salt buffer (1 M KCl, 50 mM imidazole, 2% CHAPS, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) to elute proteins which bind to the column through nonspecific ionic interactions, and washing was continued to an A280 <0.02. Elution of Kv1.3 protein from the column was performed using a linear gradient of imidazole (50-500 mM) in Native buffer. The protein peak containing Kv1.3 (at ∼300 mM imidazole) was identified by dot blot chemiluminescence using the anti-gene 10 Ab.SDS-PAGE, Protein Detection, and QuantitationSDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted in an equal volume of buffer (7.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 14.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto the gel without heating (to prevent the formation of large, insoluble aggregates). For immunoblots, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electrotransfer in Towbin buffer (192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, 10% methanol). Immunoblots were performed by spotting 1-μl samples onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK) being used for detection of the immune complexes. For quantitative immunoblotting, the scanned image was analyzed by NIH image (23Rasband W. NIH Image. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda1995Google Scholar). The positive control gene 10-extract (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as a standard assuming 65% purity.Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels was performed by the diamine staining method (24Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Quantification of protein was determined by A280, by the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce) and by quantitative chemiluminescence blotting (using anti-gene 10 Ab).Glycosylation of Kv1.3For [35S]methionine labeling, dually infected CV-1 cells were incubated in methionine-deficient minimum Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (C2 analog). After 12 h, cells were washed, harvested, and solubilized in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0). To immunoprecipitate the Kv1.3 protein, cell nuclei were first pelleted and the supernatant precleared with 5 mg of protein-A Sepharose beads. One microliter of the anti-gene 10 Ab was then added and incubated for 1 h at (40C, and then 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads were added for another hour. The protein A-Sepharose was washed with RIPA buffer three times and resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer (see above). Samples were analyzed by fluorography following SDS-PAGE separation on a 10% polyacrylamide gel.In vitro deglycosylation was performed using N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were diluted in buffer containing 35 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 5 mM EDTA, followed by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.2%. After 1 h at room temperature, an equal volume of phosphate/EDTA buffer with 5% Nonidet P-40 was added along with 0.4 units of N-glycosidase F, and the mixture was incubated at 370C overnight. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted as described above.Determining the Multimeric Nature of Kv1.3Sucrose Density—One-half milligram of each protein standard (apoferritin, alcohol dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase) and ∼10 μg of purified Kv1.3 were layered on top of a 5-50% sucrose gradient (volume of ∼12 ml) containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and either 1.0% CHAPS or 0.6% cholate. Samples were centrifuged for 14 h at 220,000 × g (200C) and 10-drop fractions were subsequently collected. To determine which fractions contained Kv1.3, 10 μl of each sample was filtered onto nitrocellulose using a slot blot apparatus and immunoblotted as described above. The scanned image of the negative was then analyzed with NIH Image (24Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) to quantitate the optical density of each spot. To visualize the protein standards, 15 μl of each fraction was loaded with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer, run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel then stained with Coomassie Blue.The mass of Kv1.3 was estimated as described by Martin and Ames (25Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sedimentation rates of proteins on continuous sucrose gradients are related to molecular masses by the equation S1/S2 = (MW1/MW2)2/3, where S1 and S2 are the distances travelled by two proteins, and MW1 and MW2 are their molecular masses (25Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We solved this equation for Kv1.3 relative to each protein standard and plotted each value against the molecular mass of the standard; the slope of the resulting line represents the estimated mass of Kv1.3.Negative Staining EM of “Crystalline” Kv1.3 ProteinThe purified Kv1.3 protein in CHAPS was reconstituted with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine at a lipid-to-protein ratio of 1:1 (w/w) and a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the detergent was slowly removed by dialysis (26Jap B.K.

Biol. 1995; 251: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, a carbon-coated electron microscope grid was glow-discharged for 2 min prior to the application of 2 μl of a Kv1.3 crystalline patch. The sample was kept on the grid for about 1 min before blotting with filter paper to remove excess buffer and left to air-dry. Samples were then coated with 1.5% uranyl acetate.Biophysical Characterization of Lipid Bilayer Reconstituted and Purified Kv1.3 ProteinPurified Kv1.3 was reconstituted into small unilamellar vesicles using previously published methods (28Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. Kreman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8468-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC/PE (2:1) solubilized in 60 mM CHAPS or cholate was added to 100-μl aliquots of purified Kv1.3 to obtain a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:1000, and then dialyzed overnight in a Slide-a-lyzer (Pierce) dialysis chamber against 3 liters of buffer containing 200 mM KCl and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Aliquots were stored at (200C prior to use.Bilayers were formed in Teflon chambers divided into two compartments, each having a volume of 2 ml. The compartments were separated by a 20 μm-thick Teflon partition with a ∼200-μm hole pretreated with approximately 0.5 μl of squalene (Atomergic Chemicals Corporation, Plainview, NY) (29Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 30Hall J.E. Vodyanoy I. Balasubramanian T.M. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 233-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). With the aqueous solutions below the hole, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL), dried under argon, and dissolved in pentane (Aldrich) was spread over the aqueous phase. To form the bilayers, the solutions in the compartments were slowly raised above the level of the hole. Following bilayer formation (monitored by capacitance increase), an aliquot of reconstituted Kv1.3 protein was added to the high KCl (cis) side of the cell, and both chambers were stirred by magnetic fleas to promote vesicle interaction with the bilayer. The bilayer was voltage-clamped by an AXOPATCH 200 A controlled by an 80286 computer driving an Interactive Microware (State College, PA) ADALAB interface board controlled by locally written software.

Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Each of these proteins contains 500-600 amino acids, typically long N and C termini, six putative transmembrane segments (S1-S6), and an additional membrane-associated loop (P-region) between S5 and S6. Several functional domains have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis in these Kv proteins (see Ref. 2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels.

The Drosophila Shaker protein has been transiently expressed at high levels in COS cells, but the poor transfection efficiency (10% of cells express protein) precludes its use as a reliable source for protein purification (7Sun T.

In addition, the quality of the overexpressed protein is seriously compromised since a significant portion of this protein is localized within inclusion bodies, rendering it insoluble in nondenaturing detergent, and very little of the protein is glycosylated (7Sun T.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The enzyme is present throughout the evolutionary phyla, and the amino acid sequence is highly conserved from bacteria to humans (2Brady T.G. O'Donovan C.I. Comp. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting it is a key enzyme in purine metabolism. In mice, the levels of ADA differ as much as 10,000-fold among various tissues with the highest levels occurring in the deciduum, chorioallantoic placenta, tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and proximal small intestine; intermediate levels are found in the thymus and low levels in other tissues (4Chinsky J.M.

Although the physiological role that ADA plays in these tissues is not clear, it is thought that ADA prevents accumulation of the cytotoxic metabolite deoxyadenosine, which interferes with deoxynucleotide metabolism and/or disrupts cellular transmethylation reactions (9Carson D.A.

These disturbances result in apoptosis or disrupt cell differentiation.Mounting evidence indicates that maintaining high levels of ADA in the placenta is essential for embryonic and fetal development. During placentation in mice, ADA appears at 7.5 days post coitum (dpc) in trophoblast giant cells surrounding the embryo and in diploid trophoblast precursor cells in the ectoplacental cone (6Knudsen T.B.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression of Ada increases as the placenta develops. At 13.5 dpc when the placenta is mature, ADA appears in all trophoblast lineages, including trophoblast giant cells surrounding the gestation site, spongiotrophoblast cells in the junctional zone, and syncytial trophoblast cells in the labyrinth zone. By this time, greater than 95% of the ADA enzymatic activity found at the gestation site resides in the trophoblasts of the placenta (7Knudsen T.B. Blackburn M.R. Chinsky J.M. Airhart M.J.

This importance is revealed by a series of mouse genetic experiments. ADA-deficient mice die perinatally of severe liver damage, brought on by profound disturbances in purine metabolism (15Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J.

The concentrations of adenosine and deoxyadenosine increase 3- and 1000-fold, respectively, in ADA-deficient fetuses, while levels of inosine decrease. These metabolic disturbances are not evident until 12.5 dpc, coinciding with the lack of Ada expression in the placenta (15Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Montgomery C.A. Bradley A. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). By genetically restoring Ada expression specifically to the placenta, most of the purine metabolic disturbances in the fetus are prevented (17Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Deoxyadenosine levels were lowered over 30-fold in ADA-deficient fetuses and severe fetal liver damage was prevented. As a result, ADA-deficient mice were rescued from the perinatal lethality (17Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, activating Ada gene expression in the placenta is critical for proper fetal development.Studying Ada gene expression in the placenta will not only enhance our appreciation of placental ADA, but also contribute to our knowledge of trophoblast differentiation. ADA is an early marker of trophoblast cell differentiation. Unlike other trophoblast-specific genes, whose expression is restricted to one cell type (19Carney E.W. Prideaux V. Lye S.J. Rossant J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Campbell M.L. Larsen D. Deb S. Kwok S.C.M. Soares M.J.

Biol. 1990; 141: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), ADA appears in all trophoblast lineages. Thus, the Ada gene may contain regulatory elements operable at all stages of trophoblast differentiation and in all three cell types, representing a good system to study trophoblast gene regulation. Starting with 6.4-kb 5′-flanking sequences, which direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression to the placenta prenatally (and forestomach postnatally) in transgenic mice (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have localized the placenta-specific regulatory element to a 770-bp fragment 5.4 kb upstream of the Ada transcription initiation site using transgenic mice as an assay system. The speed and the efficiency of this analysis were increased by examining expression of transgenes in placentas 14 days following zygote microinjection. In situ hybridization showed CAT reporter gene expression in the same cell types that expressed ADA. Sequence analysis and DNase I footprinting experiments revealed both general and placenta-specific protein binding sites within this region. Deletions and site-specific mutations of potential protein binding sites within this 770-bp fragment resulted in loss of placenta-specific expression, suggesting that multiple factors function together to ensure proper Ada expression in the placenta.DISCUSSIONAs part of our effort to understand the physiological importance of placental ADA in prenatal development, we wish to identify signaling pathways that govern the temporal and cellular expression of the murine Ada gene during placental development. Our approach involved the use of a relatively convenient and rapid transgenic assay in which the expression of ADA/CAT reporter genes was determined in transgenic placentas 14 days following zygote microinjection. The data here represent the identification and detailed analysis of a 770-bp sequence located approximately 5.4 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the murine Ada gene, which, in combination with an 800-bp region containing the Ada promoter, is sufficient to target reporter gene expression to the placentas in transgenic mice. In the absence of the placental regulatory element, no detectable CAT activity is produced from the Ada promoter in either the placenta or embryo, and the combination of the two regions directs expression only to the placenta and not to other tissues. Because the Ada promoter can be highly activated in a variety of unrelated cell types (trophoblasts, gastrointestinal epithelium, uterine decidual cells, and thymocytes), we believe that trophoblast specificity lies with the 770-bp upstream regulatory element. Consistent with this view are unpublished data indicating that the 770-bp fragment can activate heterologous promoters in a placenta-specific manner. 2D. Shi, unpublished observations. The Ada placental regulatory element is capable of directing reporter gene expression in all trophoblast lineages and in a manner that coincides with the appearance of endogenous ADA transcripts in this cell lineage (6Knudsen T.B.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the Ada placental regulatory element contains regulatory motifs capable of functioning in all three murine trophoblast lineages and at the correct developmental time.DNase I footprinting experiments determined that protein(s) present in placenta nuclear extracts bind to the 770-bp fragment at three places, termed FP1, FP2, and FP3. FP1 binds proteins present in nuclear extracts from placenta but not liver, suggesting that the protein/DNA interaction is placenta-specific. Deletion of FP1 resulted in loss of placenta-specific expression, indicating that sequence motifs within this region are required for placenta-specific expression. Inspection of the FP1 sequence revealed that it contains two motifs similar to the consensus sequence for the trophoblast-specific element-binding protein, TSEB (34Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H.

This protein is present in the human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 and binds the TSE that is part of the cis-regulatory sequence required for the enhanced expression of the human gonadotropin α and β subunit genes and the aromatase gene in that cell type (34Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S. Takagi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25064-25069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although mouse placenta does not produce gonadotropin, it is possible that a murine equivalent of TSEB is participating in the regulation of the Ada gene in the mouse placenta. The other footprinting regions, FP2 and FP3, bind proteins present in both liver and placenta nuclear extracts, and they presumably involve widely distributed proteins that may play supporting roles in achieving tissue-specific gene expression. The importance of FP3 in the Ada placental regulatory element was revealed by a deletion mutant that removed 34 bp, including a portion of FP3, from the 3′ end of the Ada placental regulatory element. Transgenic animals carrying this deleted transgene failed to show placenta-specific expression. This finding suggests that in addition to placenta-specific factors associated with FP1, other more generally expressed factors associated with FP3 are required for placenta-specific expression. These features of the Ada placental regulatory element are consistent with the concept that cell specificity is achieved in part by tissue-specific regulatory elements and in part by regulatory elements that bind more widely distributed proteins.Although the footprinted regions represent good candidates for functional components of the placental regulatory element, the lack of observable footprints over other regions does not exclude the possibility that other factors of functional importance may bind in vivo. Moreover, since the entire placenta was used to prepare nuclear extracts, regulatory proteins present in small populations of cells, such as the giant cells, may not have been sufficiently concentrated to be detected in this assay. In view of these potential limitations of footprint assays, the sequence of the Ada placental regulatory element was closely examined to identify sequence motifs common to other trophoblast-specific genes. At the 5′ end, the sequence from 57 to 103 bp shows high homology to the human placental lactogen enhancer footprinting regions DF3 and DF4. DF3 and DF4 bind nuclear proteins and mediate a synergistic trophoblast-specific enhancer activity in JEG-3 cells (30Jacquenmin P. Oury C. Peers B. Morin A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homology between the human placental lactogen enhancer and the Ada placental regulatory element suggests that similar factors may be involved in the placenta-specific expression of each gene. The potential importance of the human placental lactogen homology region is underscored by the fact that it lies within an essential 240-bp region at the 5′ end of the Ada placental regulatory element. The Ada placental regulatory element also contains five binding sites for bHLH proteins (35Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Two bHLH sites lie within the human placental lactogen homology region and may represent critical components of the conserved sequence. Two bHLH factors, Mash-2 and Hxt, are specifically implicated in gene regulation during trophoblast development (39Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Aderson D.J.

Mash-2 is found in both trophoblast precursors and spongiotrophoblasts and is essential for spongiotrophoblast development (39Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Aderson D.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar–41Guillemot F. Nagy A. Auerbach A. Rossant J. Joyner A. Nature. 1994; 371: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Hxt is present in early trophoblasts and in differentiated giant cells and can induce commitment of blastomeres to trophoblasts (42Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar–44Cserjesi P. Brown D. Lyons G.E. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 664-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although specific target genes of Mash-2 and Hxt have not been identified, available evidence favors an important role for these proteins in regulation of trophoblast gene expression. A potential role for bHLH factors in the regulation of Ada gene expression is consistent with the fact that four of the five bHLH sites found in the Ada placental regulatory element are present within the critical 240-bp fragment at the 5′ end. Additional experiments are required to specifically assess the importance of bHLH proteins in the regulation of Ada gene expression in trophoblasts.There are two centrally located GATA sites in the Ada placental regulatory element. GATA factors are zinc finger transcription factors that play a pivotal role in hematopoiesis and erythroid gene expression (45Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.-F. D'Agati V.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two members of this gene family, GATA-2 and GATA-3, are found in trophoblasts of the placenta (37Ng Y. George K.M. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I.H. Development. 1994; 120: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52George K.M. Leonard M.W. Roth M.E. Lieuw K.H. Kiossis D. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Development. 1994; 120: 2673-2686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GATA motif is part of the trophoblast-specific enhancer that regulates the human chorionic gonadotropin α subunit gene expression in JEG-3 cells (36Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GATA factors are also involved in trophoblast-specific expression of mouse placental lactogen I gene in rat Rcho-1 cells (37Ng Y. George K.M. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I.H. Development. 1994; 120: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possible involvement of GATA factors in regulating Ada expression in the placenta was investigated by introducing point mutations into each of the GATA motifs. Lack of CAT activity in placentas harboring such mutant transgenes suggests that GATA factors are required to activate the Ada gene in the placenta. GATA factors may be essential for activation of the Ada gene expression in the ectoplacental cone and/or maintaining Ada gene expression in all branches of the trophoblast population.The evidence that Ada placental regulatory element is composed of a series of distinct genetic regulatory motifs suggests that a combination of multiple transcription factors are required for Ada expression in the mature placenta. These potential factors include bHLH factors, GATA factors, TSEB, and other ubiquitously expressed factors. Identification of these factors and characterization of their function in Ada expression are currently under way. It is possible that different set of transcription factors are required for Ada expression at different stages during placenta development. Some of these factors may be involved in activation of Ada in the ectoplacental cone, some may participate in maintaining high levels of Ada expression in one or multiple trophoblast lineages.In addition to placental trophoblasts, the murine Ada gene is also expressed at high levels in several diverse cell types (4Chinsky J.M.

Ada is expressed at intermediate levels in the thymus and low levels in most other tissues (2Brady T.G. O'Donovan C.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1965; 14: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knusen T.B. Kellems R.E. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that the Ada placental regulatory element is capable of directing enhanced expression only to the placenta, suggesting that it is functionally independent from other tissue-specific regulatory elements. Since the original 6.4-kb 5′-flanking region also directs reporter gene expression to the forestomach postnatally (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that the placenta and forestomach regulatory elements are distinct. In this regard, recent experiments have identified a distinct and completely independent regulatory region located approximately 1 kb downstream of the placental regulatory element capable of directing expression specifically to the forestomach. 3P. Xu, unpublished observations. A regulatory region in intron 1 functions to direct enhanced CAT expression to the thymus (53Aronow B.J. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J.

Genet. 1996; 22: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This same region also produces low levels of expression in most tissues of transgenic mice, suggesting that it contains regulatory elements that contribute to the ubiquitous expression of the Ada gene (56Winston J.H. Hong L. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent results with the intron 1 regulatory region indicate that the ubiquitous elements do not require the thymus-specific elements to function (56Winston J.H. Hong L. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, we have identified individual regulatory elements for enhanced expression in the placenta, forestomach, and thymus, as well as a regulatory region required for ubiquitous expression. Regulatory elements not yet identified include those for the tongue, esophagus, small intestine, and deciduum. We speculate that separate regulatory elements will be required for each of these remaining tissues. INTRODUCTIONAdenosine deaminase (ADA) 1The abbreviations used are: ADAadenosine deaminasedpcdays post coitumCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)TSEtrophoblast-specific elementTSEBtrophoblast-specific element-binding proteinbHLHbasic helix-loop-helixhPLhuman placental lactogen. is a purine catabolic enzyme that converts adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively (1Frederiksen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The enzyme is present throughout the evolutionary phyla, and the amino acid sequence is highly conserved from bacteria to humans (2Brady T.G. O'Donovan C.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1965; 14: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Chang Z. Nygaard P. Chinault A.C. Kellems R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting it is a key enzyme in purine metabolism. In mice, the levels of ADA differ as much as 10,000-fold among various tissues with the highest levels occurring in the deciduum, chorioallantoic placenta, tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and proximal small intestine; intermediate levels are found in the thymus and low levels in other tissues (4Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knusen T.B. Kellems R.E. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, Ada expression is subject to developmental regulation at the maternal-fetal interface prenatally and in the gastrointestinal tract postnatally (4Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knusen T.B. Kellems R.E. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Hong L.

Although the physiological role that ADA plays in these tissues is not clear, it is thought that ADA prevents accumulation of the cytotoxic metabolite deoxyadenosine, which interferes with deoxynucleotide metabolism and/or disrupts cellular transmethylation reactions (9Carson D.A. Kaye J. Seegmiller J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5677-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10Cohen A. Hirschhorn R. Horowitz S.D. Rubinstein A. Polmar S.H. Hong R.

Ownby D.R. Ownby H. Buckley R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These disturbances result in apoptosis or disrupt cell differentiation.Mounting evidence indicates that maintaining high levels of ADA in the placenta is essential for embryonic and fetal development. During placentation in mice, ADA appears at 7.5 days post coitum (dpc) in trophoblast giant cells surrounding the embryo and in diploid trophoblast precursor cells in the ectoplacental cone (6Knudsen T.B. Green J.D. Airhart M.J. Higley H.R. Chinsky J.M. Kellems R.E. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Knudsen T.B. Blackburn M.R. Chinsky J.M. Airhart M.J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression of Ada increases as the placenta develops. At 13.5 dpc when the placenta is mature, ADA appears in all trophoblast lineages, including trophoblast giant cells surrounding the gestation site, spongiotrophoblast cells in the junctional zone, and syncytial trophoblast cells in the labyrinth zone. By this time, greater than 95% of the ADA enzymatic activity found at the gestation site resides in the trophoblasts of the placenta (7Knudsen T.B. Blackburn M.R. Chinsky J.M. Airhart M.J. Kellems R.E. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in the placenta persists until term, suggesting that ADA is functionally important in placental physiology. This importance is revealed by a series of mouse genetic experiments. ADA-deficient mice die perinatally of severe liver damage, brought on by profound disturbances in purine metabolism (15Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Montgomery C.A. Bradley A. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The concentrations of adenosine and deoxyadenosine increase 3- and 1000-fold, respectively, in ADA-deficient fetuses, while levels of inosine decrease. These metabolic disturbances are not evident until 12.5 dpc, coinciding with the lack of Ada expression in the placenta (15Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Montgomery C.A. Bradley A. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). By genetically restoring Ada expression specifically to the placenta, most of the purine metabolic disturbances in the fetus are prevented (17Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Deoxyadenosine levels were lowered over 30-fold in ADA-deficient fetuses and severe fetal liver damage was prevented. As a result, ADA-deficient mice were rescued from the perinatal lethality (17Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, activating Ada gene expression in the placenta is critical for proper fetal development.Studying Ada gene expression in the placenta will not only enhance our appreciation of placental ADA, but also contribute to our knowledge of trophoblast differentiation. ADA is an early marker of trophoblast cell differentiation. Unlike other trophoblast-specific genes, whose expression is restricted to one cell type (19Carney E.W. Prideaux V. Lye S.J. Rossant J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Campbell M.L. Larsen D. Deb S. Kwok S.C.M. Soares M.J.

Biol. 1990; 141: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), ADA appears in all trophoblast lineages. Thus, the Ada gene may contain regulatory elements operable at all stages of trophoblast differentiation and in all three cell types, representing a good system to study trophoblast gene regulation. Starting with 6.4-kb 5′-flanking sequences, which direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression to the placenta prenatally (and forestomach postnatally) in transgenic mice (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have localized the placenta-specific regulatory element to a 770-bp fragment 5.4 kb upstream of the Ada transcription initiation site using transgenic mice as an assay system. The speed and the efficiency of this analysis were increased by examining expression of transgenes in placentas 14 days following zygote microinjection. In situ hybridization showed CAT reporter gene expression in the same cell types that expressed ADA. Sequence analysis and DNase I footprinting experiments revealed both general and placenta-specific protein binding sites within this region. Deletions and site-specific mutations of potential protein binding sites within this 770-bp fragment resulted in loss of placenta-specific expression, suggesting that multiple factors function together to ensure proper Ada expression in the placenta."

It has recently been shown that in humans (h), the PCNA function, required for both DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair, can be inactivated by p21CIP1 due to a specific interaction between hPCNA and the carboxyl terminus of p21CIP1. In this report, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) PCNA-dependent pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis was inhibited less efficiently than the human system by the intact p21CIP1 protein and was unaffected by the p21CIP1 carboxyl-terminal peptide (codons 139-160). This species-specific response of PCNA to p21CIP1-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis results from a marked difference in the ability of h and S. cerevisiae PCNA to interact with p21CIP1. As shown by binding studies using the surface plasmon resonance technique, hPCNA binds both full-length p21CIP1 and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) stoichiometrically with a similar affinity (KD~ 2.5 nM) while S. cerevisiae PCNA binds p21CIP1 with ~10-fold less affinity and does not interact with the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160).

DNA primase generates oligoribonucleotide primers that are elongated by pol α for about 30 nucleotides resulting in the accumulation of pre-Okazaki fragments. In the absence of proteins that bind to 3ʹ-hydroxyl primer ends, pol α is capable of rebinding and elongating chains to mature Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand and generating DNA chains that are approximately one-half the length of the circular duplex DNA template on the leading strand (20Matsumoto T.

This non-physiological mechanism, referred to as the monopolymerase system, requires relatively high levels of the pol α·;primase complex.

As a result, both leading strand synthesis and the completion of lagging strand pre-Okazaki fragments depend on pol δ (or pol δ and pol ϵ).In eukaryotes, PCNA has been shown to be the target of a number of factors that control cell growth.

These two disparate inhibitory functions have been shown to reside in separate domains of p21CIP1, a 164-amino acid protein. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p21CIP1 is located within the amino-terminal domain while the PCNA binding region resides in the carboxyl-terminal domain. These distinct inhibitory activities have been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using the overexpressed amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of p21CIP1 (30Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.Q. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 31Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massagùe J. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).A peptide derived from amino acids 141-160 within the carboxyl-terminal domain of p21CIP1 that binds PCNA and inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro has previously been described (32Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the species specificity involved in the pol δ holoenzyme system using enzymes isolated from S. cerevisiae and HeLa cells and have shown that a chemically synthesized peptide that spans amino acid residues 139-160 of p21CIP1 specifically inhibits reactions dependent on human PCNA. This p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) had no effect on elongation reactions dependent on S. cerevisiae PCNA, although both the full-length p21CIP1 protein and a truncated p21CIP1 protein (truncated p21CIP1 protein-(70-164)) inhibited the S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzyme system albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with the human pol δ holoenzyme system.Binding studies using surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that hPCNA binds p21CIP1 and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) stoichiometrically (~three molecules bound per hPCNA trimer) with a similar affinity (KD~2.5 nM). The affinity between S. cerevisiae PCNA and p21CIP1 was 10-fold less than the affinity of hPCNA for p21CIP1, and there was no detectable interaction between the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) and S. cerevisiae PCNA. Recently the crystal structure of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) complexed with hPCNA has been elucidated (33Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O' Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Based on this structure and knowledge of the specific amino acid differences between S. cerevisiae and hPCNA, we propose a model explaining the differential effects of p21CIP1 and its derivatives on S. cerevisiae and hPCNA-dependent reactions.DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here investigated the interactions between p21CIP1 and a p21CIP1 carboxyl-terminal derived peptide with PCNA and the subsequent effect on pol δ-catalyzed DNA elongation. Full-length p21CIP1 inhibited DNA synthesis catalyzed by h or S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzymes to an extent dependent upon the ratio between p21CIP1 and PCNA. In contrast, addition of the p21CIP1-derived peptide-(139-160) only inhibited reactions dependent upon hPCNA, not S. cerevisiae PCNA. Thus, reactions containing S. cerevisiae pol δ and S. cerevisiae RFC with hPCNA were inhibited by the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160), whereas reactions containing h or S. cerevisiae pol δ, S. cerevisiae RFC, and S. cerevisiae PCNA were unaffected by the peptide. The species origin of the pol δ and RFC did not influence DNA synthesis inhibition by p21CIP1 and its derivatives.Real time interaction analysis presented here demonstrated that the affinity of the p21CIP1 for hPCNA was ~15-fold greater than its affinity for S. cerevisiae PCNA. This is consistent with the biochemical data presented indicating that 12 times more p21CIP1 was required to inhibit S. cerevisiae PCNA-dependent nucleotide incorporation by 50% than was required to inhibit hPCNA-dependent incorporation by 50%. Furthermore, the affinity of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) for hPCNA was 100-fold greater than its affinity for S. cerevisiae PCNA. These data are also consistent with the singly-primed M13 elongation assays presented which indicated that addition of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) in amounts stoichiometric with hPCNA inhibited nucleotide incorporation by 50%, whereas the addition of excess peptide did not affect reactions dependent upon S. cerevisiae PCNA.The crystal structure of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) complexed with hPCNA has recently been determined (33Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O' Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). This analysis demonstrated that the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) is bound to the inter-domain connector loop that links the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of each PCNA monomer (residues 119-133). Additional interactions are formed with both domains of PCNA. A schematic model of the hPCNA-p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) complex derived from crystal structure analyses is presented in Fig. 7. Although the α-carbon backbone traces of h and S. cerevisiae PCNA are very similar (8Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 41Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), significant differences in the backbone conformation are located in the regions where the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) interacts with hPCNA. These differences may account for the distinct effects of both p21CIP1 and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) in these two systems.First, and of particular interest, the configuration of the hPCNA interconnector loop that forms part of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) binding surface differs in S. cerevisiae PCNA. A number of residues in this interconnector loop contribute to the formation of two hydrophobic pockets in hPCNA that bind the Met-147, Phe-150, Tyr-151, and Ile-158 residues of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160). There is also an extensive array of hydrogen bonding-mediated contacts between hPCNA and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) in this region. Thus both the conformation and sequence of the interconnector loop of hPCNA are important in forming the interface with the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160). Specific differences in the amino acid sequence between the h and S. cerevisiae PCNA are likely to exclude some favorable contacts with the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) and S. cerevisiae PCNA. For example, Ile-158 of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) fits snugly into a small hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the hPCNA connector loop. Substitution of a cysteine residue (Cys-27) for asparagine at this position in S. cerevisiae PCNA would significantly alter the nature of the binding site. Additionally, Arg-156 of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp-29 and Gln-125 of hPCNA, whereas in the S. cerevisiae PCNA these residues are replaced by glutamine and phenylalanine, respectively, precluding these interactions.In the carboxyl-terminal region of the hPCNA connector loop, residues Leu-126, Gly-127, Ile-128, and Pro-129 form one edge of a binding cleft into which the methionine and tyrosine side chains of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) are inserted. The conformation of the S. cerevisiae PCNA connector loop in this region greatly differs to that of the hPCNA and probably precludes insertion of these p21CIP1 peptide side chains. The p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) tyrosine residue also interacts with the carboxamide group of Gln-131 in hPCNA, which is replaced by a leucine (Leu-131) in S. cerevisiae PCNA, although the backbone of the connector loop has shifted such that the carboxylate moiety of Glu-130 in S. cerevisiae PCNA occupies the same relative position. In addition to these changes, subtle shifts in the position of a β-strand and a short loop which border this hydrophobic cavity optimize the complementarity of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) and hPCNA surfaces. The presence of the Met-40 in hPCNA (instead of a valine residue in S. cerevisiae PCNA) augments these interactions in tailoring the shape of the binding site.Thus, a number of the specific residues that dictate the conformation of the connector loop of hPCNA and its high affinity interaction with the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) are not conserved in S. cerevisiae PCNA, and these differences probably account for the inability of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) to interact with or inhibit S. cerevisiae PCNA.Results from Warbrick et al. (32Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) also suggest that a region that includes the interdomain connector of hPCNA is essential for its interaction with p21CIP1. Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, they demonstrated that the interconnector loop of each PCNA monomer interacts with p21CIP1, whereas PCNA with a deletion of amino acids 100-150 could not form this complex. The connector loop of hPCNA also appears to be critical for its interaction with pol δ (42Roos G. Jiang Y. Landberg G. Nielsen N.H. Zhang P. Lee M.Y.W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against hPCNA that blocks the interaction between hpol δ and hPCNA was competed by a peptide derived from amino acids 121-135 within the connector loop of PCNA. Further evidence for the importance of this region of PCNA comes from cold-sensitive mutations of the S. cerevisiae PCNA gene (POL30) that are clustered in the interconnector domain region and exhibit a cell division cycle phenotype at the restrictive temperature arresting with a 2C DNA content (43Amin N.S. Holm C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 479-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The effects of p21CIP1 and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) on hPCNA-dependent DNA synthesis, the complex stoichiometry, and dissociation constants between each of these agents and hPCNA are all quantitatively similar. This suggests that the biological consequence of the p21CIP1 interaction with hPCNA is quantitatively due to the region contained within the 22-amino acid p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160). In contrast, the effects of full-length p21CIP1 and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) on S. cerevisiae PCNA are different. Furthermore, p21CIP1 was much less effective in blocking S. cerevisiae PCNA-dependent reactions than hPCNA-dependent reactions. These findings indicate that p21CIP1 may affect the S. cerevisiae pol δ-holoenzyme by a mechanism distinct from that observed with the hpol δ-holoenzyme. Since S. cerevisiae PCNA has a low affinity for p21CIP1 and no detectable affinity for the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160), other sites within p21CIP1 (present in the p21CIP1 peptide-(70-164)) may contribute to its interaction with S. cerevisiae PCNA and subsequent effects on the S. cerevisiae pol δ-holoenzyme activity.The loading of PCNA onto DNA by RFC was maximally inhibited by 50% following addition of concentrations of p21CIP1 that completely blocked the elongation of primed DNA. Hübscher's laboratory (44Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Goubin F. Ducomun B. Hübscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8869-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) has shown that PCNA loaded onto circular DNA can still slide off the DNA in the presence of p21CIP1 after linearization of the DNA. These results suggest that p21CIP1 may act to inhibit the interaction between the polymerase and PCNA through its ability to bind to the interconnector domain of PCNA. This would suggest that all reactions dependent upon PCNA and pol δ (or pol ϵ) would be affected by p21CIP1 including DNA repair reactions in which PCNA plays the same role as in replication, acting to tether the polymerase to DNA (45Shivji M.K.K.

These two disparate inhibitory functions have been shown to reside in separate domains of p21CIP1, a 164-amino acid protein. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p21CIP1 is located within the amino-terminal domain while the PCNA binding region resides in the carboxyl-terminal domain. These distinct inhibitory activities have been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using the overexpressed amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of p21CIP1 (30Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.Q. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 31Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massagùe J. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).A peptide derived from amino acids 141-160 within the carboxyl-terminal domain of p21CIP1 that binds PCNA and inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro has previously been described (32Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the species specificity involved in the pol δ holoenzyme system using enzymes isolated from S. cerevisiae and HeLa cells and have shown that a chemically synthesized peptide that spans amino acid residues 139-160 of p21CIP1 specifically inhibits reactions dependent on human PCNA. This p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) had no effect on elongation reactions dependent on S. cerevisiae PCNA, although both the full-length p21CIP1 protein and a truncated p21CIP1 protein (truncated p21CIP1 protein-(70-164)) inhibited the S. cerevisiae pol δ holoenzyme system albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with the human pol δ holoenzyme system.Binding studies using surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that hPCNA binds p21CIP1 and the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) stoichiometrically (~three molecules bound per hPCNA trimer) with a similar affinity (KD~2.5 nM). The affinity between S. cerevisiae PCNA and p21CIP1 was 10-fold less than the affinity of hPCNA for p21CIP1, and there was no detectable interaction between the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) and S. cerevisiae PCNA. Recently the crystal structure of the p21CIP1 peptide-(139-160) complexed with hPCNA has been elucidated (33Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O' Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Based on this structure and knowledge of the specific amino acid differences between S. cerevisiae and hPCNA, we propose a model explaining the differential effects of p21CIP1 and its derivatives on S. cerevisiae and hPCNA-dependent reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1976455796,"To determine whether functional receptor-G protein coupling or signaling are required for internalization of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR), we compared the endocytosis of Gq-coupled and uncoupled receptors. A hemagglutinin epitope-tagged TRHR (HA-TRHR) was in the Gq-coupled state when bound to the agonist, MeTRH, and in a nonsignaling state when bound to the HA antibody (12CA5). 12CA5 did not induce an increase in [Ca2+]i or inositol phosphates and did not inhibit [3H]MeTRH binding or MeTRH-induced production of second messengers. Both agonist- and antibody-bound HA-TRHRs were rapidly internalized via the same pathway; internalization was sensitive to hypertonic shock, and both types of internalized receptors were sorted into lysosomes. In addition, the amino acid sequence CNC (positions 335-337) in the C-terminal tail of the TRHR, which is important in ligand-induced receptor internalization as determined by deletion mutagenesis (Nussenzveig, D. R., Heinflink, M., and Gershengorn, M. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2389-2392), was also important for 12CA5-induced internalization. We expressed two truncated receptors, HA-K338STOP and HA-C335STOP, in GH12C1 pituitary cells. Both HA-TRHR and HA-K338STOP were localized at the plasma membrane of untreated cells and were translocated to intracellular vesicles after MeTRH or 12CA5 binding; however, HA-C335STOP was internalized and recycled constitutively. The intracellular localization of HA-C335STOP was not altered by MeTRH; however, 12CA5 binding induced the disappearance of internalized HA-C335STOP and caused its localization at the plasma membrane, indicating that constitutively cycling HA-C335STOP cannot be reinternalized after antibody binding. Thus, amino acids 335-337, which are important for the internalization of Gq-coupled TRHRs, are also required for the sequestration of functionally uncoupled TRHRs, and in addition, they act as an inhibitory signal that prevents constitutive receptor internalization. Specifically, the Cys residues at positions 335 and 337 are important for preventing constitutive TRHR internalization, because a mutant HA-C335S/C337S receptor was sequestered constitutively. We conclude that release from a negative regulatory internalization sequence or domain is important for HA-TRHR internalization and that the role of the CNC sequence in internalization is independent of functional TRHR-Gq coupling.

Chemical extraction of nuclei from Drosophila embryos revealed that otefin is a peripheral protein whose association with the nuclear envelope is stronger than that of lamin. Deletion mutants of otefin were expressed in order to identify regions that direct otefin to the nuclear envelope.

The nuclear envelope separates the nucleoplasm from the cytoplasm. It is a complex structure composed of outer and inner membranes that are separated by the perinuclear space. The two membranes are joined at the nuclear pore complexes. Underneath the inner membrane, there is a proteinaceous meshwork of intermediate filaments termed the nuclear lamina (for reviews, see Refs. 1Burke B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Gerace L. Burke B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 335-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 3Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope differ in their morphology and composition. Nevertheless, the two membranes are joined at the nuclear pore complexes. The way by which inner membrane proteins reach their target membrane and are retained there has been the subject of several recent studies. Isoprenylation of the CAAX motif in conjunction with a nuclear localization signal has been shown to be necessary in order to direct newly synthesized nuclear lamins to the inner nuclear envelope (4Nigg E.A. Kitten G.T. Vorburger K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The CAAX motif-mediated modifications, although necessary, are not sufficient for stable association of lamins with membranes (5Firmbach-Kraft I. Stick R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional factors such as inner membrane proteins must be involved in lamin-membrane association (6Firmbach-Kraft I. Stick R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Hennekes H. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sasseville A.M. Raymond Y. J.

Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Both the first transmembrane domain (10Smith S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the amino-terminal domain of LBR (11Soullam B. Worman H.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) mediate the targeting of LBR to the inner nuclear membrane. The highly charged amino-terminal domain of LBR can also direct cytosolic proteins to the nucleus and type II integral membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane (10Smith S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the mechanism for inner membrane targeting and retention of LBR and LAP2 involves lateral diffusion in the interconnected membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope and interaction with components of the nuclear lamina and chromatin (9Furukawa K.

The Drosophila nuclear envelope protein otefin has a mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis consistent with a molecular mass of 53 kDa (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The otefin gene encodes a putative primary translation product of 45 kDa with no apparent homology to known proteins. It is highly hydrophilic with a relatively high content of serine and threonine residues and a putative site for phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase. The 17 carboxyl-terminal residues of the otefin protein are hydrophobic and resemble membrane-spanning domains of integral membrane proteins (14Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies raised against Drosophila otefin revealed conservation of mammalian nuclear envelope epitope(s) (14Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy showed that otefin is associated with the nuclear envelope, yet it is excluded from the nuclear pores (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined by immunogold electron microscopy that otefin is present underneath the inner nuclear membrane, facing the nucleoplasm. Extraction studies have demonstrated that in contrast to LAP1, LAP2, and LBR, otefin behaves as a peripheral protein. Expression in COS-7 cells of deletion mutants of otefin and of fusion constructs between otefin truncations and the lacZ gene coupled to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-lacZ) revealed that the COOH-terminal 17-amino acid hydrophobic sequence of otefin is essential for the targeting of otefin to the nuclear periphery. This sequence alone can target NLS-lacZ to the nuclear rim, albeit with low efficiency. Other sequences that are located between amino acids 173 and 372 of otefin are required for efficient targeting to the nuclear envelope, while sequences between amino acids 35 and 172 are required for stabilizing the interaction of otefin with the nuclear envelope. Anti-Drosophila lamin Dm mAb 611A3A6 and anti-Drosophila otefin mAb 618A2O7 have been described (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J.

Biol. 1985; 50: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Drosophila otefin antibodies were prepared by injecting 500 μg of otefin cDNA translation product into rabbits. Anti-β-galactosidase (Z378A) and anti-tubulin (T9026) mAbs were purchased from Promega and Sigma, respectively. Cy3A-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), Cy3A-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 12-nm gold particles (catalog No. 111-205-144) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Vector pSP64-497-524.Z (16Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) is a eukaryotic expression vector carrying an SV40 enhancer, an α-globin promoter, NLS sequence of the glucocorticoid receptor (amino acids 497-524) fused 5′ to the lacZ sequences encoding the β-galactosidase protein, and polyadenylation sequences. pCA1038 (a kind gift from Dr. Nissim Benvenisty) is an expression vector containing the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase I promoter (17Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), a multiple cloning site, and polyadenylation sequences. pCA1038-otefin was prepared by subjecting the EcoRI fragment containing the complete otefin cDNA (14Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to end filling of the recessed 3′-ends with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and cloning it into the SmaI site of pCA1038. Δ388-406 was prepared by inserting a stop codon after amino acid 387 to pCA1038-otefin. Δ35-172 was prepared by digesting pCA1038-otefin with EagI and HincII. Following end filling with a DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, the construct was self-ligated to create a deletion between amino acids 34 and 173. Δ35-172,Δ388-406 was prepared by replacing the carboxyl terminus of Δ35-172 at the BglII site with the carboxyl terminus of Δ388-406. The construction of fusions between otefin cDNA and the lacZ gene was performed in a pT7-7 vector in which the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites were destroyed. The NLS-lacZ region was then cloned into the BamHI site of pT7-7. The NLS-lacZ-otefin cDNA fusions (see below) were subcloned into the BamHI restriction site, replacing the normal lacZ gene in pSP64-497-524.Z with the NLS-lacZ-otefin fusions. To prepare NLS-lacZ-otefin, the AAAATG translation start sequence in otefin cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-mutated to the NdeI site CATATG. The NdeI-EcoRI fragment of otefin cDNA, which contains the complete open reading frame, was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites at the 3′-end of the lacZ coding sequences. This created an in-frame fusion between lacZ and otefin. NLS-lacZ-Δ1-33 was prepared by inserting the EagI-EcoRI fragment of otefin cDNA, encoding amino acids 34-406, into the EcoRI site of the lacZ gene. Both the EagI-EcoRI fragment of otefin and the EcoRI site in lacZ were subjected to end filling of the recessed 3′-ends prior to the ligation. NLS-lacZ-Δ372-406 was prepared by digesting NLS-lacZ-otefin with StuI and EcoRI. The digested construct was subjected to end filling of the recessed 3′-ends and self-ligated. NLS-lacZ-Δ1-371 was prepared by digesting otefin cDNA with StuI and EcoRI. The StuI-EcoRI fragment, encoding amino acids 1-371, was cloned into the NdeI site of the lacZ gene. Both the StuI-EcoRI fragment of otefin and the NdeI site in lacZ were subjected to end filling of the recessed 3′-ends prior to the ligation. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL1651, SV40-transformed CV-1 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 40 mM glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin (Beit Haemek, Israel). For transfection, 5 × 105 cells were plated on 10 × 10-mm coverslips (prewashed with 70% ethanol and treated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma)) in a six-well plate and grown overnight. Lipofection mixtures were prepared by vortexing 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 15 μl of Lipofectin transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim catalog No. 1202375) in polystyrene tubes. 5 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (prepared with a Qiagen plasmid kit, QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) were then added and mixed gently for 10 min with the lipofection mixture. Following overnight incubation, the cells were washed once with Opti-MEM, and the lipofection mixture was then added to the cells. After a 5-h incubation, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FCS was added to the culture. After 24 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. Following an additional 24 h, the cells were fixed and stained for immunofluorescence analysis. Drosophila embryos (0-7 h old) were dechorionated and homogenized in buffer NM (250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Nuclei were separated by centrifugation of the homogenate at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The isolated nuclei were washed at 4°C with PBS, fixed for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 4.0% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBSBT). The nuclei were then incubated for 16 h at 4°C with polyclonal anti-Drosophila otefin antibody diluted in PBSBT, washed three times for 1 h each with PBSBT, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 12-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:25 in PBSBT. Nuclei were washed for 2 h with PBSBT and then post-fixed with PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Following a wash with PBS, nuclei were washed for 16 h at 4°C with 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.5) and then fixed for 90 min at room temperature with 1% OsO4 in 100 mM sodium cacodylate. Samples were dehydrated, embedded, sectioned, stained, and viewed as described previously (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were grown to ∼80% confluence on 10 × 10-mm coverslips, washed once with PBS, fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min at 4°C, washed again with PBS, and fixed again for 30 min at 20°C with 4% formaldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBSTR). Cells were then washed three times for 30 min: first with PBS, then with PBSTR, and then with PBSTR containing 2% FCS. These washes were followed by a single 10-min wash with PBSTR containing 5% low fat milk. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with mAb 618A2O7 or mAb Z387A diluted in PBS. Following incubation with the antibody, the cells were washed three times for 30 min each with PBSTR and were stained for 2 h with Cy3A-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in PBS containing 1% FCS. The cells were then washed three times for 30 min with PBSTR and stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS. Coverslips were mounted with 2% (w/v) n-propyl gallate in 50% glycerol/PBS (1:1) and viewed with a Leitz epifluoresence microscope using a 63×/NA = 1.4 Planapo objective lens. To better localize the immunofluorescence signal, the same cells were also viewed with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (see below). Triton X-100 extraction of cells was performed by incubation of the cells prior to fixation with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4°C, followed by a brief wash with PBS, after which the cells were fixed and treated as described above. A Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal scanhead coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 135M inverted microscope was used to acquire images of the stained cells. A 63×/NA = 1.4 objective was used. Excitation light was provided by a 100-microwatt air-cooled argon ion laser run in the multiline mode. The 514-nm line of the laser was used for excitation and was selected with an interference filter. The emission filter was a D580/32 (32 band pass centered about 580 nm). The confocal iris diameter was between 1.3 and 3.5 mm, with the larger opening used for weaker signals. Vertical resolution was between 0.5 and 1 μm, depending on the iris setting. Two to four images were averaged in order to reduce point noise. Images of 512 × 512 pixels were acquired using a hardware zoom of 3-10 (0.106-0.032 μm/pixel). When needed, a 3 × 3 median filter was used to remove point noise from the digital images. Labeling was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, and visualization was with the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and H2O2 since they allowed the detection of the few cells that expressed the construct with a light microscope before visualization with an electron microscope. COS-7 cells were transfected with NLS-lacZ-otefin. After 48 h, the cells were collected; washed with PBS; and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, and 0.05% glutaraldehyde. Subsequently, the cells were washed five times with PBS and twice with TBS. The fixed and washed cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.25% sodium borohydride in water; washed eight times with TBS; and then incubated with blocking solution containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 2% egg albumin, 0.5% glycine, 0.5% lysine, and 0.9% NaCl in 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated for 72 h at 4°C in 4 μg/ml mAb Z378A (anti-β-galactosidase) in TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 1% egg albumin. The cells were washed eight times with TBS and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse antibody. The cells were then incubated for 2 h in avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain, Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and washed eight times with TBS. The horseradish peroxidase was visualized using the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.02% H2O2. The cells were washed eight times with TBS and embedded in 2% low melting point agarose. The cells were then post-fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 1% OsO4 and 1.5% K3Fe(CN)6. After brief washes with 0.1 M cacodylate, the cells were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and infiltrated with epoxy resin. Embedding, sectioning, staining, and viewing were as described (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared according to Adra et al. (17Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) by thawing frozen 0-15-h-old Drosophila (Canton S) embryos on ice and homogenizing them in 10 volumes of buffer D (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mM MgCl2, 1.3 M sucrose). The homogenate was filtered through a 125-μm nylon mesh overlaid above a cushion of buffer D and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclear pellet was washed twice with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μM leupeptin, 100 mM TPCK) containing 40% glycerol. The nuclei were resuspended to a concentration equivalent to 2 μl of packed embryos/μl of buffer and frozen in liquid N2. For chemical extraction, nuclei were thawed on ice, washed once in buffer B, and digested for 15 min with 1 μg/ml DNase I and 1 μg/ml RNase A at 23°C. The nuclear pellet was further extracted for 15 min at 4°C in 4 volumes of buffer B supplemented with the extraction reagent. Extraction with high pH was performed in buffer B devoid of Tris-HCl, the pH of which was adjusted with NaOH. After extraction, the residual nuclear pellet was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged once more for 10 min at 150,000 × g. From each fraction, amounts equivalent to 5 μl of packed embryos were subjected to protein blot analysis using specific mAbs. Colorimetric detection of alkaline phosphatase activity was according to McGrady (19McGrady J. Histochemie. 1970; 23: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To reveal the exact orientation of otefin within the nuclear envelope, polyclonal anti-otefin antibodies were raised against the otefin cDNA translation product. These were used to refine the localization of otefin in Drosophila embryonic nuclei by immunogold electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1, otefin was localized on the nucleoplasmic side of the inner nuclear membrane. Although the labeling of otefin in the current experiments was highly specific, the immunolabeling was weaker than in a previous study in which, due to the sensitivity of the available epitope to fixatives such as glutaraldehyde, lighter fixation conditions and 5-nm gold particles were used (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction with detergents, salt, and chaotropic reagents was employed in order to study the mode of the association of otefin with the nuclear envelope (20Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 805-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Drosophila embryonic nuclei were isolated, digested with DNase I and RNase A, and extracted with buffer B containing different reagents. The supernatant and pellet were then separated and analyzed by protein blot analysis using mAb 618A2O7 (anti-Drosophila otefin) and mAb 611A3A6 (anti-Drosophila lamin Dm) (12Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction with 8 M urea, with 4 M guanidine HCl, or with buffer B at pH 13 resulted in extraction of both otefin and lamin Dm (Fig. 2A). These data show that the association of otefin with the inner nuclear membrane is peripheral and different from that of other known integral membrane proteins (20Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 805-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Otefin remained associated mostly with the nuclear envelope after washing with buffer B containing 1 M NaCl, 1 M LiCl, or 3 M NaBr (data not shown) or after washing with buffer B at pH 11. Under the same conditions, a fraction of the lamin Dm molecules were extracted (Fig. 2A). These data reveal that association of otefin with the nuclear membrane is stronger than that of lamin Dm. It was interesting to note that both otefin and lamin remained associated with the nuclear envelope after a 1% Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 2B), which suggests that both otefin and lamin are present in a protein complex that is stable to extraction with Triton. Both lamin and otefin were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 combined with 1 M NaCl (Fig. 2A). Wild-type and truncated otefin forms were visualized following transient transfection into COS-7 cells in order to analyze sequences in otefin that participate in its targeting to the nuclear periphery (Fig. 3A). Expression of the otefin constructs was detected in ∼1% (pCA1038) or 10% (pSP64-497-524.Z) of the transfected cells. COS-7 transfection with wild-type otefin labeled the nuclear rim in all otefin-expressing cells. In some transfected cells, otefin was also localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C and Table I). In Drosophila Schneider cells, otefin was resistant to extraction with 1% Triton X-100 as judged by protein blot (Fig. 2B) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, A and B) analysis. Similarly, otefin remained associated with the nuclear rim in ∼60% of the otefin-expressing COS-7 cells following extraction with Triton X-100, while most of the cytoplasmic staining disappeared (Fig. 4D and Table I). The remaining cytoplasmic staining appeared punctated probably due to aggregation of the protein at these sites.Fig. 4Cellular localization of the otefin protein in Schneider and COS-7 cells by immunofluorescence. Cells were viewed using a Leitz fluorescence microscope for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Cy3A (FM) staining. Cy3A staining was also viewed with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (CONFOCAL). A, Schneider cells were fixed with methanol and 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were than incubated with mAb 618A2O7 (anti-otefin) and with Cy3A-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Antibody staining was localized to the nuclear rim. B, Schneider cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4°C and then fixed and stained as described for A. Following the extraction with Triton X-100, staining remained in the nuclear rim. C, COS-7 cells were Lipofectin-transfected with full-length otefin in the pCA1038 vector. After 24 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. Following an additional 24 h, the cells were fixed and stained as described for A. Staining was localized to the nuclear rim and the cytoplasm (please note the cytoplasmic staining in the left cell in the FM image). D, the transfected COS-7 cells were washed with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4°C, followed by fixation and staining as describe for C. Staining remained in the nuclear rim. In some cells, some aggregates remained in the cytoplasm as shown in the FM images. Cells with relatively high levels of cytoplasmic staining are presented in D. Bars = 5 μm (A and B) and 10 μm (C and D). ∼1% of the transfected cells expressed otefin. mAb 618A2O7 (anti-otefin) did not recognize a native otefin in mammalian cells, as indicated by cells that do not express Drosophila otefin (C and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I.Summary of the results obtained following transfection of COS-7 cells with the different wild-type and truncated otefin constructsConstructLocationResistance to Triton X-100After transfectionAfter Triton X-100NNECytNNECyt%Otefin−+++−+++/−60Δ35-172−+++−+++/−20Δ388-406++−−+/−−−−0Δ35-172,Δ388-406++−−+/−−−−0NLS-lacZ++−+/−−+/−−−−13NLS-lacZ-otefin−+++/−−+++/−−77NLS-lacZ-Δ1-33−+++/−−+++/−−NDaND, not determined.NLS-lacZ-Δ374-406++−−+/−−−−16NLS-lacZ-Δ1-373+++−+−35a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In contrast to wild-type otefin, transfection with the Δ388-406 construct, which lacks the hydrophobic sequence, or with the Δ35-172,Δ388-406 construct, which lacks amino acids 35-172 and 388-406, resulted in the exclusive localization of the proteins to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5, A and C). The lack of nuclear rim localization of the Δ388-406 and Δ35-172,Δ388-406 proteins shows that the last 17 amino acids of otefin are essential for directing otefin to the nuclear envelope. The Δ388-406 and Δ35-172,Δ388-406 proteins were completely soluble following a Triton X-100 extraction (Table I). The localization of the Δ35-172 protein was similar to that of the normal protein (Fig. 5B), but was significantly less stable to extraction with Triton X-100. Only ∼20% of the cells that expressed the Δ35-172 protein remained stained following extraction with Triton X-100 (Table I), and the level of labeling in these cells was significantly reduced (data not shown). The extraction of Δ35-172 with Triton X-100 demonstrated that although the amino-terminal portion of the hydrophilic domain has little or no effect on the cellular localization of otefin, it does play a role, when present together with the hydrophobic sequence, in stabilizing the interaction of otefin at the nuclear periphery. To further analyze the role of specific sequences in targeting otefin to the nuclear periphery, a series of constructs was prepared in which the otefin sequences were fused in frame to the 3′-end of the open reading frame of the lacZ gene in the pSP64-497-524.Z vector (Fig. 3B). These constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. A comparison of the results that were obtained with the different constructs is presented in Table I. When the pSP64-497-524.Z vector encoding an NLS-β-galactosidase protein was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, the expressed protein was localized in the nucleoplasm as judged by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 6D). In ∼70% of the expressing cells, low levels of cytoplasmic staining were also observed, perhaps due to the high expression levels in these cells. In contrast, the NLS-β-galactosidase protein fused to amino acids 1-406 of otefin was detected mainly in the nuclear periphery (Fig. 6A). In some cells, reticular cytoplasmic staining was also observed. Both anti-β-galactosidase (Fig. 6A) and anti-otefin (618A2O7; data not shown) mAbs demonstrated similar behavior. Extraction of NLS-lacZ-otefin with Triton X-100 resulted in punctated perinuclear staining, similar to the pattern observed in COS-7 cells transfected with otefin (compare Fig. 4D with Fig. 6A). The location of the NLS-β-galactosidase-otefin fusion protein was further determined with electron microscopy immunolocalization using anti-β-galactosidase mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase staining appeared under the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope of the lac Z-expressing cells (Fig. 7, A-C), but not in cells that do not express the fusion protein (Fig. 7D). In addition to the inner nuclear membrane staining, horseradish peroxidase staining was also observed in the outer nuclear membrane and in the cytoplasm of many cells. The NLS-β-galactosidase-Δ372-406 protein, which lacks the hydrophobic sequence, showed a nucleoplasmic localization, similar to that of the NLS-β-galactosidase protein alone (Fig. 6E). While confirming the importance of the hydrophobic sequence in directing otefin to the nuclear periphery, these findings imply that the hydrophilic sequences of otefin are not sufficient for promoting localization to the nuclear envelope. To examine whether the hydrophobic sequence is sufficient for nuclear envelope localization, COS-7 cells were transfected with NLS-lacZ-Δ1-371, encoding the NLS-β-galactosidase protein fused to amino acids 372-406. This fusion protein had a complex localization pattern. In ∼60% of the expressing cells, staining of the nuclear rim was observed (Fig. 6C). In addition, in all of the expressing cells, nonhomogeneous cytoplasmic labeling of unidentified blobs was detected. In ∼40% of the cells, nucleoplasmic staining was also observed. Triton X-100 extracted most of the cytoplasmic and nuclear background, while the nuclear rim staining remained in ∼20% of the expressing cells (Table I), apparently reflecting the fraction of this fusion protein that stably interacts with component(s) of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 6C). It should be noted, however, that the estimation of the percent of extractability by Triton X-100 was qualitative; following extraction with Triton X-100, cells that expressed low levels of the truncated protein could have been missed. Together, these data indicate that while low efficiency targeting to the nuclear periphery of NLS-containing proteins is obtained with the hydrophobic sequence of otefin alone, high efficiency targeting requires additional sequences in otefin. Removal of the first 33 amino acids in otefin (NLS-lacZ-Δ1-33) resulted in a localization pattern similar to that of the complete otefin (Fig. 6B). Extraction of these cells with Triton X-100 resulted in punctated nuclear rim staining, similar to NLS-lacZ-otefin (Table I). These data, together with the transfection experiments, allow the identification of three domains in otefin that are important for directing otefin to the nuclear envelope. The hydrophobic sequence at the carboxyl terminus is essential for the sorting of otefin to the nuclear envelope, while the domain containing amino acids 35-172 is required to confer a stable protein complex in the nuclear envelope. Additional sequences at the hydrophilic domain play a role in the efficient targeting of otefin to the nuclear periphery. In this study, we used polyclonal anti-otefin antibody and the immunogold electron microscopy technique to show that in the nuclear envelope, otefin is facing the nucleoplasm. These findings add to our previous study (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which otefin was localized by mAb to the nuclear envelope, but its topology within the nuclear envelope could not be determined. The solubility properties identify otefin as a peripheral protein of the nuclear envelope. A major operational criterion for this classification was its extraction with 8 M urea, with 4 M guanidine HCl, or with buffer B at pH 13. Therefore, the topology of the association of otefin is different from that of LAP1, LAP2, and LBR, which are all type II integral membrane proteins (21Bailer S.M. Eppenberger H.M. Griffiths G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Worman H.J. Yuan J. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8531-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 23Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The only other known peripheral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane are the lamins. The association of otefin with the nuclear membrane was found to be stronger than that of lamins since it remained resistant to extractions with high salt or high pH (pH 11), while lamin was solubilized. Otefin also remained associated with the nuclear envelope following extraction with Triton X-100. Hence, otefin maintained its association with the insoluble lamin fraction, similar to LAP1, LAP2, and LBR (23Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). There are several indications that otefin may also interact in vivo with the nuclear lamina and/or chromatin. These indications include the peripheral nucleoplasmic localization of both otefin and lamin; the resistance of otefin to extraction with Triton X-100, similar to lamin; the finding that in early embryos, otefin remains associated with the spindle envelope during mitosis, like lamin Dmmit (13Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel E.S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and the finding that in the maternal pool, otefin is associated with the same membrane vesicle fractions as lamin Dmmit. These results motivate further studies to determine if such interactions exist. The data presented here indicate that as in Drosophila nuclei, Drosophila otefin interacts with factor(s) that are present only at the nuclear periphery of the COS-7 cells to form a Triton-stable complex. In a fraction of the otefin-expressing cells, some of the label was found associated with the cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic association was largely solubilized with Triton X-100 and therefore did not involve the formation of Triton-stable complexes. The hydrophilic domain of otefin was not sufficient for the targeting of proteins to the nuclear envelope. The localization of otefin to the nuclear envelope depended absolutely on the COOH-terminal hydrophobic sequence. Removal of the short hydrophobic sequence of otefin resulted in the nuclear localization of the Δ388-406 and NLS-lacZ-Δ372-406 proteins, which is in line with our previous suggestion that otefin has putative NLS sequences (14Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic sequence of otefin and its neighboring 11 amino acids had, by itself, only limited capability for directing the NLS-β-galactosidase protein to the nuclear envelope. Other sequences in otefin were required for the efficient localization of otefin to the nuclear envelope and for its interaction with other nuclear envelope proteins. Since the Δ35-172 and NLS-lacZ-Δ1-33 proteins had mainly a nuclear rim localization, similar to wild-type otefin, efficient targeting to the inner membranes requires the hydrophobic sequence together with hydrophilic sequences between amino acids 173 and 389. Removal of amino acids 35-172 from otefin did not affect the localization of otefin. However, the expressed construct became sensitive to extraction with Triton X-100. Although this region in otefin may be involved in the interaction of otefin with other factors that are present at the nuclear envelope, we cannot exclude the possibility that the sensitivity to Triton X-100 is due to misfolding of the mutant protein. It is interesting to note that this region in otefin contains a conserved site for Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation (SPKK) that may be involved in the regulation of the formation of a complex in vivo. Based on these observations, an attractive model for the topology of otefin is that it is attached to the inner nuclear membrane by its hydrophobic sequence. This attachment is stabilized by integral membrane proteins. Treatment with guanidine HCl, urea, or pH 13 disrupts these protein-protein interactions and allows the extraction of otefin from the protein complex. Further study is required to determine whether the known integral membrane proteins of the nuclear envelope are involved in the formation of an otefin-containing complex. It is possible that otefin is directed to the nuclear envelope by entering the nucleus with the aid of its NLS(s), followed by a hydrophobic sequence-dependent sorting to the nuclear envelope and retention by other nuclear envelope proteins. This mechanism of targeting resembles the mechanism by which lamins are localized to the nuclear envelope. However, in the case of lamins, this association with the nuclear envelope requires a post-translational modification resulting in the addition of an isoprenyl group to the CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus (24Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). In a previous report, it was noted that the stretch of amino acids 74-81 in otefin has homology to known NLSs (14Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that deletion of this region and the carboxyl-terminal domain does not abolish nuclear targeting. The ability of the deleted otefin to reach the nucleus can be explained either by the presence of a different functional NLS or by a passive diffusion of this ∼30-kDa protein into the nucleus and retention by binding to nuclear ligands. The location of NLSs in otefin is currently under investigation. Since otefin was found to be associated with membrane vesicles in the maternal pool, sorting and retention at the nuclear envelope could also occur at the end of mitosis, when vesicles attach to chromatin and fuse to form the nuclear envelope. In that case, the precise localization of otefin within the inner nuclear membrane would require direct or indirect interactions of otefin with other nuclear envelope proteins or with proteins that are present on the surface of the chromatin. Another mechanism suggested for the transport of type II integral membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane includes insertion of the protein into endoplasmic reticulum membranes, followed by lateral diffusion through the endoplasmic reticulum network and accumulation at the inner membrane by binding interactions (9Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Like otefin, which is a peripheral protein, the targeting of these integral membrane proteins involves more than one region in the protein. However, the ability of the large-size fusions of NLS-β-galactosidase-otefin (∼170 kDa) to reach the inner nuclear membrane suggests that in the COS-7 cells, they did not enter the nuclear envelope by lateral diffusion. Nevertheless, since otefin is probably small enough for lateral diffusion, we cannot rule out the possibility that in vivo, a fraction of otefin is targeted to the inner membrane by association with other inner membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum.

Catecholamines are among the physiological regulators of LPL and inhibit adipose lipid accumulation during periods of active lipolysis (e.g. fasting). Previous studies have demonstrated a decrease in LPL activity after the addition of epinephrine or other catecholamines to adipocytes in vitro (2Ong J.M. Saffari B. Simsolo R.B. Kern P.A. Mol.

A number of studies have demonstrated that the regulation of LPL is complex. Under some conditions, the levels of LPL mRNA are regulated, whereas other times there is regulation of LPL translation or posttranslational processing (1Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Regulation of LPL translation has been demonstrated in response to several conditions, including elevated glucose (4Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thyroid hormone absence (5Saffari B. Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When epinephrine was added to adipocytes, there was a rapid decrease in LPL synthesis using [35S]methionine pulse labeling, in spite of no change in adipocyte LPL mRNA levels (2Ong J.M. Saffari B. Simsolo R.B. Kern P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we partially characterized this translational regulation (6Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A cytoplasmic extract from epinephrine-treated 3T3-L1 cells inhibited LPL translation in an in vitro translation system. Furthermore, when constructs were prepared that lacked the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), the extract failed to inhibit translation, indicating that the cytoplasmic extract contained a factor that interacted with the 3′ UTR of the LPL mRNA. This study was intended to further characterize this translational regulation of LPL by epinephrine. In addition to further defining the important region of the LPL mRNA, we have identified a RNA-binding protein and demonstrated that the inhibition of LPL expression can be transferred to a heterologous reporter. 3T3-L1 cells and 3T3-F442A cells were obtained from Dr. Howard Green (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). 3T3-L1 cells were grown on 75-cm2 culture flasks (Costar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown to confluence and differentiated by incubation in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum containing 1 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, and 0.25 μM dexamethasone for 72 h. Cells were then maintained in DMEM containing 10% serum and 1 μg/ml insulin for 5-7 days. Medium was then changed to DMEM containing 10% serum. 3T3-F442A cells were treated similarly, except differentiation was accomplished with 1 μg/ml insulin alone. 3T3 fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse myocyte cells, C2 cells (7Blau H.M. Chiu C.-P. Webster C.

For differentiation, cells were switched to DMEM containing 2% horse serum. A cytosolic fraction was prepared as described previously (6Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed using an isotonic lysis buffer, and the postnuclear extract was used to prepare a high-speed supernatant fraction (S-100) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the cytosolic fraction to 60% saturation and precipitated for 0.5 h on ice. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 0°C, redissolved, and dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 20 mM KCL, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol). Protein concentration in the cell extract was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal quantities of the cell extract (0.1 μg) were used in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. For in vitro translation, RNA transcripts from a variety of human LPL cDNA constructs were used (described below). Template DNA was linearized with a suitable restriction enzyme to obtain a complete transcript of the cloned DNA. 1 μg of linearized DNA was transcribed with either SP6 or T7 polymerase using the SP6/T7 transcription kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Equal quantities of RNA transcripts (0.1 μg) were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. The construct used in Fig. 1 was LPL35, described by Wion et al. (8Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It contained 174 nucleotides of the 5′ untranslated sequence, the complete coding sequence (1428 nucleotides), and 822 nucleotides of the 1950-nucleotide 3′ UTR cloned in transcription vector pGEM-2. The 3.2-kb LPL construct (clone A in Fig. 2) was prepared using overlapping clones of human LPL cDNA in pGEM4Z (8Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), as described previously (9Ranganathan G. Ong J.M. Yukht A. Saghizadeh M. Simsolo R.B. Pauer A. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7149-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Clone B consisted of nucleotides 1-3196, with a deletion of nucleotides 1600-1654. This cDNA was generated using the megaprimer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (10Sarkar G. Sommers S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The first segment, nucleotides 1-1599, was amplified using the EcoRI cut of LPL35, which cuts at nucleotide 1640. A PstI site was attached to the upstream primer, which contained the first 17 nucleotides of the human LPL sequence (ATATCTGCAGCCCCTGTTCCTCCTC). The downstream fusion primer contained the deletion of 54 bases and extended from nucleotides 1585-1600 followed by nucleotides 1654-1670 (GTTACTTCCTCCACTTCTCAGCCTGACTTCT). The second segment, nucleotides 1654-3196, was amplified from the full-length clone of LPL (9Ranganathan G. Ong J.M. Yukht A. Saghizadeh M. Simsolo R.B. Pauer A. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7149-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A complement of the fusion primer described above was used as the upstream primer. The downstream primer used included a BamHI site (ATATGGATCCCCAACAACAACAAATCATACT). These two fragments were used as megaprimers to amplify the 3.2-kb cDNA containing the 54-nucleotide deletion. To improve the yield and minimize errors, Taq Extender PCR additive (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) was included with Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-2. The clone was confirmed to have a deletion of bases 1600-1654 using informative restriction fragment analysis. Clones C and D were a generous gift of Dr. Robert H. Eckel (University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO). Clone C has the complete 5′ UTR coding sequence (1428 nucleotides) and the first 25 nucleotides of LPL 3′ UTR cloned in pGEM-2. Clone D has both the 3′ and 5′ UTRs eliminated and contains the complete LPL coding sequence. These sequences were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.; sequenase sequencing kit). Heterologous construct E was prepared that contained the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence followed by nucleotides 1512-2451 of human LPL cloned 3′ to CAT. This construct was generated by inserting a polylinker after the CAT coding sequence using pBLCAT2 (11Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 12: 1044-1051Crossref Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The region between nucleotides 1512 and 2451 of LPL cDNA was amplified using PCR. Restriction sites were included on both ends of the PCR primers, and the resulting 939-bp fragment of LPL cDNA was cloned 3′ of the CAT coding sequence. A control construct F was generated that contained nucleotides 1312-2212 of SV40 3′ UTR cloned 3′ of the CAT coding sequence. This insert was also generated by PCR using the pBLCAT2 plasmid as template. A T7 promoter sequence was introduced 5′ of the CAT coding sequence. These constructs were confirmed by informative restriction cuts. Taq Extender PCR additive was included along with Taq polymerase to minimize errors and improve the yield of the PCR reaction. For expression, purified plasmid DNA was digested at a polylinker restriction site downstream of the LPL insert, and in vitro RNA transcription was carried out using the appropriate upstream promoter for viral RNA polymerase. The luciferase vector pcDNA3-luc was a generous gift from Dr. Roger Davis (San Diego State University, San Diego, CA). The region between nucleotides 1512 and 2451 of LPL cDNA was amplified using the appropriate primers. Restriction sites were incorporated on either side of the fragment, which was then cloned into the pcDNA3-luc vector, which has a polylinker after the luciferase stop codon. Two control constructs were used, both of which were obtained by amplification using PCR. For a control construct, a 717-bp fragment of hormone-sensitive lipase sequence between nucleotides 1717 and 2434 was amplified using PCR and inserted into pcDNA3-luc. Transient transfections of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser followed by butyrate treatment (12Goldstein S. Fordis C.M. Howard B.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3959-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells were cotransfected with luciferase-LPL (30 μg) and β-galactosidase (5 μg) plasmid DNA. The plasmids were resuspended in 0.5 ml of electroporation buffer containing 20 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA. The cells were transferred into growth medium containing 5 mM butyrate for 16 h and then transferred into differentiation medium for 72 h. Luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were measured using Promega assay systems. The sense RNA strands described in Fig. 4 were generated by PCR of clone A using the appropriate primers, except for the addition of T7 polymerase sequences on the upstream primer. For RNase protection analysis, 32P-labeled RNA transcripts to specific regions of the LPL 3′ UTR were generated from the PCR fragments also used in the sense strand competition experiments. The labeled transcripts were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the integrity was checked on a 5% nondenaturing PAGE. Binding reactions were carried out with S-100 cytoplasmic extracts (25 μg) and 25,000 cpm (0.5 ng) of 32P-labeled transcript in Buffer A. After incubation at 25° for 30 min, 2.5-5 units of RNase T1 (Ambion, Inc.) were added for 20 min, followed by the addition of 5 mg/ml heparin in Buffer A. The RNA-protein complex was then analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing PAGE (13Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). For the cross-linking assay, after the addition of heparin the reactions were exposed to UV light. UV cross-linking was done for 10 min on ice at a distance of 5-6 cm from an 8-W UV bulb. The samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Luciferase activity in transfected cells was analyzed using Student's t test. Previous studies have demonstrated an inhibition of LPL translation by a cytoplasmic extract from epinephrine-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (6Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of this translation inhibition, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from other cell types in the presence and absence of epinephrine and added to an in vitro translation system. The transcript for the reticulocyte lysate system was the in vitro-transcribed human LPL mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1, a cytoplasmic extract from epinephrine-treated 3T3-F442A adipocytes inhibited LPL translation in the reticulocyte lysate system. On the other hand, there was no inhibition of translation by cytoplasmic extracts from other cells, including 3T3 fibroblasts or C2 cells. Extracts prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibited LPL translation consistently, although the degree of inhibition was not as great as with the adipocyte cell lines. In a previous study, we determined that the region that regulated LPL translation was the proximal portion of the 3′ UTR of the LPL mRNA. To further define the region of regulation and to determine whether other downstream elements were important in translational regulation, additional experiments were performed using different mRNA constructs. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from control and epinephrine-treated 3T3-F442A cells and added to the in vitro translation system containing the constructs illustrated in Fig. 2. To determine the importance of the proximal 3′ UTR, a construct was prepared that contained the complete coding sequence (nucleotides 1-1599) and the full-length 3′ UTR, except for nucleotides 1600-1654. As shown in Fig. 2, the deletion of nucleotides 1600-1654 on the 3′ UTR resulted in a loss of translation inhibition by epinephrine. To further isolate the region on the 3′ UTR that controlled translation, a construct was prepared that contained the complete coding sequence and the first 24 nucleotides of the 3′ UTR. The translation of this construct was inhibited by the addition of epinephrine-treated cell extract from 3T3-F442A cells. On the other hand, a construct that lacked the 5′ and 3′ UTRs did not respond to the epinephrine-treated cell extract. To determine whether the coding sequence of LPL was involved in translational regulation, a heterologous construct was prepared that contained the coding sequence for CAT, followed by nucleotides 1512-2451 of LPL, cloned 3′ to the CAT coding sequence. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of the epinephrine-treated 3T3-F442A cell extract resulted in an inhibition of translation of this heterologous transcript, whereas no inhibition of translation occurred when the control extract was used and when the same construct was used with an irrelevant sequence cloned 3′ to CAT. Although we have demonstrated that the proximal 3′ UTR of LPL mediated the translational regulation of LPL using in vitro translation, we wished to determine whether the addition of the LPL 3′ UTR to a heterologous construct could confer inhibition of translation in cells. A luciferase construct was prepared that contained the 939 nucleotides of the LPL 3′ UTR (nucleotides 1512-2451) cloned 3′ to a luciferase reporter and driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. This construct was expressed in 3T3-F442A cells (as described under “Materials and Methods”), which were then treated with epinephrine. As shown in Fig. 3, epinephrine inhibited luciferase expression in 3T3-F442A cells transfected with the luciferase-LPL 3′ UTR construct. To confirm that the inhibition of luciferase expression was due to the proximal region of the LPL 3′ UTR, two additional constructs were prepared; one contained the same sequence except that it was missing the proximal 24 nucleotides of the 3′ UTR, and the other contained 717 nucleotides (nucleotides 1717-2434) of irrelevant sequence (hormone-sensitive lipase coding sequence) cloned 3′ to luciferase. As shown in Fig. 3, epinephrine had no inhibitory effect on luciferase expression using these last two constructs. If the inhibition of LPL translation was due to the production of a trans-acting binding protein, the addition of a sense RNA strand would be expected to compete for this binding protein and remove the translation inhibition. To examine this, a series of sense RNA strands were transcribed and added to the epinephrine-treated cell extract, followed by in vitro translation. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of progressively shorter sense strands of 628, 230, and 130 bp resulted in an increase in LPL translation, suggesting that these RNA strands were competing for a binding protein. The competitor RNA fragment had no effect on the control cell extract and had no effect on the in vitro translation reaction in the absence of any cell extract. Furthermore, the addition of a similar-sized sequence of irrelevant mRNA (neomycin phosphotransferase) had no effect on the epinephrine cell extract (data not shown). Thus, the sense RNA strand seemed to compete with the LPL mRNA for an inhibitory binding factor. To demonstrate the presence of a trans-acting binding protein, a sequence of the LPL 3′ UTR was labeled with [32P]UTP, followed by the addition of control or epinephrine-treated cell extract and RNase T1. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of the control cell extract did not result in any RNA protection. On the other hand, the addition of the epinephrine-treated cell extract resulted in the identification of a fragment protected from RNase. This protected fragment was found only in the epinephrine-treated cell extract and was present only when the LPL 3′ UTR was used and included the proximal 24 nucleotides of the 3′ UTR. As shown in Fig. 5, the use of an irrelevant sequence of RNA (human colipase) yielded no protected fragment. To obtain better information about this binding protein, RNase protection was performed in the same manner, except that the RNA/protein complex was cross-linked with UV irradiation. After this, the complex was analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 6, the 32P-labeled protein complex migrated at 30 kDa. A weaker band was present upon longer exposure at 40 kDa, and smaller peptides were detected at the front, suggesting the possibility of either degradation or a subunit structure to the binding protein.Fig. 6UV cross-linking of sense RNA strands with cytoplasmic extracts from control or epinephrine-treated 3T3-F442A adipocytes. 32P-labeled sense RNA encoding nucleotides 1512-1834 of LPL was incubated with equal amounts of control or epinephrine-treated cytoplasmic extract. After RNase T1 and heparin treatment, the reactions were UV cross-linked and analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have demonstrated that the regulation of LPL is complex and may occur at the level of transcription (14Ong J.M.

Saffari B. Simsolo R.B. Kern P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and glucose (4Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and increased LPL translation has been demonstrated in response to hypothyroidism in rats (2Ong J.M. Saffari B. Simsolo R.B. Kern P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in response to the treatment of humans and rats with diabetes (18Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tavangar K. Murata Y. Pedersen M.E. Goers J.F. Hoffman A.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we examined the inhibition of LPL translation by epinephrine and found that the important region of the LPL mRNA was on the 3′ UTR (6Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, we further defined the effects of epinephrine on LPL translation. The factor mediating the translation inhibition was not ubiquitous because extracts from C2 cells and fibroblasts did not affect LPL translation in the reticulocyte system, in contrast to extracts from adipocyte cell lines. Extracts from epinephrine-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells, which are known to express LPL (20Rojas C. Enerbäck S. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), also inhibited LPL translation in vitro, although to a lesser extent than did the extracts from adipocyte cell lines. To further characterize the region of the 3′ UTR involved in this interaction, constructs were prepared that contained various deletions and added to the in vitro translation reaction. These studies suggested that the proximal 3′ UTR was essential to translational inhibition by an epinephrine-treated cell extract. This was confirmed by adding the LPL 3′ UTR to a heterologous mRNA followed by transient transfection into adipocytes. Epinephrine inhibited expression of the reporter gene only when the 3′ UTR contained the initial 24 nucleotides of the LPL 3′ UTR. Additional studies demonstrated that the coding region of LPL mRNA was not involved in translational regulation. Together, these studies demonstrated that the motif for translational inhibition of LPL is contained within the first 24 nucleotides of the 3′ UTR and that upstream and downstream elements either were not involved in the translational regulation or were dependent on interactions with the proximal 3′ UTR. These studies with the epinephrine-treated cell extract, including the competition with sense RNA strands, suggested the presence of a trans-acting binding protein. To demonstrate the presence of such a protein, the cytoplasmic extract was permitted to interact with 32P-labeled LPL 3′ UTR sequence, followed by treatment with RNase. Using this technique, a protein with a subunit size of 30 kDa was protected from RNase. Because this protein was not found in control cells or in fibroblast extracts (which do not inhibit LPL translation in vitro), this 30-kDa protein is likely to be the protein responsible for the translation inhibition. The regulation of translation has been well characterized in other systems (21Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Ferritin is regulated at the level of initiation by a trans-acting protein that binds to a region of secondary structure on the 5′ untranslated region of ferritin mRNA (22Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1989; 246: 870-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Enzyme (Basel). 1990; 44: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Munro H.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Other studies have implicated changes in the 3′ UTR of mRNA in the regulation of translation (25Jackson R.J. Standart N. Cell. 1990; 62: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The same protein that regulates ferritin mRNA initiation binds to an iron response element on the 3′ UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA, resulting in the inhibition of mRNA degradation. The 3′ UTR is involved in the inhibition of translation of γ-interferon in Xenopus oocytes (26Kruys V. Wathelket M. Poupart P. Contreras R. Flers W. Content J. Huez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 89: 6030-6034Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and creatine kinase in the U937 cell line (27Ch'ng J.L. Shoemaker D.L. Schimmel P. Holmes E.W. Science. 1990; 245: 1003-1006Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies with ornithine decarboxylase, which is under the translational control of polyamines, have demonstrated coordinated regulation of translation by both the 5′ and 3′ UTRs (28Kahana C. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15390-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Grens A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11810-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translational regulation of gene expression also plays an important role in development, in which many mRNAs are stored in an inactive state until they are utilized during specific stages (30Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, protamine 2 mRNA translation is inhibited during germ cell development in the testes by the binding of a phosphoprotein to the 3′ UTR of the mRNA (31Kwon Y.K. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6547-6557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, translational regulation of LPL in 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A adipocytes is mediated by a trans-acting factor that is induced by epinephrine treatment. This factor is mainly expressed in adipocytes and binds to the 3′ UTR of LPL between nucleotides 1600 and 1624. This sequence on the LPL 3′ UTR can confer translational regulation to a reporter CAT construct in vitro and to a reporter luciferase construct transfected into 3T3-F442A adipocytes. RNase protection followed by UV cross-linking analysis using the LPL 3′ UTR as probe detected the presence of a 30-kDa RNA-binding protein in S-100 extract isolated from epinephrine-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Future studies are needed to characterize the RNA-binding protein and to elucidate its physiological role.

https://openalex.org/W1975109331,"Phosphorylation and subsequent activation of p70 S6 kinase (S6K) are events that are highly conserved in the cellular response to mitogens. The neuropeptide bombesin, which is a potent mitogen for Swiss 3T3 cells, stimulated a time- and dose-dependent activation of p70S6K as determined by gel mobility shift and immune complex kinase assays. This effect was inhibited by the immunosuppressant rapamycin at 10 nM, which also completely abolished bombesin-stimulated DNA synthesis at identical concentrations. In striking contrast, the combination of bombesin and insulin in synergy stimulated maximum DNA synthesis in these cells despite persistent inhibition of p70S6K by rapamycin throughout G1. These results indicate that activation of p70S6K is not required for the transition of quiescent cells to the S phase of the cell cycle. The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on bombesin-stimulated cell cycle progression did not involve accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 but a striking inhibition of the expression of cyclin D1. This effect was circumvented by bombesin with insulin, suggesting that a rapamycin-insensitive pathway stimulated by this combination leads to cyclin D1 expression. Thus, these findings, dissociating the mitogenic effects of bombesin in synergy with insulin from activation of p70S6K, support the hypothesis that this kinase is a component of one of the parallel pathways that can lead to DNA synthesis rather than an obligatory point of convergence in mitogenic signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2103331624,"Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is one of the major regulators of eosinophilic granulocytes in vivo. IL-5 exerts its pleiotropic effects by binding to the IL-5 receptor, which is composed of an IL-5-specific α chain and a common βc chain shared with the receptors for IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Previous studies have shown that binding of IL-5 to its receptor triggers the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, the phosphatidyl −3′-kinase, and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways. Here we describe that IL-5 activates the serine/threonine protein kinase Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway. We show that IL-5 activates TPA response element (TRE)-dependent transcription in transfection experiments. TRE activation by IL-5 is mediated by a region of the βc (577-581) that is also responsible for activation of JNK/SAPK and for activation of dyad symmetry element (DSE)-dependent transcription. Dominant-negative SAPK or ERK kinase-1 was used to demonstrate that JNK/SAPK activation is necessary for induction of DSE- and TRE-dependent transcription by IL-5, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 was not essential for TRE- and DSE-dependent transcription. By contrast, IL-5-induced activation of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 seems to be a prerequisite for TRE- and DSE-dependent transcription. Taken together, we show for the first time that IL-5 activates kinases of the JNK/SAPK family, and that this activation is linked to IL-5-induced TRE- and DSE-dependent transcription.

Hirst E.M. Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the actions of human IL-5 are restricted to the eosinophil and basophil lineages, because a functional IL-5 receptor (IL-5-R) is only expressed on these cell types (5Chihara J. Plumas J.

The IL-5-R is a multimeric molecule composed of a unique α chain associated with a common βc chain, which is part of the receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF (14Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Because the βc chain is thought to play a major role in postreceptor signal transduction, it is not surprising that IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF exert multiple overlapping effects on cells that have all three receptor complexes (15Miyajima A. Hara T. Kitamura T. Trends Biochem.

Binding of IL-3, IL-5, or GM-CSF to their receptors leads to activation of multiple signal transduction pathways. Within seconds to minutes, multiple cellular proteins become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, an event essential for most biological functions of these cytokines (12van der Bruggen T. Kok P.T.M.

Because the α and βc chains of these receptors do not contain any enzymatic activity, cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases are likely to mediate this process. We and others have shown that IL-5 binding leads to rapid and transient activation of the Janus kinase JAK2 (17van der Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J.

Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, kinases such as Lyn, Syk, fyn, hck, and BTK are also activated by cytokines of this family (21Sato S. Katagiri T. Takaki S.

Activation of these signaling pathways is mediated by different functional domains in the βc chain. A membrane-proximal region containing box1, a motif found in multiple cytokine receptors, is necessary for JAK2 and STAT3 activation, induction of c-myc gene expression and cytokine-induced proliferation (23Yousefi S.

A more distal region between amino acids 542 and 589 was shown to be involved in activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway mediated by Shc binding to the βc chain and for induction of transcription of the immediate-early genes c-jun and c-fos (24Sakamaki K.

Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K.-i. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 577 of the βc chain, possibly by JAK2, was shown to be at least partially responsible for activation of MAPK and c-fos, although also other tyrosine residues are likely to play an important role (28Itoh T.

In addition, the proline-rich region of the α chain was also shown to be involved in activation of different pathways, such as the JAK2/STAT pathway and cytokine-induced proliferation (27Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.

Immediate-early gene expression in response to a wide array of different extracellular stimuli is regulated by a limited amount of cis-acting response elements in the promoters of the induced genes. Among these, the TPA-response element (TRE) binds transcription factors of the Jun/AP-1 family (reviewed in Refs. 32Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3223) Google Scholar and 33Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). This element mediates transcriptional activation by stimuli such as phorbol esters, UV light, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IL-2, and stress induced by heat shock or protein synthesis inhibitors (33Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Jun/AP-1 transcription factors are homo- or heterodimeric proteins that are activated by serine and threonine phosphorylation. The kinases that are responsible for these phosphorylations were described recently as a novel family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, also known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs); reviewed in Refs. 34Davis R.J.

The JNK/SAPKs themselves are activated by dual phosphorylation at conserved threonine and tyrosine residues, after which they phosphorylate AP-1 members such as c-Jun and ATF2 and stimulate their transcriptional activity (34Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 35Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem.

Another cis-acting element frequently found in promoters of immediate-early genes is the dyad symmetry element (DSE) or serum response element (SRE), which was first identified in the promoter of the c-fos proto-oncogene (reviewed in Ref. 37Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The DSE/SRE binds multiple transcription factors, including the serum response factor and the ternary complex factor (TCF) ELK-1 (37Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 38Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Mitogenic stimulation leads to a rapid phosphorylation of both serum response factor and TCF/ELK-1, leading to enhanced DNA binding by serum response factor and, more importantly, enhanced transcriptional activation by TCF/ELK-1 (37Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 38Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In contrast to phosphorylation of Jun proteins, phosphorylation of TCF/ELK-1 is likely to be mediated by the classical MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 (38Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar–40Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), although in was more recently shown that the SRE can also be activated in response to JNK/SAPKs (41Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 42Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the effects of IL-5 on TRE- and DSE-mediated transcription. Here we show that IL-5 efficiently activates TRE- and DSE-containing promoters. We present evidence that this is likely to be mediated by activation of JNK/SAPKs. Moreover, we identify the regions in the IL-5-R α and βc chains responsible for these effects. Finally, we suggest that activation of JAK2 by IL-5 precedes and is necessary for activation of JNK/SAPKs and TRE- and DSE-dependent transcription. Rat-1, P19EC, and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Human TF-1 and mouse BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal clone I serum (Hyclone), 50 μm β-mercapthoethanol, and human IL-5 (20 pM for TF1) or mouse IL-3 (0.1 nM for BaF3). Human IL-5 (hIL-5) was a kind gift of Dr. D.

Other βc mutants were generated by progressive deletions using βc 763 and the erase-a-base kit (Promega Corp.).

For transfection experiments, COS-1 cells were subcultured in six-well dishes (Costar), and 3 h later, the cells were transfected with 10-20 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA as described previously (27Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.

Rat-1 and P19EC cells were transfected 16 h after splitting. Following 16-20 h exposure to the calcium-phosphate precipitate, medium was refreshed, and cells were incubated for 16 h with IL-5 (0.5 pM). Rat-1 cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum 8 h prior to the addition of IL-5. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested for CAT assays or Immuno-kinase assays. CAT assays were performed as follows. Cells were lyzed by repeated freeze-thawing in 250 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mM EDTA. Twenty-five μg of cellular extract were then incubated in a total volume of 100 μl containing 250 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2% glycerol, 0.3 mM butyryl coenzyme A, and 0.05 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol for 2 h at 37°C. Reaction products were then extracted using 400 μl of xylene:pristane (1:2), and the percentage of acetylated products was then determined using liquid scintillation counting. Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-5-stimulated cells following a procedure described previously (27Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J.

Oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in the cohesive ends with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Gel retardation assays were carried out according to published procedures with slight modifications. Briefly, nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 ng of 32P-labeled collagenase TRE oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature. Complexes were then separated though nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were incubated for 3 h in phosphate-free medium containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then stimulated with cytokines, and subsequently the cells were lyzed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged to remove DNA and cellular debris. The cell lysates were incubated with the anti-Jun polyclonal antibody for 2 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for 30′ at 4°C, washed five times with lysis buffer, and boiled in 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer. The proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid), dried, and exposed to X-ray films (Kodak) or analyzed using a phosphorimager (Applied Biosystems). For immune-kinase assays, cells were lyzed in JNK/SAPK lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% TX-100, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin, and 1 mM benzamidine), and JNK/SAPK protein was precipitated using the 12Ca5 antibody (for transfected cells) or the JNK/SAPK polyclonal antibody (SC-572 for endogenous JNK/SAPK) and protein A-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, and 2 mM dithiothreitol) containing 10 μg of GST-Jun and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was performed for 20 min at 30°C, after which the reaction was terminated by adding 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer. Proteins were then separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels, after which the gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film.

We, therefore, set out to determine whether IL-5 was able to activate transcription of reporter constructs containing a TRE, the natural Jun binding site from the collagenase promoter (32Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3223) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we transfected Rat-1 cells with the IL-5 R α and βc chains and different CAT reporter constructs. IL-5 was able to increase CAT activity in cells transfected with a reporter containing three copies of the TRE linked to the tk promoter (TREtkCAT) but failed to activate this reporter without TRE sites (Fig. 1A). This effect was not restricted to the tk promoter, because IL-5 also activated a CAT construct containing three TREs coupled to a synthetic minimal tata box (TRETATACAT) but not the enhancerless TATACAT reporter (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained in P19 EC and COS-1 cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that IL-5 can activate TRE-dependent transcription in these cell types. Previously, it was shown that activation of different signaling pathways can be assigned to different domains of the βc chain of the IL-5 and GM-CSF receptors (24Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T.

We, therefore, tested a previously described set of carboxyl-terminal deletions of the βc chain for IL-5-dependent activation of the TRETATACAT reporter. Deletion of the most carboxyl-terminal 254 amino acids (627) did not alter the effect of IL-5 on TRE-dependent CAT activity (Fig. 1B). However, further deletion of 85 amino acids (542) resulted in a complete loss of IL-5-induced TREtataCAT activity. This region (542-627) was described previously to be involved in activation of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway by GM-CSF (28Itoh T. Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7587-7592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To be able to localize the residues of the βc chain involved in TRE activation more precisely, we generated a new set of βc chain mutants using S1 nuclease. As shown in Fig. 1C, deletion down to amino acid 581 did not significantly decrease IL-5-induced TREtataCAT activity. Interestingly, further deletion of 4 amino acids (577) resulted in a complete loss of IL-5-induced TRE activity (Fig. 1C), which was also observed in P19 EC cells (data not shown). The expression of all mutants was verified by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-βc antibody (data not shown). Therefore, the region of the βc chain around tyrosine 577 is likely to be involved in activation of TRE-dependent transcription upon IL-5 stimulation. It was suggested previously that the βc chain of the IL-5-R is the major player in IL-5-induced signal tra"
https://openalex.org/W2013037204,"A cDNA clone coding for a novel oxidoreductase was cloned from a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line KM-102. We screened a cDNA library constructed from the mRNA of KM-102 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore A23187 using a 32P-labeled 15-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-TAAATAAATAAATAA-3′) probe. This probe was designed as a complementary sequence to the three reiterated AUUUA sequences, which are contained in the 3′-untranslated regions of cytokine and some proto-oncogene mRNAs and correlate with rapid mRNA turnover. Then, we obtained one cDNA clone, and further sequence analysis revealed that it coded for a new protein exhibiting 30 to ∼40% homology with glutathione reductase. By fusion protein analysis, this protein showed reducing activities on 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol and 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) but only a weak reducing activity on oxidized glutathione. Although it lacked a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in its N terminus, it was secreted by monkey kidney-derived COS-1 cells when we introduced the expression plasmid into them and also secreted by a human lung carcinoma cell line A549. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA turnover of this protein was regulated by inflammatory stimuli in KM-102 cells. These results show that this protein may have scavenging enzyme properties and has its mRNA expression regulated in a similar fashion to cytokine genes or proto-oncogenes. Thus, we named it KDRF (KM-102-derivedreductase-like factor), and KDRF may play a role in scavenging reactive oxygen intermediates, which are possibly toxic to cells, in response to inflammatory stimuli.

Through the activation of a variety of ROI-producing enzymes in response to exogenous stimuli, ROIs are produced in all cells. The representative ROIs are superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (-OH·;)(1-3). Because excessive accumulation of ROIs is toxic (1Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar, 4Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar), the intracellular level of ROIs is tightly regulated by several small antioxidant molecules (e.g. reduced glutathione), which contain sulfhydryl groups, and ROI-scavenging enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have inducible defenses to counter oxidative damage (5Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Chan E.

In fact, it has been reported that the mRNA of glutathione reductase (GR) or manganous superoxide dismutase was induced in human cells and cell lines by stimulation with lectin, tumor necrosis factor, or interleukin-1 (IL-1)(14, 15). But the mechanism(s) by which cells receive and respond to exogenous stimuli, including the induction mechanism(s) of the mRNAs of ROI-scavenging enzymes, has not yet been elucidated. reactive oxygen intermediate glutathione reductase yeast GR human GR interleukin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate lipopolysaccharide(s) base pair(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium maltose binding protein polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis oxidized glutathione 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). On the other hand, the control of transcription of many transiently expressed genes, such as cytokine genes and proto-oncogenes, has extensively been studied using exogenous stimuli. These experiments have shown that this class of mRNAs rapidly increased in cells by a signal(s) with the exogenous stimuli because it gives rise to a temporary block in specific mRNA degradation through protein synthesis (16Thorens B. Mermod J-J. Vassalli P. Cell. 1987; 48: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). But the accumulation of the mRNAs is not maintained for a long time, and after receiving the signal, the amount of mRNAs in the cells rapidly decreases. A common feature of these rapid turnover mRNAs is that they all have reiterated or dispersed AUUUA sequences in their 3′-untranslated regions (17Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar), and several studies have demonstrated that the presence of the reiterated or dispersed AUUUA sequences in the 3′-untranslated regions of the mRNAs correlated with rapid mRNA degradation (17Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 18Meijlink F. Curran T. Miller A.D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1987; 7: 4513-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, this class of mRNAs is posttranscriptionally regulated, and the AUUUA sequences are believed to be involved in the selective degradation of transiently expressed mRNAs. In the case of scavenging enzymes, although mRNAs of GR and manganous superoxide dismutase also transiently increase with exogenous stimuli, their mRNAs do not have such reiterated or dispersed AUUUA sequences in their 3′-untranslated regions (21Tutic M. Lu X. Schirmer R.H. Werner D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Ho Y-S. Crapo J.D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), except that mRNA of human catalase has three dispersed AUUUA sequences in its 3′-untranslated region (23Bell G.I. Najarian R.C. Mullenbach G.T. Hallewell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5561-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship between such scavenging enzymes and the AUUUA sequences has yet to be discussed. In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a novel oxidoreductase from a human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line KM-102 (24Harigaya K. Handa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3477-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using a complementary probe to the AUUUA sequences. We named it KDRF (KM-102-derived reductase-like factor) and demonstrated that this molecule may have scavenging enzyme properties and has its mRNA expression regulated in a similar fashion to cytokine genes or some proto-oncogenes also. The findings suggest that KDRF may play a role in scavenging ROIs, especially in response to inflammatory stimuli. Human stromal cell line KM-102 was a kind gift from Drs. K. Harigaya and H. Handa. KM-102 cells were cultured with Iscove's modified minimum essential medium (Boehringer Mannheim) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in plastic culture dishes with a diameter of 15 cm. After growing the cells confluently, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) and calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) were added to the culture at 10 ng/ml and 0.2 μM, respectively. After cultivation for 3, 6, or 14 h, total RNA for each was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate extraction method (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Six hundred μg each of the total RNAs obtained in this manner were mixed, followed by oligo(dT) cellulose Type 7 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column chromatography to purify poly(A)+ RNA. Using this procedure, approximately 100 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were obtained. This poly(A)+ RNA was used for construction of a cDNA library and for Northern blot analysis. Separately, poly(A)+ RNAs were also prepared from KM-102 cells after stimulation with PMA (used at 10 ng/ml) + A23187 (used at 0.2 μM), human IL-1β (used at 25 units/ml, Genzyme Co., Cambridge, MA), or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli (used at 1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 0.5, 1, 4, or 17 h. The poly(A)+ RNAs were used for Northern blot analysis. A cDNA library was prepared in the Okayama-Berg expression vector (pcDV1 Oligo(dT)-Tailed Plasmid Primer and pL1 Oligo(dG)-Tailed Linker, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) from 5 μg of the above-mentioned poly(A)+ RNA (26Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The library was screened with a 32P-labeled synthetic 15-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TAAATAAATAAATAA-3′, prepared with a Perkin-Elmer 380B Automatic DNA Synthesizer, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) according to the method as described (27Woods D. Focus. 1984; 6: 1-3Google Scholar). Among the 6500 colonies screened, 33 positive clones were identified. A single clone, pcD-31, was selected and subjected to the second screening. For the second screening, a cDNA library was prepared from 3.3 μg of the poly(A)+ RNA using a λgt10 system (Amersham Corp.). Either a 292-bp PstI-StuI fragment (this PstI site was derived from pL1 Oligo(dG)-Tailed Linker) or a 223-bp EcoT22I-StuI fragment (PstI, StuI, and EcoT22I, Takara Shuzo Co., Ohtsu, Japan) was prepared from pcD-31 as a probe and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) using a Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.), and plaque hybridization was performed according to the standard procedure as described (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Among the 2 × 105 plaques screened, one positive clone was obtained (λ31-7). Following digestion with EcoRI (Takara Shuzo Co.), the insert cDNA of λ31-7 (3.9 kilobase pairs) was recloned in the EcoRI site of pUC18, and the resultant plasmid was named pUCKM31-7. The nucleotide sequence of this clone was determined in both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Five μg of poly(A)+ RNA of stimulated or unstimulated KM-102 cells were fractionated in a 1.0% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Corp.)(25). The blot was hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA fragment prepared from the plasmid pcD-31 (a 292-bp PstI-StuI fragment) or pUCKM31-7 (a 1006-bp SmaI-XbaI fragment; SmaI and XbaI, Takara Shuzo Co.), and the hybridization was performed overnight at 42°C in a solution of 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium dihydrogenphosphate monohydrate, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's = 0.2 g/liter bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.2 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma), and 0.2 g/liter Ficoll (Sigma)), 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). Membranes were washed once at room temperature in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) containing 0.05% SDS for 30 min, and once at 50°C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 1 h. They were exposed to x-ray films at −70°C with intensifier screens. The size of mRNA was estimated using the relative mobilities of RNA standards purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of other human cell lines and multiple human tissues were purchased from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA) and used for hybridization with the probe. The same membranes were reprobed with human β-actin to verify the amount of poly(A)+ RNA in each lane. After digestion of the pUCKM31-7 plasmid DNA with HindIII (Takara Shuzo Co.) and isolation of the 3003-bp fragment containing the cDNA insert, the terminals were blunted using a DNA blunting kit (Takara Shuzo Co.). A high expression plasmid pcDL-SRα296 (29Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with PstI and KpnI (Takara Shuzo Co.). After similarly blunting the terminals and following dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase (derived from E. coli, Takara Shuzo Co.), it was coupled with the above-mentioned cDNA fragment in a reaction using T4 DNA ligase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies) was then transformed with this DNA, and the strain in which the direction of the cDNA transcription was identical to the direction of the SRα promoter was selected, and this plasmid was named pSRα31-7. Monkey kidney-derived COS-1 cells were transfected with pSRα31-7. COS-1 cells were cultured in a flask (150 cm2) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 cells were collected by trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) from the flask in which they were grown to semiconfluence and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered salts (PBS(−) buffer, Takara Shuzo Co.). Next, the cells were suspended in PBS(−) buffer at 2 × 107 cells/ml. The plasmid DNA prepared using the cesium chloride method (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) was dissolved in PBS(−) buffer at 200 μg/ml. Twenty μl each of the above-mentioned cell suspension and DNA solution were mixed, and the mixture was placed in a chamber containing electrodes at intervals of 2 mm (FTC-13, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Transfection of COS-1 cells was performed with the electroporation method (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989: 1.8.6-1.8.7Google Scholar) using the GTE-1 (Shimadzu Co.) gene introduction device available, and 600-V/30 μs pulses were then applied twice at 1-s intervals. After cooling the chamber at 4°C for 5 min, the cell-DNA mixture inside was added to 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Then, the cells were cultured overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere after being transferred to a Petriplate (ϕ 90 × 20 mm). After culturing overnight, the culture supernatant was removed. The cells were then washed with serum-free DMEM, and 10 ml of serum-free DMEM were added followed by culturing for an additional 3 days. The cell supernatant was then collected from the culture. pUCKM31-7 DNA was digested with HindIII. After isolation and purification of the 3003-bp fragment containing the cDNA insert, the terminals were blunted using a DNA blunting kit. The fragment was then further digested with XbaI, and a fragment containing an open reading frame was purified. A fusion expression vector pMAL-c (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) was also digested with XbaI and StuI, followed by dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase, and the above-mentioned HindIII (modified)-XbaI fragment containing the cDNA was coupled with this expression vector in a reaction using T4 DNA ligase. E. coli TB-1 strain (New England BioLabs) was transformed with this DNA, and the plasmids were analyzed. The strain in which the direction of the cDNA transcription was identical to the direction of the promoter was selected, and this plasmid was named pMAL31-7. Next, we tried to reconstruct pMAL31-7 as another type of fusion plasmid that starts with Lys49 in pUCKM31-7 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as illustrated in Fig. 1. This Lys49 corresponds to the first amino acid in the shortest type of this protein which is secreted by COS-1 cells. We synthesized five oligonucleotides (oligo i to v) with a Perkin-Elmer Automated DNA Synthesizer 394: i, 5′-GATGACAAA1AGCTACTA-3′; ii, 5′-CATAGGATGCTCCAACAA-3′; iii, 5′-TCGAGCTCGGTACCCGATGACGATGACAAAA1AGCTACTA-3′; iv, 5′-TAGTAGCTT1TTTGTCATCGTCATCGGGTACCGAGCTCGA-3′; and v, 5′-TCGAGCTCGGTACCCGAT-3′. In oligos i, iii, and iv, A1 and T1 correspond to A241 in the pUCKM31-7 cDNA sequence (Fig. 2b). Oligo ii is a complementary sequence of the pUCKM31-7 cDNA (from 836 to 853 in Fig. 2b). Oligos iii and iv are complementary sequences to each other including the enterokinase recognition and KpnI sites (Fig. 1).Fig. 2The restriction maps, nucleotide sequence, and predicted amino acid sequence of the pUCKM31-7 cDNA. a, restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of the cDNAs of pUCKM31-7 and pcD-31.

The numbers to the left and below each line refer to the nucleotide positions and amino acid positions, respectively. Comparison of the pUCKM31-7 cDNA sequence with that of the pcD-31 cDNA sequence revealed that the former sequence lacks a poly(A) tail. The probable methionine initiation codon is used for numbering the amino acids, and amino acids in the open reading frame following this methionine are indicated. The valine residue at position 24 and the lysine residue at position 49 are at the N-terminals of the proteins secreted by transfected COS-1 cells and are indicated by the open and closed triangles, respectively.

The PCR reaction was carried out at 72°C for 3 min, then a reaction consisting of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min was repeated for 30 cycles, and finally a reaction was carried out at 72°C for 10 min (we called this amplified fragment, fragment A). All of the PCR reactions were conducted using a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler 480. Three μg each of oligos iii and iv were annealed in annealing buffer (7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaCl, and 7 mM MgCl2) at 70°C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature (this annealed fragment was called fragment B). The second PCR was carried out under the same cycle conditions in a reaction mixture containing 100 pmol of each of the primers ii and v, 5 μg of fragment A and fragment B as templates, 10 μl of 10-fold concentration Taq polymerase reaction buffer solution, and 5 units of Taq polymerase in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Following PCR, 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed to purify the amplified DNA product. After purification of this amplified fragment, we digested it with KpnI and SmaI. pMAL31-7 DNA were also digested with KpnI and SmaI, followed by dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. The amplified fragment was then coupled with the dephosphorylated pMAL31-7 DNA in a reaction with T4 DNA ligase. E. coli DH10B (BRL) was transformed with this DNA, and the transformed strains were analyzed. We selected one strain and named this plasmid pMAL-K. It was confirmed that no abnormalities existed in the portion, in which the fragment was inserted, by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of this portion of pMAL-K. The fusion proteins produced in E. coli were purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography as recommended by the supplier (New England BioLabs). This cloning procedure is shown in Fig. 1. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was conducted using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Corp.). Rabbit antisera were raised using the affinity purified pMAL31-7 fusion protein. These antisera were used for Western blot analysis. Molecular weight markers were purchased from Bio-Rad. A human lung carcinoma cell line A549 was purchased from Dainihon Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan), and A549 cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells were grown to semiconfluence, the culture supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM. Then, serum-free DMEM was added, and the serum-free culture supernatant was collected after 3 days of cultivation. Serum-free conditioned medium (10 liters) of COS-1 cells transfected with the pSRα31-7 expression plasmid DNA was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The dialyzed sample was applied to 10 ml of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) contained in an XK16/20 column (ϕ 2.0 × 20 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with a 0-0.5 M linear gradient of NaCl in the 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, buffer. After collecting fractions (these fractions were monitored by Western blot) which were eluted at NaCl concentrations from 0.1 to 0.4 M, they were combined and dialyzed against 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Next, we performed an affinity chromatography using 10 ml of 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) contained in an XK16/20 column, and fractions were eluted with a 0-10 mM linear gradient of NADPH in the 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol buffer. The fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and detection of bands was performed with silver staining and Western blot analysis. After collecting fractions that contained the predicted pSRα31-7 coding protein, they were combined, and we electrophoresed it on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred it electrophoretically to a polyvinylidine difluoride film (ProBlot, Perkin-Elmer). The areas corresponding to the three bands of pSRα31-7 coding proteins were cut out for protein microsequencing. Amino-terminal sequence determination was carried out on a gas-phase protein sequencer (PPSQ-10, Shimadzu Co.). Fusion protein derived from pMAL-K and protein from pMAL-c, which expresses only MBP, were purified with affinity chromatography and dialyzed against 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 5 mM EDTA (0.01 M phosphate buffer, subsequently referred to as PB). The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). All assays were done at room temperature using a Beckman DV 7500 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Reducing activities were defined as Δ absorbance/min/mg of protein. Ten μl of 10 mM GSSG (Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.01 M PB were added to 300 μl of 0.01 M PB containing the purified fusion protein, MBP, or yeast GR (yGR, Boehringer Mannheim). Then, 10 μl of 6.4 mM NADPH (Boehringer Mannheim) in 5% sodium bicarbonate were added to the mixture, and absorbance at 340 nm was monitored at room temperature for 3 min. Three hundred μl of 50 μM DCIP (Sigma) in 0.01 M PB were added to 100 μl of 0.01 M PB containing the fusion protein, MBP, or yGR. Then, 10 μl of 6.4 mM NADPH in 5% sodium bicarbonate were added to the mixture, and absorbance at 600 nm was monitored at room temperature for 3 min. Fifty μl of 10 mM DTNB (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) in 0.01 M PB were added to 200 μl of 0.01 M PB containing the fusion protein, MBP, or yGR. Then, 10 μl of 6.4 mM NADPH in 5% sodium bicarbonate were added to the mixture, and absorbance at 412 nm was monitored at room temperature for 3 min. An Okayama-Berg expression library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of KM-102 cells, which had been stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) + A23187 (0.2 μM) for 3, 6, or 14 h, was screened with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe (5′-TAAATAAATAAATAA-3′). Among the 6500 clones screened, 33 clones were hybridized with this probe. We selected one clone, pcD-31, and subjected it to further analysis. The pcD-31 clone was 491 bp in length excluding poly(A). However, Northern blot analysis of the poly(A)+ RNA from KM-102 cells revealed that the full-length mRNA of pcD-31 was approximately 3.9 kb. To obtain the full-length cDNA clone of pcD-31, we conducted a second screening. Among the 2 × 105 plaques screened, one positive clone was obtained (λ31-7). Following digestion of the λ31-7 DNA with EcoRI, the insert was recloned in the EcoRI site of pUC18, and the resultant plasmid was named pUCKM31-7. This cDNA clone was 3815 bp in length excluding a poly(A) tail and had a single open reading frame. The first ATG codon located at nucleotide 97 from the 5′ end was followed by a 1647-nucleotide long open reading frame ending with an in-frame termination codon TGA at position 1744, and the open reading frame was, therefore, able to code for a 549-amino acid protein (Fig. 2b). The presumptive polyadenylation site, ATTAAA, was located 1851 nucleotides downstream from this TGA codon. A sequence, 5′-TTATTTATTTATTT-3′, that is complementary to the synthetic probe was located 1580 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon (Fig. 2b). Such reiterated copies of AUUUA sequences are located in the 3′-untranslated regions of many cytokine and some proto-oncogene mRNAs, as mentioned previously. Computer search on the SWISS-PROT and NBRF (PIR) protein sequence data banks showed the deduced amino acid sequence had 30 to ∼40% identity with human glutathione reductase (hGR; EC1.6.4.2)(21) and other species' GRs. A computer-aided comparison revealed 43.5% identity with probable GR of Caenorhabditis elegans (EC1.6.4.2)(32), 37.4% with Haemophilus influenzae (EC1.6.4.2)(33), 36.1% with Arabidopsis thaliana (EC1.6.4.2)(34), 36.3% with Pisum sativum (EC1.6.4.2)(35), 35.5% with human, 35.4% with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EC1.6.4.2)(36), and 34.7% with Trypanothione reductase of Trypanosoma brucei (EC1.6.4.8)(37)(Fig. 3). An alignment of the amino acid sequence of hGR with pUCKM31-7 coding protein indicated an overall sequence identity of 35.5% (Fig. 4). The homology was absolute over a well conserved 10-amino acid sequence Leu107-Gly-Gly-Thr-Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys116, referred to as the active site, and a 9-amino acid sequence Ile70-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Leu-Ala78, referred to as the FAD binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2069676127,"The bifunctional glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase from Escherichia coli catalyzes both the ATP-dependent formation of an amide bond between N1 of spermidine (N-(3-amino)propyl-1,4-diaminobutane) and the glycine carboxylate of glutathione (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and the opposing hydrolysis of this amide bond (Bollinger, J. M., Jr., Kwon, D. S., Huisman, G. W., Kolter, R., and Walsh, C. T. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14031-14041). In our previous work describing its initial characterization, we proposed that the 619-amino acid (70 kDa) protein might possess separate amidase (N-terminal) and synthetase (C-terminal) domains. In the present study, we have confirmed this hypothesis by expression of independently folding and functional amidase and synthetase modules. A fragment containing the C-terminal 431 amino acids (50 kDa) has synthetase activity only, with steady-state kinetic parameters similar to the full-length protein. A fragment containing the N-terminal 225 amino acids (25 kDa) has amidase activity only and is significantly activated relative to the full-length protein for hydrolysis of glutathionylspermidine analogs. This observation suggests that the amidase activity in the full-length protein is negatively autoregulated. The amidase active site catalyzes hydrolysis of amide and ester derivatives of glutathione (e.g. glutathione ethyl ester and glutathione amide) but lacks activity toward acetylspermidine (N1 and N8) and acetylspermine (N1), indicating that glutathione provides the primary recognition determinants for glutathionylspermidine amide bond cleavage. No metal ion is required for the amidase activity. A tetrahedral phosphonate analogue of glutathionylspermidine, designed as a mimic of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate for either reaction, inhibits the synthetase activity (Ki∼ 10 μM) but does not inhibit the amidase activity.

The polyamine, spermidine (N-(3-amino)propyl-1,4-diaminobutane), and the tripeptide, glutathione (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly, abbreviated GSH), are present at high concentrations (0.1-10 mM) in most cells (see, for example, Refs. 1Tabor C.W.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for reviews). With its redox active cysteine thiol, GSH is the primary small-molecule antioxidant in many cells, serving to maintain redox poise and reductively scavenge reactive oxygen species. It is catalytic in these roles by virtue of glutathione reductase, which maintains GSH in active, reduced form. As a polycation, spermidine complexes with nucleic acids, proteins, and phospholipids, thereby influencing their structures and biological properties (3Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). An intriguing link between GSH and spermidine metabolism is found in the protozoal parasites of genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania, including those that cause African sleeping sickness, South American Chagas' disease, and various afflictions known collectively as leishmaniases. In these parasites, it appears that the bis(glutathionyl)spermidine conjugate, trypanothione (see Scheme 1 for structure), has appropriated the important antioxidant roles normally played by GSH (4Fairlamb A.H.

Because trypanothione appears to have important roles in these pathogens and is not present in their hosts, its metabolism is an obvious target for design of new antiparasitic drugs. The synthesis of trypanothione from glutathione and spermidine is catalyzed by glutathionylspermidine (GSP) 1The abbreviations used are: GSPglutathionylspermidineBis-Tris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneDTTDL-dithiothreitolPCRpolymerase chain reactionDCC1,3-dicyclohexyl carbodiimideDMFN,N-dimethylformamideMCCAmixed carboxylate carbonate anhydrideOBnO-benzylmpmelting pointPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisEtOAcethyl acetate. synthetase and trypanothione synthetase (11Smith K.

The intermediate in this pathway, glutathionylspermidine, was first identified in Escherichia coli more than 3 decades before the discovery of trypanothione itself, and a GSP synthetase activity was partially purified (13Dubin D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1959; 1: 262Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

As part of an ongoing investigation of the enzymology and physiology associated with these glutathione-spermidine conjugates, we recently characterized GSP synthetase from E. coli (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We purified the enzyme, isolated and sequenced its gene, overproduced it, and characterized the recombinant protein. We were surprised to discover that the 70-kDa protein possesses a second catalytic activity: hydrolysis of glutathionylspermidine back to glutathione and spermidine. As the net of these two activities is hydrolysis of ATP (i.e. futile cycling), we proposed that reciprocal regulation of its activities might be an important feature of the bifunctional enzyme. In addition, because the synthetase activity was selectively abrogated by proteolytic cleavage after Arg-538 of the 619-amino acid protein, we proposed that it might possess separate domains for its two activities (N-terminal amidase and C-terminal synthetase) (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have confirmed the hypothesis of separate domains by genetic dissection of the bifunctional protein into independently folding and functional amidase and synthetase fragments, and have characterized the fragments with respect to their steady-state kinetic constants. We have evaluated, as an inhibitor of the synthetase activity, a phosphonate analog of glutathionylspermidine designed to mimic the proposed tetrahedral intermediate. Finally, we have begun to address the question of substrate specificity and mechanism of the amidase reaction by 1) evaluating analogs of GSH, spermidine, and glutathionylspermidine as possible substrates and/or inhibitors of the reaction and 2) testing for the presence of a catalytic metal ion. Oligonucleotides were purchased from the Harvard Medical School Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology departmental biopolymer facility or from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The vector pET22b and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Construction of the vectors pJMB1 and pGSP has been described previously (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We had previously (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

A mutant plasmid from the resulting set, with the transposon inserted after nucleotide 675, was used as template to amplify a 5′ fragment of gsp (containing the amidase domain) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers were 5′-AAGGTAAACATATGAGCAAAGGAACGACCAG-3′ (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which primes in the transposon for synthesis of the antisense strand of gsp. The resulting 751-base pair PCR fragment was digested with NdeI (which cuts in primer 1) and BamHI (which cuts in the transposon just 3′ of gsp) and ligated into vector pET22b to give pAMID, which encodes an N-terminal fragment of GSP synthetase/amidase consisting of amino acids 1-225 fused to the transposon-encoded dipeptide GV. Sequencing of the plasmid by the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Core Facility confirmed that no mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. The vector pSYN was constructed to overproduce a C-terminal fragment of GSP synthetase/amidase comprising amino acids 189-619. PCR was used to amplify a 1362-base pair, 3′ fragment of the gsp gene. The template for amplification was the vector pGSP (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which contains gsp inserted in the plasmid pET22-b (Novagen) via NdeI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) restriction sites. Primer 1 (5′-ACCATTCTGGGCCATATGATCCAGACGGAAGAT-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 550-582 of gsp but introduces an NdeI site (CATATG) for cloning. Primer 2 (5′-ATATTGAATTCTTTGATTAATCCCCGTACTGATTATTC-3′) primes immediately 3′ of gsp for synthesis of the antisense strand. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI, which cuts both in primer 1 and at an internal site in gsp after nucleotide 932. The resulting 367-base pair fragment (nucleotides 565-932) was ligated with NdeI-digested pGSP (two sites resulting in excision of nucleotides 1-931 of gsp). Transformants of E. coli strain DH5α containing pSYN (with the NdeI insert in the desired orientation) were identified by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA. Sequencing of the plasmid by the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Core Facility confirmed that no mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pGSP, pAMID, or pSYN was grown aerobically in LB medium containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C to an A600 of 0.6-0.8, when protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 500 μM for full-length protein and amidase fragment or 100 μM for synthetase fragment. Cultures were incubated an additional 2-4 h and were harvested by centrifugation. A typical yield was 2.5 g of wet cell paste/liter of culture. Full-length GSP synthetase/amidase was purified from strain BL21DE3/pGSP as described previously (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

In a typical purification of the amidase fragment, cells from 2 liters of culture were resuspended and lysed as described previously (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T.

Ammonium sulfate fractionation steps were as described (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

The pellet from the 70% ammonium sulfate step was redissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA (buffer A) and dialyzed against buffer A. The desalted solution was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (2.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, and then developed with a gradient of NaCl in buffer A (50 ml of 0-100 mM, then 450 ml of 100-400 mM). GSP amidase activity of column fractions was determined by a previously described (15Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

Fractions with greatest specific activity were combined (78 ml eluting at 230-280 mM NaCl). A 10-ml aliquot of this pool was made 1 M in (NH4)2SO4 by addition of the solid. This solution was chromatographed in two 5-ml portions on a Phenyl-Superose HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.25), 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA (buffer B) containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4. After loading, the column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4 and then developed with a gradient of decreasing (NH4)2SO4 concentration (10 ml of 1.0-0.75 M, then 80 ml of 0.75-0.25 M) in buffer B. Fractions comprising the major protein peak were combined (20 ml from two injections, eluting at 550-500 mM (NH4)2SO4). The pool was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C. SDS-PAGE analysis of the combined fractions showed the fragment to be > 90% pure (Fig. 1, lane 4). For purification of the synthetase fragment, lysis of cells (17 g of wet cell paste from 6 liters of culture), streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate fractionation steps, and desalting of redissolved ammonium sulfate pellet were carried out as described for the full-length protein (15Bollinger Jr., J.M.

The desalted protein was then loaded on a 2.5 × 25-cm DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in 50 mM Bis-Tris propane·;HCl, pH 7.15, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA (buffer C). The column was developed with a gradient of NaCl in buffer C (70 ml of 0-100 mM, 610 ml of 100-300 mM), and fractions containing synthetase activity were pooled (81 ml eluting at 120-180 mM NaCl). This solution was made 1.2 M in (NH4)2SO4 by addition of the solid and was chromatographed in 10-ml aliquots on a Phenyl-Superose HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA (buffer D) containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4. The column was developed with a gradient of decreasing (NH4)2SO4 concentration (1-0 M) in buffer D. A fraction of the synthetase activity eluted at the end of this gradient (0 M (NH4)2SO4), and the remainder eluted with H2O (free of buffer). The fractions were combined, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80°C. SDS-PAGE analysis of the combined fractions showed the fragment to be >90% pure (Fig. 1, lane 3).

Glutathione ethyl ester was purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (Switzerland). Other reagents were obtained from Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. For the DCC method, a solution of Z-Glu-OBn (3, 1.0 eq), DCC (Fluka, 1.1 eq) and hydroxybenzotriazole·;H2O (1.2 eq) in DMF (5 ml/mmol 3) was stirred at 0°C for 10 min. A mixture of the C-terminal protected dipeptide (·HCl or ·TsOH) (1.0 eq) and NMM (1.0 eq) in DMF (5 ml/mmol 3) was then added to the above solution and the reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h, then at room temperature overnight. The precipitated dicyclohexylurea was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. For the MCCA method, to a stirred solution of Z-Glu-OBn (3, 1.0 eq) in dry tetrahydrofuran (10 ml/mmol 3) was added NMM (1.0 eq), followed by i-butylchloroformate (1.1 eq) at −25°C under dry nitrogen.

For method 2, a solution of H-Ala-Gly-NH2 (1.01 g, 5.6 mmol), Boc-Glu(OSu)-OtBu (2.24 g, 5.6 mmol), and N-methylmorpholine (1.3 ml) in DMF (80 ml) was stirred for 10 h at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was partitioned between 0.1 N HCl and EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3(aq) and brine, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated to dryness. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel with CHCl3-MeOH (12:1) to give Boc-γ-Glu(α-OtBu)-Ala-Gly-NH2 (2.04 g) in 85% yield. Treatment of the protected tripeptide with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 under N2 for 30 min, evaporation of the solvent, and chromatography on Sephadex G-10 afforded γ-Glu-Ala-Gly-NH2 in 88% yield. TLC analysis of the product (n-PrOH/AcOH/H2O:10/1/5) on silica gave one spot which comigrated with the material synthesized and characterized by Method 1 above, and the 1H NMR spectra of the products from the two methods were identical. GSH amide was prepared by ammonolysis of glutathione ethyl ester. In a typical reaction, 10 ml of 2 M NH3 in methanol (Aldrich) was cannulated under N2 into a sealed, N2-purged vessel containing 0.10 g of glutathione ethyl ester, 0.052 g of dithiothreitol, and a single crystal of dimethylaminopyridine (Sigma) as catalyst. The solution was incubated at 42°C for 72 h. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography on silica with CH3Cl:MeOH:33% acetic acid (5:3:1) in water mobile phase (RF values: glutathione ethyl ester, 0.6; glutathione methyl ester, 0.5; product, 0.2). After 72 h, a 0.2-ml aliquot of 1 M dithiothreitol in methanol was added to the reaction, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The solid was redissolved in 5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. The solution was filtered through a column of 1.5 ml of Dowex AG-50 (Na+ form, Bio-Rad) to remove remaining NH4+. Fractions containing product (flow-through) were then filtered through a C18 spice cartridge (Rainin) to remove oxidized and reduced dithiothreitol (product elutes in the void volume, while dithiothreitol is retarded). Fractions containing product were evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and product was redissolved in 10 mM dithiothreitol in H2O for use. The product with RF = 0.2 was quantitatively converted to a species that comigrated with GSH by treatment with GSP synthetase/amidase. In this conversion, ammonia was produced, as detected by the glutamate dehydrogenase spectrophotometric assay described below. The quantity of NH3 released following exhaustive hydrolysis was assumed to be equal to the quantity of glutathione amide originally present. The hydroxyspermidine-containing phosphopeptide, 8 (see “Results” for structure), was prepared in a convergent synthesis based on the retrosynthetic pathway outlined previously (17Malachowski W.P.

https://openalex.org/W2172091246,"Once internalized, cell-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans are degraded to short glycosaminoglycans by the action of endoglycosidases or heparanases. We have begun to address the question of how many heparanases are responsible for this process by analyzing short heparan sulfate chains produced in vivo by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell heparanases. Short heparan sulfate chains were purified from CHO cells and labeled at the reducing end with [3H]NaBH4. Hydrolysis of the chains to monosaccharides and analysis of the 3H-sugar alcohols indicate that heparanase activities in CHO cells are endo-β-glucuronidases. The modification state of the heparanase-derived glycosaminoglycans was examined by treating the [3H]heparan sulfate chains with nitrous acid or bacterial heparin lyases, which cut the chain at specific sequences, and analyzing the products by P2 gel filtration chromatography. Two populations of short chains were identified that differ in the extent of modification on the nonreducing side of the heparanase cleavage site. One class of chains is unmodified for at least 9 residues from the reducing end, while the other group has a modified domain within 3-7 residues from the heparanase cleavage site. Our results suggest a model of heparanase action where the enzymes recognize differences in sulfate content between modified and unmodified regions and bind to sites that encompass both domains. The enzymes then cleave the glycosaminoglycan at junctions between the modified and unmodified sequences to produce the different populations of short heparan sulfate chains.

The enzymes then cleave the glycosaminoglycan at junctions between the modified and unmodified sequences to produce the different populations of short heparan sulfate chains. INTRODUCTIONHeparanases are a family of mammalian endoglycosidases that degrade long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans to shorter chains (1Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some heparanases are secreted from cells where they degrade heparan sulfate proteoglycans in basement membranes and extracellular matrices (1Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These enzymes are thought to play a role in remodeling basement membranes after injury or at inflammation sites (4Matzner Y.

Other heparanases are intracellular and are important for degrading cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans once they have been internalized (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inside cells, heparanases cleave long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans on core proteins to short chains that have an approximate Mr of 5000 (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakajima M. Irimura T.

One obvious role of the intracellular enzymes is to generate additional nonreducing ends so heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans can be efficiently degraded by lysosomal exoglycosidases (10Kresse H. Glossl J. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 60: 217-312PubMed Google Scholar). However, these heparanases may have other important functions. Cell surface proteoglycans have been shown to be receptors for growth factors (11Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 12Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enzymes (14Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and viruses (15WuDunn D. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so intracellular heparanases may act to release bound ligands from their proteoglycan receptors once the complex is internalized. Short heparan sulfate chains generated by heparanases may also regulate the interaction of a ligand with the proteoglycan in the endosome or, if the chains are secreted, at the cell surface. Heparanases could play a role in modulating the modification state of cell surface proteoglycans. Recent evidence suggests that some proteoglycans are internalized and recycled through the Golgi apparatus (16Fransson L.-Å. Edgren G. Havsmark B. Schmidtchen A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); thus, heparanases could remove a portion of the heparan sulfate in endosomes so that new chain polymerization and modification could occur when the core protein is rerouted to the Golgi. Degradation of proteoglycans by heparanases may also be an important mechanism to prevent long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans from associating with molecules that would be deleterious to the cell. For example, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease due to their association with the β-amyloid peptide (17Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R. Nochlin D. Fraser P. Kimata K. Mizotani A. Arai M. Schrier W.A. Morgan D.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 219-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Heparanases may cleave heparan sulfate chains from the core protein, thus preventing the formation of the β-amyloid-proteoglycan complex deposited in amyloid plaques.Although heparanase activities have been described in a variety of cells and tissues, not much is known about how the enzymes recognize and cleave the glycosaminoglycan chain. Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are linear chains of alternating uronic acid (GlcUA or IdceA) and GlcN sugars (18Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 75-443Crossref Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). The GlcN residues may be either N-acetylated or N-sulfated, and all four monosaccharide species may be O-sulfated (18Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 75-443Crossref Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Structural studies of heparan sulfate indicate the N- and O-sulfate groups are clustered in iduronic acid-rich domains (modified domains), which are separated by regions of (GlcNAc1-4GlcUA) disaccharide repeats that contain very little O-sulfate (unmodified domains) (19Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that heparanases cleave within the unmodified regions, since, with the exception of the small platelet enzyme that has been reported to be an endoglucosaminidase (6Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.L. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), all of the mammalian enzymes examined are endo-β-glucuronidases (7Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N.

Chem. 1982; 257: 11249-11255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies suggest overall modification of the polysaccharide is more important for enzyme recognition than a specific glycosaminoglycan sequence, because N-sulfate groups are required for heparanases to cleave the heparan sulfate substrate, but O-sulfate groups have little effect on enzyme activity (22Oldberg Å.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Finally, most heparanases can only act on heparan sulfate chains greater than or equal to 10 kDa (2Yanagishita M.

Tyrrell D.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), indicating that the length of the glycosaminoglycan chain is also important for substrate recognition.One approach to address the substrate specificity of intracellular heparanases is to characterize the short heparanase-derived products for the cleaved glycosidic bond and the modification state of the chain at the cleavage site. However, to use this approach one needs microgram quantities of the glycosaminoglycan so that enough radioactivity can be incorporated into the reducing ends of the cleaved heparan sulfate for further experiments. In previous studies examining heparanase activities from placenta (20Klein U. Von Figura K. Hoppe-Seyler Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), platelets (6Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.L. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), commercially obtained heparan sulfate or heparin was cleaved with partially purified activity, and the newly formed reducing ends were labeled. While these studies yielded useful information about the glycosidic bond cleaved by the partially purified enzymes, they were not ideal for characterizing the sequences at and around the cleavage site for a number of reasons. First, most of the heparan sulfate commercially available is obtained from liver or kidney and may have been partially degraded by intracellular heparanases in the tissue before being purified. These chains may not be the best substrate, since they may no longer have the sequences recognized or cleaved by heparanases, or the chain itself may be too small. Another problem is that in these studies, large quantities of heparan sulfate were incubated with partially purified enzymes in vitro, and the conditions of the reaction may have forced the enzyme to cleave the chain at sequences it would not normally act at in vivo. Finally, it may be important to use heparanase activities and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans from the same cellular source. Studies have shown the modification state of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans is dependent on the cell that synthesizes it (26Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Steward W.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 27Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that intracellular heparanase specificities are fine-tuned for the modified glycosaminoglycan it normally encounters. By using a commercial source of glycosaminoglycans, one may be missing the correct sequences for efficient degradation by the heparanase of interest.We have circumvented these problems by analyzing short heparan sulfate species produced by heparanases in vivo. For these studies we are using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryGlcNSO3N-sulfated glucosamineIdceA2S2-O-sulfated iduronic acidNaBH4sodium borohydride. cell heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Lysosomes in CHO cells degrade heparan sulfate chains to monosaccharides inefficiently; thus, the short heparanase-derived glycosaminoglycans can be purified from the cells, and the reducing ends can be labeled with [3H]NaBH4. Analysis of the short [3H]heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans shows there are distinct populations of heparanase-derived heparan sulfate chains in CHO cells and suggests that heparanases may recognize and cleave the heparan sulfate chain at junctions between modified and unmodified domains. Our results also indicate that there may be multiple heparanase activities in CHO cells.DISCUSSIONOur studies show that there are two populations of short, heparanase-derived heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans in CHO cells that differ in the distance of the first modified domain from the glycosidic bond cleaved by heparanases (Fig. 5). One population, class I, has relatively unmodified sequences for the first 9-13 residues from the heparanase cleavage site and remain as long oligosaccharides that elute at the void volume of a P2 gel filtration column after either low pH nitrous acid treatment (Fig. 3) or digestion with heparinase (Fig. 4). The other population of short glycosaminoglycans, class II, has modified sequences that begin within 3-7 residues from where heparanases cleaves the chain. Class II chains elute as shorter oligosaccharides after low pH nitrous acid treatment (Fig. 3) and, based on their susceptibility to heparinase, may or may not contain IdceA2S residues within the modified domain (Fig. 4). Both chain populations are produced by endo-β-glucuronidase activities that cleave a relatively unmodified sequence, since the reducing ends of at least 90% of the heparanase products have the sequence (GlcNAc1-4GlcUA). The two classes of heparanase products observed in CHO cells may be a general feature of intracellular heparanase catabolism, since similar results were seen with short heparan sulfate chains isolated from rat hepatocytes (8Kjellén L. Pertoft H. Oldberg Å. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8416-8422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or produced by partially purified placenta heparanase activities (20Klein U. Von Figura K. Hoppe-Seyler Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In these earlier studies, low pH nitrous acid converted the short heparan sulfate chains to trisaccharides and oligosaccharides that eluted at the void volume of Sephadex G-25 gel filtration columns (8Kjellén L. Pertoft H. Oldberg Å. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8416-8422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klein U. Von Figura K. Hoppe-Seyler Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the sizes of the voided oligosaccharides were not identified in either study, it is likely that they are comparable with the CHO class I products, while the trisaccharide species are comparable with the class II products.Structural analysis of heparan sulfate shows that the glycosaminoglycan is composed of alternating modified and unmodified domains (19Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Modified regions, made up of 3-7 disaccharides, are rich in GlcNSO3 and IdceA residues and are the primary sites for O-sulfation. They are separated by sequences of 14-25 (GlcNAc1-4GlcUA) disaccharides that contain few O-sulfate groups (19Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that heparanases may recognize and cleave the heparan sulfate chain at the junctions between these domains (Fig. 5). Heparanases may recognize differences in the sulfate content between the modified and unmodified regions and bind to sites on the chain that encompass both domains. The enzymes then cleave the glycosaminoglycan in a relatively unmodified sequence to generate shorter chain products. If heparanases cleave the glycosaminoglycan on the nonreducing side of the modified domain, class I chains will be generated, while if the enzymes act on the reducing side of the modified domain, the products will be class II chains (Fig. 5). In either case, the heparan sulfate substrate may sit loosely in the catalytic site, since both class I and class II products have slight variations in the distance of the first GlcNSO3 from the cleaved glycosidic bond (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Our model of heparanase action is similar to the model proposed by Schmidtchen and Fransson (40Schmidtchen A. Fransson L.Å. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). They analyzed the structure of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides from fibroblasts and found the chains to be rich in GlcUA residues, with IdceA2S sugars at the periphery of the molecules. From these findings, they proposed that the short glycosaminoglycans had been produced by heparanases that cleaved the chain at or near modified sequences (40Schmidtchen A. Fransson L.Å. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).A model where heparanases bind to both modified and unmodified regions is consistent with what is known about the substrate specificity of the enzymes. Modified domains are defined by the presence of N-sulfate groups, which have been shown to be essential for heparanases to recognize and cleave a heparan sulfate chain (22Oldberg Å. Heldin C.-H. Wasteson Å. Busch C. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Specific O-sulfate groups, found primarily in the modified regions, are not necessary for enzyme activity (22Oldberg Å. Heldin C.-H. Wasteson Å. Busch C. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This is not surprising if, as our model predicts, the enzyme only recognizes the difference in sulfate content between modified and unmodified domains. O-sulfation should promote the interaction of heparanase with the substrate, since it would increase the sulfate content of the modified domain, but binding should not be dependent on the type or arrangement of O-sulfate groups. In fact, our model would predict that the spacing and length of the modified domain within the substrate are more important for enzyme recognition than the actual sequence of uronic acid epimers and O-sulfate groups. The degree of IdceA residues in the modified domain may be important for enzyme recognition as well. Heparan sulfate chains are proposed to form a helix with 2-fold symmetry (34Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasiskeharan R. Crit. Rev. in Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic and molecular modeling studies indicate that IdceA residues may exist in two conformations that will determine how charged functional groups are oriented to the helix (34Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasiskeharan R. Crit. Rev. in Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The IdceA in the modified domains may orient the glycosaminoglycan so that the increased sulfate content of the region is emphasized and thus facilitate the binding of heparanase to the heparan sulfate substrate. Our model would also explain the size dependence of heparanase substrates. Studies in vivo and in vitro suggest that heparan sulfate chains must be at least 10 kDa in order to be cleaved by heparanases (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klein U. Von Figura K. Hoppe-Seyler Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25LaPierre F. Holme K. Lam L. Tressler R.J. Storm N. Wee J. Stack R.J. Castellot J. Tyrrell D.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which would be the minimum size of a heparan sulfate chain that is composed of one modified domain and one unmodified domain of average sizes. 3The molecular weight of a chain consisting of one modified and one unmodified domain was calculated by assuming an average molecular weight of 500 g/mol for a modified disaccharide, and an average molecular weight of 400 g/mol for an unmodified disaccharide. A chain with an average modified domain of 5 disaccharides and an average unmodified domain of 20 disaccharides would have an estimated molecular mass of 10.5 kDa (2.5 kDa of modified domain plus 8 kDa of unmodified domain).How many heparanases are required to generate class I and class II chains? Since our studies characterized short heparan sulfate chains formed in vivo, it is possible they were produced by multiple enzymes. Indeed, the simplest explanation for the formation of class I and class II products is that they were generated by separate heparanase activities. Each enzyme would recognize the substrate by differences in sulfate content between modified and unmodified regions but would bind the chain so that modified domains are oriented differently at the catalytic site. At the present time we do not know how many heparanases exist in CHO cells. We have preliminary evidence for two separate CHO-heparanase activities; 4A. Hassell, C. Sanderson and K.J. Bame, unpublished results. however, further work is necessary to establish whether each activity catalyzes the formation of one or both classes of heparanase products. INTRODUCTIONHeparanases are a family of mammalian endoglycosidases that degrade long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans to shorter chains (1Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some heparanases are secreted from cells where they degrade heparan sulfate proteoglycans in basement membranes and extracellular matrices (1Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These enzymes are thought to play a role in remodeling basement membranes after injury or at inflammation sites (4Matzner Y.

Other heparanases are intracellular and are important for degrading cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans once they have been internalized (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inside cells, heparanases cleave long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans on core proteins to short chains that have an approximate Mr of 5000 (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakajima M. Irimura T.

One obvious role of the intracellular enzymes is to generate additional nonreducing ends so heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans can be efficiently degraded by lysosomal exoglycosidases (10Kresse H. Glossl J. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 60: 217-312PubMed Google Scholar). However, these heparanases may have other important functions. Cell surface proteoglycans have been shown to be receptors for growth factors (11Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 12Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enzymes (14Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and viruses (15WuDunn D. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so intracellular heparanases may act to release bound ligands from their proteoglycan receptors once the complex is internalized. Short heparan sulfate chains generated by heparanases may also regulate the interaction of a ligand with the proteoglycan in the endosome or, if the chains are secreted, at the cell surface. Heparanases could play a role in modulating the modification state of cell surface proteoglycans. Recent evidence suggests that some proteoglycans are internalized and recycled through the Golgi apparatus (16Fransson L.-Å. Edgren G. Havsmark B. Schmidtchen A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); thus, heparanases could remove a portion of the heparan sulfate in endosomes so that new chain polymerization and modification could occur when the core protein is rerouted to the Golgi. Degradation of proteoglycans by heparanases may also be an important mechanism to prevent long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans from associating with molecules that would be deleterious to the cell. For example, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease due to their association with the β-amyloid peptide (17Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R. Nochlin D. Fraser P.

S., Dedman, J. R., Shears, S. B., and Nelson, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 14092-14097). The molecular mechanisms that regulate the cellular levels of this signal are not characterized. To pursue this problem we have now studied the 1-kinase that deactivates inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate. The enzyme was purified from rat liver 1600-fold with a 1% yield. The native molecular mass was determined to be 46 kDa by gel filtration. The Km values for inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate and ATP were 0.3 and 10.6 μM, respectively. The kinase was unaffected by either protein kinase A or protein kinase C. Increases in Ca2+ concentration from 0.1 to 1-2 μM inhibited activity by 10-20%. Most importantly, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was shown to be a potent (Ki = 0.2 μM), specific, and competitive inhibitor of the 1-kinase.

The agonist-mediated activation of phospholipase C and the resulting increased rate of hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate releases Ins(1,4,5)P3, 1Inositol lipids and inositol phosphates are abbreviated according to IUPAC nomenclature, e.g. Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (see Biochem.

Other abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. which mobilizes cellular Ca2+ stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The fact that the pathway by which Ins(1,4,5)P3 is metabolized is complex has led to the speculation that one or more of the many downstream metabolites might serve important cellular functions (2Downes C.P. Macphee C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Hughes P.J. Michell R.H. Curr. Opin.

W., Jr., ed), Vol. 26, pp. 63–92, Raven Press, New York.Google Scholar). Support for this opinion has come mainly from research into the actions of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, the product of 3-kinase-directed phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. As a result of many studies, there is now considerable evidence that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 augments Ins(1,4,5)P3-initiated Ca2+ mobilization (5Irvine, R. F., (1992) Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research, (Putney, J. W., Jr., ed), Vol. 26, pp. 161–185, Raven Press, New York.Google Scholar). Yet the search for other signaling functions of additional inositol polyphosphates continues at several laboratories. Attention has come to focus on a somewhat distant metabolic relative of Ins(1,4,5)P3, namely Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. The latter was first identified in mammalian cells in 1988, at which time it was noted that its levels increased substantially upon receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C (6Stephens L.R.

Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We subsequently proposed that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was an “orphan” second messenger (8Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K.

Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The first indication of what the function of this messenger might be came from work by Barrett, Traynor-Kaplan, and colleagues with the T84 colonic epithelial cell line (10Kachintorn U. Vajanaphanich M. Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C671-C676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C859-C868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They drew attention to a correlation during receptor activation between the bulk InsP4 content of the cell and the uncoupling of the customary ability of Ca2+ to stimulate Cl− secretion. This prompted a study in which we treated T84 cells with cell-permeant analogues of inositol phosphates (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor- Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The results indicated that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was the specific InsP4 isomer responsible for inhibiting Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P.

We subsequently consolidated this idea by demonstrating that the Ca2+-dependent Cl− conductance was directly inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 when it was microinjected into the T84 cell (13Xie W.

Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 had a similar effect when injected into CFPAC-1 cells, an adrenal carcinoma cell line deficient in cAMP-activated Cl− transport (14Ho M.W.Y. Shears S.B. Bruzik K.S. Duszyk M. French A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, the cloned calcium-activated chloride channel from bovine trachea has also been shown to be directly inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (15Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In all three of these electrophysiological studies (13Xie W.

Thus, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 may now be considered to be an authentic intracellular signal with the potential to modulate many of the physiological processes that require chloride channel activity: salt and fluid secretion, pH balance, neurotransmission, osmoregulation, and volume-dependent metabolic effects (16Korn S.J.

This has increased the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the synthesis and metabolic inactivation of this inositol polyphosphate. A particularly important aspect of this problem is to establish how the activation of phospholipase C is coupled to changes in cellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. We have proposed that this cannot be explained as a simple mass action effect (8Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). That is, we have argued that a receptor-mediated increase in Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 concentration does not reflect a nonspecific accumulation of downstream metabolites of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (8Menniti F.S.

Shears S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Instead we have proposed that agonists intervene in the activities of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase/Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 1-phosphatase substrate cycle (8Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F.

Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has developed very little in the absence of any significant progress in determining the mechanism for this proposed regulatory process. In no small part, this uncertainty is due to the fact that no laboratory has yet purified the 1-phosphatase, and what we know of the 1-kinase depends almost entirely on a single paper by Stephens et al. (7Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Morris A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In that study, the enzyme in a 100,000 × g supernatant made from rat brain was enriched approximately 35-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography (7Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Morris A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No kinetic information emerged from that work. We now describe the procedures we have developed that purify the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 enzyme from a rat liver 100,000 × g supernatant. We have used these preparations to obtain the first kinetic description of this enzyme's activity. We have further investigated possible mechanisms by which this enzyme might be controlled in intact cells. We conclude that Ins(1,3,4)P3 is a physiologically important regulator of 1-kinase activity that accounts for the close relationship between phospholipase C activity and changes in intracellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. [3H]Inositol was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. or DuPont NEN. Nonradioactive Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was synthesized as described previously (13Xie W. Kaetzel M.A. Bruzik K.S. Dedman J.R. Shears S.B. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14092-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The other inositol phosphates were purchased from Calbiochem or the University of Rhode Island Foundation (Kingston, RI). Bovine serum albumin, phosphocreatine, phosphocreatine kinase, heparin agarose resin (Type II), protease inhibitors, and the calmodulin kinase fragment 290-309 were all purchased from Sigma. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B resin and Mono Q HR10/10 column was from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. and Matrex A dye resin was from Amicon. [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is not available commercially. We prepared it from [3H]inositol-labeled erythrocytes isolated from 5-day-old chicks that had been incubated for 24 h with 10 mCi of [3H]inositol/ml of packed cells at 37°C (20Stephens L.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Incubations were quenched and neutralized (20Stephens L.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and then the [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 peak was isolated by HPLC (8Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and desalted (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor- Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In order to ascertain the specific radioactivity of the [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, its mass was determined from the extent to which it inhibited partially purified Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6 kinase (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor- Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Most of the data described in this paper were obtained using a single batch of [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (specific radioactivity, 217 dpm/pmol). For this preparation, the extent of contamination of [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 with [3H]Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (less than 5%) was determined using the partially purified Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 3-kinase (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor- Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Many preliminary experiments, including those described in Table I, were performed with a different batch of [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (1.5 dpm/pmol) isolated as described above but from [3H]inositol-labeled turkey erythrocytes.Table IEnzyme stability under different conditionsTreatmentActivity remaining after 48 h%Buffer only2.11 mM sodium pyrophosphate352.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate845 mM sodium pyrophosphate9110 mM sodium pyrophosphate10010 mM phenyl phosphate415 mM glucose phosphate3.51 mM ATP (sodium salt)281 mM cAMP2920 mM (NH4)2PO42210 mM ammonium molybdate321 mM sodium vanadate5.120 mM sodium fluoride0.610% glycerol281 mM dithiothreitol8.81 μM okadaic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide24Dimethyl sulfoxide24 Open table in a new tab During purification, 10-40 μl of samples were incubated at 37°C for 10-30 min in a final volume of 100 μl containing 4000 dpm of [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (adjusted to a concentration of 5 μM with nonradioactive substrate), 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 6 mM MgSO4, 0.4 mg/ml saponin, 100 mM KCl, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μM InsP6, 5 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 2.5 Sigma units of phosphocreatine kinase. The final preparations of enzyme were also assayed using the above methods except that the quench medium did not contain InsP6. In some cases, the free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted using EGTA/Ca2+ buffers (21Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was quenched with 1 ml of ice-cold medium containing 1 mg/ml InsP6, 0.2 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid. The quenched reactions were diluted to 10 ml with water and chromatographed on Bio-Rad gravity-fed columns using AG 1-X8 ion-exchange resin. In some experiments, incubations were quenched with 40 μl of 2 M perchloric acid plus 1 mg/ml InsP6, neutralized with Freon/octylamine, and chromatographed on HPLC using a Partisphere SAX column (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor- Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Livers obtained from 200-250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with ice-cold saline and frozen at −60°C until use (freezing did not impair enzyme stability). All subsequent procedures (which took 5 days) were conducted at 0-4°C, and all the column chromatography procedures (except for the final Matrex Blue A stage) utilized a Pharmacia FPLC system. For each preparation, about 70 g of liver was homogenized (500-1000 rpm, five up-and-down strokes) in 140 ml of medium consisting of 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged for 1.5 h at 100,000 × g, and the resultant supernatant was filtered (0.2 μm). The filtrated supernatant was loaded at about 1 ml/min to a heparin-agarose column (3.2 × 20 cm) that was equilibrated with 300 ml of Buffer A (20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After washing with 80 ml of Buffer A at 1.5 ml/min, the column was eluted at 1.5 ml/min with a linear gradient of 2.5-5 mM pyrophosphate in Buffer A for 300 min followed by 50 mM pyrophosphate in Buffer A for 200 min at 2 ml/min. Peak fractions of enzyme activity eluted from the heparin column were pooled, the concentration of NaCl was adjusted to 1 M, and the sample was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.2 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with 250 ml of Buffer B (1 M NaCl, 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mM pyrophosphate). After washing with 200 ml of Buffer B, the remaining protein was eluted with Buffer C (Buffer B without NaCl). The flow rate was 1 ml/min throughout. Peak fractions of enzyme activity eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column were pooled and loaded onto a Mono Q HR10/10 column previously equilibrated with 30 ml of Buffer D (50 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The column was then washed with 10 ml of Buffer D and eluted with a linear gradient of 100-350 mM NaCl in Buffer D for 50 min and 1 M NaCl in Buffer D for another 50 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min throughout. Peak fractions of enzyme activity eluted from the Mono Q fractions were pooled and 1 mM MgSO4 was added. Samples were then loaded onto a 0.5-ml Matrex Blue A column previously equilibrated with Buffer D containing 1 mM MgSO4. The flow-through was collected under gravity. Finally, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20% glycerol were added, and the preparations were stored at −70°C until use. There was no significant loss of activity over a 6-month period. The molecular weight of the partially purified Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase was determined by gel filtration. Purified enzyme was concentrated about 10-fold using an Amicon Centricon-10 concentrator and mixed with molecular weight standards from Bio-Rad: bovine γ-globulin, chicken ovalbumin, equine myoglobin, and vitamin B12. A 50-200-μl mixture was chromatographed on a Pharmacia Superdex 75 HR10/30 gel filtration column using Bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM EGTA, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μM leupeptin, 0.4 μM E-64, 0.1 mM ATP, and 100 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.25-ml fractions were collected and assayed for enzyme activity. A 0.4-μg aliquot of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase preparation was incubated with 0.05 units of protein kinase C (Pierce, catalog no. 29536) or 50 units of protein kinase A (Pierce, catalog no. 29538) in a volume of 10 μl using the manufacturer's assay kit. After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, the mixtures were assayed for 1-kinase activity. The activities of protein kinases A and C were also determined as positive controls using colorimetric assays (Pierce, catalog no. 29517 for kinase C and catalog no. 29529 for kinase A). Kinase activity during purification was assayed in the presence of 2 μM InsP6. This had no effect on the 1-kinase (data not shown) but was used to inhibit the Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 3-phosphatase (22Nogimori K. Hughes P.J. Glennon M.C. Hodgson M.E. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16499-16506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that contaminated the kinase during the initial stages of purification. However, the InsP6 was not included in experiments with the purified enzyme since this did not contain any Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 phosphatase activity (data not shown). We chose to isolate the 1-kinase from liver, a tissue in which the enzyme has relatively high specific activity (7Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Morris A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); kinetic data we accumulated from the purified enzyme could than be compared with the inositol phosphate profiles in isolated hepatocytes (23Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The rat hepatic 1-kinase is predominantly a soluble enzyme (Ref. 7Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Morris A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and data not shown). These crude preparations of enzyme were relatively stable when maintained at 0-4°C, but our initial attempts at further purification were thwarted by such procedures bringing about a nearly complete loss of activity. For example, if the enzyme was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, 98% of activity was lost within 48 h (Table I). Fortunately, we discovered that certain phosphate-containing compounds and some phosphatase inhibitors were able to preserve enzyme activity to varying extents (Table I). Among them, inorganic pyrophosphate was the most effective. The disadvantage of including pyrophosphate was that it prevented the enzyme from binding to many of the column resins that otherwise might have facilitated the purification of the enzyme. Eventually, we found that an adequate compromise was to load the crude supernatant onto a heparin-agarose column in the absence of pyrophosphate and then use this compound to elute the enzyme from the column as a single peak (Fig. 1A, Table II). These procedures brought about an approximately 20-fold purification with an apparent yield of 67%.Table IISummary of purification of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinaseStepmlmgpmol/min/mg-fold%Supernatant14431251.081100Heparin-agarose240106.621.219.666.7Phenyl-Sepharose6020.330.130.220Mono Q50.1234764771.9Matrex Blue A50.0195159616031 Open table in a new tab Pyrophosphate was also present during the next stage of purification of the enzyme by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1B, Table II). However, during further purification steps (Fig. 1C, Table II) the enzyme again became unstable at 0-4°C, apparently for a different reason since pyrophosphate now offered no protective effect (a fact that also prevented us from using the purified enzyme to explore the mechanism of action of pyrophosphate). We did discover that enzyme activity could be preserved by the addition of excess protein (e.g. 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). It is possible that the enzyme was now being adversely affected by its inevitable dilution during purification. Neither glycerol (up to 50% (v/v)) nor polyvinylpyrrolidone (up to 0.5% (w/v)) were effective substitutes for the albumin. We attempted to compensate for this particular difficulty by scaling up our preparations to increase the concentration of the purified 1-kinase. We were then able to further purify the enzyme by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1C, Table II) and Matrex Blue A dye-ligand chromatography (Table II). The final preparations, which were approximately 1600-fold pure with a 1% yield, were stored at −70°C with the addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin plus 20% (v/v) glycerol; there was no significant loss of activity for at least 6 months. We found that the enzyme had high affinity for both Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 and ATP; the Km value of the 1-kinase for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was estimated to be 0.36 ± 0.01 μM (mean ± S.E. from three determinations, Fig. 2A). The kinetic properties of the 1-kinase activity in any tissue have not previously been described. Our determinations were made possible by the development of procedures for the chemical synthesis of enantiomerically pure Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (13Xie W. Kaetzel M.A. Bruzik K.S. Dedman J.R. Shears S.B. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14092-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) plus our isolation of relatively high specific activity [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 from [3H]inositol-labeled chick erythrocytes (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Km for ATP was estimated to be 10.6 ± 0.08 μM (mean ± S.E. from three determinations, Fig. 2B). The native molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be 46 ± 1 kDa 2Several bands were observed when the enzyme preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver-stained; one of these migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. Densitometric analysis indicated that this particular band accounted for approximately 15% of total protein (data not shown). (mean ± S.E. from three determinations, Fig. 3).Fig. 3Gel filtration of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase. An aliquot of 1-kinase was analyzed by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the following standards: bovine γ-globulin, 158,000; chicken ovalbumin, 44,000; equine myoglobin, 17,000; vitamin B12, 135,000. The recovery of 1-kinase was 80%. The data shown are from one experiment that was typical of three experiments; the average molecular mass was 46 ± 1 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The most important goal of this study was to gain insight into how the 1-kinase might be regulated in vivo, particularly when phospholipase C is activated. We found that the 1-kinase activity was unaffected by its co-incubation with either protein kinase A or protein kinase C (data not shown; for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). We also investigated the effect on the 1-kinase of the changes in [Ca2+] that would be expected to occur in cells upon activation of phospholipase C. The enzyme activity was slightly reduced (∼10-20%) at 1-2 μM Ca2+ relative to the activity at 0.1 μM (data not shown). This small effect, which would only be expected to occur during the brief period at which a cellular Ca2+ transient attained its peak value, was not influenced (data not shown) by the further addition of either 5 μM calmodulin or 10 μM calmodulin antagonist (kinase fragment 290-309 (24Payne M.E.

From the point of view of our efforts to understand how the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase is regulated, a particularly important result (see “Discussion”) was the potency with which this enzyme was inhibited by Ins(1,3,4)P3 (Fig. 4); the inhibition was determined by a Dixon plot to be competitive (Fig. 4), and the estimated Ki value was 0.2 ± 0.01 μM (mean ± S.E., n = 3; Fig. 4, Table III). The inhibition of 1-kinase by Ins(1,3,4)P3 was relatively specific; Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 were also competitive inhibitors, but they all acted with considerably lower potency (Table III).Table IIIInositol phosphate inhibitors of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinaseInhibitorKiμMIns(1,3,4)P30.2 ± 0.01 (3)Ins(1,3,4,5)P49 ± 1 (3)Ins(1,3,4,6)P414.5 ± 0.2 (4)Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P515 ± 0.3 (3)Ins(1,4,5)P348 ± 1 (4) Open table in a new tab In order to fully discern the actions of second messengers we need to determine how both their accumulation and metabolic inactivation are regulated. This generally requires the purification and characterization of the enzymes responsible for these metabolic control processes. This is the approach we have taken to increase our understanding of the receptor-regulated mechanisms that control metabolic turnover of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, a novel cellular signal (see the Introduction). Thus, we have purified the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase activity 1600-fold from a hepatic supernatant with a 1% yield. (The only previously described purification of this enzyme yielded a 35-fold enriched sample from a rat brain supernatant (7Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Morris A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).) The novel kinetic data that we have obtained with this purified enzyme have been particularly revealing concerning the mechanisms by which receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C causes cellular Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels to increase. For example, we have discovered that the 1-kinase has relatively high affinity for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (Km = 0.36 μM). In addition, we have determined that Ins(1,3,4)P3 is a potent inhibitor of the 1-kinase, with a Ki of 0.2 μM. Since intracellular levels of Ins(1,3,4)P3 are about 1 μM under basal conditions (25Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of the 1-kinase by this polyphosphate is physiologically relevant. Inhibition by Ins(1,3,4)P3 was also relatively specific; other inositol polyphosphates were inhibitors but at unphysiologically high concentrations (Table III), with perhaps one exception. In intact cells some slight inhibition of 1-kinase activity by Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is also possible since its steady-state levels (22Nogimori K. Hughes P.J. Glennon M.C. Hodgson M.E. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16499-16506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) are close to its Ki value of 15 μM. However, levels of this particular isomer do not change substantially during activation of phospholipase C (4Shears, S. B., (1992) Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research, (Putney, J. W., Jr., ed), Vol. 26, pp. 63–92, Raven Press, New York.Google Scholar, 9Menniti F.M. Oliver K.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), so this polyphosphate will not contribute to receptor-mediated regulation of the 1-kinase. It is of further significance that Ins(1,3,4)P3 is a downstream metabolite of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (4Shears, S. B., (1992) Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research, (Putney, J. W., Jr., ed), Vol. 26, pp. 63–92, Raven Press, New York.Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular levels of Ins(1,3,4)P3 accumulate severalfold whenever phospholipase C is activated. This raises the possibility that it is these receptor-mediated changes in Ins(1,3,4)P3 levels that, by inhibiting 1-kinase, link phospholipase C activity to elevations in Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels. To further explore this idea, we fitted our kinetic data to Equation 1 (see Ref. 22Nogimori K. Hughes P.J. Glennon M.C. Hodgson M.E. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16499-16506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).v=Vmax×[S][S]+Km×1+I1/Ki1+I2/Ki2(Eq. 1) Here, v is the reaction rate for the 1-kinase under conditions in which [S] represents the concentration of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (1 μM in resting cells (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor- Kaplan A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16499-16506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); the values of the Km for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 are from Fig. 2, and the Ki values of the two inhibitors are given in Table III. If we take the concentration of Ins(1,3,4)P3 ([I1]) to be 1 μM under basal conditions (25Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Equation 1 predicts that the 1-kinase would be operating at 28% of its maximal capacity in unstimulated cells. We next evaluated what would be the effect of a typical, receptor-mediated 5-10-fold rise in the concentration of Ins(1,3,4)P3 (12Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P.

Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using Equation 1 we estimated that if levels of this trisphosphate accumulated to either 5 or 10 μM, this would decrease the velocity of the kinase to 9 and 5%, respectively, of its maximal capacity. Thus, these two physiologically relevant agonist-dependent changes in the concentration of Ins(1,3,4)P3 would be predicted to inhibit the 1-kinase by 68 and 82%, respectively. This would perturb the poise of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase/Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 1-phosphatase substrate cycle (8Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Menniti F.M. Oliver K.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) so that levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 would accumulate due to the ongoing activity of the Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 1-phosphatase. Our kinetic data also predict that during the poststimulatory phase competition between Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4)P3 would be a major factor in determining the rate at which Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 returns to basal levels. Therefore, we conclude that a major function of Ins(1,3,4)P3 is to provide a mechanism by which activation of phospholipase C can induce changes in cellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. In this way phospholipase C may be considered to have both positive and negative input into Cl− ion channel activity: initial stimulation by Ca2+ followed by inhibition by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. The idea that Ins(1,3,4)P3 serves an important physiological function amends a long-standing belief that it is merely an inactive degradation product of Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 turnover. Moreover, this role for Ins(1,3,4)P3 is ultimately served by the activity of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase. Thus, both the function of the 3-kinase and the selective pressures that caused it to evolve (see Ref. 5Irvine, R. F., (1992) Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research, (Putney, J. W., Jr., ed), Vol. 26, pp. 161–185, Raven Press, New York.Google Scholar) should no longer be interpreted purely in terms of regulating the levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to control Ca2+ mobilization. It is entirely possible that this action of Ins(1,3,4)P3 by itself is all that is necessary to elevate levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 in vivo. In any case, the identification of this process adds a remarkable new feature to our understanding of the control of signaling functions of inositol polyphosphates. These results also consolidate our original hypothesis (8Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Menniti F.M. Oliver K.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that receptor-dependent changes in Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels are not just a consequence of mass action effects dependent on alterations in levels of its metabolic precursor, i.e. Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5. Moreover, our data exclude a substantial contribution of some other potential regulatory processes to the control of 1-kinase. For example, the enzyme activity was not affected by either protein kinase A or protein kinase C. We also investigated whether the changes in cellular [Ca2+] that occur upon receptor activation would affect 1-kinase activity. When free [Ca2+] in our assays was raised from 0.1 to 1-2 μM, there was a slight inhibition of enzyme activity (10-20%), but this seems insufficient to substantially contribute to the control of 1-kinase activity in vivo. Indeed, we have previously shown that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes did not change in response to thapsigargin (which elevates cytosol [Ca2+]). The high affinity of the kinase for ATP (Km = 10.6 μM) indicates that the activity of the hepatic enzyme in vivo is unlikely to be affected by physiologically relevant changes in ATP levels, which are maintained in the millimolar range (26Soboll S. Scholz R. Heldt H.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 113: 429-440Google Scholar). Drugs that modify the actions and metabolism of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 might improve treatment for certain medical conditions that result from perturbations to transmembrane Cl− transport, such as cystic fibrosis, and heart arrhythmia. The new information we have provided concerning the properties of the 1-kinase may improve the scope for pharmacological intervention, since they identify the enzymes of Ins(1,3,4)P3 metabolism as additional, potential therapeutic targets. Finally, our goal of sequencing and cloning the 1-kinase will help us understand the properties of this enzyme at a molecular level. We are grateful to Drs. S. T. Safrany and C. M. Pedrosa Ribeiro for helpful comments on the manuscript and to Dr. Safrany for assistance with the protein kinase C and protein kinase A assays."

This DHFR variant is not homologous in either sequence or structure with chromosomal DHFRs. The crystal structure of tetrameric R67 DHFR indicates a single active site pore that traverses the length of the molecule (Narayana, N., Matthews, D. A., Howell, E. E., and Xuong, N.-H. (1995) Nat. Struct. Biol. 2, 1018-1025). A pH profile of enzyme activity in R67 DHFR displays an acidic pKa that is protein concentration-dependent. This pKa describes dissociation of active tetramer into two relatively inactive dimers upon protonation of His-62 and the symmetry-related His-162, His-262, and His-362 residues at the dimer-dimer interfaces. Construction of an H62C mutation results in stabilization of the active tetramer via disulfide bond formation at the dimer-dimer interfaces. The oxidized, tetrameric form of H62C R67 DHFR is quite active at pH 7, and a pH profile displays increasing activity at low pH. These results indicate protonated dihydrofolate (pKa = 2.59) is the productive substrate and that R67 DHFR does not possess a proton donor.

EC 1.5.12.3) reduces dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate using NADPH as a cofactor. DHFR is important in folate metabolism as the reaction product, tetrahydrofolate, is required for the synthesis of thymidylate, purine nucleosides, methionine, and other metabolic intermediates. The chromosomally encoded DHFR from Escherichia coli utilizes a general acid to facilitate catalysis (1Howell E.E. Villafranca J.E. Warren M.S. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Science. 1986; 231: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and has specific binding sites for both substrate (DHF) and cofactor (NADPH) (2Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It has also been designated a highly evolved enzyme with a calculated efficiency of 0.15 (3Fierke C.A. Kuchta R.D. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hydride transfer rates are faster than the rate-determining step, which is release of product, tetrahydrofolate (4Fierke C.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In addition, ab initio quantum mechanical calculations suggest protein-mediated electronic polarization of bound DHF and NADPH may help lower energy barriers and aid catalytic function (5Bayorath J. Kitson D.H. Fitzgerald G. Andzelm J. Kraut J. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1991; 9: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Bayorath J. Kraut J. Li Z. Kitson D.H. Hagler A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Proteins. 1991; 11: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally, an overlap between the binding sites for NADP+ and 5-deazafolate in human DHFR has been proposed to facilitate catalysis by compressing the distance between C-6 of DHF and C-4 of NADPH to a separation that is optimal for hydride transfer (8Davies II, J.F. Delcamp T.J. Prendergast N.J. Ashford V.A. Freisheim J.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9467-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These studies all indicate that chromosomal DHFR has developed various mechanisms to maximize catalytic efficiency. dihydrofolate reductase dihydrofolate wild type diethyl pyrocarbonate protonated dihydrofolate 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. A different DHFR has emerged recently due to use of trimethoprim as a clinical drug to treat numerous bacterial infections. Trimethoprim is an active site-directed inhibitor of chromosomal DHFR. Resistance to trimethoprim has been correlated with the production of novel DHFRs encoded by R-plasmids. Type II R-plasmid-encoded R67 DHFR is unrelated genetically to chromosomal DHFRs (9Amyes S.G.B. Gemmell C.G. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 36: 4-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Amyes S.G.B. Towner K.J. Young H.-K. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 36: 1-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare this novel R-plasmid-encoded DHFR with its chromosomal counterpart, several crystal structures have been determined. A crystal structure of dimeric R67 DHFR was reported by Matthews et al. (11Matthews D.A. Smith S.L. Baccanari D.P. Burchall J.J. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). More recently, the active homotetramer has been crystallized both as an apoenzyme and in a binary complex with folate (12Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Xuong N-. H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Difference Fourier maps describing bound folate indicate the active site is a pore traversing the length of the molecule and that residues from each monomer contribute to the single active site. The center of the pore possesses exact 222 symmetry, indicating R67 DHFR binds DHF and NADPH in an unusual manner. The difference Fourier map for bound folate shows the pteridine ring in the center of the pore. The electron density can be fit by two asymmetric binding sites each present at 1/4 occupancy (12Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Xuong N-. H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Due to steric constraints, a maximum of two ligands can bind concurrently (13Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A productive model for catalysis proposes binding of DHF in half the pore and binding of cofactor in the other half. The pteridine ring of dihydrofolate and the nicotinamide ring of NADPH encounter each other at the center of the pore. This model of catalysis suggests R67 DHFR uses related sites (due to 222 symmetry) for binding of ligands and each half-pore accommodates either DHF or NADPH. However, DHF and NADPH are bound in slightly different orientations. The recent evolutionary origin of R67 DHFR coupled with this unusual binding scheme hints that R67 DHFR may not be a very efficient catalyst. To probe the efficiency of the R67 DHFR reaction further and contrast it with the E. coli chromosomal DHFR, a series of experiments have been designed to investigate the pH dependence of the R67 DHFR reaction. As indicated above, a general acid has been proposed to facilitate catalysis in E. coli chromosomal DHFR (1Howell E.E. Villafranca J.E. Warren M.S. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Science. 1986; 231: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In a D27S 2Mutant enzymes containing amino acid substitutions are described by the wild type residue and numbered position in the sequence, followed by the amino acid substitution. For example, H62C R67 DHFR describes the His-62 → Cys substitution in R67 DHFR. mutant of E. coli chromosomal DHFR, the proton donor, Asp-27, was removed by site-directed mutagenesis. The D27S DHFR partially compensated by binding pre-protonated DHF (pKa = 2.59); this was reflected in an increased kcat at low pH where protonated dihydrofolate predominates. Alternately, a role for Asp-27 in tautomerization of bound substrate (14Basran J. Casarotto M.G. Barsukov I.L. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or in alteration of the pKa of N-5 for bound substrate (15Chen Y.-Q. Kraut J. Blakley R.L. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) has been proposed. When the crystal structure of R67 DHFR is examined for potential proton donors, the only residue identified in the active site pore is Tyr-69, 3The amino acids in the first monomer are labeled 17-78; those in the second monomer, 117-178; the third monomer, 217-278; and the fourth monomer, 317-378. For brevity, when a single residue is mentioned in the text, residues in all four subunits are implied. as well as its symmetry-related residues Tyr-169, Tyr-269, and Tyr-369. Thus we pose the question, does R67 DHFR utilize a proton donor to facilitate catalysis as does chromosomal DHFR? During a series of experiments to answer the above question, we found that the ionization describing reduction of protonated dihydrofolate is masked by dissociation of tetrameric R67 DHFR to dimers. Thus we additionally ask, what are the relative activities of dimeric and tetrameric R67 DHFR? And can the tetramer be stabilized by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce disulfide bonds across the dimer-dimer interfaces? This paper addresses these questions. The H62C mutation was constructed by standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques using a synthetic R67 DHFR gene (16Reece L.J. Nichols R. Ogden R.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10895-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the following oligonucleotide: 5′-TGAGCCCGGGCAAGCCTCAGA-3′. The entire mutant H62C R67 DHFR gene was sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations were present. This mutant gene conferred trimethoprim resistance upon E. coli, indicating that an active DHFR was produced. H62C R67 DHFR was purified according to the protocol used to purify wild type (wt) R67 DHFR except that E. coli cells were lysed by sonication and reducing agents were omitted from buffers (16Reece L.J. Nichols R. Ogden R.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10895-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 5 mM EDTA was included in the buffers to minimize air-oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Purification steps included G75 molecular sieving, DEAE-Fractogel and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, and a Mono-Q column on a Pharmacia FPLC system. Steady state kinetic data were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer λ3a spectrophotometer interfaced with an IBM PS2 according to Howell et al. (17Howell E.E. Warren M.S. Booth C.L.J. Villafranca J.E. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8591-8598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The computer program UVSL3 (Softways, Moreno Valley, CA) was used in data collection and analysis. Assays were performed at 30°C in a polybuffer containing 50 mM acetic acid + 50 mM MES + 100 mM Tris + 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol (MTA buffer). This buffering system maintains a constant ionic strength between pH 4.5 and 9.5 (18Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). For the wt R67 DHFR pH profile, the enzyme concentration was held constant at all pH values unless noted. Enzyme was diluted and incubated in the cuvette for 5 min prior to initiation of the assay by addition of 110 μM dihydrofolate and 64 μM NADPH. Non-enzymic hydrolysis rates were measured and subtracted from enzymic rates. Formation of NADPD, used for measuring isotope effects, involved the reaction of alcohol dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Boehringer Mannheim) on 1,1-dideuterioethanol (MSD Isotopes) and NADP+ (Sigma). This reaction was coupled with NADP+ aldehyde dehydrogenase (Sigma) to allow the reaction to approach completion (17Howell E.E. Warren M.S. Booth C.L.J. Villafranca J.E. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8591-8598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Stone S.R. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2753-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The dehydrogenases were removed from NADPD by ultrafiltration through a YM-10 membrane. Chromatography on a DEAE Fractogel column (0-0.4 M KCl gradient) removed any unreacted NADP+. NADPD was subsequently desalted by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-2 column and lyophilized. A model to describe the behavior of R67 DHFR as a function of pH is shown in Scheme I, where T is tetrameric R67 DHFR; DHn is protonated dimer; Ka and αKa are ionization constants; Kd, Ks, and αKs are binding constants; and Koverall describes the linked dissociation and ionization of tetramer to 2 DHn (20Nichols R.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4554-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); Ks and αKs represent Km values describing binding of HDHF and DHF to E·;NADPH; and Kd describes binding of NADPH to apoenzyme (13Bradrick T.D.

Fraser S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). For H62C R67 DHFR, Km values for NADPH and DHF were obtained by varying both DHF (4-25 μM) and cofactor (8-80 μM) concentrations at subsaturating levels; primary and secondary plots were calculated according to Cleland (23Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH profiles for kcat and kcat/Km were fit to Equation 4, logkcat=logkcat(max)−log1+χpH−pKa(Eq. 4) where kcat(max) is the pH-independent value of kcat or kcat/Km and χ values of 10, 5, and 2 represent slopes of 1, 0.5, and 0.2 (24Murphy D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fitting with χ permits a non-integral slope. Data were fit using the NLIN program in the Statistical Analysis Systems program package (Sas Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Circular dichroism spectra of wt and H62C R67 DHFRs in 10 mM KH2PO4 at pH 7.0 and 5.0 were obtained at 22°C using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. Cell pathlength was 2 mm. Ten spectra were acquired per sample using 1-nm steps and 2-s integrations, and an averaged spectrum calculated. An essentially flat buffer baseline scan was then subtracted from the average protein scan. The CD data are described as the mean residue ellipticity by taking 111 g/mol as the mean residue molecular weight. Gel filtration using a Superose 12 HR10-30 column on a Pharmacia FPLC was performed according to Nichols et al. (2Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Reducing and non-reducing Ellman's titrations were done according to Creighton (25Creighton, T. E., (ed) (1990) Protein Structure: A Practical Approach, pp. 155–167, IRL Press, Oxford.Google Scholar) and Riddles et al. (26Riddles P.W. Blakley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined using the following extinction coefficients: 28,000 M−1 cm−1 at 282 nm for DHF (27Blakley R.L. Nature. 1960; 40: 1684-1685Google Scholar); 6220 M−1 cm−1 at 340 nm for NADPH (28Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient used to assess DHFR reduction of DHF was 12,300 M−1 cm−1 (29Baccanari D. Phillips A. Smith S. Sinski D. Burchall J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5267-5273Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by biuret assays and all proteins were homogeneous according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The disulfide bond stability was assayed according to Sauer et al. (30Sauer R.T. Hehir K. Stearman R.S. Weiss M.A. Jeitler-Nilsson A. Suchanek E.G. Pabo C.O.

Oxidized H62C R67 DHFR was mixed with 8.8 mM oxidized dithiothreitol (Sigma) and varying concentrations of reduced dithiothreitol (0.05-0.1 mM; Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at room temperature for 24 and 48 h. The reactions were quenched by addition of 0.3 volume of 1 M iodoacetic acid. All experiments were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8). The dimer/tetramer concentrations in the quenched samples were analyzed using a Superose 12 HR10-30 column on a Pharmacia FPLC. Peak areas were measured by weighing on a balance. The only potential proton donating group in the active site pore is Tyr-69 as well as its symmetry-related residues, Tyr-169, Tyr-269, and Tyr-369. To determine if tetrameric R67 DHFR uses Tyr-69 as a proton donor, we examined a pH profile of R67 DHFR activity. If Tyr-69 were a general acid participating in catalysis, we would expect to observe a half-bell profile displaying a pKa of pH 9.5-10.5, corresponding to ionization of tyrosine (assuming no effects due to environment). On the other hand, if R67 DHFR does not use Tyr-69 as a general acid, we would expect to see increasing activity at low pH as the pKa for protonation of dihydrofolate at N-5 is approached (pKa = 2.59; Ref. 21Maharaj G. Selinsky B.S. Appleman J.R. Perlman M. London R.E. Blakley R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4554-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), similar to the pH profile exhibited by D27S E. coli chromosomal DHFR (1Howell E.E. Villafranca J.E. Warren M.S. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Science. 1986; 231: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Instead of either of these patterns, a pH profile of kcat displays a bell shape as shown in Fig. 1. From the pH profile at high pH, we can conclude that if Tyr-69 is acting as a proton donor, its contribution to catalysis must be minimal since a titration is not observed up to pH 9.88. Activity measurements above this pH were not performed due to the high enzyme concentrations needed. Because of the size of the active site pore (∼18 Å wide by ∼24 Å long) and consequent solvent accessibility, it seems unlikely that the pKa of Tyr-69 would be perturbed. The apparent pKa value of 6.15 (Ptot = 166 nM dimer) observed in Fig. 1 suggests histidine may be ionizing and affecting enzyme activity. A single histidine (His-62) occurs per monomer at the dimer-dimer interfaces. From the 222 symmetry of the tetrameric crystal structure, 2 histidines appear per dimer-dimer interface (i.e.. His-62 and His-362 at one interface, and His-162 and His-262 at the second symmetry-related interface). Protonation of His-62 (pKa 6.84) has previously been found to destabilize tetrameric R67 DHFR and favor dimer formation (20Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As the active site pore is lost when tetramer dissociates to dimer, decreased activity results. Since dissociation of tetrameric R67 DHFR to 2 dimers is a bimolecular reaction, the ionization describing this process should be protein concentration-dependent. To test this, the activity associated with three protein concentrations was monitored as a function of pH. As seen in Fig. 1, the basic portion of the bell-shaped curves overlays fairly well. However the acidic titration clearly shows a protein concentration dependence, consistent with dissociation of active tetramer to less active dimers. Since protonation of His62 is linked to dissociation of active tetramer into inactive or partially active dimers, any potential activity increase at low pH due to protonation of dihydrofolate in solution (pKa = 2.59) will be masked. To investigate whether R67 DHFR utilizes protonated or nonprotonated DHF as the productive substrate, we constructed a stable tetramer to eliminate the T + 2nH+⇄ 2DHn ionization from the pH profile. The distance between the α-carbons of histidines 62 and 362 (or 162 and 262) at the dimer-dimer interface is 9.6 Å in R67 DHFR. The β-carbon distance is 7.8 Å. Sowdhamini et al. (31Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have proposed that CA-CA distances of ≤6.5 Å and CB-CB distances of ≤4.5 Å indicate a good potential for disulfide bond formation. However, Matsumura and Matthews (32Matsumura M. Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 336-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have constructed disulfide bridges in T4 lysozyme with CA-CA distances of 8.1 Å. While the distances in R67 DHFR are slightly longer, a H62C substitution was modeled using INSIGHT (Biosym Technologies) and a disulfide bond generated. The model appeared feasible, thus a H62C mutation was constructed in the R67 DHFR gene as described under “Materials and Methods.” A majority of purified H62C R67 DHFR is oxidized and tetrameric as determined by molecular sieving studies and Ellman's titrations. A reduced, dimeric component can also be observed, which upon extended incubation produces stable, oxidized tetramer. This result indicates the H62C mutation has greatly increased the Kd describing the tetramer ⇄ 2 dimers equilibrium, most likely due to the unfavorable distance between cysteines for disulfide bond formation. Previously, the Kd for wt R67 DHFR was estimated to be ≤50 nM by sedimentation equilibrium and 9.72 nM by fitting of protein concentration-dependent pH titration of fluorescence (20Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The relatively small dimer-dimer interface areas indicate stacking and hydrogen bond formation between His-62 and His-362 and between His-162 and His-262 are a major determinant of association state. Disulfide bond formation between H62C R67 DHFR dimers does occur spontaneously in vitro, albeit slowly. Numerous procedures were initially investigated to facilitate disulfide bond formation, for example disulfide exchange (33Villafranca J.E. Howell E.E. Oatley S.J. Xuong N.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2182-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Torchinsky Y.M. Sulfur in Proteins. Pergamon Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar) or mercuric ion cross-bridging (35Wong S.S. Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Cross-Linking. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 7-48Google Scholar). However, the easiest and most efficient method found was to incubate dimeric H62C R67 DHFR at high protein concentrations (≥15 mg/ml), pH 8.8, 4°C for >1 week. Since the Kd for tetramer formation in H62C R67 DHFR is elevated, high protein concentrations were necessary to facilitate tetramer formation and subsequent disulfide cross-linking. Generation of active, cross-linked tetramer was readily monitored by either increased enzyme activity and/or by molecular sieving chromatography and confirmed by Ellman's titrations (see below). From the chromatography results, two peaks are observed during elution from a Superose 12 HR10-30 column (Pharmacia FPLC), indicating tetrameric and dimeric species are not in rapid equilibrium in H62C R67 DHFR. With increasing time (days → weeks), the first peak increases in area. The first peak was identified as active tetramer (S-S cross-linked) and the second peak as reduced dimer by Ellman's titrations, Kav values (and thus predicted molecular weights) and by the first peak possessing virtually all the enzyme activity. To separate active tetramer from dimer, ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column with a 0.05-0.07 M KCl gradient in 10 mM Tris, pH 8 was utilized (Pharmacia FPLC). Purified dimer was maintained in buffer + 1 mM dithiothreitol. Alternatively, molecular sieving chromatography on G-75 Sephadex at pH 5 allows separation of reduced, dimer from oxidized tetramer. Ellman's titrations were performed to verify the formation of disulfide bonds in tetrameric H62C R67 DHFR. A single sulfhydryl per monomer, Cys-47, occurs on the surface of R67 DHFR. Non-reducing Ellman's titrations yield 0.78 and 0.99 free sulfhydryls/monomer for wt and oxidized, tetrameric H62C R67 DHFRs, respectively (average of ≥2 determinations). In contrast, reducing Ellman's titrations yield 1.1 and 2.2 sulfhydryls/monomer (average of 2 determinations) for wt and oxidized, tetrameric H62C R67 DHFR, respectively. These values clearly confirm a stable tetrameric species has been constructed by disulfide cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 2, a comparison of elution position for wt R67 DHFR from a Superose 12 HR 10-30 column at pH 8 and 5 shows a significant change, consistent with dissociation of tetramer to 2 dimers (20Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, molecular sieving studies of active, tetrameric H62C R67 DHFR at pHs 8 and 5 show changes in elution position that are the same within experimental error. From a plot of Kav (= (elution volume − void volume)/(total bed volume − void volume)) versus molecular weight standards, the molecular mass of H62C R67 DHFR at pH 8 and 5 was calculated as 42,000. For comparison, the measured molecular mass of wt R67 DHFR using molecular sieving techniques is also 42,000 at pH 8.0 (20Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.H. Huang F.Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These values are higher than a value of 33,720 calculated from the amino acid sequence. Aberrant molecular weight estimates are not unusual, however, as both the shape and size of the molecule affect elution position (36Potschka M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism studies were performed to assess the effects of the H62C mutation on the secondary structure of R67 DHFR (Fig. 3). The spectra for oxidized, tetrameric H62C R67 DHFR at pH 5 and 7 correlate well with the spectrum of wt, tetrameric R67 DHFR at pH 7.0. However, the spectra for reduced, dimeric H62C R67 DHFR at both pH 5 and 7 show significant differences from the spectrum for wt, dimeric R67 DHFR at pH 5.0. Since dimeric H62C R67 DHFR possesses minimal activity (see below) and is stably folded (37Zhuang P. Eisenstein E. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4237-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the change in CD signal must reflect a change in protein conformation/environment. Since His-62 is near Trp-38 at the dimer-dimer interface and His-62 is protonated at pH 5 in wt R67 DHFR, perhaps the H62C substitution affects the contribution of Trp-38 to the CD signal. Woody (38Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) indicates aromatic side chains can make detectable contributions to the far-UV CD. In contrast to the spectra for wt R67 DHFR, the spectra for oxidized and reduced H62C R67 DHFR do not show pH-dependent changes since they are locked in their respective tetrameric and dimeric forms. Oxidized, tetrameric H62C R67 DHFR is quite active with kcat = 74 ± 0.9 min−1, Km(DHF) = 29 ± 0.6 μM and Km(NADPH) = 34 ± 3.0 μM at pH 7.0. For comparison, wt R67 DHFR values are kcat = 78 min−1, Km(DHF) = 5.8 μM and Km(NADPH) = 3.0 μM at pH 7.0. Km values increase 5-11-fold, while kcat remains unaffected. One additional difference associated with the H62C mutation is the observation that DHF inhibition now occurs at high concentrations (≥40 μM at pH 7.0). Substrate inhibition is not observed in wt R67 DHFR; however, it is consistent with nonproductive binding of 2 DHF molecules, which blocks formation of the productive R67 DHFR·;DHF·;NADPH ternary complex (13Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 4Under binary complex conditions, two DHF molecules bind with p"

As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition.

More recent studies have also demonstrated the existence of a new group of bHLH proteins that contain the basic and the HLH domain but nevertheless function as transcriptional inhibitors. One of these inhibitory bHLH proteins, BETA3, interacts with E proteins to form heterodimers that are incapable of DNA binding (9Peyton M. Stellrecht C.M.M. Naya F.J. Huang H.-P. Samora P.J. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternatively spliced variant of the E protein ITF-2, ITF-2b, was identified and shown to inhibit the MyoD-mediated transactivation of the cardiac α-actin promoter (10Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism responsible for this inhibition has not yet been directly tested. Here we reported the independent and accidental cloning by the yeast two-hybrid system of a full-length ITF-2b cDNA while we were searching for protein factors that interact with the Id protein, Id3/HLH462. We have confirmed that Id3/HLH462 and full-length ITF-2b physically interacted with each other in vitro and complemented each other in a mammalian two-hybrid assay in the myogenic C2C12 cell line. Interestingly, although ITF-2b exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter in C2C12 cells, it functioned as a transactivator on an artificial promoter containing three tandem E box sites. Moreover, when both Id3/HLH462 and ITF-2b were co-expressed, their combined inhibitory effect on the MCK promoter was attenuated. Gel shift studies revealed that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer formed a strong DNA binding complex comparable with that formed by the MyoD/E47 heterodimer, but the formation of both heterodimer-DNA complexes was effectively inhibited by Id3/HLH462. Analysis of ITF-2 and Id3/HLH462 gene expression revealed that transcripts of both activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms were present initially in C2C12 cells placed under differentiation-promoting conditions, while the expression of Id3 was high in proliferating cells and declined as the culture differentiated.

An 11-day mouse embryo cDNA library in pGAD10 vector (Clontech) was screened according to the manufacturer's protocol to select for genes whose products interact with Id3/HLH462.

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay was done essentially as described (14Titus D.E. Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar).

FLAGHLHΔH2 was made by removal of a PstI/NarI fragment from the HLH462 plasmid to partially delete the second helix domain. All proteins were made using the TNT®-coupled in vitro transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and labeled with [3H]leucine. Immunoprecipitation was carried out in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100, using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) A fragment containing the complete open reading frame of ITF-2b was removed from the pGAD10 vector by EcoRI digestion and cloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pVP16 (Clontech).

First strand cDNA was made by reverse transcription at 37°C for 2 h and used for PCR amplification using primers that are specific to ITF-2a, ITF-2b Id3, or myogenin. Amplification was first performed with β-actin primers to normalize the amount of cDNA present in each preparation, and the normalized values were used to adjust for the amount of templates used in the PCR reaction with the gene specific primers. The primer sets specific to each gene for PCR were listed as follows. A typical PCR profile used was: 94° 30 s, 59°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min for 27 cycles for ITF-2a and ITF-2b, 25 cycles for Id3/HLH462 and myogenin, and 20 cycles for β-actin, followed by extension at 72°C for additional 10 min. We have used the yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning strategy to identify genes whose products can interact with Id3/HLH462. Out of about 4 × 106 yeast clones co-transformed with GBTHLH plasmid and the pGAD10 mouse embryonic cDNA library, 95 clones grew in the absence of histidine, among which 51 clones showed β-galactosidase activity. Further analysis confirmed 32 clones that showed Id3/HLH462-dependent galactosidase expression. Sequence analysis revealed that all are members of the E protein family (Table I). One of these clones appeared to correspond to a novel splicing variant of ITF-2, ITF-2b, recently isolated by the Mcburney's laboratory and reported to exhibit the unusual property of being able to inhibit the MyoD-mediated transactivation of α-cardiac actin gene expression (10Skerjanc I.S.

First, we examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiment to see if in vitro translated Id3/HLH462 and ITF-2b proteins could interact with each other without the attached GAL4 DNA binding and transactivation domains used in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Using an antibody directed against the FLAG antigenic epitope, we showed that ITF-2b was co-precipitated with the FLAG-tagged Id3/HLH462 protein. A second helix deletion mutant of Id3 (FLAGHLHΔH2), which exhibited a dramatically reduced inhibitory effect on MCK gene expression, 2B. Chen and R. W. Lim, unpublished observation. co-precipitated ITF-2b to a much lower extent (Fig. 1A). An unrelated protein, luciferase, was not precipitated at all by the anti-FLAG antibody. The result indicates that the interaction of ITF-2b and Id3 is specific and may be dependent on an intact HLH domain in Id3. The relatively small amount of ITF-2b co-precipitated in comparison with the amount added may reflect the inefficiency of the in vitro assay system or steric hindrance by the precipitating antibody. As a further confirmation of the ability of ITF-2b to associate with Id3, we also analyzed the interaction between these two proteins using the mammalian two-hybrid systems. As shown in Fig. 1B, full-length ITF-2b fused to the VP16 transactivation domain was able to complement an Id3/GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein to transactivate a GAL4-regulated promoter in transfected C2C12 cells. The resulting CAT activity was 50-200-fold higher than what was obtained with expression vectors lacking one or the other of the interacting proteins and reached about 20% the level obtained with the covalently linked Gal4-VP16 fusion protein. Thus, the two inhibitory proteins could associate inside mammalian cells with affinity that is consistent with a specific noncovalent interaction. Next we want to confirm that ITF-2b could indeed inhibit muscle-specific gene expression as reported previously (10Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and to examine the potential consequence when two mutually interacting inhibitory HLH proteins were co-expressed in the same cell. We first demonstrated that both Id3/HLH462 and ITF-2b could inhibit the ability of MyoD to transactivate the expression of a muscle-specific creatine kinase (MCK) promoter-regulated CAT reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Interestingly, when ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 were co-expressed, the inhibitory effect on MCK gene expression was attenuated relative to what was observed when each protein was expressed by itself. This apparent mutual interference of inhibitory activity presumably was due to the formation of Id3/HLH462 and ITF-2b complexes that were no longer capable of inhibiting MCK gene expression. In order to determine the mechanism through which ITF-2b might inhibit MCK promoter activity, we examined whether ITF-2b protein could form homo- or heterodimers that bind to the consensus MyoD/E protein binding site (E box). As shown in Fig. 3, only a faint DNA-protein complex was detectable when the labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with in vitro translated ITF-2b protein alone, suggesting that ITF-2b either could not homodimerize efficiently or that the homodimer could not bind DNA well. When ITF-2b was co-incubated with the activating E protein, E47, the mobility of the shifted complexes that were formed resembled those formed by ITF-2b and E47 homodimers, suggesting that the ITF-2b/E47 heterodimer might bind DNA with relatively low affinity. That ITF-2b-E47 heterodimers were formed was supported by the fact that the presence of the ITF-2 protein resulted in a much reduced level of apparent E47 homodimer/DNA complexes as compared with that seen with E47 alone. In contrast to these weak interactions, ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimers formed a very strong DNA complex comparable to the E47/MyoD heterodimer DNA complex, but the formation of both complexes was still efficiently blocked by Id3/HLH462. Taken together, our data indicate that ITF-2b did not inhibit MyoD function because of failure to bind DNA. Unlike ITF-2b, the human ITF-2 protein (also called E2-2) with the first 49 amino acid missing from its N-terminal was reported to cooperate with MyoD to transactivate an artificial reporter gene, (MEF1)4CAT, containing four tandem MyoD binding MEF1 sites (4Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Since the inhibitory activity of ITF-2b appeared to reside in the N-terminal first 83 amino acids (10Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it was assumed that the differential activity of the two proteins was due to the absence of the 49 amino acids. To test this assumption, we also examined the effect of the full-length ITF-2b protein on the MyoD-mediated transactivation of a reporter gene containing three copies of the MEF1 sites (3ESVCAT). Surprisingly, whereas Id3/HLH462 remained fully inhibitory on this reporter gene, the full-length ITF-2b protein was no longer inhibitory but instead enhanced the transcriptional activity of MyoD (Fig. 4). It thus appeared that ITF-2b-MyoD heterodimerization did not always result in a transcriptionally silent DNA binding complex. While the preceding data provided clear evidence for the biochemical function of the ITF-2b protein, the biological relevance of this protein to the muscle differentiation process could not be inferred from these results alone. To explore this question further, we have analyzed the mRNA expression patterns of both the activating and “inhibitory” ITF-2 isoforms (ITF-2a and ITF-2b) by RT-PCR during the in vitro differentiation of the myogenic C2C12 cells. Results of this assay indicated that both transcripts were absent in proliferating cells but became detectable as the cells were placed into differentiation-permissive conditions (Fig. 5). In contrast, the Id3 gene was expressed in proliferating C2C12 cells and down-regulated as the cultures were allowed to differentiate. Whether both Id3 and ITF-2b proteins are co-expressed in the same cells at some point during the differentiation process is an interesting question that would need to be confirmed when appropriate antibodies become available. We reported in this manuscript the cloning of an inhibitory form of the murine ITF-2 protein, ITF-2b, by virtue of its interaction with another transcriptional inhibitory protein Id3. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro co-immunoprecipitation analysis and DNA binding assay, by functional complementation in the mammalian two-hybrid system and by mutual antagonism in the MCK reporter gene assay. Moreover, our data revealed that the inhibitory function of ITF-2b was evident on the MCK reporter gene but not with an artificial promoter regulated by the MEF1 (E box) DNA binding site. Interestingly, ITF-2b mRNA was not detectable in proliferating myoblasts but became observable in cells initiating the differentiation process. One possible explanation for the rather complex behavior of the ITF-2b protein is that the inhibitory domain in ITF-2b might prevent the myogenic factor-ITF-2b protein heterodimer from interacting with transcription factors bound to other regulatory elements in the MCK enhancer that are required for maximal MCK activation. Such interactions might be dispensable in the case of the artificial promoter regulated solely by multiple E boxes. The inhibitory effect on the cardiac α-actin promoter could be explained if similar interactions were required for its full activation. Thus depending on the constellation of factors that are needed to activate the expression of a particular gene, ITF-2b might exert either inhibitory or activating influences in a promoter-specific manner. It would be very interesting to know whether ITF-2b will inhibit or activate other muscle-specific genes as well as other tissue-specific genes that depend on bHLH proteins for transcriptional activation (17Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The reason for the enigmatic increase in the transcripts of the inhibitory ITF-2b isoform when cells were first exposed to differentiation-inducing conditions is not clear. One possibility is that it might serve to prevent cells from initiating the differentiation process prematurely in response to small fluctuations in the extracellular environment. This inhibitory effect would be overcome when the expression levels and activities of the myogenic regulatory factors and the activating E proteins became sufficiently elevated and the levels of the inhibitory Id proteins declined. Alternatively, the expression of the ITF-2b isoform in differentiating muscle cells might allow different muscle-specific genes to be regulated independently in a promoter-specific manner. Which if either of these speculative models are accurate can only be borne out by further investigations. Taken together, our data presented here painted a more complex picture concerning the regulatory interactions between the HLH proteins than previously recognized. The complete implication of these interactions remains to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W1578446400,"Stimuli that are mitogenic for mature T-cells induce cell cycle arrest in some T-cell tumors and T-cell hybridomas. The molecular mechanism of this growth inhibition is poorly understood. In this report, we show that in EL4, a murine T-lymphoma cell line, stimulation with concanavalin A or treatment with phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (PMA) inhibit growth, due to cell cycle arrest at both the G1 and the G2/M phases. The block at the G1 phase is accompanied by the appearance of a hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), due to the inhibition of G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to this G1 cell cycle arrest differ between concanavalin A and PMA: concanavalin A inhibits both cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes, while PMA inhibits only cyclin E-Cdk2. We demonstrate that concanavalin A inhibits cyclin D-Cdk4 activity by decreasing the amount of cyclin D. The inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 by both concanavalin A and PMA is due to increased binding of the Cdk inhibitor p21 to this complex. However, while stimulation of the cells with concanavalin A did not result in an evident increase of the total level of p21, treatment of the cells with PMA increased p21 levels significantly. Our results indicate, furthermore, that the G2/M block results from the inhibition of cyclin A- and cyclin B1-associated kinase activities. As for cyclin E-Cdk2, the inhibition of the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex is due to increased binding of the p21 inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1973543573,"The basement membrane of skeletal muscle is produced by the muscle cells it ensheathes and by nonmuscle cells located in the surrounding extracellular matrix. In this study, we have shown that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates secretion of three basement membrane components of skeletal muscle: laminin (70% increase), fibronectin (30%), and type IV collagen (70%). Furthermore, we have found using the signal transduction inhibitors, genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor), thapsigargin (depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores), and H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), that PDGF-stimulated secretion of these proteins occurs through distinct signaling pathways. Densitometry of Western blots of L6 myoblast supernatant indicates that the PDGF-induced increase in secretion of laminin and type IV collagen is tyrosine kinase-dependent. The increase in type IV collagen secretion also shows dependence on PKC, as well as the release of intracellular Ca2+. Inhibition of either of these pathways reduces the increase in type IV collagen secretion to 20%. In contrast, the PDGF-induced increase in laminin secretion is unaffected by inhibition of either PKC or intracellular Ca2+ release. The increase in fibronectin secretion by PDGF uses yet a third set of signals. PDGF-induced fibronectin secretion is not dependent on tyrosine kinase activity but is dependent on protein kinase A as well as the release of intracellular Ca2+. These divergent signaling pathways provide for independent regulation of basement membrane protein secretion, allowing a muscle cell to modify both the quantity and composition of its basement membrane in response to its environment. The basement membrane of skeletal muscle is produced by the muscle cells it ensheathes and by nonmuscle cells located in the surrounding extracellular matrix.

These divergent signaling pathways provide for independent regulation of basement membrane protein secretion, allowing a muscle cell to modify both the quantity and composition of its basement membrane in response to its environment. The basement membrane of skeletal muscle forms a continuous layer of connective tissue that completely ensheathes each individual muscle fiber. Thus, all signals that reach the muscle fiber must traverse the basement membrane, all forces generated by muscle must be transmitted across the basement membrane before acting upon other extracellular structures, and any change in muscle fiber size or shape that occurs during development, growth, or adaptation must involve remodeling of the basement membrane. Previous investigations have also shown that the composition of the basement membrane of muscle shows regional variability in composition and thickness. For example, the thickness and composition of the basement membrane at myotendinous junctions and neuromuscular junctions differs from the basement membrane at other sites on the fiber (1Swasdison S. Mayne R. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 257: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Sanes J.R. Cheney J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the assembly of the basement membrane during development and regeneration occurs by the sequential, rather than concurrent, release of basement membrane proteins onto the surface of the muscle fiber (3Gulati A.K. Reddi A.H. Zalewski A.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Tidball J.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Together, these observations support the hypothesis that the synthesis and secretion of individual basement membrane proteins can be regulated independently. Basement membrane proteins can also influence proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells. Surprisingly, these influences of different basement membrane proteins on muscle development can be antagonistic. For example, laminin stimulates differentiation of skeletal myoblasts in culture while fibronectin inhibits differentiation, but stimulates proliferation (5von der Mark K. Öcalan M. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect that muscle cells would independently regulate the synthesis and secretion of basement membrane proteins during development, if these proteins play a significant role in regulating developmental events. One means by which independent regulation could occur would be if the synthesis and secretion of each individual basement membrane component were regulated by a unique set of intracellular signals. This would enable muscle cells that were stimulated by growth factors or other substances that regulate development, to independently regulate the synthesis and secretion of basement membrane molecules in response to the stimulation. In the present investigation, we have tested the hypotheses that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPLCphospholipase CPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseFuDR5-fluor-2′-deoxyuridineIP3inositol trisphosphatePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. stimulates secretion of basement membrane proteins in skeletal muscle cells and that the intracellular signaling mechanisms that regulate secretion of distinct basement membrane proteins differ downstream from receptor-ligand binding. PDGF was selected for study because previous studies have shown that PDGF stimulates the synthesis and secretion of many basement membrane proteins in non-muscle cells, including laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen (7Owen A.J. Geyer R.P. Antoniades H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is feasible that PDGF stimulation of muscle cells can cause local changes in basement membrane synthesis because previous investigations have shown that PDGF receptors become heterogeneously distributed on the cell surface during muscle differentiation (8Jin P. Rahm M. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Sejersen T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1665-1672Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Tidball J.G. Spencer M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have tested the above hypotheses by measuring changes in basement membrane protein secretion by PDGF-stimulated cells in the presence of inhibitors to specific components of selected signaling pathways. By quantifying the increase in the release of laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen during PDGF stimulation in the presence of the different inhibitors, we have been able to determine that the intracellular signaling pathways which regulate the secretion of these proteins are distinct. platelet-derived growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phospholipase C cAMP-dependent protein kinase 5-fluor-2′-deoxyuridine inositol trisphosphate phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Rat L6 myoblasts were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every other day until the cells were confluent. The cells were then incubated in DMEM alone for 24 h. Cultures were subsequently washed with DMEM, and then the control cultures transferred to DMEM only and experimental cultures transferred to DMEM supplemented with PDGF-BB at selected concentrations (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (UBI), Lake Placid, NY). At the end of PDGF stimulation, supernatant was collected from experimental and control cultures and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g. Supernatants were then prepared for gel samples by adding 15 μl of 1% bromphenol blue, 15 μl of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 15 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, and 15 μl of 50% glycerol to 500 μl of supernatant. The samples were then boiled and electrophoresed on 8% acrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE; Ref. 10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB was added at 20 ng/ml to confluent L6 cells that were then incubated for 1, 4, 8, or 24 h. Control cultures for each time point were treated identically to PDGF-stimulated cells, except that their media were PDGF-free. Duplicate cultures were prepared for each experimental and control time point, and supernatants and cells were collected separately for analysis by immunoblots. Supernatant was also collected from one unstimulated culture at the onset of the experiment (t = 0 h). PDGF-BB was added to the culture medium at 0, 2, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ng/ml. Two plates of each concentration were incubated for 24 h, and then the supernatant was collected and prepared for SDS-PAGE. Cultures were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10 min and then washed with DMEM to remove all residual PDGF from the cultures. The cells were then incubated for 24 h in DMEM only. Other treatments consisted of three plates of cells that were stimulated with DMEM only and incubated for 24 h in DMEM only (controls), and three plates that experienced continuous 20 ng/ml PDGF stimulation for the entire 24-h incubation period (chronic stimulation). In an additional stimulation experiment, cultures were incubated in DMEM containing 6 μg/ml uridine (Sigma) and 2.4 μg/ml 5-fluor-2′-deoxyuridine (FuDR; Sigma) or DMEM only for 8 h. FuDR-treated cultures were then transferred to 20 ng/ml PDGF, 6 μg/ml uridine, and 2.4 μg/ml FuDR in DMEM for 24 h. DMEM-treated cultures were then treated with either 20 ng/ml PDGF or DMEM only for 10 min and then rinsed three times in DMEM. After 24 h, supernatant was collected from PDGF/uridine/FuDR cultures, PDGF cultures, and DMEM-only cultures and prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblots. The signaling pathways involved in PDGF stimulation of basement membrane protein secretion were analyzed by stimulating L6 myoblasts in the presence of a variety of signal transduction inhibitors. These included: genistein (122 nM), which inhibits tyrosine kinase activity; thapsigargin (50 nM), which prevents the release of intracellular Ca2+; PMA (600 nM), which inhibits protein kinase C; and H89 (30 μM), which inhibits protein kinase A. Cells were preincubated in inhibitor for 14 h prior to stimulation with 20 ng/ml PDGF, 6 μg/ml uridine, 2.4 μg/ml FuDR, and the desired inhibitor. In some experiments, cells were incubated with brefeldin A (10 μg/ml), which inhibits protein secretion by disrupting the Golgi apparatus, during PDGF stimulation. The brefeldin A treatments enabled distinction between PDGF stimulation of protein secretion and stimulation of protein release from the cell surface that did not involve secretion. Triplicate cultures were prepared for each experimental condition. Supernatant was collected 24 h after PDGF stimulation and prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis. L6 myoblasts stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB showed loss of PDGF receptors that were recognizable by antibodies to PDGF-β receptor oligopeptide. Therefore, we used PDGF receptor blots of cell extracts to confirm that stimulation and receptor internalization were taking place in each experiment. Gel samples prepared in each experiment were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE as described above, and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper for 4 h at 1 A. The blots were blocked overnight at 4°C in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% NaN3 (buffer A), to which 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin or 3% nonfat dry milk were added. The blots were then overlaid with one of the following primary antibodies diluted in buffer A containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.3% bovine serum albumin: 1) goat anti-type IV collagen (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), diluted 1:100; 2) rabbit anti-laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.), diluted 1:40; or 3) rabbit anti-fibronectin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), diluted 1:200 (Fig. 1). The primary antibodies recognized proteins under reducing conditions which had apparent molecular masses of 220 kDa (laminin), 200 kDa (fibronectin), and 190 kDa (type IV collagen). The collagen IV antibody only recognized a single band at the molecular mass of the α1(IV) chain (185 kDa) and did not detect the α2(IV) chain in the myoblast supernatant. The secondary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma), diluted 1:3000. In addition, rabbit anti-PDGF receptor (UBI) was used for immunoblots of cell extracts. Densitometry of antibody reaction product on the blots was performed using an imaging system/densitometer (Alpha Innotech). A standard curve containing known amounts of purified laminin, fibronectin, or collagen type IV was done to determine the linear range of detection for each antibody. The standard curves were done on blots that also contained a known volume of control supernatant so that we were able to determine the amount of laminin, fibronectin or collagen type IV in the samples. Densitometric values were compared by t tests with confidence level set at p < 0.05. The total amounts of laminin, collagen type IV, and fibronectin in the supernatant of 24-h control samples were determined by comparing densitometric measurements of the supernatant to a loading curve composed of known amounts of purified extracellular matrix protein. The densitometric values measured from the supernatant could then be directly compared to those of known amounts of purified protein. Thus an estimate of the amount of laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin in the supernatant was determined. Total RNA was isolated from L6 myoblasts stimulated with PDGF BB for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h, and from control cultures that were not stimulated. RNA was isolated using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63166) Google Scholar), and 25 μg run on a 2% agarose gel in formaldehyde and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes. The membranes were stained with methylene blue to determine accuracy of loading and RNA integrity. The blots were then probed with α-32P-labeled cDNA probes to collagen type IV α1 chain (COL4A1, ATCC; Ref. 12Pihlajaniemi T. Tryggvason K. Myers J.C. Kurkinen M. Lebo R. Cheung M.-C. Prockop D.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and fibronectin (FN1, ATCC; Ref. 14Bernard M.P. Kolbe M. Weil D. Chu M.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2698-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The collagen IV probe recognized a doublet at 6.5 and 5.3 kilobases, the laminin β1 probe recognized a 6-kilobase message, and the fibronectin probe recognized an 8-kilobase message. The possibility that changes in secreted protein concentration could represent changes in cell number resulting from PDGF stimulation, rather than from changes in rate of protein secretion, was tested by assaying for changes in cell concentration in PDGF-stimulated cultures. Two plates of the cultured cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF for 24 h and two plates served as controls. After 24 h, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were rinsed with buffer A and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were rinsed again with buffer A and stained with hematoxylin for 1 min. Cells in each of five randomly selected fields observed by light microscopy using a 20× objective were counted. At this magnification, each sampled field was 0.1225 mm2. In an additional experiment, cells were pulse-stimulated for 10 min with PDGF, PDGF in the presence of uridine, and FuDR or DMEM alone. Cultures were then rinsed with DMEM and stained, and cell counts were performed 24 h following stimulation. L6 myoblasts grown in DMEM only secreted approximately 0.14 pg/cell collagen type IV, 1.4 pg/cell laminin, and 88 pg/cell fibronectin in 24 h. Stimulation of L6 myoblasts for 24 h with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB resulted in a significant increase in collagen type IV, laminin, and fibronectin in the culture media relative to control cultures (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Densitometric measurement of alkaline phosphatase reaction products in immunoblots showed that laminin concentration in the culture media after 24 h of PDGF stimulation was 115% greater than the concentration in control culture media, collagen type IV concentration in stimulated cell media was 188% greater than control values, and the fibronectin concentration in stimulated cell culture media was 36% greater than in control. Although a portion of this increase in laminin and collagen type IV concentration is attributable to a greater rate of cell proliferation in PDGF-stimulated cultures, stimulated cultures contained only 35% more cells than unstimulated cultures at the end of 24 h. Thus, the majority of laminin and collagen IV accumulation in the media of stimulated cells is attributable to an increase in secretion of these proteins by the stimulated cells. Using inhibitors of cell proliferation, we were able to determine that the increase in laminin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin secretion resulting from PDGF stimulation did not result from an increase in cell density induced by PDGF stimulation. Cells stimulated with PDGF or PDGF in the presence of anti-mitotic agents (FuDR/uridine) did not differ significantly in laminin or fibronectin secretion. Although type IV collagen secretion was decreased with anti-mitotic treatments, fibronectin, collagen type IV, and laminin concentrations exceeded that in unstimulated cell supernatants (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).Fig. 4Densitometric measurements of reaction products in immunoblots of L6 cell supernatants stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Supernatants were collected 24 h after the start of stimulation.

Maximum collagen type IV secretion occurred at 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Maximum laminin concentration was measured following stimulation with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB, although the value did not differ significantly from that obtained following stimulation with 10 or 20 ng/ml. Fibronectin secretion that occurred at 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB was significantly greater than that measured at 20 ng/ml, although the 5-fold increase in PDGF concentration produced only a 16% increase in fibronectin concentration.Fig. 6Densitometric measurements of alkaline phosphatase reaction products in immunoblots of L6 cell supernatants stimulated with PDGF-BB for 24 h. Immunoblots were labeled with anti-laminin (upper), anti-collagen type IV (middle), or anti-fibronectin (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) No decreases were observed in the concentration of laminin, fibronectin, or collagen type IV in extracts of myoblasts stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF for 24 h (Fig. 7). Thus, the increase in collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin in the culture media of stimulated cells represents a net increase in the quantities of these proteins in the preparations, rather than simply a shift in distribution of laminin, fibronectin, and collagen type IV from myoblasts to the supernatant. Further evidence, which demonstrates that laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin are secreted by the muscle cells, comes from experiments where the muscle cells were stimulated with PDGF in the presence of brefeldin A. In the presence of brefeldin A, laminin and collagen type IV were undetectable in the supernatant and fibronectin levels were greatly reduced and showed no increase with PDGF stimulation (Fig. 8). These data further demonstrate that the increases in laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin in the supernatant result from PDGF stimulation of secretion rather than simply a PDGF-stimulated release of proteins from the cell surface. Finally, Northern blots done on cells over a time course following PDGF stimulation demonstrate that the myoblasts are actively up-regulating the message levels for these three proteins (Fig. 9). The message levels for laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin all showed dramatic increases by 6 h following PDGF stimulation with peak levels occurring at 16 h for laminin (300% increase), 8 h for collagen IV (180% increase), and 16 h for fibronectin (130% increase). Thus, the increase in mRNA for each of these three proteins and the increase in concentration of the proteins in the cell supernatant confirm that PDGF stimulation is causing an increase in the production and secretion of these proteins by regulating their level of transcription. The concentration of laminin in culture media of cells stimulated for 24 h with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB (chronic stimulation) produced an increase in laminin in the culture media (190% increase relative to controls) that was significantly different from that observed following 10 min of incubation with PDGF-BB (pulse stimulation; 133% increase). Pulse stimulation also produced a significant increase in secreted collagen type IV (68% increase) that was significantly less than that produced by chronic stimulation (131% increase). Chronic (28% increase) and pulse stimulation (25% increase) produced identical increases in fibronectin secretion (Fig. 10, Fig. 11).Fig. 11Densitometric measurements of alkaline phosphatase reaction products in immunoblots of L6 cell supernatants stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Supernatants were collected 24 h after start of the experiment.

The increase in fibronectin secretion stimulated by PDGF was independent of tyrosine kinase activity, with genistein having no effect on the PDGF-induced secretion of this protein (Fig. 12, Fig. 13). However, incubation of the cells in H-89 prior to PDGF stimulation, or depletion of intracellular Ca2+ with thapsigargin, completely abolished the PDGF-induced increase in fibronectin secretion (Fig. 12, Fig. 13). Thus, the release of intracellular Ca2+ that is essential for PDGF stimulation of fibronectin secretion occurs through a tyrosine kinase-independent pathway.Fig. 13Densitometric measurements of reaction products in immunoblots of L6 cell supernatants stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence of the signal transduction inhibitors: genistein (Gen), PMA, thapsigargin (Thaps), and H89. *, p < 0.05 versus control without inhibitor; ‡, designates p < 0.05 versus control with inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PDGF-induced increase in type IV collagen secretion was completely inhibited by genistein, thereby indicating dependence on tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). The PDGF-induced secretion of type IV collagen also showed dependence on the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores, as well as on protein kinase C activity, although inhibition by thapsigargin or PMA was not complete in either case (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). The similar levels of inhibition by thapsigargin and PMA suggest that they both function in the same signaling pathway rather than through independent mechanisms. We could not confirm this because incubation with both of the inhibitors resulted in substantial cell death.Fig. 15Densitometric measurements of reaction products in immunoblots of L6 cell supernatants stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence of the signal transduction inhibitors: genistein (Gen), PMA, thapsigargin (Thaps), and H89. *, p < 0.05 versus control with out inhibitor; ‡, p < 0.05 versus control with inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PDGF-stimulated laminin secretion was not inhibited by any of the signal transduction inhibitors except the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (Fig. 16, Fig. 17). Thus, the PDGF-induced increase in laminin secretion is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, but it does not involve phospholipase C activity or the generation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, which in turn cause release of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKC.Fig. 17Densitometric measurements of reaction products in immunoblots of L6 cell supernatants stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence of the signal transduction inhibitors: genistein (Gen), PMA, thapsigargin (Thaps), and H89. *, p < 0.05 versus control without inhibitor; ‡, p < 0.05 versus control with inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unidentified, soluble factors have been shown previously to stimulate secretion of extracellular matrix molecules into the supernatant of myoblasts grown in vitro (15Duksin D. Kalcheim C. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14585-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kalcheim C. Vogel Z. Duksin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3077-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Those factors could feasibly play a regulatory role in production of the connective tissues surrounding muscle cells during normal development and growth, or during adaptation or response to injury. It is also feasible that pathologically high concentrations of those matrix stimulatory factors could lead to fibrotic changes observed in muscle that are known to occur in several myopathies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (17Gorospe J.R.M. Hoffman E.P. Curr. Opin. Rheum. 1992; 4: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). We have begun to examine these possibilities by investigating the influence of PDGF on myoblast secretion of basement membrane proteins. We have shown that PDGF-induced secretion of basement membrane proteins is mediated by distinct, intracellular signaling pathways, including pathways that are dependent and independent of tyrosine kinase activity. PDGF-stimulated increases in fibronectin secretion occur via a tyrosine kinase-independent pathway that is dependent on PKA activity. A tyrosine kinase-independent, PDGF-stimulated signaling pathway has been demonstrated previously in Balb/c 3T3 cells in which PDGF stimulation induces expression of egr-1 without detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (18Mundschau L.J. Forman L.W. Weng H. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16137-16142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our experiments, PDGF receptor down-regulation in response to stimulation was still observed in the presence of genistein. This observation agrees with previous studies showing that in a kinase-inactivated PDGF receptor mutant, PDGF receptors are internalized and degraded in response to ligand binding (19Sorkin A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessary for at least some of the biological responses that occur due to the PDGF receptor binding its ligand. In other studies, PDGF stimulation of 3T3 cells has been shown to release PKA from the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in activated cytosolic PKA (20deBlaquiere J. Walker F. Michelangeli V.P. Fabri L. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this latter study did not specifically test whether PKA release occurred independently of PDGF receptor phosphorylation, it is possible that the reported release of PKA from the cell membrane in PDGF-stimulated 3T3 cells is a component of the tyrosine kinase-independent pathway identified here. Results of the present investigation also show that PDGF stimulation of fibronectin secretion is sensitive to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ by thapsigargin. This is interesting because the major pathway for the release of intracellular Ca2+ by PDGF stimulation is thought to be through the activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLC-γ), which then cleaves phosphoinositol bisphosphate into the second messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol (21Claesson-Welsh L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 37-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IP3 is then capable of releasing intracellular Ca2+ by activating the IP3 receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Ref. 21Claesson-Welsh L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 37-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the release of intracellular Ca2+ by this mechanism should be inhibited by using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, since it will prevent the activation of PLC by preventing the autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor. Treatment with genistein has no effect on the PDGF-induced increase in fibronectin secretion, suggesting that there must be an alternate signaling pathway that is dependent upon the release of intracellular Ca2+ without the generation of IP3 by PLC. The finding reported here, that PDGF-induced secretion of type IV collagen is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, indicates that this signaling pathway relies on the well characterized generation of the second messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol, following PLC phosphorylation and activation. Furthermore, the PDGF-induced secretion of type IV collagen is sensitive to inhibition of protein kinase C, as well as the release of intracellular Ca2+. Signaling through both of these second messengers can be attributed to PLC activation and therefore would also be inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. However, inhibition of either protein kinase C or the release of intracellular Ca2+ did not completely inhibit the PDGF-induced increase in type IV collagen secretion. Since these experiments were done in the presence of the anti-mitotic agents FuDR and uridine, the remaining increase in type IV collagen secretion cannot be explained by an increase in cell number. This suggests that the mechanism of increased type IV collagen secretion may include more than one signaling pathway that is tyrosine kinase-dependent. The PDGF-induced increase in laminin secretion is also dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, but it is not sensitive to protein kinase C inhibition or intracellular Ca2+ depletion. In fact, inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation was the only way in which we were able to prevent the induction of laminin secretion by PDGF. This eliminates any involvement of PLC and therefore implicates other signaling pathways that may be initiated by receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine. These include activation of Ras through GRB2 as well as the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (21Claesson-Welsh L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 37-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This arrangement of distinct signaling pathways gives the cell the potential to regulate the amount of secretion of a given protein independently of the others, making it possible for the cell to change the quantity, as well as the composition, of its basement membrane (see Diagram 1). Although these findings would indicate that PDGF stimulation increases the production of basement membrane by myoblasts, electron microscopic evidence shows that basement membrane is not discernible on the surface of muscle cells in vivo until they have fused to form myotubes (22Tidball J.G. Lin C. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 257: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present study shows an increase in laminin, collagen type IV, and fibronectin in the culture media of PDGF-stimulated cells, but no increase in cell-associated laminin, collagen type IV, or fibronectin. These observations suggest that the ECM molecules released by myoblasts following PDGF stimulation may serve some function other than basement membrane formation. Previous investigations (5von der Mark K. Öcalan M. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Foster R.F. Thompson J.F. Kaufman S.J. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. von der Mark K. Dev. Biol. 1988; 125: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have shown that laminin can stimulate myoblast locomotion, proliferation, and differentiation. These functions are antagonistic, at least to some degree, to those associated with fibronectin, which is present at high concentrations in muscle in vivo at the time that morphogenetic migrations of myogenic cells cease (25Chiquet M. Eppenberger H.M. Turner D.C. Dev. Biol. 1981; 88: 220-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Turner D.C. Lawton J. Dollenmeier P. Ehrismann R. Chiquet M. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fibronectin is also capable of stimulating myoblast proliferation in vitro (26Turner D.C. Lawton J. Dollenmeier P. Ehrismann R. Chiquet M. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), delaying myoblast fusion (27Podleski T.R. Greenberg I. Schlessinger J. Yamada K.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 122: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and delaying expression of muscle myosin and desmin (5von der Mark K. Öcalan M. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The results of the present study that show a large increase in laminin secretion and only a slight change in fibronectin secretion following PDGF stimulation could suggest that the end effect of PDGF stimulation of myogenic cells would be promoting cell differentiation via laminin-mediated effects. The duration of stimulation in the present study was too brief to observe fusion of myogenic cells, and no other indicators of differentiation were assayed. However, previous studies have shown that PDGF stimulation of L6J1 myoblasts used at concentrations employed in the present study will inhibit myotube formation (8Jin P. Rahm M. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Sejersen T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1665-1672Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Jin P. Sejersen T. Ringertz N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1245-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduce the proportion of muscle cells expressing myosin heavy chain (29Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Balestreri T.M. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and reduce the expression of creatine phosphokinase and sarcomeric actin (28Jin P. Sejersen T. Ringertz N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1245-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mRNA for muscle myosin heavy chain does not appear in L6 cells until after mRNA for PDGF receptor is no longer detectable (28Jin P. Sejersen T. Ringertz N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1245-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PDGF treatment of muscle cells causes an inhibition of differentiation, even though the treatment also elevates laminin secretion, which can stimulate muscle cell differentiation and muscle myosin expression when administered alone (5von der Mark K. Öcalan M. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The influence of laminin on promoting differentiation may become apparent only after the influence of PDGF has been removed. This would be consistent with the sequence of events observed in vivo (30Bischoff, R., (1994) Myology, (Engle, A. G., Franzini-Armstrong, C., eds), Vol. 1, pp. 97–118, McGraw-Hill, New York.Google Scholar). An additional function for PDGF stimulation of laminin and collagen type IV secretion may be to provide a positive chemotactic signal for myoblasts and other cells present in developing muscle. Both laminin and type IV collagen have been shown to stimulate directed migration of myogenic, neuronal, and other cell types (24Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. von der Mark K. Dev. Biol. 1988; 125: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Aznavoorian S. Stracke M.L. Krutzsche H. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), while PDGF is chemotactic for many mesenchymal cells and myogenic cells (32Venkatasubramanian K. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1984; 104: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for chemotactic signaling by collagen type IV and PDGF may share some characteristics. Type IV collagen-stimulated chemotaxis is mediated by elevating intracellular concentrations of free calcium in target cells (33Savarese D.M.F. Russell J.T. Fatatis A. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21928-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while PDGF stimulation also causes an elevation in intracellular free calcium (34Ives H.E. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1950-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Moolenaar W.H. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8066-8069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it has not yet been tested whether that elevation in calcium following PDGF stimulation is necessary for myoblast migrations. The positive chemotactic effects of PDGF, laminin, and type IV collagen, together with observations that PDGF stimulates laminin and collagen type IV secretion, suggest that the elevation in laminin and collagen type IV secretion following PDGF stimulation can provide a mechanism for amplifying the effects of PDGF on chemotaxis. Since PDGF has a brief half-life following its secretion (36Bowen-Pope D.F. Malpass T.W. Foster D.M. Ross R. Blood. 1984; 64: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it can function only transiently as a chemoattractant. However, the effects of PDGF can be amplified over longer periods if PDGF also stimulates continued, elevated synthesis of other chemoattractants, such as laminin. The results of the present study that show laminin secretion remains elevated for periods of at least 24 h following 10 min of PDGF stimulation support this hypothesis. It may be significant that laminin and type IV collagen increase the frequency of neurite sprouting (reviewed in Ref. 37Sanes J.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 491-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and that muscle cells bearing PDGF receptors are most prevalent in muscle during the latter third of fetal development (38Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Seifert R.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), at the stage when neurite invasion into muscle occurs most extensively."
https://openalex.org/W2001810384,"We have set out to test a model for tissue-specific gene expression that relies on the early replication of expressed genes to sequester limiting activating transcription factors. Using an erythroid cell line, we have tested the changes in the DNA binding activity of the lineage-restricted transcription factor GATA-1 through the cell cycle. We find that GATA-1 activity is low in G1, peaks in mid-S phase, and then decreases in G2/M. In contrast, the binding activities of two ubiquitous transcription factors, Oct1 and Sp1, remain high in G2/M. GATA-1 protein and mRNA vary in a similar manner through the cell cycle, suggesting that the expression of the gene or the stability of its message is regulated. Although a number of transcription factors involved in the control of the cell cycle or DNA replication have been shown to peak in S phase, this is the first example of a lineage-restricted transcription factor displaying S phase-specific DNA binding activity. One interpretation of these data leads to a model in which the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding amplifies the effect of early replication on the activation of erythroid-specific genes at the same time as preventing activation of non-erythroid genes containing GATA-responsive elements. These results may also relate to recent data implicating GATA-1 function in apoptosis and cell cycle progression.

These results may also relate to recent data implicating GATA-1 function in apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The relationship between cell division and differentiation is still unclear. In the hematopoietic system, it has long been thought that differentiation requires prior or concomitant cell division (1Till J.E. McCulloch E.A. Siminovitch L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), but direct evidence for a mechanistic relationship has been hard to obtain. One potential mechanism involves the effect of DNA replication on repressive chromatin and stable transcription complexes. The passage of a replication fork through a chromatin template is known to transiently disrupt both histone octamers and complexes of transacting factors required for programming gene expression (2Svaren J. Chalkley R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Brown D.D. Cell. 1986; 47: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subsequently, as nucleosomes reform behind the replication fork, transcription factors have a window of opportunity to bind and either reprogram gene expression or reassemble committed genes (2Svaren J. Chalkley R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 5Villarreal L.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 512-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence in support of a role for DNA replication in gene activation for a variety of viral and cellular genes has been provided by the activating effect of an origin of replication in transient transfection assays (6Enver T. Brewer A.C. Patient R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Wilson A.C. Patient R.K.

Lee B.A. Jackson S.P. Proudfoot N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the normal cellular context, a strong correlation exists between the replication timing of a gene and its state of transcriptional activity. Specifically, replication early in S phase is associated with expression for a large number of tissue-specific genes in a variety of different cell types (10Holmquist G.P. Am. J. Human Genet. 1987; 40: 151-173PubMed Google Scholar, 11Calza R.E. Eckhardt L.A. DelGiudice T. Schildkraut C.L.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A well studied example is the β globin locus, which is replicated early in erythroid cells where it is transcribed but late in fibroblasts where it is not (13Hatton K.S. Dhar V. Brown E.H. Iqbal M.A. Stuart S. Didamo V.T. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Epner E. Forrester W.C. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8081-8085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The major determinant of erythroid expression of this locus is the locus control region, a set of nuclease hypersensitive sites located several kilobases upstream of the first gene in the cluster. The locus control region is required both for transcription and early replication of the β globin locus (15Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), further maintaining the correlation between replication timing and tissue-specific gene activation, leading to a model where early replication removes repressive chromatin and allows activating transcription factors to bind (4Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factor availability is clearly an important component of such a model. If the overall nuclear concentration of critical factors remained constant in the cell cycle, titration of transcription factors by early replicating genes would limit their availability for binding to later replicating genes with the same control sequences, as has been suggested for the early replicating somatic 5 S RNA genes of Xenopus (4Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Gottesfeld J. Bloomer L.S.

Biol. 1982; 47: 879-884Crossref Google Scholar). Alternatively, sequestration of transcription factors to prevent activation of genes replicating in late S phase would be further enhanced by a concomitant decrease in factor DNA binding activity. These considerations have led to the suggestion that fluctuations in the levels of critical transacting factors during S phase may amplify the effect on chromatin remodeling conferred by early replication (6Enver T. Brewer A.C. Patient R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have set out to test this model, using an erythroid cell line that contains both a transcriptionally poised β globin gene that replicates during the first half of S phase (14Epner E.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4958-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and GATA-1, a lineage-restricted transcription factor crucial for erythroid differentiation (20Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E.

Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that has potential binding sites in the regulatory sequences of all erythroid genes (22Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed at increasingly higher levels during erythroid maturation (23Leonard M. Brice M. Engel J.D. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find that the availability of GATA-1 but not ubiquitous factors does indeed vary in the cell cycle in a manner likely to amplify the effects of replication timing. GATA-1 therefore represents a candidate molecule for linking erythroid transcription and early replication. These data can also be linked with recent observations that GATA-1 may be directly involved in control of the cell cycle and the choice among proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (24Dubart A. Romeo P.H. Vainchenker W. Dumenil D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3711-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar–26Blobel G.A. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1687-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).

Asynchronous log phase cells were separated into different stages of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation, as follows. 108-109 cells were pelleted, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at a concentration of approximately 107 cells/ml, and injected into the chamber of a Beckman JE-5.0 elutriation rotor spinning at 3000 rpm containing ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline pumped at 21 ml/min. The pump rate was incremented in 10-15 steps up to 65 ml/min, and elutriated fractions were collected onto ice. Fractions were then pelleted, resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by Coulter counter to determine cell concentration and size distribution. Aliquots of 5 × 105 cells were removed, stained with propidium iodide (28Tate E.H. Wilder M.E. Cram L.S. Wharton W. Cytometry. 1983; 4: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and analyzed by FACS to determine the quality of the elutriation. Adjacent fractions that consisted of essentially identical cell cycle profiles were pooled, and nuclear proteins were then extracted. murine erythroleukemia cells fluorescence-activated cell sorting electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Elutriated cells were pelleted and then taken up at constant cell concentration in ice-cold 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2 containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease (5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml bestatin), kinase (0.5 mM EDTA), and phosphatase (1 Mβ-glycerophosphate, 0.2 M levamisole, 0.25 M NaF, 20 mM sodium vanadate) inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 15 min, lysed cells were pelleted at 6500 rpm in a microfuge for 2 min at 4°C, and the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 2 volumes of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2 containing 350 mM NaCl plus inhibitors. After 15 min on ice, nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min. Glycerol was added to the supernatants to 25%, and aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −70°C. Nuclear extracts (0.2-4 μl) were mixed with 7.5 μl of 4 × buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 4% w/v Ficoll), 1 μg of poly(dIdC)·;poly(dIdC) nonspecific competitor DNA, and specific competitor DNAs where appropriate.

Binding reactions were then loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide/0.5 × TBE gel that had been pre-electrophoresed at 200 V until the current across it was 11 mA. After 2 h electrophoresis at 4°C, gels were dried down and autoradiographed. Laser densitometry was performed with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer. The cell cycle position of the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity was estimated by using the quantitative FACS data (see, for example, Fig. 1a). 2n and 4n, representing DNA content at the beginning and end of the cell cycle, were defined as the positions of the peaks in fractions 1 and 7, respectively. The n value for the fraction with the highest GATA-1 DNA binding activity was determined relative to these. Peak values from four separate elutriations were used to derive a mean cell cycle position for GATA-1 DNA binding activity. Cell equivalents of cell cycle-fractionated extracts were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and semi-dry electroblotted onto Hybond C+ nitrocellulose (Amersham). GATA-1 protein was immunodetected with anti-mouse GATA-1 antibody (a kind gift of J. D. Engel) after blocking with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by binding with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and treatment with ECL (Amersham). Total RNA was extracted from elutriated cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62891) Google Scholar), separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, alkaline blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham), and probed with a 32P random hexamer-labeled GATA-1 XhoI fragment. To perform an analysis of GATA-1 DNA binding activity through the cell cycle, asynchronous MEL cells (27Friend C. Scher W. Holland J. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) were fractionated by centrifugal elutriation. This technique separates bulk suspension cells by size and, because cell volume increases through the cell cycle, results in fractionation of cells according to their position in the cell cycle. The cell cycle composition of the fractionation was assessed by FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells taken from each fraction (a typical example is shown in Fig. 1a). The percentages of cells in each phase of the cell cycle for a typical elutriation are summarized in Fig. 1b (cells are defined as G1, S, or G2/M depending on their DNA content (2n, 2-4n, and 4n, respectively)). We assessed GATA-1 DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear proteins, salt extracted from equal numbers of cells through the cell cycle, were incubated with an oligonucleotide containing a strong GATA-1 binding site from the mouse α1 globin promoter (29Perkins N.D. Nicolas R.H. Plumb M.A. Goodwin G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1299-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed (Fig. 2a, upper panel, lanes 1-7). Nuclear protein from asynchronous MEL cells was also analyzed (lane 8), and the identity of the GATA-1 band shift was confirmed by comparing the effects of specific (self-competition, lane 9) and nonspecific (an oligonucleotide containing a mutated GATA-1 site, lane 10) oligonucleotide competitors. Clearly, there is variation in GATA-1 DNA binding activity per cell through the cell cycle, with low levels in G1 (lanes 1 and 2), an increase to a peak of activity in S phase (lane 5), followed by a decrease in late S/G2 (lanes 6 and 7). Comparison of the FACS profiles for these fractions shows that GATA-1 DNA binding activity is highest in mid-S phase cells (Fig. 1a, fraction 5) compared with early S (Fig. 1a, fraction 4) and late S (Fig. 1a, fraction 6). Quantitation of the GATA-1 band intensities indicates that there is a 4-fold increase in GATA-1 DNA binding activity between early G1 and mid-S phase and an 11-fold decrease between mid-S and G2/M (Fig. 2b). Analysis of GATA-1 DNA binding activity from several different elutriations revealed a consistent peak in mid-S phase. The position of this peak was quantitated by referring to the FACS analysis of each elutriation (see, for example, Fig. 1a). 2n and 4n, representing DNA content at the beginning and end of the cell cycle, were defined as the positions of the G1 and G2/M peaks in fractions 1 and 7, respectively. The n value for the GATA-1 binding peak in each case was calculated relative to these. Data from four separate elutriations yielded a mean value of 2.98n with a standard deviation of 0.04. Thus, GATA-1 binding activity reproducibly peaks in mid-S phase. The drop in GATA-1 DNA binding from mid-S to G2/M was also reproducible, averaging 7-fold in the four elutriations. To determine whether the variation in GATA-1 DNA binding activity was particular to GATA-1 in this cell line or whether it was a general feature shared with other transcription factors, we determined the DNA binding activity of Oct1 and Sp1, two transcription factors whose cell cycle-regulated DNA binding activity has been characterized previously. Oct1 DNA binding activity has been studied in HeLa cells, and it does not appear to vary relative to bulk protein through the cell cycle except during mitosis, when it loses DNA binding activity (32Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Dalton S. Coleman J.R. Wells J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We therefore determined Oct1 DNA binding activity in equal numbers of MEL cells by EMSA, using an oligonucleotide containing the octamer motif from the mouse IgH chain gene enhancer (Fig. 2a, middle panel). In contrast to the result seen with GATA-1, Oct1 DNA binding activity does not appear to peak in S phase but instead is highest in the last elutriated fraction, which contains a mixture of G2 and M cells (Fig. 2a, middle panel, lanes 1-7). As cell volume increases through the cell cycle, we conclude that the nuclear concentration of Oct1 competent for DNA binding remains broadly the same, consistent with the published data (32Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Dalton S. Coleman J.R. Wells J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A second ubiquitous transcription factor, Sp1, has also been shown not to vary in DNA binding activity through the cell cycle in various cell types (34Dou Q.P. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine its activity in MEL cells. An oligonucleotide containing a binding site for Sp1 gave a similar result to Oct1, with the amount of Sp1 DNA binding activity increasing progressively through the cell cycle (Fig. 2a, lower panel). Thus, for two ubiquitously expressed transcription factors, it appears that there is an increase in DNA binding activity concomitant with increasing nuclear volume through the cell cycle, likely maintaining a broadly constant concentration of nuclear protein. In contrast, although GATA-1 DNA binding activity increases in a similar way through to S phase, it contrasts with the other two transcription factors by exhibiting a sharp decrease in activity in late S/G2. GATA-1 revealed a similar profile when we took into account the doubling in nuclear chromatin protein during the cell cycle. Fig. 2b is a plot of the data in Fig. 2a showing the change in DNA binding activities of GATA-1, Oct-1, and Sp1 for equal amounts of nuclear protein through the cell cycle. The DNA binding activities of all three factors increase between G1 and early S. However, GATA-1 DNA binding activity decreases in G2/M (to 9% of peak value), while Oct1 and Sp1 remain high in G2/M (93 and 147% of peak values, respectively). We next asked whether the S phase peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity reflected a change in the amount of GATA-1 protein through the cell cycle or whether GATA-1 DNA binding activity was being regulated by some post-translational mechanism, such as phosphorylation. Nuclear protein from equal numbers of cell cycle-fractionated cells was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotted, and probed with an antibody specific for GATA-1 (Fig. 3b). Variation in the amount of GATA-1 protein through the cell cycle can be seen (lanes 1-7), with a peak in mid-S phase (lane 5), in the same fraction where DNA binding activity is at its highest (Fig. 3a, lane 5). Furthermore, the magnitude of the changes in GATA-1 protein and DNA binding activity through the cell cycle is broadly similar. Quantitation of band intensities indicates that between early G1 and mid-S the amount of GATA-1 protein increases 5-fold while DNA binding activity increases 4-fold. Similarly, between mid-S and G2/M the amount of GATA-1 protein decreases 8-fold and DNA binding activity 11-fold. Taken together, these data indicate that the variation in GATA-1 DNA binding activity through the cell cycle is primarily due to variations in the total amount of GATA-1 protein and that post-translational mechanisms make at most a minor contribution to the change in GATA-1 DNA binding activity. The varying amounts of nuclear GATA-1 protein through the cell cycle might come about by changes in protein stability, subcellular localization, or gene expression. However, we have assayed GATA-1 DNA binding activity in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and found similar S phase peaks with low levels in G1 and G2/M. 2M. E. Cullen and R. K. Patient, unpublished observation. In particular, we do not detect high levels of GATA-1 DNA binding activity in the cytoplasm in G2/M, which would be expected if the drop in nuclear GATA-1 DNA binding activity we observe in this phase of the cell cycle was due to shuttling between compartments. To investigate the possibility that the variation in the amount of GATA-1 protein was due to changing levels of gene expression, total RNA was extracted from cell cycle-fractionated cells, separated on an agarose gel, Northern blotted, and then probed for GATA-1 message (Fig. 3c). A peak in the level of steady state GATA-1 mRNA was seen in mid-S phase (lane 5), as found for both GATA-1 DNA binding activity and GATA-1 total protein (Fig. 3, a and b, lanes 5). The change in the amount of GATA-1 mRNA (6-fold) between early G1 and mid-S phase is similar to that of protein (5-fold) and DNA binding activity (4-fold). The drop in the level of message between mid-S and G2/M decreases only a little less (4-fold) than protein and mean DNA binding activity (8- and 7-fold, respectively). Thus, the primary control over GATA-1 DNA binding activity appears to be at the RNA level, but there may be some additional control at the protein level. Variations in DNA binding activity through the cell cycle have been found for ubiquitous transcription factors involved in some of the central events of the cell cycle, including Jun (35Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Pena A. Lipson K. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar), E2F (36Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar), factors regulating the expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis (34Dou Q.P. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Pena A. Lipson K. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar), and S phase-specific histone gene expression (19Dhar V. Mager D. Iqbal A. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4958-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Holthuis J. Owen T.A. van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L. Ramsey-Ewing A. Kennedy M.B. Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Soprano K.J. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Science. 1990; 247: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to these examples, we have now shown that GATA-1, a lineage-restricted transcription factor that targets tissue-specific genes, possesses S phase-specific DNA binding activity in cycling cells. Activation of GATA-1 expression has also been seen in quiescent hematopoietic progenitors upon entrance into the cell cycle (38Sposi N.M. Zon L.I. Care A. Valtieri M. Testa U. Gabbianelli M. Mariani G. Bottero L. Mather C. Orkin S.H. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). There are several ways in which our observations can be interpreted. One possibility is that GATA-1-directed control of the erythroid program operates through the regulation of erythroid-specific replication origins containing GATA sites, causing early replication and hence gene activation. Since several transcription factors are required as origin-specific replication factors by certain viruses, including Oct1 and βCCAAT/NF1 family members (39DePamphilis M.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 635-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it is possible that specific replication origins located near to GATA-1-responsive genes may be activated by GATA-1 early in S phase, inducing early replication and subsequent transcriptional activation by GATA-1. An origin of replication has been mapped between the δ and β globin genes of the human β globin locus (40Kitsberg D. Selig S. Keshet I. Cedar H. Nature. 1993; 366: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and it is the origin used for early replication of this region in erythroid cells. Furthermore, there is a requirement for the presence of the locus control region, which contains several GATA-1 sites and directs β globin gene expression, for early replication of this region of the chromosome (15Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, there is little evidence supporting a role for GATA-1 in eukaryotic origin activity or replication, although it does appear to cause growth inhibition and bind to the origin of replication in Escherichia coli (41Trudel P. Provost S. Massie B. Chartrand P. Wall L. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 684-693PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, from our data the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2a) occurs too late to fire the β globin locus origin early in S phase (19Dhar V. Mager D. Iqbal A. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4958-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A more attractive model based on the correlation between replication timing of genes and their expression (2Svaren J. Chalkley R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 5Villarreal L.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 512-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Holmquist G.P. Am. J. Human Genet. 1987; 40: 151-173PubMed Google Scholar) positions the effect of GATA-1 DNA binding activity downstream of replication. We envisage that the observed pattern of GATA-1 binding through the cell cycle may be necessary to amplify the effect of early replication on transcriptional activation. As early replicating erythroid genes become stripped of chromatin and active gene complexes, GATA-1 binding sites in regulatory elements, including the locus control region, become available (Fig. 4, left side). By having sufficiently high levels of GATA-1 to compete successfully with the reassembly of repressive chromatin, the expression of GATA-1-activated erythroid genes is maintained. We note that the replication of the locus control region, the major determinant of erythroid expression in MEL cells (14Epner E. Forrester W.C. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8081-8085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Dhar V. Mager D. Iqbal A. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4958-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), correlates well with the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity. High levels of GATA-1 throughout S phase could lead to the activation of later replicating genes that are not part of the erythroid program but are normally responsive to other members of the GATA family. Genes containing GATA sites are expressed in a wide range of non-erythroid tissues (22Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Neave B. Rodaway A. Wilson S.W. Patient R. Holder N. Mechanisms Dev. 1995; 51: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 44Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the high levels of GATA-1 found in MEL cells, it seems unlikely that passive titration of GATA-1 by binding sites in early replicating activated genes is sufficient to prevent the activation of later replicating genes, as has been suggested for the differential effect of transcription factor IIIA on the expression of somatic and oocyte 5 S RNA genes (4Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Gottesfeld J. Bloomer L.S. Cell. 1982; 28: 781-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Instead, we suggest that the decrease in GATA-1 activity that occurs during late S phase is required to prevent activation of non-erythroid genes subject to activation by other GATA family members (Fig. 4, right side). By ensuring that GATA factor availability and target site accessibility occur in the same temporal compartment of S phase, subsets of genes with closely related control sequences can be activated independently. Finally, another interpretation of these data has been prompted by several recent papers suggesting a role for GATA-1 in control of the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of GATA-1 in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines can lead to alterations in the length of segments of the cell cycle (24Dubart A. Romeo P.H. Vainchenker W. Dumenil D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3711-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, high levels of ectopic GATA-1 cause S phase to lengthen in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that the reduction in GATA-1 DNA binding activity we see here may be necessary for the correctly timed exit from S phase. GATA-1 also appears to function as an erythroid survival factor, since differentiation of GATA-1 negative ES cells along the erythroid lineage, or abrogation of GATA-1 activity in MEL cells, leads to premature apoptosis (25Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Blobel G.A. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1687-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, the high GATA-1 DNA binding activity we see in S phase may be necessary to prevent apoptosis. The emerging picture is that the choice among proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis is affected by the level of GATA-1. Our data demonstrating a peak of GATA-1 DNA binding activity in mid-S, downstream of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoints, support the idea that GATA-1 has a cell cycle role in erythroid cells.
