https://openalex.org/W2119885778,"Swift elimination of undesirable cells is an important feature in tumour suppression and immunity. The tumour suppressor p53 and interferon-α and -β (IFN-α/β) are essential for the induction of apoptosis in cancerous cells and in antiviral immune responses, respectively, but little is known about their interrelationship. Here we show that transcription of the p53 gene is induced by IFN-α/β, accompanied by an increase in p53 protein level. IFN-α/β signalling itself does not activate p53; rather, it contributes to boosting p53 responses to stress signals. We show examples in which p53 gene induction by IFN-α/β contributes to tumour suppression. Furthermore, we show that p53 is activated in virally infected cells to evoke an apoptotic response and that p53 is critical for antiviral defence of the host. Our study reveals a hitherto unrecognized link between p53 and IFN-α/β in tumour suppression and antiviral immunity, which may have therapeutic implications."

The genes mutated in NPHP1 and NPHP4 have been identified, and a gene locus associated with infantile nephronophthisis (NPHP2) was mapped. The kidney phenotype of NPHP2 combines clinical features of NPHP and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Here, we identify inversin (INVS) as the gene mutated in NPHP2 with and without situs inversus. We show molecular interaction of inversin with nephrocystin, the product of the gene mutated in NPHP1 and interaction of nephrocystin with beta-tubulin, a main component of primary cilia. We show that nephrocystin, inversin and beta-tubulin colocalize to primary cilia of renal tubular cells. Furthermore, we produce a PKD-like renal cystic phenotype and randomization of heart looping by knockdown of invs expression in zebrafish. The interaction and colocalization in cilia of inversin, nephrocystin and beta-tubulin connect pathogenetic aspects of NPHP to PKD, to primary cilia function and to left-right axis determination."
https://openalex.org/W2008626549,"Protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)- and CD1-restricted CD8 T cells, but the mechanisms underlying antigen delivery to antigen-presenting molecules remain enigmatic. Macrophages, the primary host cells for mycobacteria, are CD1-negative. Here we show that M. tuberculosis phagosomes are secluded from the cytosolic MHC-I processing pathway and that mycobacteria-infected cells lose their antigen-presenting capacity. We also show that mycobacteria induce apoptosis in macrophages, causing the release of apoptotic vesicles that carry mycobacterial antigens to uninfected antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Inhibition of apoptosis reduced transfer of antigens to bystander cells and activation of CD8 T cells. Uninfected dendritic cells, which engulfed extracellular vesicles, were indispensable for subsequent cross-presentation of antigens, through MHC-I and CD1b, to T cells from mycobacteria-sensitized donors. This new 'detour' pathway for presentation of antigens from a phagosome-contained pathogen shows the functional significance of infection-induced apoptosis in the activation of CD8 T cells specific for both protein and glycolipid antigens in tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2011349880,"Inactivating mutations of Phex cause X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) by increasing levels of a circulating phosphaturic factor. FGF23 is a candidate for this phosphaturic factor. Elevated serum FGF23 levels correlate with the degree of hypophosphatemia in XLH, suggesting that loss of Phex function in this disorder results in either diminished degradation and/or increased biosynthesis of FGF23. To establish the mechanisms whereby Phex regulates FGF23, we assessed Phex-dependent hydrolysis of recombinant FGF23 in vitro and measured fgf23 message levels in the Hyp mouse homologue of XLH. In COS-7 cells, overexpression of FGF23 resulted in its degradation into N- and C-terminal fragments by an endogenous decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone-sensitive furin-type convertase. Phex-dependent hydrolysis of full-length FGF23 or its N- and C-terminal fragments could not be demonstrated in the presence or absence of decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone in COS-7 cells expressing Phex and FGF23. In a reticulolysate system, apparent cleavage of FGF23 occurred with wild-type Phex, the inactive Phex-3'M mutant, and vector controls, indicating nonspecific metabolism of FGF23 by contaminating enzymes. These findings suggest that FGF23 is not a direct Phex substrate. In contrast, by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, the levels of fgf23 transcripts were highest in bone, the predominant site of Phex expression. In addition, Hyp mice displayed a bone-restricted increase in fgf23 transcripts in association with inactivating Phex mutations. Increased expression of fgf23 was also observed in Hyp-derived osteoblasts in culture. These findings suggest that Phex, possibly through the actions of unidentified Phex substrates or other downstream effectors, regulates fgf23 expression as part of a potential hormonal axis between bone and kidney that controls systemic phosphate homeostasis and mineralization."

https://openalex.org/W1979164049,"Mammalian cells respond to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by attenuation of protein translation mediated through the PERK-eIF2α pathway and transcriptional activation of genes such as Grp78/BiP encoding ER chaperone proteins. The disruption of PERK function or the blocking of eIF2α Ser51 phosphorylation fails to attenuate translation after ER stress and also results in substantial impairment of Grp78/BiP induction by ER stress. While the activation of the Grp78 promoter by the ATF6 pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum stress elements (ERSEs) is well documented, the molecular mechanism linking PERK activation to Grp78 stress induction is unknown. We report here that ATF4, a transcription factor whose translation is up-regulated by the PERK-eIF2α pathway, can activate the Grp78 promoter independent of the ERSE. The ATF4-activating site is localized to an ATF/CRE sequence upstream of the ERSEs and is distinct from the C/EBP-ATF composite site previously identified as the ATF4 binding site in the ER stress-inducible chop promoter. In vitro translated ATF4 binding to the ATF/CRE site requires other nuclear co-factors from non-stressed cells, forming a complex that exhibits identical electrophoretic mobility as a thapsigargin-stress induced complex. Here we have identified the closely related ATF1 and CREB1 as nuclear co-factors that form in vivo complexes with endogenous ATF4. ER stress induces CREB1 phosphorylation and ATF1/CREB1 binding to the Grp78 promoter. Through the use of adenoviral vector expression systems, we provide evidence that when ATF4 function is suppressed and its binding partners are not able to compensate for its function, Grp78 induction by Tg and Tu is partially inhibited. Our studies resolve a mechanism responsible for inhibition of Grp78 mRNA induction by ER stress in cells that are functionally null for PERK or devoid of eIF2α phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1975551623,"To better understand the functional role of the mitochondrial network in shaping the Ca2+ signals in living cells, we took advantage both of the newest genetically engineered green fluorescent protein-based Ca2+ sensors (“Cameleons,” “Camgaroos,” and “Pericams”) and of the classical Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, all targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. The properties of the green fluorescent protein-based probes in terms of subcellular localization, photosensitivity, and Ca2+ affinity have been analyzed in detail. It is concluded that the ratiometric pericam is, at present, the most reliable mitochondrial Ca2+ probe for single cell studies, although this probe too is not devoid of problems. The results obtained with ratiometric pericam in single cells, combined with those obtained at the population level with aequorin, provide strong evidence demonstrating that the close vicinity of mitochondria to the Ca2+ release channels (and thus responsible for the fast uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria upon receptor activation) are highly stable in time, suggesting the existence of specific interactions between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Calcium is arguably the most versatile player within the cell. This second messenger is directly or indirectly involved in a myriad of processes that span virtually all physiological aspects of a cell, including its birth, health, disease, and death. From a generic point of view, calcium was often seen to exert its action exclusively through changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c). 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]c, cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration; [Ca2+]m, mitochondrial matrix free Ca2+ concentration; cyt, mt, and nu, prefixes denoting cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear, respectively; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; F, fluorescence intensity; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; PericamR, ratiometric pericam; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; CaM, calmodulin.1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]c, cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration; [Ca2+]m, mitochondrial matrix free Ca2+ concentration; cyt, mt, and nu, prefixes denoting cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear, respectively; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; F, fluorescence intensity; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; PericamR, ratiometric pericam; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; CaM, calmodulin. In recent years, these global changes have been dissected into regional variations, and different organelles have seen their importance accrued. In particular, in practically all cell types investigated, it has been found that the speed and amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake depend not only on the amplitude of the [Ca2+]c rise, but also on the source of Ca2+ and the mechanisms through which the Ca2+ increase is elicited. Specifically, fast increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m) can be triggered by either Ca2+ mobilization from stores or Ca2+ influx from the medium, or both, depending on the cell type. Because mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake takes place exclusively through the so-called calcium uniporter, and because this uniporter has a low affinity for Ca2+, it was not clear how the relatively low, average [Ca2+]c increase elicited by physiological stimuli could efficiently drive the observed rise in [Ca2+]m. The concept of high Ca2+ microdomains was thus developed to explain the very rapid Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria under physiological conditions. The hypothesis predicts that the fast [Ca2+]m increases depend on the close vicinity of these organelles to Ca2+ channels, where the Ca2+ concentration is sufficiently high to drive an efficient uptake by the low affinity mitochondrial uniporter (1Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 2Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that this microdomain model does not purport to explain all mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake; rather, the model provides a conceptual framework to explain the fast [Ca2+]m rises, erst-while paradoxical. Given the motility of both ER and mitochondria, and the requirement for regions of close proximity between the two organelles to ensure a highly efficient mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, it becomes of paramount importance to understand how this spatial arrangement is obtained. From a structural point of view, the ER is a highly convoluted reticular network, while mitochondria have historically been erroneously depicted as “fuse-like” individual organelles that pepper the cytoplasm. The notion that also mitochondria form a network within the cytoplasm is practically half a century old, but only recently has it been more widely accredited, with in vivo studies that have revealed a highly dynamic network that continuously undergoes multiple fusion and fission processes (2Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 3Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc.

Essentially, two major scenarios can be envisaged. On one hand, the vicinity of mitochondria to Ca2+ release sites may be a stochastic event, because of the abundance and motility of both organelles. On the other, transient or permanent interactions may exist to keep specific mitochondrial subpopulations close to sites where Ca2+ reaches high concentrations. It has been suggested that stable mitochondria-ER interactions might occur in adrenal medullary cells (6Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibáñez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. García-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), but this phenomenon has not been analyzed in detail. In the present study, we adopted a bipartite approach to explore this issue. For single cell studies we employed the new GFP-based Ca2+ probes selectively targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, whereas at the cell population level we took advantage of specific characteristics of aequorin, a Ca2+ probe with an established track record. Generation of Constructs—cDNA encoding the N-terminal part (comprising the first 36 amino acids) of subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase was fused, in-frame, to cDNA encoding DsRed (Clontech) to generate mt-DsRed. Mitochondrially targeted versions of Cameleon and split Cameleons were generated similarly. Cameleon, split Cameleons, and mtCamgaroo-2, and mt- and nuPericamR were generous gifts from Roger Y. Tsien and Atsushi Miyawaki, respectively. Details of all constructs are available upon request. Cell Cultures and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transient transfections, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (24-and 13-mm diameter for single cell imaging and for aequorin measurements, respectively). Transfections were performed at 50-70% confluence with the calcium phosphate method, using a total of 4 or 10 μg of DNA for small or large coverslips, respectively. Cell Imaging—Cells expressing fluorescent probes were observed 36 h after transfection on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan), with an oil immersion objective (×63, N.A. 1.40). Excitation light at appropriate wavelengths was produced by a monochromator (Polychrome II, TILL Photonics, Martinsried, Germany): 440 nm for cameleon and CFP-CaM, 500 nm for M13-YFP and camgaroo, and 415 and 490 nm for PericamR. Dichroic beam splitters were 455DRLP, 525DRLP, and 505DRLP, respectively. Emission filters were 480DF30 (for CFP) and 545DF35 (for YFP) in the case of cameleon, HQ520LP in the case of camgaroo, and 535RDF45 in the case of PericamR; when using cameleon, the emission filters were alternated using a filter wheel (Lambda 10-2, Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA). Filters and dichroic beam splitters were purchased from Omega Optical and Chroma Technologies (Brattleboro, VT). Images were acquired using a cooled CCD camera (Imago, TILL Photonics) attached to a 12-bit frame grabber. Synchronization of the monochromator and CCD camera was performed through a control unit using TILLvisION version 4.0 (TILL Photonics); this software was also used for image analysis. Additional image analyses employed the public domain ImageJ program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health by Wayne Rasband and available on the Internet. 2http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. For co-localization studies, confocal planes were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES system: for mtPericamR, the 488-nm line of a Kr-Ar laser was used together with a 522DF35 emission filter, whereas for mtDsRed, the 568-nm line and a 605DF32 emission filter were used. Unless otherwise specified, F measurements refer to average pixel intensities in regions covering >50% of the total mitochondrial or nuclear area. Whereas camgaroos respond to Ca2+ changes only with a change in F, ratiometric pericam shows an antiparallel behavior in response to Ca2+, i.e. upon Ca2+ binding, F upon excitation at 415 nm decreases, whereas F upon excitation at 490 nm increases. In a few experiments, however, the 415- and 490-nm signals did not behave in a perfectly antiparallel way. Such a behavior was random and most often because of either photobleaching or movement. In these cases the ratio of the two signals nicely corrects for the artifact. In a few cases, however, we noticed a drop of the 490-nm signal not accompanied by an increase in the 415-nm fluorescence that were not attributable to the above artifacts. The reason for this rare behavior is presently unknown, but, if it is observed, it can be verified by monitoring the fluorescence at the isosbestic point (470 nm). Aequorin Measurements—Cells transiently expressing aequorin were reconstituted in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB; containing, in mm, 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 Na3PO4, 1 MgSO4, 5.5 glucose, 20 Hepes, pH 7.4, at 37 °C), supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 5 μm coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 2 h. During the experimental procedure, cells were placed in a temperature-controlled chamber and perfused with KRB. Photons emitted were collected and analyzed as previously described (22Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Cell Stimulations—For in situ calibration experiments using mtPericamR, permeabilization was carried out by incubating cells in modified KRB (mKRB; containing, in mm, 10 NaCl, 130 KCl, 1 Na3PO4, 1 MgS04, 5 succinate, 10 Tris, pH 8.0, at 37 °C), supplemented with digitonin (100 μm) and FCCP (4 μm), after permeabilization. For in situ calibration experiments using nuPericamR, mKRB was buffered not with Tris but with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at 37 °C, and supplemented only with digitonin (20 μm); in addition, Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin was used (Sigma; 100 μg/ml); cells were maintained in mKRB for the remaining experimental procedures. Perfusion with histamine (100 μm) was employed to trigger Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Perfusion with cyclopiazonic acid (20 μm) was employed to inhibit ER Ca2+-ATPase. For cytoskeleton disruption, cells were first challenged with histamine and then incubated in KRB, in the presence of colchicine (ICN, Milan, Italy; 10 μg/ml) or cytochalasin D (ICN; 10 μm), or both, for 30 min. The second histamine stimulus was applied in the presence of the same drug(s). All experimental procedures and incubations were carried out at 37 °C. All chemicals were of analytical or highest available grade and, unless otherwise stated, were acquired from Sigma. Data shown represent typical results obtained in at least five independent experiments; numerical data are presented as mean ± S.D.; statistical significance was calculated by applying Student's t test. Choice of a Mitochondrial Ca 2+ Indicator for Single Cell Studies—The positively charged fluorescent indicator rhod-2 is often considered the indicator of choice to measure changes in mitochondrial [Ca2+] at the single cell level. Although this probe has been extensively used by different groups, its subcellular localization is far from ideal; most likely because of this, its use has given rise to partially contradictory results in different cell types (7Collins T.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25465-25470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The search for alternative calcium indicators has prompted the development of a number of genetically encoded fluorescent probes. These probes, however, have yet to be thoroughly characterized. Below we consider the three families of fluorescent indicators that have been recently introduced, i.e. Cameleons, Camgaroos, and Pericams. Cameleon is a GFP-based Ca2+ indicator, which was initially introduced as a probe for Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, ER, and nucleus (11Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). A mitochondrial cameleon has been generated by fusing at the N terminus of the cytosolic construct the targeting sequence of subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase (12Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This particular mitochondrial targeting presequence has been repeatedly shown to deliver fused proteins in an highly efficient and selective manner to the mitochondrial matrix (13Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 14Brini M. Pinton P. King M.P. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Rizzuto R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In a series of elegant experiments (12Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), it was observed that a cameleon targeted to mitochondria by this strategy only localizes efficiently in cells that express very low levels of the construct. We also confirmed that this fusion protein fails to localize correctly and transfected cells exhibit fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm; only rarely was a selective labeling of mitochondria observed. An attempt to bypass this problem was to use the so-called split cameleon (11Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar), in which two functional constituents of the cameleon are expressed individually. The two halves of the indicator were targeted to the mitochondrial matrix independently, using the same presequence as before. In this case, the M13-YFP moiety was efficiently delivered exclusively to the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1A, left panel); targeting of the CFP-CaM part was again deficient, although, with ∼50% of the fluorescence present throughout the cell body (Fig. 1A, right panel). The reasons for this behavior are not clear at present. Because of these difficulties, no further attempt to characterize mtCameleons was undertaken. Camgaroo is an insertional mutant of GFP, sensitive to Ca2+ (15Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). A mitochondrial version of this probe (mtCamgaroo-2; Ref. 16Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) possesses an N-terminal presequence that effectively targets it to the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1B), although in strongly fluorescent cells a residual signal is often present throughout the cell cytoplasm. Results obtained by Tsien and co-workers (16Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) indicated that mtCamgaroo-2 can be used to monitor changes in [Ca2+]m. Surprisingly, in our hands, HeLa cells expressing mtCamgaroo-2 transiently showed marginal, often undetected, changes in fluorescence when challenged with histamine (see below). The reason for this discrepancy lies in the illumination protocol used. When cells were illuminated continuously, a very rapid drop (to ∼50% of the initial F) was observed; this drop was not due to photobleaching because a short recovery (30 s) in the dark resulted in almost complete recovery of the initial F (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Importantly, the photoconverted form of the probe was almost completely insensitive to Ca2+ changes, as indicated by the lack of increase in F upon histamine addition after ∼10 s of continuous illumination (Fig. 2A, upper panel). If, on the contrary, the time of illumination was reduced to a minimum and at least 1 s between two successive illuminations were allowed, a clear increase in F was revealed by mtCamgaroo-2 upon histamine challenge (Fig. 2A, lower panel), on average about 20% of the initial value. Under the same conditions, a non-Ca2+-sensitive, but pH-sensitive, YFP gave no change in signal (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Using mtCamgaroo-2, we observed a substantial subcellular heterogeneity in peak Ca2+ increases in single HeLa cells challenged with histamine (Fig. 2B), in agreement with previous studies with rhod-2 or mtCameleons (7Collins T.J. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26411-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). With probes such as rhod-2 or mtCamgaroo-2 (that respond to alterations in [Ca2+] simply by changing F), changes in size and shape of organelles, as well as organelle movement, may all create artifacts that confound both quantitative and qualitative analyses (17Dunn K.W. Mayor S. Myers J.N. Maxfield F.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To overcome these limitations, we shifted our attention to the most recent genetically targeted Ca2+ probe family (the Pericams; Ref. 18Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the typical staining pattern of a HeLa cell transiently expressing a mitochondrially targeted ratiometric pericam (mtPericamR). The staining is highly specific and completely overlaps with that of a mitochondrially targeted red variant of GFP (mtDsRed). In addition, the nuF is almost indistinguishable from the background of non-transfected cells. The use of mtPericamR greatly diminishes the problem of photoconversion that plagues mtCamgaroo-2. Upon almost continuous illumination there is still an initial, rapid decrease in F at both wavelengths (but only ∼15%); as in the case of mtCamgaroo-2, the initial F is recovered after brief periods of non-illumination (data not shown). The significant difference in relation to mtCamgaroo-2 is that this probe retains its Ca2+ sensitivity even during periods of rapid data acquisition (see below). Characterization of mtPericamR—HeLa cells expressing mt-PericamR and challenged with histamine show a subcellular heterogeneous response, as reported previously using other non-ratiometric indicators, confirming that the differences between mitochondrial populations are real and not artifacts of movement. Fig. 3A shows pseudocolor-rendered ratios of a HeLa cell before and after a histamine challenge. When different subsets of mitochondria are selected for analyses, a clear heterogeneity is observed (Fig. 3B). We next addressed the problem of the relationship between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes in the same cell. Given that it has been repeatedly demonstrated in HeLa cells that the nucleus behaves essentially as the cytoplasm, we cotransfected these cells with a variant of PericamR targeted to the nucleus (nuPericamR) and mtPericamR. Under resting conditions, the ratio value was higher in the latter. This most likely reflects a difference in resting pH, rather than in [Ca2+] (see below). Upon a histamine challenge both compartments showed similar kinetics: a sharp rise in the F ratio, followed by a declining plateau, often accompanied by oscillations (Fig. 3C). Quantitatively, it was surprising to note that this increase was larger in the nucleus than in the mitochondria. This result is in sharp contrast with previous data obtained with aequorin, rhod-2, and mtCameleon, with all these probes, the increase in [Ca2+] has been found to be larger within mitochondria than in the nucleus (and cytoplasm). To verify whether this contradiction was because of a different affinity of the probe for Ca2+ in the two compartments, we carried out a calibration in situ with the widely used ionomycin and high Ca2+ method (e.g. Ref. 16Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A (upper panel), both compartments exhibit a sharp increase in the ratio upon histamine stimulation, which returns to basal levels after the agonist is washed away; addition of Ca2+ in the presence of the ionophore also causes an increase in the ratio, this time clearly biphasic: a first rapid increase, followed by a larger and slower rise. However, analysis of the two individual wavelengths shows distinct pictures in the case of histamine and ionomycin. In the former, the increase in ratio is because of a small increase in F upon excitation at 490 nm and a larger decrease in F upon excitation at 415 nm (Fig. 4A, lower panel). In the latter, the first rise is similar to that observed for histamine; the second rise, however, is fully because of an increase in F upon excitation at 490 nm, whereas the 415-nm signal remains essentially unchanged. Given that alkalinization increases the F of PericamR at 490 nm (18Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), the possibility of a pH artifact in the effect of ionomycin was thus considered. Cells expressing nuPericamR and mtPericamR were challenged with NH4Cl to increase the pH inside the cells without grossly changing the [Ca2+] (verified with fura-2). An apparent increase in [Ca2+] was observed in both compartments (Fig. 4B, upper panel), but this was due simply to an increase in the 490-nm signal (Fig. 4B, lower panel). A further confirmation that the ionomycin effect is because of a pH artifact is provided by monitoring F at the isosbestic point (470 nm). As expected, no fluorescence increase was observed at this wavelength in the case of histamine, whereas both ionomycin and NH4Cl caused a major increase in F at this wavelength (data not shown). To obtain an in situ measurement of the Ca2+ affinity of mtPericamR, we employed the following protocol. Cells were first treated with digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane and then with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP to equilibrate matrix pH with that in the medium. The external medium, without added Ca2+ and supplemented with 100 μm EGTA, was buffered at pH 8 to mimic the conditions of the mitochondrial matrix in intact cells. Under these conditions, given the absence of a mitochondrial membrane potential and of a pH gradient, matrix [Ca2+] rapidly establishes an equilibrium with the extracellular [Ca2+] via the uniporter. Indeed, further addition of ionomycin at any [Ca2+] resulted in no appreciable change in F. Increasing concentrations of CaCl2 in the medium resulted in increased F ratios (Fig. 5A) with no change at the isosbestic point. The apparent K′d of mtPericamR for Ca2+ was thus determined to be ∼11 μM (Fig. 5B), much higher than the 1.3 μm calculated in vitro (18Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Using this calibration procedure we could conclude that the mean increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] at the peak of a histamine challenge is about 10 μm with some regions reaching values well over 50 μm (see, for example, Fig. 3A, where ratio values of 2.5 and 3.4 correspond to 10 and 50 μm, respectively, according to the calibration shown in Fig. 5, A and B). It was more difficult to perform the same calibration procedure in the nucleus, because the digitonin treatment (100 μm, as used for calibrating mtPericamR) generally provoked the release of the nuclear probe. We tried to permeabilize the cells with S. aureus α-toxin (19Bhakdi S. Weller U. Walev I. Martin E. Jonas D. Palmer M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 182: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) but the results were unsatisfactory, given that very high concentrations of the toxin (∼100 μg/ml) resulted only in partial release of a trapped fluorescence probe such as fura-2. However, at lower digitonin concentrations (20 μm), complete release of fura-2 was obtained, whereas in the majority of the cells a large part of nuPericamR remained localized in the nucleus. Accordingly, the K′d of nuPericamR in situ was calculated to be ∼2.5 μm, similar to that calculated in vitro. The kinetics of the mitochondrial Ca2+ increase with respect to that in the nucleus were analyzed in the experiments presented in Fig. 6. The high rate of data acquisition permitted by the use of PericamR enabled us to acquire data points (F ratio upon excitation at two independent wavelengths) every 180-200 ms. Detailed analyses of the ratio increases immediately following histamine stimulation revealed different types of heterogeneity. In some cells, the mitochondrial response time was homogeneous, but with different rates of Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 6A). In others, mitochondria have similar rates of Ca2+ uptake, but different delays in relation to the nuclear [Ca2+] rise (data not shown). In general, the heterogeneity observed among different mitochondrial populations, in terms of the lag time between nucleoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+ increases, ranged from not appreciable (less than 200 ms) to well above 400 ms. On the other hand, in accordance with previously published results (18Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), the peak response of the mitochondria was reached with some delay (3-5 s) with respect to that in the nucleus (1-2 s). Stochastic or Regulated ER-Mitochondria Interactions?—Experiments presented above and previously published data confirm a substantial heterogeneity in the mitochondrial response to the Ca2+ increases elicited by an agent such as histamine (that by producing InsP3, mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores). The accepted interpretation for such heterogeneity (and for the speed and amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ increases) is that some of the organelles are very close to the InsP3-gated channels. In this way, they are exposed not to the mean increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+], but rather to the microdomains of much higher [Ca2+] that are formed close to the channels themselves. The still unanswered, but key question, is whether this vicinity is simply a stochastic event of two organelles that are densely packed within the cell (whereby the random movement and reorganizatio"

Here, we show by affinity chromatography that both, full-length Hsp70-protein and Hsp70-peptide TKD, specifically bind a 32-kDa protein derived from NK cell lysates.

Incubation of tumor cells with increasing concentrations of perforin-free, isolated granzyme B shows specific binding and uptake in a dose-dependent manner and results in initiation of apoptosis selectively in tumor cells presenting Hsp70 on the cell surface. Remarkably, Hsp70 cation channel activity was also determined selectively in purified phospholipid membranes of Hsp70 membrane-positive but not in membrane-negative tumor cells. The physiological role of our findings was demonstrated in primary NK cells showing elevated cytoplasmic granzyme B levels following contact with TKD. Furthermore, an increased lytic activity of Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells could be associated with granzyme B release by NK cells.

However, evidence has accumulated indicating that the presence of Hsp70 on the plasma membrane or in the extracellular milieu is highly immunogenic and exposes target cells to immunological attack (2Schild H.-J.

A peptide-independent “chaperokine effect” has been described for members of the HSP70 family. Binding of exogeneous HSP70 to monocytes via TLR2/4 induces receptor clustering in a CD14-dependent pathway (10Pfeiffer A. Böttcher A. Orso E. Kapinsky M. Nagy P. Bodnar A. Spreitzer I. Liebisch G.

We detected Hsp70, the major-stress inducible member of the HSP70 family, selectively in the plasma membrane of tumor cells, but not in normal cells by cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence (14Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wisenet M. Müller E. Meier T. Wilmanns W. Issels R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed most recently by proteomic profiling of tumor cell membranes (15Shin B.K. Wang H. Yim A.M. LeNaour F. Brichory F. Jang J.H. Zhao R. Puravs E. Tra J. Michael C.W. Misek D.E.

The amount of membrane-bound Hsp70 on tumor cells positively correlates with their sensitivity to lysis mediated by natural killer (NK) cells. Physical (i.e. heat, irradiation) and chemical (i.e. cytostatic drugs, alkyllysophospholipids) stress has been found to increase Hsp70 surface expression on tumor cells and thereby renders them better targets for NK cells (16Botzler C. Kis K. Eissner G. Issels R. Multhoff G. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 470-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Rabinovich B.A. Shannon J. Su R.-C. Miller R.G. J.

Incubation of purified NK cells with recombinant Hsp70 increases the cytolytic activity against Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells (19Multhoff G. Mizzen L. Winchester C.C. Milner C.M. Wenk S. Kampinga H. Laumbacher B. Johnson J. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). NK cells have been found to interact specifically with a 14-amino acid Hsp70 sequence, termed TKD (TKDNNLLGRFELSG, aa450–463), on the C-terminal of this protein. This region (TKD) is present in the ectoplasmic domain of viable tumor cells (20Multhoff G. Pfister K. Gehrmann M. Hantschel M. Gross C. Hafner M. Hiddemann W. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 337-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising that similar to full-length Hsp70 (19Multhoff G. Mizzen L. Winchester C.C. Milner C.M. Wenk S. Kampinga H. Laumbacher B. Johnson J. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1627-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), Hsp70-peptide TKD exhibits a comparable immunostimulatory capacity to NK cells (20Multhoff G. Pfister K. Gehrmann M. Hantschel M. Gross C. Hafner M. Hiddemann W. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 337-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the preceding observations indicate that Hsp70-peptide functions as a tumor-selective target recognition structure for NK cells (21Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wiesnet M. Eissner G. Issels R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4341-4350PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which NK cells lyse Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor target cells remained to be elucidated. The NK cell line YT was cultured at low cell densities ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 6 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen). The tumor sublines CX+/CX– and Colo+/Colo– were derived by cell sorting of CX-2 colon (Hsp70 positive: 60%) and Colo357 pancreas (Hsp70 positive: 60%) carcinoma cell lines using the Hsp70-specific monoclonal antibody C92F3B1 (Multimmune GmbH, Regensburg, Germany), according to a previously described protocol (21Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wiesnet M. Eissner G. Issels R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4341-4350PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp70 stably high expressing CX+ (Hsp70 positive: 80%) and Colo+ (Hsp70 positive: 85%) carcinoma sublines differ significantly from Hsp70 stably low expressing CX– (Hsp70 positive: 25%) and Colo– (Hsp70 positive: 35%) carcinoma cells. Carcinoma sublines and the non-NK leukemic cell line K562 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 6 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics. Exponentially growing tumor cells (day 1 after feeding of the cells) were used for granzyme B and camptothecin treatment. All cell lines were screened regularly for mycoplasma contaminations by an enzyme immunoassay detecting Mycoplasma arginini, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Achdeoplasma laidlawii, and Mycoplasma orale (Roche Diagnostics). Only mycoplasma-free cell lines were used. Primary NK cells were generated by CD3-depletion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a standard Miltenyi biotin separation method (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Sorted cells were activated by incubation of the NK cells for 3 days in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 IU/ml interleukin-2 (Chiron, Ratingen, Germany) and 2 μg/ml Hsp70-peptide TKD (TKDNNLLGRFELSG, aa450–463, Bachem Bubendorf, Switzerland). Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg/ml, Sigma), lyophilized, recombinant human Hsp70-protein (1 mg/ml, StressGen, British Columbia, Canada), and Hsp70-peptide TKD (1 mg/ml, Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) were incubated with equilibrated AminoLink-agarose beads (2 ml, Pierce) for 6 h, together with the reductant NaCNBH3, followed by removal of uncoupled material by extensive washes with Tris buffer and quenching non-reactive groups. Binding capacity of BSA, Hsp70-protein, and Hsp70-peptide TKD was greater than 95%. Cell lysates of NK cells and the leukemic non-NK cell line K562 were loaded onto BSA, Hsp70-protein, and Hsp70-peptide TKD-conjugated columns for 1 h at room temperature. Columns were washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 3 m sodium chloride in 20 mm Tris buffer, in 5 fractions (1 ml). Each fraction was subjected to a SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide slab gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with skim milk (0.1%) and incubation with monoclonal antibody directed against granzyme B (2C5, IgG2a, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), for 5 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed and incubated with a secondary mouse anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 s. A 32-kDa protein band was isolated by affinity chromatography on immobilized Hsp70-protein or Hsp70-peptide TKD, which was excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gels, digested with trypsin, and desalted using reversed phase ZIP tips (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The samples were embedded in 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid and the peptide masses were determined with a Perseptive Voyager DePro matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer in reflective mode. A peaklist was compiled with the m/z software (Proteometrics) and used for peak selection; the resulting peptide mass fingerprint was used to search the non-redundant NCBI protein data base using the Profound search engine (Proteometrics). Granzyme B was identified with 100% probability and >95% confidence. Membrane purification was performed by Dounce homogenization (100 × 106 tumor cells) in hypotonic, EDTA-free buffer containing the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by sequential centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and at 100,000 × g, at 4 °C, for 60 min. The pellet containing membranes was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.3 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6. Large unilamellar liposomes were prepared from plasma membranes derived of Hsp70 membrane-positive and membrane-negative tumors and applied to an orifice of about 100–120 μm in diameter with a Teflon film separating two compartments. The ionic solutions containing either symmetrical concentrations of KCl (200cis/200trans mm) or asymmetric concentrations (200cis/50trans mm) and 5 mm K-Hepes, 7.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and ATP (2 mm). The two ionic compartments were electrically connected via agar bridges and Ag/AgCl pellet electrodes to the input of a voltage clamp amplifier. Current was recorded using patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch-1D; Axon Instruments, CA) and data were stored on a PCM/VCR digital system (Toshiba) with a frequency response in the range from direct current to 25,000 Hz. Off-line analysis of the channel activity was carried out using the software package Pclamp 6 and Axosope (Axon Instruments). Cells (0.5 × 106) were fixed in paraformaldehyde (1% paraformaldehyde in PBS) for 10 min, and permeabilized in PBS containing BSA (0.5%), NaN3 (0.1%), and saponin (0.1%). Permeabilized cells were incubated either with the granzyme B-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibody HC2-PE (IgG1; Hölzel Diagnostika, Cologne, Germany) or with an isotype-matched IgG1 control antibody, at 4 °C for 1 h, in the dark. Following washing intracellular localized granzyme B was analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). Stock solutions of camptothecin (4 mg/ml, Sigma, Munich, Germany) were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Granzyme B (Hölzel Diagnostics, Cologne, Germany) solutions were freshly prepared directly before usage. Exponentially growing cells (0.5–1.5 × 106/ml) were incubated either with camptothecin at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml or with purified, enzymatically active granzyme B (10 ng/ml, 1 μg/ml, 2 μg/ml, 4 μg/ml) (22Shi L. Yang X. Froelich C. Greenberg A.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 125-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min, and 30 min either at 4 or 37 °C. After washing in RPMI 1640 medium binding and uptake was determined in non-permeabilized and permeabilized tumor cells by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy on a Axioscop 25 scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×40 objective and standard filters. Images were treated by multiplicative shading correction using the software Axiovison (Zeiss Vison, Jena, Germany). Granzyme B was visualized in red by using the HC2-PE antibody. Apoptotic cell death was measured after incubation of tumor cells with 10 ng/ml granzyme B for 4, 12, and 24 h by different apoptosis assays, as described below. Annexin V-FITC Staining—Briefly, cells were washed twice in Hepes buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and incubated with annexin V-FITC (Roche Diagnostics) for 10 min at room temperature. Annexin V-FITC positively stained cells were measured on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). DAPI Staining—Methanol/acetone fixed cells (0.1 × 106 cells/100 μl) were incubated with 0.5 μg/μl 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS/glycerol (3:1) for 15 min in the dark. Following washing in PBS the cells were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and analyzed for fluorescence using a Zeiss model Axioscop 2 scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×40 objective and standard filters. Apoptosis was visualized with DAPI staining in 50 cells, each. Images were treated by multiplicative shading correction using the software Axiovision (Zeiss). Cytochrome c—Cytochrome c was determined using a quantitative immunoassay (DCDCO, R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Briefly, untreated, camptothecin (4 μg/ml), or granzyme B (10 ng/ml)-treated cells (1.5 × 106/ml) were washed in PBS and treated with lysis buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants were removed and 200 μl of a 1:100, 1:250, and a 1:500 dilution was used for a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Following incubation with substrate solution in the dark for 30 min the reaction was stopped. The optical density of each well was determined on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 450 nm. The amount of cytochrome c was determined according to a calibration curve. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was measured using a 12-h 51Cr radioisotope assay. As target cells the colon carcinoma sublines CX+ and CX– were used. For blocking studies the monoclonal antibody C92F3B1 and an isotype matched control antibody (IgG1) were used at a final concentration of 5 μg/1 × 106 cells. Following incubation of CX+ and CX– target cells with the antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were labeled with 51Cr and the cytotoxicity assay was performed as described by MacDonald (23MacDonald H.R. Engers H.D. Cerottini J.C. Brunner K.T. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The percentage of specific lysis was calculated as: [(experimental release – spontaneous release)/(maximal release – spontaneous release)] × 100. Granzyme B release was compared in unstimulated NK cells (NK d0) and TKD-stimulated NK cells (NK d3) after a 4-h co-incubation period with tumor cell lines CX+/CX– and Colo+/Colo–, at different effector to target cell ratios (E:T) ranging from 20:1 to 2:1. For detection a granzyme B ELISPOT kit (number 552572, BD Biosciences) was used. Briefly, 96-well ELISPOT plates (MAIPN45, Millipore) were coated overnight at 4 °C with capture antibody, blocked with RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated with tumor and effector cells for 4 h at 37 °C, as specified before. After washing in deionized water and wash buffers A and B, biotinylated anti-granzyme B antibody was added (2 μg/ml) for 2 h. After another two washing steps granzyme B was visualized by the addition of freshly prepared avidin-horseradish peroxidase (1 h) and substrate solution (25 min incubation period). Spots were counted automatically using Immuno Spot Series I analyzer. Granzyme B Is a Partner of Hsp70 and Hsp70-Peptide TKD— Proteins that interact with Hsp70 were identified by affinity chromatography on immobilized Sepharose columns coupled either with human Hsp70-protein or a peptide derived from the C-terminal region of Hsp70, termed TKD (TKDNNLLGRFELSG, aa450–463). TKD corresponds to 14-amino acids localized in the extracellular domain of Hsp70, present on Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells, which mediate recognition by NK cells (20Multhoff G. Pfister K.

TKD was used in the affinity column to exclude the recognition of proteins by the substrate binding domain of Hsp70. Recently, we showed that Hsp70-protein and TKD, specifically bind to the NK cell line YT (24Gross C. Hansch D. Gastpar R. Multhoff G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 267-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assumed that YT cells provide an ideal tool for identifying Hsp70-interacting partners. YT cell lysates were fractionated on immobilized Hsp70 and TKD columns. The material bound to the columns was eluted with 3 m sodium chloride in five fractions. As controls, YT cell lysates were administered to carrier or BSA-conjugated columns. Moreover, lysate of a non-NK cell line (K562) was fractionated on TKD-conjugated affinity column. The eluted fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. A dominant protein band of apparent molecular weight of 32,000 was observed in fractions two (F2) and three (F3) of YT cell eluates derived from Hsp70-protein (Hsp70) or Hsp70-peptide (TKD) columns (Fig. 1A). This band was not detectable in eluates of carrier (data not shown) or BSA-conjugated columns nor in material eluted from the TKD affinity columns loaded with K562 cell lysates (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the 32-kDa protein band derived from F3 was excised from a SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue and digested with trypsin (Fig. 1B). The resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting. Sequences of the tryptic peptides exhibited 100% homology with granzyme B (Fig. 1B). The identity of the 32-kDa protein band as granzyme B was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody (2C5) against granzyme B. Fractionation of YT cell lysates on Hsp70-protein (Hsp70) and Hsp70-peptide (TKD) columns revealed the presence of granzyme B protein band by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). However, no granzyme B was detected in the eluted fraction of Hsp70 and TKD affinity columns loaded with K562 cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Also flow cytometry using a phycoerythrin-conjugated granzyme B antibody HC2-PE showed positive staining for cytoplasmic granzyme B in YT cells, but not in K562 cells (Fig. 1D). In summary, these data indicate that granzyme B interacts with full-length Hsp70-protein as well as Hsp70-peptide TKD. Specific Binding and Internalization of Granzyme B in Hsp70 Membrane-positive Tumor Cells—The preceding findings posed the question whether membrane-bound Hsp70 might enable specific binding and entry of granzyme B into the cytosol. Therefore, perforin-free, purified granzyme B was co-incubated with tumor cell sublines CX+/CX– and Colo+/Colo– that exhibit differential Hsp70 membrane expression. A light microscopical analysis of untreated CX+ and Colo+ cells (control) at 4 versus 37 °C is shown in the upper row of each panel (Fig. 2A). The corresponding immunofluorescence microscopy of the cells at 4 and 37 °C is illustrated below (control). Initially, none of the cells showed any granzyme B staining, neither on the cell surface nor in the cytoplasm. However, after a 15-min incubation period of the cells with purified granzyme B (grB) at 4 °C, a ring-shaped fluorescence, indicating a typical cell surface staining, was detected on Hsp70 membrane-positive CX+ and Colo+ tumor sublines (Fig. 2A, left panel). A temperature shift from 4 to 37 °C during the 30-min incubation period resulted in uptake of granzyme B, as determined by a cytoplasmic staining pattern in CX+ and Colo+ tumor sublines (Fig. 2A, right panel). In contrast, the Hsp70 membrane-negative counterparts CX– and Colo– neither exhibited any granzyme B cell surface binding at 4 °C nor uptake at 37 °C (data not shown). Flow cytometry analysis of permeabilized cells revealed a faint shift of the granzyme B peak to the right selectively in Hsp70 membrane-positive CX+ and Colo–, but not in CX– and Colo– tumor sublines, if the cells were co-incubated with 1 μg/ml granzyme B for 30 min at 37 °C (Fig. 2B, upper graph). A dose-dependent increase in granzyme B uptake, in Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells (CX+/Colo+), was detected after co-incubation with 2 and 4 μg/ml granzyme B (Fig. 2B, lower graph). However, even at the highest concentration of 4 μg/ml, granzyme B was internalized much more pronounced by Hsp70 membrane-positive as compared with Hsp70-negative tumor cells (CX–/Colo–). Potential ion channels formed by Hsp70 may play a role in the mechanism of selective granzyme B uptake in Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells. Indeed, a particular ion conductance pathway was observed after incorporation of vesicles derived from purified phospholipids of Hsp70 membrane-positive (CX+) tumor sublines. This was not seen in vesicles obtained from Hsp70 membrane-negative (CX–) tumor cells (data not shown). Based on these results one might speculate about an ion channel activity facilitating uptake of granzyme B selectively into Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells. In Vitro Provided Granzyme B Induces Apoptosis Selectively in Hsp70 Membrane-positive Tumor Cells—Differences in the inducibility of apoptosis were studied by co-incubation of Hsp70 high-(CX+/Colo+) and low-(CX–/Colo–) expressing carcinoma cells (21Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wiesnet M. Eissner G. Issels R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4341-4350PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 ng/ml enzymatically active granzyme B (22Shi L. Yang X. Froelich C. Greenberg A.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 125-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 4, 12, and 24 h. The topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml served as a positive control for apoptosis. Programmed cell death was determined by using three different apoptosis assays including annexin V-FITC, DAPI staining, and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. After a 4-h incubation period, neither camptothecin nor granzyme B initiated apoptosis in any of the tested tumor cells (data not shown), indicating that our tumor carcinoma cell lines are more resistant to apoptotic cell death, as compared with the acute T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat. After a 12- and 24-h incubation period with camptothecin significant apoptosis was observed in all tumor sublines (Fig. 3A). It appeared that the colon carcinoma sublines CX+/CX– are better protected toward a camptothecin-mediated cell death as compared with the pancreas carcinoma sublines Colo+/Colo–. However, no significant differences in the inducibility of apoptosis by using camptothecin was observed between Hsp70 membrane-positive and Hsp70 membrane-negative tumor cells. Interestingly, this was not the case if the tumor sublines were incubated with granzyme B at a concentration that is found in the serum under physiological conditions (10 ng/ml): 12 h post-treatment the amount of annexin V-FITC positive cells was equally up-regulated in Hsp70 membrane-positive CX+/Colo+ tumor cells (1.3-fold); after 24 h the increase in apoptotic cells was significant in Hsp70 membrane-positive CX+ (1.8-fold) and in Colo+ (2.4-fold) tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In line with these results the amount of Hsp70 membrane-positive leukemic K562 cells (25Multhoff G. Botzler C. Wiesnet M. Eissner G. Issels R. Blood. 1995; 86: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was similarly up-regulated (1.8-fold) following contact with granzyme B (data not shown). In contrast, the amount of apoptotic CX– and Colo– tumor cells with stably low Hsp70 membrane expression levels remained unaltered before and after a 12- and 24-h co-incubation period with granzyme B (Fig. 3A). To exclude apoptosis initiated by anoikes light microscopical analysis of untreated (control), camptothecin-(cam), and granzyme B (grB)-treated CX+/CX– and Colo+/Colo– tumor cells were performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, 24 h post-treatment with granzyme B, neither Hsp70 membrane-positive nor -negative tumor cell lines exhibited any signs of loss in plastic adherence. Regarding these findings we ruled out the possibility that anoikes might be a possible mechanism for the induction of apoptotic cell death in Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor sublines. It is important to note that all apoptosis assays were determined within the adherent cell population following a short term (<1 min) trypsinization. Consistent with the results derived by annexin V-FITC staining all cell types, CX+/CX-, Colo+/Colo–, exhibited a positive DAPI nuclear fragmentation staining, as a typical sign of apoptosis at a later stage, following treatment with camptothecin, as compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 3C). Again, DNA fragmentation was detected only in Hsp70 membrane-positive CX+ and Colo+ tumor cells, 24 h post-treatment with granzyme B (grB). In line with the annexin V-FITC staining results, no signs of DNA fragmentation were observed in Hsp70 membrane-negative CX– and Colo– cells (Fig. 3C). As an additional test for apoptotic cell death, cytochrome c release was measured following incubation of CX+ and CX– cells with granzyme B and camptothecin. As summarized in Table I, following incubation with granzyme B for 24 h, cytochrome c concentration was elevated 1.8-fold (0.382 mg/ml versus 0.690 mg/ml) in CX+ cells. However, no increase in cytoplasmic cytochrome c was observed in CX–"
https://openalex.org/W1994601869,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent, multifunctional, endothelial-cell-specific growth factor. It stimulates proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Characterization of intracellular signal transduction after VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) interaction has demonstrated the involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However, several studies indicated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) is another important pathway downstream of VEGF/VEGFR interaction. Therefore, we studied the role of STAT3 in the migration and tube formation of the human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). HDMEC expressed phosphorylated forms of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, and a marked increase of phosphorylated STAT3 in the nuclear fraction after addition of VEGF was observed by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. To verify the functional implication of STAT3 phosphorylation in HDMEC migration, we introduced a dominant-negative STAT3 using adenovirus vector system. Dominant-negative STAT3 abolished the VEGF-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT3 and inhibited HDMEC migration completely. Dominant-negative STAT3 also suppressed VEGF-induced HDMEC tube formation on Matrigel and on collagen gel. These data demonstrate that STAT3 and its phosphorylation are involved in the downstream pathway of VEGF/VEGFR interaction and regulate VEGF-induced HDMEC migration and tube formation."

ROS are generated during normal metabolic process in all of the oxygen-utilizing organisms. The copper-zinc-containing SOD (SOD1) acts as a major defense against ROS by detoxifying the superoxide anion. In model organisms, SOD1 has been shown to play a role in the aging process. However, the exact role of the SOD1 protein in the human aging process remains to be resolved. We show that SOD1 RNA interference (RNAi) induces senescence in normal human fibroblasts. This premature senescence depends on p53 induction. In contrast, in human fibroblastic cells with inactivated p53, the SOD1 RNAi is without effect. Surprisingly, in cancer cells (HeLa), the SOD1 RNAi induces cell death rather then senescence. Together, these findings support the notion that in normal human cells the SOD1 protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular lifespan by p53 and may also regulate the death signals in cancer cells.

It is estimated that around 1% of the total oxygen consumed in the mitochondria becomes the superoxide anion (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar). Damage induced by ROS includes DNA mutation, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation. ROS may contribute to the development of various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and premature aging (2Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar, 3Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5403) Google Scholar). The superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute a family of antioxidant enzymes that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anions to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (for recent review on SODs, see Ref. 4Noor R. Mittal S. Iqbal J. Med. Sci. Monit. 2002; 8: RA210-RA215PubMed Google Scholar). They include the manganese-containing SOD (SOD2) in the mitochondria (5Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the copper-zinc-containing SOD (SOD1) in the cytoplasm (5Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a small fraction in the mitochondria intermembrane space (6Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). >90 different mutations in the SOD1 gene have been found to associate with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that causes the degradation of motor neurons (7Rosen D.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The free radical theory of aging states that ROS generation during metabolism can cause damage to cellular constituents (8Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). During the life of a cell or an organism, SODs and catalase detoxify ROS. However this process is not perfect and ROS species can cause cumulative damage, which causes the physiological decline characteristic of aging (for review, see Ref. 9Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7298) Google Scholar). In yeast survival, the stationary phase appears to be limited by ROS because deletion of either SOD1 or SOD2 shortens survival time (10Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, overexpression of the human SOD1 extends the fly life span by 40% over controls (11Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). After a finite number of divisions, primary human cells in culture enter into a state of replicative senescence in which they are growth-arrested and resistant to mitogenic stimulation. Senescence is considered a mechanism to suppress tumorigenesis because it inhibits cell proliferation (12Campisi J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Oxidants appear to be important in the development of the senescent phenotype. Cells grown in low oxygen tension exhibit a prolonged life span (13Packer L. Fuehr K. Nature. 1977; 267: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), whereas cells grown in high oxygen concentration have a reduced life span (14von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The physiological response to oxidative damage appears to trigger growth arrest via activation of the p53 tumor suppressor, which up-regulates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (15Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 16Lundberg A.S. Hahn W.C. Gupta P. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). One of the features associated with cancer cells is acquisition of the potential to undergo an indefinite number of cell divisions. This feature commonly described as cellular immortalization requires the loss of molecular mechanisms that normally mediate the induction of replicative senescence (reviewed in Refs. 17Smith J.R. Aging (Milano). 1997; 9: 437-438PubMed Google Scholar and 18Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Replicative senescence can be substantially delayed by abrogation of endogenous p53 function through antisense or dominant-negative mutants (19Bond J.A. Blaydes J.P. Rowson J. Haughton M.F. Smith J.R. Wynford-Thomas D. Wyllie F.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2404-2409PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hara E. Tsurui H. Shinozaki A. Nakada S. Oda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is not surprising that the loss of p53, usually in combination with additional genetic alterations, promotes cellular immortalization (21Harvey D.M. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 22Metz T. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Rogan E.M.

To directly explore the role of the SOD1 protein in human cellular senescence, we have investigated the effect of SOD1 RNAi on the life span of normal human fibroblasts. We report that SOD1 RNAi induces senescence in WI38 cells. This premature senescence is associated with p53 induction. In human fibroblastic cells in which p53 is not active, the SOD1 RNAi fails to induce senescence. Surprisingly, in cancer cells the SOD1 RNAi induces cell death. Together, these findings support the notion that in normal human cells SOD1 plays a role in delaying p53 induction of cellular senescence and can also regulate death signals in cancer cells. Plasmids—RNAi plasmids were constructed using pSUPER as the backbone plasmid. pSUPER was obtained from Dr. R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). SOD1 RNAi was constructed by cloning the sequence 5′-GGCCTGCATGGATTCCATG-3′ into the pSUPER plasmid. This sequence was determined to be unique to the SOD1 gene by BLAST search of GenBank™ data base. pEGFP was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Cells and Transfections—WI38 and WI38-SV40 cells were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. WI38 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator containing CO2 (5% v/v) at 37 °C. HeLa and WI38 transfection were performed using jetPEI (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), respectively. WI38 cells were co-transfected with pSUPER-SOD1 RNAi and the pBABE-puro as a selection marker. After 24 h, the transfected cells were selected with the puromycin for the following 4 days. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in protein sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), vortexed, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min. Extract corresponding to equivalent cell numbers were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated for 20 min with a blocking solution (2.5% lowfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). Membranes were incubated with a p53-specific monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-SOD1 antibody FL-154 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and as a loading control anti-Actin C-4 (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:10,000). Chemiluminescent signal was generated by incubation with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—WI38 cells grown on coverslips were transfected and prepared for epifluorescence microscopy. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 10 min in 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were washed carefully and incubated for 60 min with a monoclonal antibody against p53 (DO-1) and then with a Alexa594-conjugated chicken anti-mouse secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted with VectaShield mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole, dilactate (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Epifluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon microscope. β-Galactosidase Staining—Cells on coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed for 5 min in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C (no CO2) with fresh senescence-associated β-galactosidase stain solution (sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1 mg of X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside)/ml 40 mm citric acid, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). Staining was detected by light microscopy following the overnight incubation. Death Analysis—HeLa cells (5 × 105/6-cm dish) and WI38 cells (1.2 × 105/3.5-cm dish) were transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFP with the indicated combinations of expression plasmids. Cultures were analyzed with fluorescent microscope, and transfected cells were identified by the presence of green fluorescence. Apoptotic cells were identified by their round morphology in contrast to the spread-out non-apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cells were counted, and their percentage from the total population of fluorescent cells was calculated. Because SOD activity decreases with age (24Casado A. de la Torre R. Lopez-Fernandez E. Carrascosa D. Venarucci D. Gac. Med. Mex. 1998; 134: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether levels of the protein decreased with increasing population doubling in WI38 cells. To this end, WI38 cells were subject to immunoblotting with an anti-SOD1 antibody. SOD1 protein levels did not vary between population doubling 33 and 49 (Fig. 4A). To determine the functional effect of SOD1 in cellular aging, we investigated the result of decreasing SOD1 levels within cells by RNAi. Three weeks after transfection, cells with the empty pSUPER vector (control) replicated normally (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the SOD1 RNAi-transfected cells no longer divided. In addition the SOD1 RNAi morphology was aberrant and cells had an increased cell area and flattened appearance (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the cells stayed flattened and did not divide for 100 days. This phenotype is identical to that observed during classical senescence (25Campisi J. Cell. 1996; 84: 497-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Goldstein S. Science. 1990; 249: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). We next addressed the possibility that the senescence-like phenotype of the SOD1 RNAi cells was because of mortality incurred during transfection and selection. WI38 cells were transfected with the SOD1 RNAi or the control vector together with an EGFP-expression plasmid. Transfection with either SOD1 RNAi or control plasmids did not result in detectable death during the first 2 days (Fig. 1F, days 1 and 2). Three days post-transfection, a minimal fraction of cells did exhibit death-associated morphological features. However, we could not find any significant difference between the SOD1 RNAi and the control plasmid-transfected cells (Fig. 1F, 3 days). Thus the senescence induced by SOD1 RNAi was not an immediate effect of transfection. To confirm that the flattened and enlarged cells are senescent, we checked the activity of acidic β-galactosidase in WI38 SOD1 RNAi cells. This marker is facilely expressed in senescence cells of many types (27Dimri G. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 26: 9363-9367Google Scholar). WI38 SOD1 RNAi cells exhibited significantly stronger activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase than the control cells (Fig. 2, A and B). A quantitative analysis indicated that almost 100% of the SOD1 RNAi cells were senescent, whereas in the control culture, only 20% of the cells reached senescence (Fig. 2C). Thus SOD1 RNAi induces premature senescence in human fibroblasts. We next investigated the molecular mechanism of the SOD1 RNAi-induced premature senescence. As mentioned above, a reduction in SOD1 levels is known to induce DNA damage and thereby activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein (for review see Ref. 28Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). To explore whether SOD1 RNAi induced senescence via p53, we investigated whether p53 could be responsible for the SOD1 RNAi-induced premature senescence of the WI38 cells. Cells were seeded on coverslips, transfected with the SOD1 RNAi and control plasmids, and selected with puromycin. After 3 weeks, the cells were fixed and stained with the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO1). In contrast to control cells, SOD1 RNAi-transfected cells displayed the p53 protein in the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and B) and at elevated expression levels (Fig. 3, B and D). Therefore, the premature senescence induced by SOD1 RNAi correlates with the induction of the p53 protein. To establish a causal link between p53 and SOD1 RNAi-triggered senescence, we employed WI38 cells that were transformed with the SV40 large T antigen. SV40 large T antigen interacts with and negatively regulates the p53 protein. WI38 SV40 cells were transfected with the SOD1 RNAi, and the cellular morphology was examined. After 14 days, the SOD1 RNAi did not induce senescence and cells appeared identical to those with the pSUPER control (Fig. 1, panels C and D). Western blot analysis verified that SOD1 RNAi reduced SOD1 protein levels in WI38 SV40 cells (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, the inhibition of p53 by SV40 abolished the induction of senescence by SOD1 RNAi in WI38 cells. It was of interest to compare the early senescence of primary fibroblast to a response to SOD1 RNAi in cancer cells. Accordingly, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with SOD1 RNAi or control plasmids along with the pBABE-puro plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4B, SOD1 RNAi dramatically decreased the steady-state levels of the SOD1 protein in transfected cells. Moreover, in SOD1 RNAi-transfected cells, p53 protein level was induced (Fig. 4C). The induction of p53 by SOD1 RNAi in HeLa cells was comparable to WI38 cells (Fig. 3). What Is the Biological Outcome of the p53 Induction by SOD1 RNAi in HeLa Cells?—Interestingly, we did not see any staining for β-galactosidase that would have been indicative of senescence in the transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). However, SOD1 RNAi transfection did result in 50% cell death (Fig. 5). In contrast, transfection with pSUPER resulted in little cell death (Fig. 5). Thus SOD1 RNAi appears to cause death in cancer cells (Fig. 5) but senescence in normal cells (Fig. 2). SOD1 activity is required for the efficient maintenance of cellular integrity as reflected by the number of human diseases associated with the SOD1 protein (4Noor R. Mittal S. Iqbal J. Med. Sci. Monit. 2002; 8: RA210-RA215PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that SOD1 RNAi induces premature senescence in normal human fibroblastic cells. This observation supports a role for the SOD1 protein in the life span determination of human cells. It is noteworthy that SOD1 regulates the life span of other organisms such as yeast and Drosophila (10Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol.

Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In humans, SOD activity decreases with age (24Casado A. de la Torre R. Lopez-Fernandez E. Carrascosa D. Venarucci D. Gac. Med. Mex. 1998; 134: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we did not find any evidence for the SOD1 protein reduction as cells approached senescence (Fig. 4A). This paradox may be resolved in several ways. First, during senescence, SOD1 activity may decrease even though the protein levels do not change. Second, the reduction of SOD activity may be because of a decrease in levels or activity of SOD2, not SOD1. Third, a change in SOD1 levels that occurs in human aging may not happen during cellular senescence. SOD activity is elevated in tumor tissues (29Afrasyap L. Guvenen G. Turkmen S. Cancer Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 16: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kong Q. Lillehei K.O. Med. Hypotheses. 1998; 51: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, SOD1 overexpression may play an important role as a defense mechanism in cancer. We found that SOD1 RNAi induces premature senescence in normal human fibroblasts while inducing death in cancer cells. The senescent induction observed in this study is p53-dependent. WI38 SOD1 RNAi-transfected cells displayed the p53 protein in the nucleus at elevated expression levels (Fig. 3). Moreover, inhibition of p53 by SV40 large T antigen abolished the induction of senescence by SOD1 RNAi in those cells (Fig. 1, C and D). In HeLa cells, the biological outcome was completely different. SOD1 RNAi induced cell death. Similarly to WI38 cells, the SOD1 RNAi caused an increase in the p53 protein levels in HeLa cells (Fig. 4C). Our findings may have implications for cancer therapy. When cancer cells are treated with chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic agents, the normal cells that surround the cancer tissue can also be affected. In the long term, mutations that occur in the surrounding tissue may cause secondary tumors. It is possible that treatment with SOD1 RNAi or other inhibitors of the enzyme will induce death in the cancer cells but at the same time trigger senescence in normal cells. The outcome might be the inhibition of secondary tumor formation. We thank Dr. R. Agami for the gift of the pSUPER plasmid. We also thank N. Chung for stimulating discussions and helpful advice."

Hdm2 protein levels are auto-regulated by the self-ubiquitination activity of Hdm2 and on the transcriptional level by p53-activated transcription of the hdm2 gene. Little is known about the regulation of Hdmx expression levels, apart from the observation that the Mdmx protein can be cleaved by caspase-3 in a p53-inducible manner. In the functional analysis of two mutant Hdmx proteins, products of two alternatively spliced mRNAs, it was found that Hdmx proteins are targets for ubiquitination by Mdm2. The stability of the Hdmx protein is partly dependent on the presence of its internal acidic domain. Mdm2 appears only to require an intact RING domain to be able to ubiquitinate Hdmx and target it for proteasomal degradation.

These findings highlight the intricate functional relationships between p53, Mdm2, and Hdmx. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a major role in maintaining the integrity of the genome. In response to various forms of cellular stress p53 is stabilized and activated, which leads to induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis, dependent on the type of cells and stress (1Lane D.P. Benchimol S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). With such a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes, the frequency of functional p53 inactivation in human cancer is expected to be higher than estimated from the p53 mutation alone (for review see Ref. 2Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). The major regulator of p53 activity is the Mdm2 protein (reviewed in Refs. 3Alarcon-Vargas D. Ronai Z. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 4Michael D. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).

The Mdm2-related protein Mdmx binds p53 with similar requirements as Mdm2 and can inhibit p53-induced transcription (9Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P.

However, transfection studies indicated that Mdmx could not ubiquitinate or degrade, but instead stabilized p53 and Mdm2 (11Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This activity requires an interaction between the RING finger domains of Mdmx and Mdm2 (15Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest that Mdmx and Mdm2 have opposite effects on p53 stability, it is very possible that under certain conditions Mdm2 and Mdmx cooperate in the inactivation of p53 (16Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The critical importance of both Mdmx and Mdm2 in the regulation of p53 is best illustrated by the observations that both mdm2-null and mdmx-null mice are embryonic lethal. In both cases, lethality can be rescued in a p53-null background (17Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 18Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G.

Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It has been generally accepted that the mdm2 gene functions as an oncogene, as shown by transformation experiments in cell culture and by analysis of human tumors (reviewed in Ref. 21Momand J. Wu H.H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). More recent data suggest that Hdmx might also perform a similar function. It was found that the hdmx gene is amplified in a subset of human gliomas without mutations in p53 or amplification of hdm2 (22Riemenschneider M.J. Buschges R. Wolter M. Reifenberger J. Bostrom J. Kraus J.A. Schlegel U. Reifenberger G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6091-6096PubMed Google Scholar, 23Riemenschneider M.J. Knobbe C.B. Reifenberger G. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found the levels of Hdmx protein to be increased in more than 30% of human tumor cell lines tested (24Ramos Y.F. Stad R. Attema J. Peltenburg L.T. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1839-1842PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of Hdmx in these tumor cells appeared to correlate with the presence of wild type p53. However, whether Hdmx actually contributes to transformation and tumor formation remains to be determined. Because both Hdmx and Mdm2 are important in regulation of p53 activity, Hdmx expression levels, like Mdm2 expression, might be strictly regulated. However, not much is known about the ways that Hdmx/Mdmx expression levels or activities are controlled. We found that after certain types of DNA damage the mdmx mRNA level was not increased (9Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Another report (25Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggests that Mdmx levels are constant during cell growth, differentiation, and after DNA damage. On the other hand, it has been shown that Mdmx protein can be cleaved by caspase-3 and that this cleavage can be stimulated by activation of wild type p53 (26Gentiletti F. Mancini F. D'Angelo M. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Jochemsen A.G. Moretti F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A completely different level of Hdmx regulation is the control of its subcellular localization. It has been shown that localization of Hdmx proteins is distinct between different cell lines, with most cell lines showing a predominantly cytoplasmic localization (16Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H.

Colombo E. Carbone R. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7318-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon co-expression of Mdm2 or p53, the majority of Hdmx protein is translocated into the nucleus (27Migliorini D. Danovi D. Colombo E. Carbone R. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7318-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, following DNA damage, a p53- and Mdm2-independent nuclear translocation has been described (28Li C. Chen L. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7562-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of two new splicing variants of Hdmx, which we have called Hdmx-A and Hdmx-G. Hdmx-A lacks exon 9 sequences encoding the acidic domain, whereas Hdmx-G lacks the p53-binding domain. These proteins were characterized for their ability to associate with and subsequently inhibit p53-induced transcription activation and for their ability to stabilize Mdm2. Surprisingly, the Hdmx-A protein could not significantly stabilize Mdm2 and was particularly susceptible to Mdm2-triggered degradation. Importantly, both full-length Hdmx, Hdmx-A, and Hdmx-G were found to be targets for Mdm2-induced ubiquitination and degradation. These data provide new insights into the delicate regulation of the balance between the Hdmx, Mdm2, and p53 proteins, which might have implications for the control of Hdmx protein level upon stress-induced activation of p53 and subsequent increase in Mdm2 levels. Antibodies—Anti-Mdm2 antibody was mouse monoclonal antibody 4B2 (29Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Anti-Hdmx antibody was the rabbit polyclonal serum p55 (24Ramos Y.F. Stad R. Attema J. Peltenburg L.T. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1839-1842PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1, the DO-1 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal FL393, and the 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-HA antibody H11 was obtained from Babco, and the mouse monoclonal anti-LacZ antibody D19–2F3-2 was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse-HRP, goat anti-rabbit-HRP, goat anti-mouse-Rhodamine, and goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cell Lines and Transfections—H1299 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. p53 – / –, p53 – / – /mdm2 – / –, p53 – / – /mdmx – / –, U2OS, and C33A cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cells were seeded 6–16 h before transfection in DMEM and transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (30van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were made in IPB 0.7 (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 0.7 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholic acid supplemented with protease inhibitors) and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (13Stad R.

Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized by autoradiography or with the use of a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from C33A cells with the Nonidet P-40 method (31Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and treated with DNase I (Promega). Single-stranded cDNA was made with reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from 3 μg of RNA using oligo(dT) as primer. Subsequently, PCR was carried out to detect Hdmx cDNAs. Primers at the 5′-end contained sequences from exon 2 (5′-GCAGTTTCTTCACTACC-3′; just upstream of the first ATG) or exon 3 (5′-TGCATGCAGCAGGTGCG-3′). For amplification from the 3′-end a primer in exon 8 was used (5′-CATTACTTCTAGGTGTAT-3′), and two different primers located in exon 11 (A, up to nucleotide 1172 within the coding sequence 5′-CCAATCCTTCCTCAAGGC-3′, or B, up to nucleotide 1894 within the 3′-untranslated region 5′-GGTTCACCTAACTATGTA-3′). The exon numbers are based upon the published genomic organization of the mdmx gene (32Parant J.M. Reinke V. Mims B. Lozano G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55 °C. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid Constructs—Full-length hdmx and the alternative splicing variants were cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pCDNA3.1Myc-His (Invitrogen). Sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) tag were cloned at the 5′-end of hdmx and hdmx-G by PCR (5′ primer, 5′-GATCAAGCTTACCATGGCTTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCGTCGAGGCCGGGATCCACATCATTTTCCACCTGCTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ACATCATTTTCCACCTCTGCTC-3′). PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and, after confirmation of correct sequence by DNA sequencing, subcloned into Hdmx-pcDNA3.1Myc-His via XbaI sites. HA-Hdmx-A pcDNA3.1Myc-His was made by exchanging XbaI fragments between HA-hdmx and hdmx-A. The caspase-3 cleavage mutants Hdmx(-A) D361A and Hdmx(-A) C362Stop were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange method (Stratagene). Mdm2 expression plasmids were Mdm2-X2 (33Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or pcDNA3.1 Mdm2, the latter made by recloning the EcoRI fragment containing the mdm2 cDNA from Mdm2-X2 into pcDNA3.1. Plasmid encoding the RING mutant Mdm2-(C464A) was a kind gift from D. Xirodimas (34Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding wild type human p53 (pC53-SN) has been described previously (35Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R.

The expression vectors for Hdm2, Hdm2ΔRING, Hdm2 S395A, and Hdm2 S395D were kind gifts of M. Oren. pCMV Hdm2 was constructed by B. Vogelstein and described with Hdm2 S395A and Hdm2 S395D (39Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Hdm2ΔRING is generated from the pCMV Hdm2 vector by deletion of a HincII-HincII fragment followed by religation, removing amino acids 442–491. pcDNA3.1 Mdm2Δacidic domain was generated by removing sequences encoding amino acids 202–303 using the Quick-Change method (Stratagene) and using pcDNA3.1 Mdm2 as a template. pcDNA3.1 Myc-Mdm2-RING, expressing the C-terminal 94 amino acids of Mdm2, was made by PCR amplification on wild type mouse mdm2 cDNA with the use of 5′ primers containing a BamHI endonuclease recognition sequence, a translation initiation site, and the 9E10 Myc epitope coding sequence and with 3′ primers containing a stop codon and an EcoRI endonuclease recognition sequence. PCR fragments were cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Expression vectors for Myc-Mdm2 and Myc-Mdm2Δp53 (lacking the N-terminal 111 amino acids of Mdm2) were the gift of J. C. Marine and were made by PCR amplification on wild type mouse mdm2 cDNA with the use of 5′ primers containing an EcoRI endonuclease recognition sequence, a translation initiation site, and the 9E10 Myc epitope coding sequence and with 3′ primers containing a stop codon and an EcoRI endonuclease recognition sequence. PCR fragments were cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To generate the mouse mdmx/mdm2 chimeric constructs pcDNA3.1 2X2 and pcDNA3.1 22X, endonuclease recognition sites were generated by QuickChange (Stratagene): SspI at position 106 (Mdm2) or 105 (Mdmx) and BsrGI at position 303 (Mdm2) or 304 (Mdmx). pcDNA3.1 2X2 consists of Mdm2 (aa 1–106)-Mdmx (aa 107–304)-Mdm2 (aa 304–489), pcDNA3.1 22X consists of Mdm2 (aa 1–303)-Mdmx (aa 305–489). The mdmx/mdm2 chimeras are described in more detail in Meulmeester et al. (40Meulmeester E. Frenk R. Stad R. de Graaf P. Marine J.C. Vousden K.H. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All plasmids produced by PCR were checked with sequencing and restriction fragment analysis. Luciferase Assays—Transfections were performed in triplicate into H1299 cells grown on 6-well plates and transfected with 1.5 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 60 ng of p53, 1.2 μg of effector plasmid (Mdm2 and Hdmx plasmids) and 1 μg of CMV-LacZ in 300 μl of calcium phosphate precipitate. Luciferase assay was performed with a commercial kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Luciferase values were corrected for β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were washed with PBS and subsequently lysed in Giordano buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 10% glycerol, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined with Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad). For direct Western blot analysis samples of 25 μg of total lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE. Anti-Hdmx immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 μg of total lysate using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco). Precipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence—H1299 and U2OS cells were seeded on cover-slips and transiently transfected as described in luciferase assays (H1299 cells) or with HA-Hdmx, HA-Hdmx-A, or HA-Hdmx-G expression vectors, either alone or in combination with plasmid encoding Hdm2 or the Hdm2ΔRING mutant (U2OS cells). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized by a 10-min incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Detection of expressed proteins was performed as described (13Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28039-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mdm2 was detected with mouse monoclonal 4B2, the HA-tagged Hdmx, and mutant Hdmx proteins with p55 or with monoclonal H11 (anti-HA). P53 was detected by rabbit polyclonal FL393. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. Cycloheximide Chase—H1299 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method. 24 h after transfection, culture medium was replaced by RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, and cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). Cells were lysed in IPB 0.7 at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h after addition of cycloheximide. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—Purification of His-tagged ubiquitinated conjugates was performed essentially as described previously (14Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). 40 h after transfection cells were either mock-treated or treated with 20 μm MG132 for 4 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and scraped in PBS. 20% of the cell suspension was lysed in IPB 0.7 and analyzed by Western blot. Lysis of the remaining 80% of the cells and the subsequent isolation of His-tagged (ubiquitinated) proteins was performed exactly as described previously (14Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Eluates were analyzed by Western blotting. Identification of Alternatively Spliced Hdmx mRNAs—In order to isolate alternative splicing variants of the hdmx gene in C33A cells, we performed RT-PCR. In this study, we characterized two of the splicing variants that still contained the RING, and which we called Hdmx-A and Hdmx-G. The hdmx-A mRNA lacks exon 9 encoded sequences, resulting in the inframe deletion of 50 amino acids (225–274) in the predicted Hdmx-A protein (Fig. 1). These amino acids fall within the “acidic region” of Hdmx. The hdmx-G mRNA lacks sequences from exons 3–5 and part of exon 6, resulting in an in-frame deletion of amino acids 27–124, encompassing the p53-binding domain (Fig. 1). Within exon 6 a cryptic splice acceptor site is present. As an indication of the accuracy of our method, we also isolated an hdmx mRNA lacking exon 6 sequences. This splicing variant is the human homologue of the mouse mdmx cDNA missing a stretch of 68 nucleotides described by Rallapalli et al. (41Rallapalli R. Strachan G. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8299-8308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Like in mdmx, the hdmx exon 6 contains 68 nucleotides, which means that skipping exon 6 results in a frameshift leading to translation termination after incorporation of 26 alternative amino acids. Confirming the results from Rallapalli et al. (41Rallapalli R. Strachan G. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8299-8308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that the exon 6 splicing variant very efficiently inhibited p53-induced transcription activation. To study the functions of the alternative proteins Hdmx-A and Hdmx-G, the parts of the cDNAs containing the alternative splicing were recloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vectors into a full hdmx background. To detect the different proteins with a similar affinity, the cDNAs were provided with sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) tag at their 5′-end. Hdmx-A, but Not Hdmx-G, Can Bind p53 and Inhibit p53-mediated Transcription (in a Promoter-dependent Fashion)— To investigate the ability of Hdmx-A and Hdmx-G to associate with p53, we transfected C33A cells, containing high levels of endogenous p53, with the different HA-tagged Hdmx constructs. Expression levels of the Hdmx proteins and p53 in the lysates are shown in the left panels of Fig. 2A. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-HA antibodies, and the ability to co-precipitate p53 was tested by Western blotting. As expected, p53 co-immunoprecipitated with Hdmx and with Hdmx-A, but not with Hdmx-G, which lacks the p53-binding domain (Fig. 2A, right bottom panel). Reprobing the same blot after stripping with anti-HA antibody showed a similar efficiency of immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged Hdmx proteins (Fig. 2A, right upper panel). The Mdmx/Hdmx protein has been reported to inhibit p53-mediated transcription activation (9Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P.

We determined whether alternative splicing of Hdmx would affect this function. To address this question, H1299 cells were co-transfected with Mdm2, the different Hdmx constructs, wild type p53 expression vector, and the bax-luciferase reporter. Luciferase activity was determined, and values were corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity. All luciferase transfections were performed at least twice in triplicate. Mdm2 co-expression reduces p53-induced transcription back to basal levels. Hdmx and Hdmx-A also significantly inhibit p53-induced transcription activation (Fig. 2B), whereas Hdmx-G partly inhibits p53-mediated transcription activation. Although possibly unexpected because the Hdmx-G protein lacks the N-terminal p53-binding domain, it fits with our earlier report (13Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28039-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) that the RING of Hdmx alone can partly inhibit the transcription activation by p53. This effect might be mediated through stabilization of endogenous Hdm2. Co-transfection of Hdmx, Hdmx-A, or Hdmx-G with Mdm2, p53, and bax-luciferase did not affect the Mdm2-mediated inhibition of transcription activation by p53, as reported before (13Stad R. Ramos Y.F.

It is important to note here that exogenous expressed Hdmx, Hdmx-A, and Hdmx-G proteins are mainly located in the nucleus of H1299 cells, both when expressed alone or together with p53 (Fig. 2C), in contrast to what is found in other cells, e.g. U2OS (16Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol.

Also, the observation that Hdmx can inhibit p53-activated transcription in H1299 cells fits with earlier reports (11Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 43Ghosh M. Huang K. Berberich S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2291-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to the effect on the bax promoter, we also studied the effect of the Hdmx proteins on p53-dependent transcription of the p21 promoter. Again, Mdm2 inhibited p53-mediated transcription activation back to basal levels (Fig. 2D). Co-expression of p53 with the Hdmx or Hdmx-A proteins, which significantly inhibited p53-mediated transcription activation of the bax-luc reporter, only partly inhibited the transcription activation of the p21-luc reporter (Fig. 2D). Similar experiments with the use of the mdm2-luc reporter showed results comparable with those obtained with the bax-luc reporter (results not shown). The observed promoter dependence is in agreement with our results (42Little N.A. Jochemsen A.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) obtained in Saos-2 cells. Because the Hdmx proteins hardly affected the activation of the p21-luc reporter by p53, we investigated whether in this case co-transfection of Hdmx proteins would affect the Mdm2-mediated inhibition of transcription from the p21 promoter. It was found that, as with the bax promoter, the Hdmx proteins could not prevent the strong inhibition of p53-mediated transcription by Md"

Tic110 is a major integral membrane component of active Tic complexes and has been proposed to function as a docking site for translocation-associated stromal factors and as a component of the protein-conducting channel. To investigate the various proposed functions of Tic110, we have investigated the structure, topology, and activities of a 97.5-kDa fragment of Arabidopsis Tic110 (atTic110) lacking only the amino-terminal transmembrane segments. The protein was expressed both in Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis as a stable, soluble protein with a high α-helical content. Binding studies demonstrate that a region of the atTic110-soluble domain selectively associates with chloroplast preproteins at the late stages of membrane translocation. These data support the hypothesis that the bulk of Tic110 extends into the chloroplast stroma and suggest that the domain forms a docking site for preproteins as they emerge from the Tic translocon."

Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). Subsequent changes in receptor substrates, including modulations of enzymatic activities and modifications of proteins and lipids, lead to the assembly of signaling networks that ultimately control cellular responses including cell proliferation, migration, or differentiation (2Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). Activated RTKs are also rapidly relocalized from the cell surface into the endosomal compartment, from where they can be recycled back to the plasma membrane or alternatively sorted to the lysosome for degradation. The processes of receptor internalization and endocytosis are regulated via a network of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, as well as protein post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination (3Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 4Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Several RTKs, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, are ubiquitinated and down-regulated upon interactions with the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases (5Joazeiro C.A. Hunter T.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) have indicated that attachment of a single ubiquitin, rather than polyubiquitin chains, to EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptors is sufficient for receptor endocytosis and that multiple monoubiquitination events ensure proper receptor sorting and subsequent degradation in the lysosome. Cbl can also promote receptor endocytosis via a pathway that is functionally separable from its ubiquitin ligase activity and is dependent on Cbl interactions with the adaptor protein CIN85 (11Petrelli A.

Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). CIN85, also known as Ruk and SETA, is a broadly expressed protein containing three SH3 domains, a proline-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain (13Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A.

Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The multidomain structure of CIN85 and its homologue CMS/CD2AP enables them to associate with various proteins including Cbl, Grb2, p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, CD2 receptors, SETA-binding protein 1 (SB-1), SLP-65/BLNK, Alg2-interacting protein 1 (AIP1), and p130Cas (16Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These interactions promote formation of CIN85-linked protein networks that are implicated in the control of RTK signaling, actin reorganization, T cell functions, kidney architecture, and apoptotic signals (16Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). CIN85 binds to Cbl via its SH3 domains, and their association is enhanced by growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (15Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S.

Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 12Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Based on these features, CIN85 can rapidly recruit endophilins to complexes with activated receptors, thus controlling receptor internalization (11Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 12Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Importantly, an analogous mechanism has been shown recently (19Lynch D.K. Winata S. Lyons R.J. Hughes W.E. Lehrbach G.M. Wasinger V. Corthals G. Cordwell S. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21805-21813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) for CMS/CD2AP. Interestingly, the CMS/CD2AP proline-rich region also interacts with cortactin in a ligand-dependent manner, recruiting it to the CD2AP· Cbl·EGFR complex. These data open an intriguing possibility that CIN85/CD2AP adaptor proteins link receptor endocytosis with cytoskeletal rearrangements (19Lynch D.K. Winata S. Lyons R.J. Hughes W.E. Lehrbach G.M.

CIN85 associates with two members of the Cbl family, Cbl and Cbl-b, but not Cbl-3, and this interaction depends on the presence of a minimal binding domain in their distal carboxyl-terminal tails (17Szymkiewicz I.

Surprisingly, binding of SH3 domains of CIN85 or CMS to Cbl/Cbl-b is not mediated via a PXXP motif (17Szymkiewicz I. Kowanetz K. Soubeyran P. Dinarina A. Lipkowitz S. Dikic I. J. Biol.

Williamson M.P. Sudol M. Faseb J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and bind to SH3 domains in either of two orientations, depending on the position of a positively charged residue in the peptide sequence (23Cesareni G. Panni S. Nardelli G. Castagnoli L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ligand binding surface of SH3 domains contains three shallow grooves defined by conserved aromatic residues. Two prolines in the PXXP motif occupy the hydrophobic pockets, whereas the third binding pocket associates with a positively charged residue flanking the PXXP motif (21Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several reports have indicated that unconventional proline-based sequences, which are distinct from PXXP motifs, can functionally interact with various SH3 domains (27Kami K. Takeya R.

Here we identified a novel atypical polyproline motif present in the distal tail of Cbl/Cbl-b, which serves as a high affinity binding site for the SH3 domains of CIN85/CMS adaptor molecules. We also show that CIN85, via its three SH3 domains, clusters Cbl molecules, which is a critical step for oligomerization of CIN85·Cbl·EGFR complexes leading to internalization and efficient degradation of activated EGF receptors. CIN85 can thus function as an RTK scaffold molecule, like G protein-coupled receptor specific β-arrestins, controlling receptor endocytosis and degradation.

The following tryptophan residues in pcDNA-FLAG-CIN85 were mutated to alanine: SH3-A*-W36A, SH3-B*-W135A, SH3-C*-W306A, SH3-AB*-W36A, W135A, SH3-BC*-W135A, W306A, and SH3-ABC*-W36A, W135A, W306A. The arginine residues were mutated to alanines in the following proteins: Cbl-R829A, Cbl-b-R911A, SLP-65-R248A,R313A, CIN85-R404A. Cbl-b-P906A, -P908A, and -P910A constructs have respective proline residues mutated to alanines. The constructs were verified by sequencing. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293T and CHO-EGFR cells were used as described previously (12Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 17Szymkiewicz I. Kowanetz K. Soubeyran P. Dinarina A. Lipkowitz S. Dikic I. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 12191-12196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 30 h after transfection the cells were starved for an additional 12 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for indicated times. Cells were lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Peptide Synthesis and Peptide Binding Assays—All peptides were synthesized following the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy using Fmoc amide resin resulting in carboxyl-terminally amidated peptides. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 column. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the correct molecular weight for each peptide. Each peptide had a single amino-terminal cysteine residue that was used for coupling to a SulfoLink resin (following the product instruction; Pierce). In peptide binding assays, 5 nmol of each SulfoLink-immobilized peptide was incubated with cell lysates for 2 h, and after washing three times in the lysis buffer the protein complex was resolved by SDS-PAGE. In peptide competition experiments, the lysates were incubated with increasing amounts of peptides 1 h before and during immunoprecipitation. Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—ITC experiments were conducted on a VP ITC (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) as described previously (32Renzoni D.A. Pugh D.J. Siligardi G. Das P. Morton C.J. Rossi C. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15646-15653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33O'Brien R. DeDecker B. Fleming K.G. Sigler P.B. Ladbury J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. The data were analyzed using the ORIGIN software supplied with the calorimeter. In a typical titration ∼1.5 ml of 25 μm SH3 domain was placed in the calorimeter cell, and 250 μm peptide was injected in 25 × 10-μl injections. The reported data for the stoichiometry and KD are based on at least two repetitions of the titrations. The actual measurement data for these experiments are available upon request. Ligand Internalization Assays—Ligand internalization assays were performed as described previously (12Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers of transfected CHO cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled EGF, washed twice with binding buffers, and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals. Cells were transferred on ice and washed with either cold phosphate-buffered saline or mild acidic buffer to remove surface-bound radiolabeled EGF. The remaining radioactivity in cells was quantified by a γ-counter following cell lysis. Each point was measured in quadruplicate and expressed as a percentage (average ± S.D.) of internalized versus total cell-associated radioactive EGF. The amounts of transfected proteins were monitored by Western blotting (data not shown). Biochemical Assays—Lysates with adjusted protein concentration (Bradford assay; Bio-Rad) were incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated following 1-h incubation with protein A-agarose beads. After washing in cold lysis buffer, the complexes were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For GST binding assays, GST fusion proteins were adsorbed on glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated with the lysates for 2 h at 4 °C, washed in the lysis buffer, and proceeded for Western blotting as above. In vitro translation was performed with the TNT transcription/translation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. EGF receptor degradation assays were performed as described previously (31Haglund K. Shimokawa N. Szymkiewicz I. Dikic I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12191-12196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T were transfected with EGFR, Cbl, FLAG-ubiquitin, and CIN85 or indicated CIN85 mutants, serum-starved, and stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for indicated times. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-EGFR (RK2) and anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 antibodies. The levels of EGFR were quantified for each time point from three independent experiments by using the NIH Image program (1.62) and expressed as the percentage of remaining EGFR for every time point as compared with unstimulated cells in the same experiment. Identification of the Consensus Binding Motif for the SH3 Domains of CIN85/CMS—To identify the binding site responsible for selective recognition of Cbl proteins by CIN85/CMS molecules, we synthesized all proline-rich peptides found in the distal tail of Cbl-b (Fig. 1A) and tested their binding to CIN85 (Fig. 1B). Peptide 893 bound strongly to CIN85, peptide 968 bound much less, and the other Cbl-b-derived polyproline peptides failed to interact with CIN85 (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the fact that peptide 893 is located in the minimal binding domain of Cbl-b (residues 891–927), which is critical for interactions with CIN85 (17Szymkiewicz I. Kowanetz K. Soubeyran P. Dinarina A. Lipkowitz S. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39666-39672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of increasing amounts of peptide 893, but not peptide 768, to the cell lysates, efficiently competed against co-precipitation between Cbl-b and CIN85 (Fig. 1C). The amino acid sequence of peptide 893 of Cbl-b (PARPPKPRPR) is similar to peptide 814 of Cbl (PERPPKPFPR) (Fig. 1A). Consistently, peptide 814 of Cbl also bound very potently to CIN85 in peptide binding assays and competed effectively against Cbl/CIN85 binding in co-precipitation assays (Fig. 1, B and D). Close inspection of these sequences revealed a double PXXP motif followed by a charged arginine residue. However, a similar double PXXP motif found in peptide 768 of Cbl-b (PLPPARP) was not involved in binding to CIN85 (Fig. 1, A and B). To identify amino acids critical for CIN85 recognition, we synthesized peptides with proline and arginine residues in the PXXPPXPXPR motif substituted to alanines (Fig. 2A). The peptide containing mutations of three prolines (3A peptide) involved in the formation of double PXXP motifs (A XX APX A XPR), bound as strongly as wild type 814 peptide, whereas mutation of two additional prolines in 5A peptide (A XX AA X A X AR) completely blocked binding to CIN85 (Fig. 2B, left panel). More detailed analysis indicated that mutation of proline 906 in Cbl-b peptide (PXXPA XPXPR) significantly reduced its ability to associate with CIN85, and the effect was even more prominent when proline 906 was mutated together with proline 910 in Cbl-b sequence (PXXPA XPX AR) but not when mutated together with proline 905 (PXX AA X-PXPR) (Fig. 2B, right panel). On the other hand, single mutation of arginine residue 829 in Cbl or arginine 911 in Cbl-b peptides (PXPPPXPXPA) completely abrogated their ability to bind to CIN85 or CMS (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the minimal recognition sequence for the SH3 domains of CIN85 may contain the PXXXPR motif. However, additional peptides containing the PXXXPR core sequence were found in Cbl-b, such as peptide 968 (PpvsPR) and peptide 500 (PpvpPR) (Fig. 2A). Peptide 968 bound much less efficiently to CIN85 as compared with peptide 893, and this low affinity binding was also dependent on the intact arginine 979, whereas peptide 500 did not bind to CIN85 (Fig. 2B, right panel). Peptide 968 may represent the low affinity binding site, associating only in in vitro binding assays, as in the context of the full size Cbl-b molecule, introduction of a stop codon at a residue 927, which preserves only the motif corresponding to the peptide 893 but not 968 of Cbl-b, did not affect the binding to CIN85 (17Szymkiewicz I.

Different mutants of peptide 814 from Cbl and peptide 893, 968, or 500 from Cbl-b are listed (A) and were used for pull down assays with lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with CIN85 (B) or CMS (C). After recovery of the bound material, detection was performed by immunoblotting with anti-CIN85 or anti-FLAG (CMS) antibodies. D, HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with CIN85 or CMS together with Cbl or Cbl-b or their mutants Cbl-R829A or Cbl-b-R911A. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Cbl or anti-Cbl-b antibodies and immunoblotting (IB) with anti-FLAG, anti-CIN85, or anti-Cbl/Cbl-b antibodies. TCL, total cell lysate. E, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with CIN85 and HA-Cbl-b or indicated Cbl-b proline mutants.

The consensus PXPXPR motifs are emphasized in bold, and amino acid positions of arginines in each motif in SLP-65 sequence are indicated. G, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with CIN85 and HA-SLP-65 or HA-SLP-65 arginine mutants (R248A, R313A, and R248,313A). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA or anti-CIN85 antibodies and immunoblotting (IB) with indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The difference between peptides 893 or 814 and these additional PXXXPR peptides was based on spacing between proline residues, PXPXPR found in peptide 893 as compared with PPXXPR or PPXPPR found in peptides 968 and 500, respectively. Thus, it seems that variations in X residues in PXXXPR motif might, in addition to the structural availability of the motif, define the strength of interactions with the SH3 domains of CIN85/CMS. Because peptide analysis indicated that the arginine in the PXXXPR motif is essential for binding to CIN85 and CMS, we further tested whether the same residue is necessary for interactions between CIN85/CMS and Cbl/Cbl-b in the context of full size molecules. Mutation of arginine 829 in Cbl or arginine 911 in Cbl-b abolished their co-precipitation with CIN85 or CMS (Fig. 2D). Mutations of proline residues within the high affinity PXXXPR motif of Cbl-b led to similar results as our peptide pull-down assays, with the first proline residue (Pro-906) being the most important for the association (Fig. 2E). Substituting the last proline (Pro-910) to alanine significantly affected the binding to CIN85, whereas the middle (Pro-908) could be exchanged for alanine without any effect on the interaction (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, several proteins shown previously to interact with the SH3 domains of CIN85 and CMS, including the CD2 receptor and AIP1, contained the conserved PXXXPR motif, whereas the SETA-binding protein 1 (SB1) and B cell linker adaptor protein SLP-65 had two conserved binding sites (Fig. 2F) (16Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of individual arginine residues in the corresponding motifs in SLP-65, as well as in SB1, reduced their association with CIN85, whereas mutation of both arginines completely blocked co-precipitation with CIN85 (Fig. 2G) (data not shown). Taken together, our data demonstrate that the PXXXPR motif found in numerous signaling proteins is"
https://openalex.org/W2069149537,"Rat liver epithelial cells were exposed to three quinones with different properties: menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, vitamin K3), an alkylating as well as redox-cycling quinone, the strongly alkylating p-benzoquinone (BQ), and the non-arylating redox-cycler, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ). All three quinones induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK 2 via the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MAPK/ERK kinases (MEK) 1/2. ERK activation resulted in phosphorylation at Ser-279 and Ser-282 of the gap junctional protein, connexin-43, known to result in the loss of gap junctional intercellular communication. Another EGFR-dependent pathway was stimulated, leading to the activation of the antiapoptotic kinase Akt via phosphoinositide 3-kinase. The activation of EGFR-dependent signaling by these quinones was by different mechanisms: (i) menadione, but not BQ or DMNQ, inhibited a protein-tyrosine phosphatase regulating the EGFR, as concluded from an EGFR dephosphorylation assay; (ii) although menadione-induced activation of ERK was unimpaired by pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine, activation by BQ and DMNQ was prevented; (iii) cellular glutathione (GSH) levels were strongly depleted by BQ. The mere depletion of GSH by application of diethyl maleate EGFR-dependently activated ERK and Akt, thus mimicking BQ effects. GSH levels were only moderately decreased by menadione and not affected by DMNQ. In summary, EGFR-dependent signaling was mediated by protein-tyrosine phosphatase inactivation (menadione), GSH depletion (BQ), and redox-cycling (DMNQ), funneling into the same signaling pathway.

Quinones are involved in a number of biochemical reactions (1Bolton J.L. Trush M.A. Penning T.M. Dryhurst G. Monks T.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 135-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), including redox reactions such as the transport of electrons by ubiquinol in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the carboxylation of blood coagulation factors involving the K vitamins, or redox cycling as a result of quinone reduction followed by reoxidation with molecular oxygen, concomitantly generating the superoxide anion (2Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 435-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 3Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Further, a variety of alkylation reactions are observed, including Michael-type additions of sulfhydryl groups to quinones (4Boatman R.J. English J.C. Perry L.G. Fiorica L.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or DNA alkylation (5Hargreaves R.H. Hartley J.A. Butler J. Front.

This biochemistry of quinones is exploited in cancer chemotherapy, such as with mitomycin c or certain anthraquinone derivatives including doxorubicin, yet the exact contributions of both redox and alkylation reactions to either the desired or adverse effects of these compounds are not fully elucidated.Cells respond to stimuli such as those imposed by xenobiotic quinones by activating stress-responsive signaling cascades regulating cellular proliferation and survival. These include pathways activated by DNA damage, such as p53-related events (6Wu R.C. Hohenstein A. Park J.M. Qiu X. Mueller S. Cadenas E. Schönthal A.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and general stress-responsive cascades, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; DMNQ, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone; PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEM, diethyl maleate; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Cx, connexins; GJC, gap junctional intercellular communication; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BQ, p-benzoquinone; MQ, menadione; IP, immunoprecipitation.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; DMNQ, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone; PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEM, diethyl maleate; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Cx, connexins; GJC, gap junctional intercellular communication; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BQ, p-benzoquinone; MQ, menadione; IP, immunoprecipitation. cascades, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cascade, and others (7Li X.A.

Gap junctions allow the diffusion of compounds of low molecular mass (up to about 1 kDa) between the cytoplasms of adjacent cells (9Vine A.L. Bertram J.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2002; 21: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a process known to be regulated by phosphorylation of the gap junctional proteins, the connexins (Cx) (10Warn-Cramer B.J.

Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). ERK activation resulted in phosphorylation of the gap junctional channel protein Cx43 and down-regulation of GJC (8Klotz L.O. Patak P. Ale-Agha N. Buchczyk D.P. Abdelmohsen K. Gerber P.A. von Montfort C. Sies H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of ERK was blocked by inhibitors of the direct upstream kinases of ERK 1/2, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1, and MEK 2 and by inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, leading to the hypothesis that ligand-independent activation of the EGFR by menadione was responsible for the above described effects (8Klotz L.O. Patak P. Ale-Agha N. Buchczyk D.P. Abdelmohsen K. Gerber P.A. von Montfort C. Sies H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar).We here demonstrate that quinones of different structures and reactivities all activate the same signaling pathway, resulting in Cx43 phosphorylation. Both a strongly alkylating quinone, p-benzoquinone (BQ), as well as an exclusive redoxcycler, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), cause an EGFR-dependent activation of ERK and the PI3K/Akt cascade, as does menadione, an alkylating and redox-cycling compound. Regarding the mechanism of activation, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) inhibition, glutathione depletion, and redox cycling are proposed to be responsible for the activation of the pathway by menadione, BQ, and DMNQ, respectively. It thus appears that different modes of action of the various quinones are similarly interpreted and integrated by the cell and funneled into the same signaling pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and intercellular communication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells (13Tsao M.S.

They were held in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with (final concentrations) 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (BioWest, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK) were grown under identical conditions. Quinones were from Sigma (menadione), Merck (BQ), and Calbiochem (DMNQ), and diethyl maleate (DEM) was from Sigma. Stocks of these compounds were in Me2SO and stored frozen in the dark. Cells grown to confluence in 7-cm2 dishes were exposed to quinones diluted in serum-free medium for the times indicated. In experiments with inhibitors of signaling cascades (U0126, compound 56, AG1478, wortmannin, LY294002, all from Alexis, Lausen, Switzerland, or Calbiochem) culture medium was removed, and cells were briefly washed with PBS prior to preincubation for 30 min with either Me2SO (control) or the respective inhibitor (diluted from stock solutions in Me2SO) diluted in serum-free medium. Inhibitors were also present in the medium during exposure to the respective quinone tested.Western Blotting, Dot Blotting, and Immunohistochemistry—Cells were grown to 90–100% confluence and exposed to the respective quinone or to diethyl maleate. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) followed by brief sonication. Samples were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels of 10% (w/v) acrylamide followed by electrophoresis and by Western blotting as described (15Mahns A. Melchheier I. Suschek C.V. Sies H. Klotz L.O. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For detection of phosphorylated (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and total ERK 1/2, phosphorylated (Ser-473) and total Akt rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) were used at the dilutions recommended by the supplier. All antibody incubations were in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST), except for incubations with anti-phosphotyrosine (see below). Detection of antibody binding to the membrane was with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and detection thereof with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce/Perbio). For immunodetection of connexin-43, dot blotting or immunohistochemistry were performed. Total Cx43 was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx43 antibodies from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) or from Sigma. For detection of Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser-279 and Ser-282, phospho-specific antibodies were employed: an anti-phospho-Cx43(Ser-279/Ser-282) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; sc-12900-R) was taken for immunohistochemistry studies, whereas SA226P (16Leykauf K. Durst M. Alonso A. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 311: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), an anti-phospho-Cx43(Ser-279/Ser-282) antibody that was a kind gift from Dr. Kerstin Leykauf and Dr. Angel Alonso from the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany, was taken for dot blotting analysis. For dot blotting, 2 μl of the lysates in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and air-dried. Immunodetection was as described above for Western blotting.For immunohistochemistry, WB-F344 cells were grown to confluence on coverslips in 3-cm-diameter plastic dishes, briefly washed in PBS, and kept in serum-free medium overnight before exposure to the respective agent or Me2SO (vehicle control). After treatment, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed with 5 ml/dish of methanol for 15 min at –20 °C. Fixed cells were then thoroughly washed with ice-cold PBS followed by blocking with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Invitrogen) in PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 90 min at room temperature. For detection of phosphorylated connexin-43, cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight under slight agitation with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-connexin-43 antibody (sc-12900-R) diluted 1:1,500 in PBS containing 1% (v/v) goat serum. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with an Alexa 488-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclear staining was performed after intense washing with PBS by addition of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.2 μg/ml final concentration) in PBS for 15 min followed again by intense washing and embedding. Images were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescent microscope coupled to a CCD camera (ORCA II, Hamamatsu, Japan).Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in 70-cm2 cell culture dishes. After treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of IP buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4,1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) per dish by incubating on ice for up to 30 min. Lysed cells were collected with a cell lifter and transferred to Eppendorf cups. Lysates were frozen at –80 °C, thawed, and centrifuged to pellet non-soluble fractions. The resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf cups, and protein was determined according to Bradford. 700 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated using 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and 50 μl of a 50% (w/v) slurry of protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology; preequilibrated in IP buffer) under end-over-end rotation at 4 °C overnight. The samples were centrifuged and washed twice with fresh IP buffer and once with IP wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 6.8; 1 mm EDTA). After addition of 40 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the washed protein A pellets, samples were boiled, and the proteins were resolved on 8% Tris-glycine gels followed by blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Detection of phosphorylated tyrosines was with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBST, briefly washed with TBST, and incubated with the primary antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST at 4 °C overnight. The secondary antibody was diluted in TBST. Human recombinant EGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was taken as positive control.Assay of EGF Receptor Dephosphorylation—The assay was essentially performed as described by Knebel et al. (17Knebel A. Böhmer F.D. Herrlich P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 255-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were grown to 80–100% confluency and serum-starved overnight. EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was stimulated by incubation in the presence of EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. The cells were washed with PBS, treated with the respective quinone (100 μm) or Me2SO (as vehicle control) for 15 min. The quinone was removed, and fresh serum-free medium containing the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor compound 56 (Calbiochem; 10 μm) was added to prevent any further autophosphorylation of the receptor. After 30 s, medium was quickly removed, and cells were lysed in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE on a gel of 8% (w/v) acrylamide and Western blotting with detection of phosphorylated tyrosine residues (4G10 monoclonal antibody, Upstate Biotechnology).Glutathione Determination—Total glutathione and glutathione disulfide were determined enzymatically according to Ref. 18Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Briefly, cells on 7-cm2 cell culture dishes were lysed by scraping them in 250 μl of ice-cold HCl (10 mm) followed by one freeze/thaw cycle, brief sonication on ice, and centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Aliquots of the supernatants were kept for protein determination according to Bradford. For glutathione determination, protein was precipitated from the supernatant with 5% (w/v; final concentration) 5-sulfosalicylic acid on ice. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Total glutathione (GSH plus GSSG) and, after blocking thiols with 2-vinylpyridine, GSSG were determined from the supernatant using 5,5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid in the presence of NADPH and glutathione reductase (18Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar).RESULTSActivation of ERK 1/2 and Connexin-43 Phosphorylation after Exposure to Quinones—Exposure of cells to menadione is known to result in the activation of ERK 1/2 and ERK-dependent phosphorylation of connexin-43 (Cx43), resulting in a decreased intercellular communication (8Klotz L.O. Patak P. Ale-Agha N. Buchczyk D.P. Abdelmohsen K. Gerber P.A. von Montfort C. Sies H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar). Two other quinones of different reactivities were tested for ERK activation and Cx43 phosphorylation: BQ, a strong alkylator, and DMNQ, an exclusive redox-cycler, were compared with menadione, which is known both to undergo redox cycling and to alkylate. Exposure of cells to any of the three quinones resulted in the strong dual phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 (Fig. 1A), which is mediated by MEK 1 and MEK 2, the kinases directly upstream of ERK 1/2, as U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK 1/2 activation, completely (BQ, DMNQ) or largely (menadione) blocked ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). When cells were exposed to any of the quinones for 15 min followed by aspiration of quinone-containing media and postincubation in serum-free medium, the activation of ERK 1/2 remained equally strong with slight decreases observable starting after 2 h of postincubation (data not shown).As was demonstrated for menadione (8Klotz L.O. Patak P. Ale-Agha N. Buchczyk D.P. Abdelmohsen K. Gerber P.A. von Montfort C. Sies H.

Phosphorylation of Cx43 at ERK 1/2 sites was demonstrated both by dot blotting (Fig. 2A) and by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2B) using two different polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies.Fig. 2Induction of connexin phosphorylation by quinones. WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells were exposed to Me2SO (vehicle control, C), MQ (50 μm), BQ (50 μm), or DMNQ (100 μm) for 30 min. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser-279 and Ser-282 was then analyzed by dot blotting (A) and immunohistochemistry (B). In A, loading control was by detection of total Cx43. In B, nuclei were stained with DAPI for orientation. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Quinoneinduced Signaling—Based on inhibitor studies, it was proposed that menadione-induced activation of ERK 1/2 is mediated by the activation of the EGFR (8Klotz L.O. Patak P. Ale-Agha N. Buchczyk D.P. Abdelmohsen K. Gerber P.A. von Montfort C. Sies H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, AG1478 and compound 56, two specific inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, largely blocked menadione-induced ERK activation. Another strategy used to demonstrate the dependence of ERK activation by menadione on EGFR was based upon the fact that permanent exposure of cells to high concentrations of growth factors may result in an enhanced internalization of the respective receptors (19Masui H. Castro L. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Exposure of WB-F344 cells to high concentrations of EGF (400 ng/ml) for 1 h followed by washing and 2 h of incubation with serum-free medium rendered cells refractory for further activation by EGF (100 ng/ml) or menadione (10, 25 μm), as seen in Fig. 3B. Taken together, menadione-induced ERK activation is dependent on EGFR stimulation. The activation of the EGFR upon exposure to menadione was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor molecules (Fig. 3C). Like menadione, BQ- and DMNQ-induced ERK activation relies on EGFR activation, as demonstrated using AG1478 and compound 56 (Fig. 4A), both of which abrogated ERK phosphorylation induced by exposure of cells to these quinones. If the EGFR is activated in cells exposed to menadione, BQ, or DMNQ, downstream signaling pathways other than the MEK/ERK pathway should also be stimulated. In fact, the PI3K/Akt cascade was activated in WB-F344 cells as serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt was strongly enhanced after treatment with menadione, BQ, or DMNQ and abrogated in the presence of either of two structurally unrelated inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 4B). Taken together, menadione, BQ, and DMNQ all activate the EGFR as well as downstream signaling pathways.Fig. 3Role of EGFR in menadione-induced ERK activation. In A, WB-F344 cells were exposed to menadione (50 μm) for 15 min with or without pre- and coincubation with inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (AG1478 and compound 56, c56;10 μm each) followed by analysis of ERK phosphorylation by Western blotting. Exposure to inhibitors alone (not shown) did not yield results different from control (–). Me2SO served as vehicle control for menadione and for the inhibitors. In B, cells were treated with EGF at 400 ng/ml (+) or control treated (–) for 1 h followed by washing and incubation in serum-free medium for 2 h. Cells were then exposed to menadione at the indicated concentrations or EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min followed by lysis and Western blotting. In C, cells were exposed to menadione at the concentrations given for 15 min followed by lysis and IP of the EGFR and determination of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting. Detection of EGFR in the precipitates served as control for successful IP and equal loading; EGF (100 ng/ml for 15 min) was used as positive control for tyrosine phosphorylation. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Quinone-induced activation of EGFR-dependent signaling. In A, WB-F344 cells were exposed to Me2SO (vehicle control, C), BQ (50 μm), or DMNQ (100 μm) for 30 min with or without pre- and coincubation with inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (AG1478 and compound 56, c56; 10 μm each) followed by analysis of ERK phosphorylation by Western blotting. Exposure to inhibitors alone (not shown) did not yield results different from control (–). Me2SO served as vehicle control both for menadione and for the inhibitors. In B, cells were exposed to MQ (50 μm), BQ, or DMNQ (100 μm each) in the absence or presence of inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, wortmannin (100 nm), and LY294002 (20 μm). Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was detected by Western blotting. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Inactivation in EGFR Activation by Quinones—One possible way of activating a receptor tyrosine kinase such as the EGFR in the absence of ligand would be to disrupt negative regulation of the receptor. It was demonstrated that the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by ultraviolet irradiation and reactive oxygen species relies on the inactivation of a PTPase regulating the respective receptor (22Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). To test for the involvement of a PTPase in the activation of the EGFR upon exposure to quinones, cells were treated with EGF followed by addition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, compound 56. HeLa cells were used for these experiments because they responded better to EGF treatment, yielding more intense tyrosine phosphorylation than WB-F344 cells, which is crucial for the assay. Stimulation of the cells with EGF resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 5A , lane 2), which disappeared after addition of compound 56 (Fig. 5A , lane 3). This can be explained only by the existence of a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates the activated receptor (Fig. 5B). In the presence of menadione, however, dephosphorylation was blocked, resulting both in an enhanced responsiveness of the cells to EGF (Fig. 5A , lane 4 versus lane 2) and in the maintenance of tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR even in the presence of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig. 5A , lane 5). On the contrary, neither BQ nor DMNQ had the same effect (Fig. 5A , lanes 7 and 9), pointing to mechanisms other than PTPase inactivation being responsible for EGFR activation by these quinones.Fig. 5Protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibition by quinones. In A, HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. The cells were washed with PBS, treated with 100 μm of MQ, BQ, or DMNQ or Me2SO (as vehicle control) for 15 min. The quinone was removed, and fresh serum-free medium containing the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor compound 56 (c56, 10 μm) was added to prevent any further autophosphorylation of the receptor. After 30 s, medium was quickly removed, and cells were lysed followed by Western blotting with detection of phosphorylated tyrosine residues and of total EGFR. B, schematic interpretation of A. MQ inhibits PTPase dephosphorylating the EGFR, resulting in a net phosphorylation of the receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the Role of Glutathione in Quinone-induced EGFR and ERK Activation—The results obtained from experiments on PTPase inhibition render it highly likely that menadione-induced EGFR activation is due to inactivation of a PTPase negatively regulating the receptor. Menadione both is an alkylator and undergoes redox cycling in the cell. Both the alkylation of a PTPase and its oxidation by reactive oxygen species generated upon redox cycling are feasible mechanisms of inactivating the enzyme. All PTPases known so far harbor an essential cysteine thiolate at their active site that is prone to oxidation (23Kolmodin K. Aqvist J.

It is now well established that NR-mediated transcriptional activation requires the recruitment of coregulator complexes, which facilitate recruitment of the basal transcription machinery through direct interactions with the basal transcription machinery and/or through chromatin remodeling. However, a number of recently described NR coactivators have been implicated in cross-talk with other nuclear processes including RNA splicing and DNA repair. T:G mismatch-specific thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is required for base excision repair of deaminated methylcytosine. Here we show that TDG is a coactivator for estrogen receptor α (ERα). We demonstrate that TDG interacts with ERα in vitro and in vivo and suggest a separate role for TDG to its established role in DNA repair. We show that this involves helix 12 of ERα. The region of interaction in TDG is mapped to a putative α-helical motif containing a motif distinct from but similar to the LXXLL motif that mediates interaction with NR. Together with recent reports linking TFIIH in regulating NR function, our findings provide new data to further support an important link between DNA repair proteins and nuclear receptor function.

The NR superfamily encompasses high affinity receptors for the steroid hormones, vitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid as well as so-called “orphan receptors” that bind with low affinity to dietary lipids such as fatty acids, oxysterols, bile acids, and xenobiotics and a large number of receptors with no known ligand (1Chawla A.

In the present study, we have investigated the role for TDG as a coactivator for ERα.We show that TDG interacts with many NR, representative of the major groupings within the superfamily, and that TDG associates with ERα in a ligand-dependent manner. This interaction is mediated by a motif in TDG, which is similar to the NR coactivator motif required for coactivator recruitment by NR. Moreover, we demonstrate that TDG potentiates transcription activation by ERα and show that it is recruited to the promoters of estrogen-regulated genes in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The expression vector pSG5 and constructs expressing human ERα and deletion mutants expressing N- or C-terminal portions of ERα (ΔAF2 and ΔAF1, respectively) have been described as having HA-tagged TDG and TDG-N140A (56Tora L.

Parker (60Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). ERE-2-TATA-CAT was kindly provided by B. Katzenellenbogen.GST Pull-down Assays—In vitro transcription/translations were performed using TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST proteins were induced, and lysates were prepared as described previously (24Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). For pull-down assays, GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads and retained as a 50% slurry in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, protease inhibitors). 100 μl of glutathione-agarose beads loaded with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins were then used directly in binding assays with 10 μl of radiolabeled polypeptides from in vitro translation by the addition of 890 μl of low salt buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% SDS, protease inhibitors). Following 1-h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed twice with low salt buffer and twice with high salt buffer (low salt buffer containing 1 m NaCl). Samples were boiled for 10 min in 80 μl of Laemmli buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and autoradiographed.Transfections, β-Galactosidase, and CAT Assays—COS-1 cells were seeded in 9-cm Petri dishes in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% dextran-coated charcoalstripped fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique, and β-galactosidase and CAT assays were performed as described previously (61Chen D. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Ali S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1002-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 17β-Estradiol (E2, 10 nm), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT, 100 nm), or ICI 182,780 (ICI, 100 nm) was added as appropriate.Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—COS-1 cells were plated in 9-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum 16–24 h prior to transfection with 4 μg of expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After an additional 48 h, the cells were treated with 10 nm E2 or vehicle (ethanol) for 2 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysates (2 mg) were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 2 μg of HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used as a control. The immunoprecipitates were washed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 5% v/v dithiothreitol, and immunoblotting was carried out using anti-HA peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) and anti-ERα (NovoCastra).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed following published methodology (62Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). E2 was added to a final concentration of 10 nm for 30 min prior to cell fixation and harvesting. Immunoprecipitations were performed using previously described antibodies against ERα (63Ali S. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.P. Chenard-Neu M.P. Rouyer N. Metzger D. Hybridoma. 1993; 12: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), SRC1 (64Belandia B. Orford R.L. Hurst H.C. Parker M.G.

Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). PCR for the progesterone receptor gene was performed using primers with the sequences 5′-AAAGGGGAGTCCAGTCGTCATG-3′ and 5′-TGCTGGTCCTGCGTCTTTTC-3′ and span sequences in the human progesterone receptor (PR) gene that contains sequences identical to the ERE named E3 in the rat PR gene (65Kraus W.L. Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 952-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). PCR for the PSA gene was performed using oligonucleotides in the human PSA gene. These primers have been described previously as primers G/H (66Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol.

Heery D.M. Lemoine Y. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) expressing wild-type ERα was transformed with VP16-fused mutants of TDG that have previously been described (68Um S.

Interactions were assessed by spotting transformed cells at various dilutions on medium lacking uracil and containing 0.1 nm.RESULTST:G Mismatch-specific Thymine DNA Glycosylase Stimulates ERα Activity in a Ligand-dependent Manner—In COS-1 cells, TDG stimulated ERα activity ∼3-fold in the presence of E2 and OHT but not in the absence of ligand or in the presence of ICI (Fig. 1B). TDG cotransfection with ERα lacking AF1 (ΔAF1) or AF2 (ΔAF2) (Fig. 1A) showed that deletion of either activation function prevented coactivation by TDG (Fig. 1C). Mutation of key residues in helix 12 inhibits recruitment of coactivators (60Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Substitution of the hydrophobic residues at amino acid positions 539 and/or 540 abolished ERα activity and prevented coactivation by TDG (Fig. 1D). Substitution of the charged residues at position 542 or 538/542/545 significantly reduced ERα activity and reduced coactivation by TDG in a proportional manner. Substitution of tyrosine 537 by serine has been shown to result in ligand-independent ERα activity and SRC1 recruitment (69Weis K.E. Ekena K. Thomas J.A. Lazennec G. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1388-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 70White R. Sjoberg M. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By contrast, TDG only stimulated its activity in the presence of E2. These data are indicative of a requirement for helix 12 sequences for ERα interaction with TDG but suggest mechanistic differences in the recruitment of coactivators such as SRC1 and TDG by ERα. Moreover, a mutation that abolishes the DNA glycosylase activity of TDG (N140A) (58Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33449-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) stimulated ERα activity in a similar manner to wild-type TDG, indicating that coactivation by TDG does not require the DNA glycosylase activity associated with TDG (see Fig. 3).Fig. 3Interaction of TDG with ERα is mediated by a motif similar to LXXLL. A, VP16 fused to regions of mouse TDG was coexpressed with ERα in the presence of 1 nm E2, and the yeast were scored for growth on medium lacking uracil. B, amino acid sequences of TDG from different species are aligned with the NR-interacting regions of N-CoR and SMRT. Also shown is the consensus sequence for the corepressor and coactivator binding motifs for NR (37Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M.

Positions of TDG residues 132/135/136 are shown by dots. C, pull-down assays were done following incubation of TDG or mutants with GST-AF2 with 100 nm E2. D, GST pull-down assays using 35S-labeled TDG in the presence of 1 μm (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24), 5 μm (lanes 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, and 25), 10 μm (lanes 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26), 20 μm (lanes 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27), or 40 μm (lane 28) of peptides corresponding to amino acids 115–146 of TDG. A peptide having wild-type TDG sequence or containing the substitutions shown were used in the competitions. P6, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 330–364 of human TDG was used as a control peptide. E, CAT assays were performed as described for Fig. 1. The top panels show immunoblotting of the lysates using antibodies for TDG and ERα. F, COS-1 cells were transfected with 17M-ERE-G-CAT and Gal4-LBD together with VP16, V16-TDG-(116–146), or a substitution mutant of TDG-(116–146). Transcription activation by Gal4-LBD together with pVP16-TDG-(116–146) in the presence of E2 was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TDG Interacts with ERα in a Ligand-dependent Manner in Vitro—In GST pull-down assays, ERα and ERα-ΔAF1 associated with TDG in a ligand-regulated manner. No interaction was evident for ERα-ΔAF2 (Fig. 2A). TDG interacted with AF2 in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2B). Some association was observed with OHT but not in the absence of ligand or in the presence of ICI. Helix 12 plays a crucial role in the ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators by the LBD and mutations in helix 12 inhibit or prevent coactivator binding (60Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the case of mouse ERα, substitution of the aspartic acid at positions 542 and 549 by asparagines together with the replacement of glutamic acid at position 546 by glutamine prevents SRC1 binding to AF2. TDG did not bind to this mutant (Fig. 2C). Substitution of the leucine 542 and 544 or the methionine 547 and leucine 548 by alanine prevented TDG interaction as has also been shown for SRC1. Interaction was unaffected by substitution of tyrosine 541 by phenylalanine as described for SRC1 (70White R. Sjoberg M. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that TDG interacts with ERα in a ligand-dependent manner and that this interaction requires the integrity of AF2. Note also that substitution of glutamic acid at position 546 by alanine, which has little adverse effect on SRC1 binding to AF2 in vitro, did not bind TDG, which is suggestive of difference as well as similarities in the way that TDG and SRC1 interact with AF2.Fig. 2In vitro interaction of TDG with ERα is mediated by the LB/AF2. A, Pull-down assays of 35S-labeled ERα, ERα-DAF1, or ERα-DAF2 were performed using GST-TDG. 100 nm E2 was present throughout the procedure. B, GST pull-down assays of TDG were done using GST-LBD/AF2 (mouse) in the absence of ligand or in the presence of 100 nm E2 (E), OHT (O), or ICI (I). C, pull-down assays were done using GST-AF2 or mutants in the presence of E2. The numbers refer to amino acid positions for mouse ERα. Aspartic acid at positions 542 and 549 were replaced by asparagines and glutamic acid at position 546 by glutamine in AF2-NQN"

Here we report the identification of a new fibrillar-like collagen chain that is related to the fibrillar α1(V), α1(XI), and α2(XI) collagen polypeptides and which is coexpressed with type I collagen in the developing bone and eye. The new collagen was designated the α1(XXIV) chain and consists of a long triple helical domain flanked by typical propeptide-like sequences. The carboxyl propeptide is classic, with 8 conserved cysteine residues. The amino-terminal peptide contains a thrombospodin-N-terminal-like (TSP) motif and a highly charged segment interspersed with several tyrosine residues, like the fibril diameter-regulating collagen chains α1(V) and α1(XI). However, a short imperfection in the triple helix makes α1(XXIV) unique from other chains of the vertebrate fibrillar collagen family. The triple helical interruption and additional select features in both terminal peptides are common to the fibrillar chains of invertebrate organisms.

FASEB J. 1991; 13: 2814-2823Crossref Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Among them, the fibril-forming (fibrillar) collagens represent the most abundant product synthesized by connective tissue cells and include the highly expressed types I–III and the quantitatively minor collagen types V and XI. Types I, III, and V are distributed widely in non-cartilaginous tissues, and types II and XI collagen are found almost exclusively in cartilage and the eye.

Fibrillar collagens display a common molecular structure that consists of a long collagenous domain made of ∼330 Gly-X-Y triplets flanked at both ends by non-collagenous propeptides. Extracellular removal of propeptides initiates the process of maturation facilitating trimer self-assembly into fibrils (for review, see Ref 16Bornstein P. Sage H. Ann. Rev.

It follows that the regulation of fibril diameter is an important determinant of connective tissue function. For instance, large diameter fibrils, spatially arranged in unidirectional bundles, are appropriate for the integrity of tendons. However, such structures would impair the tissue integrity of the cornea, where transparency is dependent upon having thin diameter fibrils arranged in orthogonal layers. One method of controlling fibril diameter is by assembling heterotypic fibrils, incorporating either type V or XI collagen into fibrils with types I or II collagen, respectively (17Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Blaschke U.K. Eikenberry E.F. Hulmes D.J. Galla H.J. Bruckner P. J. Biol.

Types V and XI collagen most likely serve as fibril diameter regulators because they retain a bulky amino-terminal portion attached to the triple helix after their final extracellular processing (17Birk D.E.

The retained N-peptide domain cannot be embedded in fibrils but instead, projects from the fibrillar surface inhibiting the lateral aggregation of additional molecules onto the fibril (20Linsenmayer T.F.

Here we report the identification of a novel fibrillar collagen chain, designated α1(XXIV), which contains an amino-terminal domain closely related to those of the types V and XI collagen subunits. We show that embryonic expression of the mouse gene (Col24a1) is confined to the developing eye and skeleton. We therefore propose that collagen XXIV may participate in regulating type I collagen fibrillogenesis at specific anatomical locations during fetal development. Interestingly, the α1(XXIV) chain also displays structural features unique to invertebrate fibrillar collagens. Identification and Full-length Cloning of α1(XXIV) Collagen cDNA—The strategy for isolating α1(XXIV) collagen is presented first, followed by descriptions of the methods employed. A BLAST search (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

(26Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) looking for amino acid sequence homology with the COOH-terminal third of the α1(V) collagen chain (Swiss-Prot accession number BAA14323) yielded one clone (GenBank accession number, AA331798) as a possible candidate for a novel human collagen cDNA. The clone, EST 35663, contained an insert about 2.4 kb in length. About 255 bp had been sequenced, encoding 85 amino acid residues with a perfect Gly-X-Y triplet structure. The EST was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and sequenced in its entirety using the method described below. The sequence revealed codons for an additional 33 amino acid residues of Gly-X-Y structure (i.e. 11 more triplets) and 235 amino acid residues of a non-collagenous (NC) domain. This was followed by a stop codon and ∼1.4 kb of 3′-untranslated region (UTR). From the sequence of the EST clone, nested primers were designed for 5′-RACE, using human placental Marathon ready cDNA (Clontech), as template, as described previously (27Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The method was adapted as follows. Because the collagen XXIV mRNA was rare in the pool of placental mRNA, a Long Expand PCR Kit (Roche Applied Science) was used for PCR with the following conditions: denaturation, 94 °C for 3 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C (–0.5 °C/cycle) for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min; 65 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min (+10 s/cycle); a final extension period at 68 °C of 8 min. The PCR samples from the first round were purified (PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 2% of the sample volume was used in the second round of PCR using the PCR protocol given above. These PCR products were purified from agarose gels using Gel Purification Kits (Qiagen) and either subcloned into pCRII or pCR2.1 vectors (Invitrogen) or used directly for sequencing. By performing RACE repeatedly with primer sequences derived from each previous RACE, overlapping segments representing the full-length ∼6.5 kb mRNA were obtained. To confirm the nucleotide sequence and control for PCR-induced nucleotide substitutions, gene-specific primers were used to reamplify the entire cDNA by RT-PCR from human hip (tissue composed of both bone and cartilage) mRNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using random primers; routine PCR was used to generate overlapping products that were sequenced directly or were subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The resulting composite hip cDNA corresponded exactly with the human placental α1(XXIV) collagen cDNA sequence. The human α1(XXIV) collagen cDNA sequence is deposited in GenBank under accession number AY244357. The human protein accession number is NP_690850. Mouse cDNA sequences were obtained from the GenBank data base by homology searches with the human sequence. All sequences in the data base were a mix of exon and intron structure, so that the coding regions were not immediately obvious. XM_149399 encodes the 5′-UTR and about 94 amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus. XM_143611 begins halfway into the minor triple helix and continues coding about 200 amino acid residues of the major triple helix. We closed the gap between XM_149399 and XM_143611 by amplifying a fragment of α1(XXIV) from mouse liver cDNA and cloning the piece into pCRII vector for sequence analysis. This mouse clone (GenBank accession number AY243578) overlaps XM_149399 by 27 codons and XM_143611 by 9 codons, and represents the bulk of the N-peptide, extending into the minor triple helix. It also contains an additional 20 amino acid residues after the TSP domain which are not found in the human cDNA. Additional clones identified from the data base included XM_143612 and XM_131211. The former encodes a fragment covering 420 residues of the triple helix, ending about 23 codons prior to the imperfection. XM_131211 corresponds to the 3′-end, beginning about 74 amino acid residues into the C-propeptide. It continues into the 3′-UTR for more than 1,000 nucleotides. All mouse cDNAs were compared with collagen XXVII sequences to ensure they represent murine α1(XXIV) collagen. Sequence Analysis—Nucleotide sequences were determined with a Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit and 33P-labeled dideoxy-NTPs (Amersham Biosciences) using either M13 forward or reverse primers if the cDNA fragment were cloned into vector. Alternatively, gene-specific primers, synthesized on an ABI oligonucleotide synthesizer, were used to sequence PCR products directly. A 1.5:1 ratio of inosine to guanosine was included in the sequencing mix. Sequence data were assembled and manipulated using Genetyx-Max 8.0 and Genestream-1 at www2.igh.cnrs.fr/(Software Development Co., Ltd.; EERI, France). The signal peptide cleavage site, between residues 38 and 39, was predicted by visual inspection, using the rules of von Heijne (28von Heijne G. J. Membr.

Other corneas were dissected from whole eyes obtained from this same eye bank. Mouse corneas, as well as skin, were dissected from C57 mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). A segment of human hip was a gift from Maria Nurminskaia (Tufts University School of Medicine). Human retina was obtained from William Brunken (Tufts University School of Medicine) and from whole eyes from the Lions Eye Bank of Oregon. Mouse retina, as well as bone and tendon, were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). All tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation. For PCR, RNA was isolated from each tissue with Trizol™ (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Then Qiagen RNeasy Kit columns were used for on-column DNase digestion, following appendix D instructions within the RNeasy Mini handbook. Total RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. 200 ng of RNA was converted to first strand cDNA in a 20-μl volume and treated with RNase H as described previously (2Koch M Foley J.E. Hahn R.

Taq polymerase was from Invitrogen., 10× PCR buffer from PE Applied Biosystems, and dNTPs were from Roche Applied Science. A PerkinElmer 9600 was used with the following program: a preliminary cycle of 94 °C for 30 s, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, and a final elongation cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The identity of all PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. Relative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Relative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (30Morio L.A. Chiu H. Sprowles K.A. Zhou P.

For collagen XXIV, a 315-bp product was amplified with sense primer CCAGGACCACATGGAAATCC and antisense primer AGAACCGATGAAACCTCGGAC. For a 340-bp mα 2(I) collagen product, the forward primer was CAGAGTGGAACAGCGATTACT, and the reverse was GCCCGTCTCCTCATCCAGGTACG. To make a 349-bp collagen III cDNA product, the forward and reverse primers were GATG(C/T)(A/T)(C/G)CCA(C/T)CTTGGTCAGTCCTATG and CAGT(A/T)GG(AG)CATGATTCACAGATTC, respectively. For α1(V) collagen, the primer pair to make a 294-bp product was CACA(A/G)CTACGTGGA(C/T)TA(C/T)GC and GGGCCAAGAAGTGATTCTGG. A ratio of 1:20 for the 18 S primer:Competimer™ (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) was found to produce an amplification signal comparable with the collagen XXIV signal in 27 cycles of PCR. Products were loaded onto 5% denaturing acrylamide gels. Radioactive bands were excised from the dried gel and counted, and collagen cDNA products were normalized to the attenuated 18 S signal. All samples were run at the same time and loaded on the same gel to minimize variability. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridizations were carried out using 35S-labeled riboprobes on tissue sections of staged mouse embryos (32Ohnishi S. Laub F. Matsumoto N. Asaka M. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), as described previously (33Laub F. Aldabe R. Friedrich Jr., V. Ohnishi S. Yoshida T. Ramirez F. Dev.

A ∼1,000-bp fragment of the 3′-UTR of the mouse α1(XXIV) collagen cDNA was made by designing primers (nucleotides 521–553 for the sense strand and the reverse complement of 1508–1527 for the antisense strand) from XM_131211. The template used for PCR was C57 mouse genomic DNA. This fragment was cloned into pCR2.1. The insert was excised with restriction enzymes and ligated into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to employ the T3 and T7 promoters for riboprobe generation. The accuracy of the insert was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Selective linearization of the plasmid allowed for generation of sense and antisense riboprobes using T3 and T7 polymerases. Embryos and tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 8 μm. Deparaffinized sections were proteinase K-treated and incubated with 35S-UTP-labeled riboprobes. Slides were dipped in emulsion and exposed at 4 °C for 5–8 days and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin for brightfield views. Darkfield photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axioscope or Nikon dissecting microscope and a digital camera system. Positive hybridization signal was verified in several ways. One was multiple hybridizations on the same tissue from different dissections. Another was sense strand control hybridization. A third method, performed on all sections, was to compare the sections by brightfield and darkfield: the silver grains are easily seen in brightfield, and their presence confirms positive hybridization signals observed in darkfield photos. This method was particularly useful for detecting nonspecific binding that occurs at external surfaces and the false positive signals because of blood cells (i.e. erythrocyte scatter). For post-processing of the data, Photoshop™ 7.0 imaging software (Adobe) was used. Bioinformatics—The human and mouse α1(XXIV) collagen cDNA sequences (GenBank accession numbers AY244357 and AY243578, respectively) were compared with genomic sequences in the NCBI GenBank genome data bases, in an effort to confirm the sequence and to define and compare the exon/intron borders (not shown).

The human α1(XXIV) collagen protein sequence is deposited in GenBank under accession number NP_690850. Identification of Collagen XXIV cDNA—A search of the GenBank dbESTs for collagen domain homologies identified three cDNAs, each encoding a potentially unique collagen. These EST clones were purchased and sequenced. Full-length copies of each mRNA were obtained by 3′- and 5′-RACE using a commercial human library as a template. Once it became clear from sequence analysis that the cDNAs did, indeed, represent novel collagens, they were designated as the α1 chains for the next available numbers in the collagen family, i.e. types XXII, XXIII, and XXIV.

The hypervariable C-terminal domain of these GTPases has been implicated in membrane association and effector binding. We found that cell-permeable peptides, encoding the C termini of Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, and Cdc42, interfere with GTPase signaling in a specific fashion in a variety of cellular models. Pull-down assays showed that the C terminus of Rac1 does not associate to either RhoGDI or to Pak. In contrast, the C terminus of Rac1 (but not Rac2 or Cdc42) binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphate kinase (PIP5K) via amino acids 185-187 (RKR). Moreover, Rac1 associates to the adapter protein Crk via the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Crk and the proline-rich stretch in the Rac1 C terminus. These differential interactions mediate Rac1 localization, as well as Rac1 signaling, toward membrane ruffling, cell-cell adhesion, and migration. These data show that the C-terminal, hypervariable domain of Rac1 encodes two distinct binding motifs for signaling proteins and regulates intracellular targeting and differential signaling in a unique and non-redundant fashion.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To relay their signals, Rho-like GTPases interact with a wide range of effector proteins. These interactions are generally thought to occur at the plasma membrane to which GTPases are translocated prior to activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. This membrane association is dependent on lipid modifications of specific cysteine residues in the extreme C terminus (i.e. prenylation), as well as on the C-terminal polybasic region (5Tao W. Filippi M.D. Bailey J.R. Atkinson S.J. Connors B. Evan A. Williams D.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho-like GTPases share a high level of homology, despite the fact that their effects on cellular morphology or function can be very distinct. This has been attributed to sequence diversity in the effector domain (residues 26-45) and the so-called insert region (amino acids 124-135). However, the most divergent region between otherwise very homologous GTPases (e.g. Rac 1066 CX, and Rac2) is the C-terminal polybasic region. This domain was shown to be required for activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase (6Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and was claimed for Rac1 to drive activation of PAK 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; CRIB, Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding; PTD, protein transduction domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MDCKII, Madin-Darby canine kidney II; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIP5K, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphate kinase; SH, Src homology; CTX, cholera toxin; WT, wild type; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor. by some (7Knaus U.G.

Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most of the studies that have addressed the role of this domain relied on deletion or mutation strategies, testing the role of this region in the context of, for instance, a constitutively active variant of the GTPase. Tao et al. (5Tao W. Filippi M.D. Bailey J.R. Atkinson S.J. Connors B. Evan A. Williams D.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed recently that deleting the C-terminal polybasic region affects the efficiency of prenylation of Rac2. Moreover, del Pozo et al. (8del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) have shown that mutation of the crucial cysteine residue to prevent Rac prenylation blocked activation of PAK. This means that mutating or deleting the C-terminal domain may affect downstream signaling in an indirect manner, complicating the interpretation of this type of analysis. In an extensive study using GFP-tagged versions of a range of Rho-like GTPases, Michaelson et al. (9Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) showed the differential intracellular localization of various Rho-like GTPases to the plasma membrane, the Golgi, etc. These authors suggested that the hypervariable domain determines to which membrane compartment the GTPases are targeted, although the mechanism of this targeting was not identified. To study the role of the hypervariable C-terminal domain in the targeting and signaling specificity of Rho-like GTPases, in particular of Rac1, we hypothesized that this region may act as a selective, targeted inhibitor when brought into living cells. To test this hypothesis, we fused the C-terminal domains of Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, and Cdc42, excluding the CAAX region, to the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein (10Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 11Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar) and tested modulation of signaling by these GTPases in a variety of assays in adherent and non-adherent cells. The results show that the C-terminal domain of Rho-like GTPases is differentially targeted to intracellular sites and specifically interferes with GTPase function because of differential associations with effector, as well as adapter, proteins. Cell Culture—The HL60, KG1a, NIH3T3, MDCKII, and COS7 cell lines were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (BioWhittaker) containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C/5% CO2. Adherent cells were passaged by trypsinization. Immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured as described (12van Wetering S. van Buul J.D. Quik S. Mul F.P. Anthony E.C. ten Klooster J.P. Collard J.G. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides, Loading, Quantification, and Localization—For this study, we made use of synthetic peptides (peptide synthesis was performed on a Syro II, using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry) encoding the C-terminal domain of Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, and Cdc42, excluding the CAAX box, fused to a protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus, from here on denoted as TAT (see Fig. 1A). HL60 or trypsinized MDCKII cells in a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with 200-1,000 μg/ml biotinylated TAT-Rac1, TAT-Rac2, or TAT-Cdc42 C-terminal peptides for various times. At the indicated time points, 100 μl of the cell suspension was transferred to 100 μl of fixation solution (Intraprep Permeabilization Reagent; Coulter Immunotech). After 15 min at room temperature, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% BSA (Sigma), resuspended in 100 μl of permeabilization solution (Intraprep Permeabilization Reagent; Coulter Immunotech), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently exposed to Streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100; Immunopure; Pierce) or Streptavidin-Alexa 488 (1:100; Molecular Probes) on ice and in the dark during 45 min, washed, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell scan (BD Biosciences). For the peptide localization experiments in MDCKII cells, the cells were grown and stained with Streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate on fibronectin-coated glass slides. F-actin in MDCKII cells was made visible by Texas Red Phalloidin (1:500; Molecular Probes). Phase contrast and fluorescent confocal images and movies were recorded with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Determination of the C-terminal Peptide Specificity—The specificity of the TAT-RhoA and the TAT-Rac1 C-terminal peptides was determined in three separate, established models. In the first model, serum-starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts were exposed to the 400 μg/ml of the various TAT C-terminal peptides during 30 min at 37 °C before adding 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. In the control situation, cells respond to fetal calf serum with RhoA-mediated contraction. In the second model, GFP-Rac1-expressing HUVEC were exposed to 1 mg/ml of the C-terminal peptides, and the effect on the spontaneous, Rac1-mediated membrane ruffling, cell spreading, and contractility was determined. The third model comprised GFP-Rac1 transduced MDCKII cells exposed to 10 ng/ml HGF during 30 min, which induces Rac1-mediated membrane ruffling. Subsequently, the various C-terminal peptides in a concentration of 1 mg/ml were added to the cells, and the effect on the stimulus-induced ruffling, cell spreading, and contractility was assessed. In all models, the effect of the C-terminal peptides was recorded using time-lapse fluorescence or phase contrast microscopy. Cell Migration and Actin Polymerization Assays—Transmigration assays (13Voermans C. Gerritsen W.R. von dem Borne A.E. van der Schoot C.E. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1806-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were performed in 6.5-mm, 5-μm pore Transwell plates, coated overnight with 20 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) at 4 °C. The cells used were pre-treated with 200 μg/ml of the indicated TAT C-terminal peptides (TAT sequence YGRKKRRQRRR) for 30 min and washed with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/0.25% BSA. KG1a cells were exposed to the peptides during the 30-min pre-treatment and during the migration assay. Pretreated, freshly isolated CD34+ cells from cord blood or mobilized peripheral blood (13Voermans C. Gerritsen W.R. von dem Borne A.E. van der Schoot C.E. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1806-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), B-CLL blasts, HL60, or KG1a cells (100.000 cells/Transwell) were added to the upper compartment and were allowed to migrate toward 100 ng/ml SDF-1 (HL60) or to medium (KG1a), present in the lower compartment, for 4 h. Actin polymerization assays were performed as described previously (14Voermans C. Anthony E.C. Mul E. van der Schoot E. Hordijk P. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1456-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a 30-min pre-treatment with 200 μg/ml of the C-terminal peptides, HL60 cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml SDF-1. At the indicated time points 100 μl of the cells was transferred to 100 μl of fixation solution (Intraprep Permeabilization Reagent) for at least 15 min. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% BSA and resuspended in 100 μl of permeabilization reagent (Intraprep Permeabilization Reagent). After 5 min 1 unit/ml Alexa 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was added to visualize the F-actin. After 20 min the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% BSA. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured by fluorescence-activated cell scan (BD Biosciences) and used as a measure for the amount of polymerized actin. The -fold increase actin polymerization was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity generated at a particular time point by the mean fluorescence intensity at t = 0 of that particular condition. Pull-down Assays—To assay the activity of Rac1 and RhoA in MDCKII cells (5 × 106 cells) following incubation with the different C-terminal peptides (15 min, 200 μg/ml), pull-down assays were performed with GST-PAK-CRIB and GST-Rhotekin, respectively. Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with one of the GST fusion proteins and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h while rotating. After incubation, samples were washed five times in Lysis Buffer A and resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. Rac1 or RhoA binding was determined by Western blot analysis as described (15Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). To determine the association of signaling proteins with the different C-terminal peptides, 5 × 106 MDCKII or Cos7 cells were seeded 1 day prior to the assay. Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS), centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 μg of one of the C-terminal peptides and with Streptavidin-coated beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h while rotating. In these experiments, equal amounts of the different peptides were added to cellular lysates to exclude that differences in peptide loading of cells would cause variations in the detection of peptide-protein complexes. Samples were then washed in Lysis Buffer A five times and either resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer or used for the PIP5K activity assay (16Divecha N. Roefs M. Los A. Halstead J. Bannister A. D'Santos C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 582-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Crk binding to the various peptides was determined by pull-down assays as described above followed by Western blot analysis. For analysis of binding of the C terminus of Rac1 to the different v-Crk mutants, the v-Crk, v-Crk Δ SH2, and v-Crk Δ SH3 proteins were expressed in Cos7 cells, prior to the pull-down assays. Lipid Raft Visualization—Lipid rafts in HL60 cells were stained with cholera toxin subunit B (CTX; 10 μg/ml final concentration, 15 min, 37 °C; Molecular Probes) after a 5-min incubation with TAT-Rac1 WT, TAT-Rac1 PPP, and TAT-Rac1 RKR (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C. Statistical Analysis—Significance of differences was determined with a two-sided Student's t test. Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Differential Loading of the Cell-permeable C Termini—To determine the kinetics and levels of cell loading for the various C-terminal peptides used in this study (Fig. 1A), HL60 leukemic (Fig. 1, B and C) and MDCKII epithelial cells (not shown) were transduced with biotinylated versions of the peptides. Already within 1 min, 100% of the exposed cells were positive for the transduced peptide (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, although the percentage of positive cells was similar for all peptides used, the relative level of cell loading differed. The Rac1 and Rac2 C termini accumulated to higher amounts, compared with the Cdc42 peptide, even though cells were exposed to equal concentrations of peptide (Fig. 1C). The RhoA C terminus was transduced as efficiently as Rac1 (not shown). Peptide loading remained detectable for 2-4 h, after which the levels of fluorescence declined, possibly because of proteolytic breakdown. Detection of peptide loading required cell permeabilization, indicating that the peptides were present inside the cell, rather than associated with the cell surface. These data suggest that these C-terminal peptides are transduced rapidly into adherent, as well as non-adherent, cells and are selectively sequestered, indicating that the C-terminal domains of Rho-like GTPases differentially associate to intracellular proteins. Rho-GTPase C Termini Mediate Selective Inhibition of Cell Contraction, Membrane Ruffling, and Cell Polarization—We next tested whether the C-terminal peptides could be used to dissect intracellular GTPase signaling. RhoA-mediated, serum-induced contraction of NIH3T3 fibroblasts was selectively blocked by the TAT-RhoA C-terminal peptide (TAT-RhoA) but not by the PTD or the TAT-Rac1 peptide (Fig. 2A, movie 1, a-c). TAT-Cdc42 also did not inhibit serum-induced contraction (data not shown). Conversely, in GFP-Rac1-expressing HUVEC, the TAT-Rac1 peptide induced a rapid loss of spontaneous membrane ruffling and a concomitant loss of GFP-Rac1 localization, whereas cell spreading and contractility were not impaired (Fig. 2B, movie 2). To further confirm the specificity of the effects of these C-terminal peptides, GFP-Rac1-expressing MDCKII cells were exposed to the various peptides following treatment with HGF (17Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), which induced formation of prominent lamellae and peripheral membrane ruffles, brightly positive for GFP-Rac1 (Fig. 2C). The TAT-Rac1 or a TAT-Rac1 17-32 peptide (a Rac-inhibiting peptide (18Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S. Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) blocked membrane ruffling within 1-3 min and induced a diffuse GFP-Rac1 distribution (Fig. 2C, movie 3). Cell spreading was unaffected, but membrane ruffling and GFP-Rac1 localization to these ruffles was blocked. Apparently, both the effector loop and as the C terminus of Rac1 are required, in a non-redundant fashion, for growth factor-induced membrane ruffling and proper Rac1 localization. The levels of GFP-Rac1 at cell-cell junctions remained unaffected (data not shown). In contrast to the Rac1, the RhoA, Rac2, and Cdc42 C-terminal peptides did not affect either HGF-induced ruffling or GFP-Rac1 localization, further underscoring the specificity of the effects exerted by these C termini. Rho-like GTPases, in particular Rac1 and Cdc42, control polarization of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells (4Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 19Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, transduction of MDCKII cells with both TAT-Rac1 and TAT-Cdc42 peptides reduced cell polarity and induced cell spreading (Fig. 2D). In addition, increased stress fiber formation in the lower region of the TAT-Rac1 transduced cells was observed, in line with the antagonism between Rac1 and RhoA in epithelial cells (15Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 20Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The TAT-RhoA peptide induced increased cell spreading but had no major effects on cell polarization. The TAT-Rac2 C-terminal peptide did not affect either MDCKII cell-cell adhesion or spreading (data not shown). The Rac1 C-terminal Domain Inhibits Actin Polymerization and Cell Migration—The above results show that the C-terminal peptides act as selective inhibitors of GTPase signaling. This allowed us to use these peptides to assess the contribution of different Rho-like GTPases to chemokine-induced actin polymerization and directional migration of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. SDF-1-induced actin polymerization and cellular motility in HL60 cells (14Voermans C. Anthony E.C. Mul E. van der Schoot E. Hordijk P. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1456-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was significantly blocked by the Rac1 but not the RhoA, Rac2, Cdc42, or PTD peptides (Fig. 3A, movie 4, a and b). SDF-1-induced migration of HL60 cells and of primary normal and leukemic hematopoietic progenitor cells was blocked by TAT-Rac1 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B). These data were obtained using pre-incubation followed by washing of the cells; when peptides were also present during the migration assay, lower concentrations were sufficient for complete inhibition. The inhibition of cell migration was not because of peptide-induced toxicity, as we found no signs of reduced cell growth or viability after prolonged and repetitive transduction with the various peptides (data not shown). Table I depicts an overview of a large series of migration experiments in various cell types, which shows that chemotaxis is significantly and differentially inhibited by the Rac1 and RhoA C-terminal peptides, e.g. for 98 and 69%, respectively, in HL60 cells. Together, these data indicate that in normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells, primarily Rac1 and RhoA, and not Rac2 or Cdc42, mediate chemotaxis.Table ISummary of the inhibition of SDF-1-induced migration of various cell types by the indicated peptides as compared to the migration of TAT-treated cellsRac1Rac2RhoACdc42HL60 (n = 3-4)98.6 (± 0.5)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.50 (± 45.1)69 (± 12.7)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.29 (± 2.51)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.KG1A (n = 3-4)92 (± 2.9)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.20 (± 28.4)NDNDCB CD34+ (n = 1)835260NDMPB CD34+ (n = 3-4)49 (± 13.4)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.11 (± 10.2)21 (± 9.0)34 (± 7.1)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.B-CLL (n = 3-4)39 (± 16.9)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.0.8 (± 34.6)29 (± 6.5)aSignificant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells.NDa Significant (p < 0.05) inhibition in comparison with TAT-treated cells. Open table in a new tab The Rac1 C-terminal Domain Associates with Effector and Adapter Proteins—In MDCKII, HL60, COS7, or KG1a cells, the Rac1 or RhoA C-terminal peptides did not inhibit GTP loading of either endogenous Rac1 or RhoA. In addition, HGF-induced PAK activation was also not affected by transduction with TAT-Rac1 (data not shown). Clearly, the inhibitory effects presented above are mediated through a different, GTP loading-independent mechanism. The differential cellular loading of the C termini suggested that these domains mediate specific interactions with cellular proteins, rather than with lipids. In line with this, we were unable to find associations between phosphoinositides and the Rac1 C-terminal peptide. 2J. P. t. K. and J. R. H., unpublished observations. The TAT-Rac1 C terminus (or the RhoA, Rac2, Cdc42, and PTD peptides) did not associate with RhoGDI, which has been suggested to bind to Rac via the C terminus (21Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This may be because of the absence of the CAAX region and thus the lack of lipidation of the peptides. Similarly, the TAT-Rac1 peptide did not bind to the Rac effector PAK (not shown). This finding is in line with the above data that the TAT-Rac1 C-terminal peptide does not affect PAK activation and with the notion that the interaction of PAK with Rac is mediated by the effector loop. Tolias et al. (22Tolias K.F. Couvillon A.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have shown that the lipid kinase PIP5K binds to a GST-Rac 165-192 fusion protein, which comprises the C-terminal domain (22Tolias K.F. Couvillon A.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Using pull-down experiments followed by lipid kinase activity assays (23Divecha N. Roefs M. Halstead J.R. D'Andrea S. Fernandez-Borga M. Oomen L. Saqib K.M. Wakelam M.J. D'Santos C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5440-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that indeed the TAT-Rac1 C terminus (amino acids 178-188) bound PIP5K activity when used as a bait to fish in HL60 cell lysates (Fig. 4). The Rac2 and Cdc42 C-terminal domains were less efficient in binding to PIP5K, but the RhoA C-terminal peptide also associated to PIP5K, which confirms earlier data by Ren et al. (24Ren X.D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). TAT-Rac1 also bound PIP5K in KG1a, MDCKII, and COS7 cells (data not shown). Apparently, the Rac1 178-188 region, encoded by the peptide used in this study, is already sufficient to mediate association of Rac1 with PIP5K. We next examined the binding of the Rac1 peptide to other signaling proteins, implicated in cell migration and cell-cell adhesion. We found that the adapter proteins NCK and Crk bound specifically to the Rac1 C-terminal peptide. Although these adapter proteins have been implicated in cell migration (25Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 26Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a direct association with Rho-like GTPases has not been reported previously. The association of Crk to the C termini of Rac2 or Cdc42 was much less or even absent, compared with the Rac1 peptide (Fig. 5A). To confirm that the association between the Rac1 C-terminal peptide and Crk was also mediated by full-length Rac protein, we used the CRIB domain of PAK to isolate Rac1 from cell lysates. We indeed found Crk to be associated to this complex (Fig. 5B). Moreover, in the presence of the Rac1 C-terminal peptide, Crk binding to Rac was no longer observed, although the Rac-CRIB association remained unaltered. The RhoA C-terminal peptide did not compete for Crk binding to endogenous Rac (Fig. 5B). Subsequently, using transient transfection of v-Crk mutants that were mutated in the SH2 or the N-terminal SH3 domain (27Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar), we could show that the association of Crk with the Rac1 C terminus is mediated by the N-terminal SH3 domain of Crk and is not dependent on an intact SH2 domain (Fig. 5C). Having established at least two signaling proteins that associate directly with the Rac1 C terminus, we tested whether these interactions would involve identical residues within the Rac1 C-terminal sequence. To this end, two mutants of the TAT-Rac1 C-terminal peptide were synthesized. In the first one, the three prolines (amino acids 179-181) were replaced by alanine residues (Rac1 PPP-AAA). In the second, the RKR sequence (amino acids 185-187) was replaced by alanine residues (Rac1 RKR-AAA) (Fig. 6A). The interaction of the Rac1 C terminus with PIP5K was shown previously (28Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) to be mediated by basic amino acids, in particular Lys-186. In line with these data, the TAT-Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide no longer associated with PIP5K activity in the pull-down assay (Fig. 6B). Because the interaction with the Crk adapter protein involved the Crk SH3 domain, we tested whether the three consecutive prolines in the Rac1 C terminus mediated Crk binding. When using the Rac1 PPP-AAA peptide, the binding to Crk was abolished, confirming that these prolines were required for the interaction (Fig. 6C). This peptide was still capable of associating to PIP5K (Fig. 6B). The Rac1 RKR-AAA mutant peptide also no longer associated to Crk, indicating that, in addition to the proline stretch, the adjacent basic amino acids are also important for Crk binding. These data establish the presence of two binding motifs for signaling proteins within the Rac1 C terminus. Next, the wild type and the two mutant peptides were used to determine the relation between the presence of either binding site and localization and effects of the peptides. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, a product of PIP5K, is present in lipid rafts from where actin poly"

A key component of the pathway is β-catenin that, in association with TCF-4, directly regulates the expression of Wnt-responsive genes. To identify novel binding partners of β-catenin that may control its transcriptional activity, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid screen and isolated the Tax-interacting protein (TIP-1). The in vivo complex formation between β-catenin and TIP-1 was verified by coimmunoprecipitation, and a direct physical association was revealed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments in vitro. By using a panel of deletion mutants of both proteins, we demonstrate that the interaction is mediated by the PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 homology) domain of TIP-1 and requires primarily the last four amino acids of β-catenin. TIP-1 overexpression resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the transcriptional activity of β-catenin when tested on the TOP/FOPFLASH reporter system. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous TIP-1 slightly increased endogenous β-catenin transactivation function. Moreover, we show that overexpression of TIP-1 reduced the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of colorectal cancer cells. These data suggest that TIP-1 may represent a novel regulatory element in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt signaling is essential during development while deregulation of this pathway frequently leads to the formation of various tumors including colorectal carcinomas.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar), whereas deregulation of this pathway is the major cause of colorectal cancers (2Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 3Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the presently accepted scheme (www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html), signal transduction initiates with the binding of the secreted ligand Wnt to the Frizzled/low density lipoprotein 6 receptor complex, which recruits cytoplasmic Disheveled to the membrane. Disheveled then binds and destabilizes the APC/axin/GSK3β complex that, in the absence of signaling, earmarks β-catenin for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Stabilized β-catenin enters the nucleus where it binds members of the TCF family of transcription factors, thereby activating the expression of Wnt-target genes including c-myc, PPARδ, matrilysin, and cyclin D1. Periodical renewal of the colorectal mucosa is strictly governed by the progressive decrease of Wnt signals as cells move from the bottom of the crypt to the surface of the lumen (4Fodde R. Smits R. Clevers H. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Mutations that inactivate APC or render β-catenin immune to phosphorylation by GSK3β cause signal-independent accumulation of β-catenin (5Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). This results in the formation of adenomatous polyps, which may acquire additional genetic changes and transit into fully metastatic carcinomas (4Fodde R. Smits R. Clevers H. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Therefore, the control of levels, localization, and transcriptional activity of β-catenin provides a potential intervention point in the treatment of colorectal cancer. β-Catenin is also a structural component of mammalian cells, linking the adhesion molecule cadherin to cytoskeletal actin filaments (6Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). During epithelialmesenchymal transition, invasive tumor cells show profound alterations in their cytoskeletal structure and adhesion properties (7Savagner P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Recent observations suggest that the equilibrium between cytoplasmic and membrane-associated pools of β-catenin is regulated by APC, a lack of which may result in changes of cell adhesion and migration during colorectal carcinogenesis (8Bienz M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). PDZ 1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 homology; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; luc, luciferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TIP, Tax-interacting protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; si, small interfering; TCF-4, T cell factor 4; APC, adenoma polyposis coli. (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 homology) domains are small protein-protein recognition modules that bind well defined C-terminal residues in a sequence-specific manner (9Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Several PDZ domain-containing proteins localize to sites of cell-cell contacts and are involved in the assembly of diverse signaling complexes (10Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increasing number of PDZ proteins have been shown to shuttle between these signaling complexes and the nucleus, thus exerting transcription regulatory functions (11Hsueh Y.P. Wang T.F. Yang F.C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Riefler G.M. Firestein B.L. J. Biol.

Pietrini G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3978-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and MAGI-1 (15Dobrosotskaya I.Y. James G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that the PDZ protein TIP-1 binds β-catenin and inhibits its transcriptional activity. We show that overexpression of TIP-1 results in reduced proliferative capacity of colorectal cancer cells, suggesting an important role for this protein in the control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Cell Culture, DNA Constructs, and Transfections—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The protein coding sequence of murine TIP-1 was subcloned into the following expression vectors: pCMV-Myc, pEGFPC1 (Clontech), pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in fusion with an N-terminal Myc tag. The coding sequence of murine β-catenin was subcloned into pCMV-HA (Clontech) and pcDNA3. β-Catenin-(1-777) was generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3. The various deletion mutants of β-catenin and TIP-1 used for interaction mapping were generated by PCR. The coding sequence of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax (kindly provided by Dr. M. Giacca) and mouse rhotekin (amino acids 38-551) was subcloned in pcDNA3. TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH reporters contain wild type (WT) and mutated TCF-4 consensus binding sites, respectively, and were described previously (16Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). pG5luc contains five tandem repeats of Gal4 binding sites and was purchased from Promega. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) reagents according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Antibodies, Immunofluorescence Analysis, and Western Blotting—Anti-TIP-1 polyclonal antisera were obtained from rabbits immunized with GST-TIP-1. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 9B11, Signal Transduction Laboratories), anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), and anti-β-catenin (Signal Transduction Laboratories). Polyclonal antibodies specific for actin were obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Sigma. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (17Sandy P. Gostissa M. Fogal V. De Cecco L. Szalay K. Rooney R.J. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and images were taken with a Leica DMLB microscope and a Photometrics Coolsnap camera. Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assay—Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (17Sandy P. Gostissa M. Fogal V. De Cecco L. Szalay K. Rooney R.J. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Kanamori M. Kai C. Hayashizaki Y. Suzuki H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Purification of GST and GST-TIP-1, in vitro translation (TnT kit, Promega), and pull-down assays were performed as described previously (17Sandy P. Gostissa M. Fogal V. De Cecco L. Szalay K. Rooney R.J. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mammalian Two-hybrid and Reporter Assays—The applied two-hybrid method has been published previously (19Suzuki H. Fukunishi Y. Kagawa I. Saito R. Oda H. Endo T. Kondo S. Bono H. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For TOP/FOPFLASH reporter assays, cells were transfected in 24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well density. 50-100 ng of luciferase reporter was cotransfected with expression vectors as indicated in each experiment for a total of 250 ng of DNA/well. pRL-CMV (Promega) was cotransfected (5-10 ng/well) to normalize samples for transfection efficiency (Dual luciferase kit, Promega). Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase activity was determined with a Turner Designs luminometer. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA duplexes (siTIP-1, 5′-AAGCUGCGUCAAGGUGAGAAC-3′ and siCONT (20Monte M. Benetti R. Buscemi G. Sandy P. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30356-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells grown on 24-well plates were transfected with siRNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. 24 h later, cells were transfected with the indicated reporter constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent and luciferase activity was measured 1 day later. Colony Formation and Soft Agar Assays—Subconfluent cells grown on 6-cm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3Myc-TIP-1. 24 h later, cells were replated on three 10-cm dishes in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). After 2 weeks of selection, surviving colonies were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde stained with Giemsa and counted. Cell Lines with Stable Expression of Myc-TIP-1 Were Obtained as Described Previously (21Goruppi S. Chiaruttini C. Ruaro M.E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 902-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)—For anchorage-independent growth assays, 5 × 104 cells were plated in 2 ml of soft agar (0.5% agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) on the surface of 4 ml of hard agar (1%) in 6-cm dishes. After 3 weeks, large colonies were counted. β-Catenin Interacts with TIP-1—In search for new interacting partners of β-catenin, we employed a modified mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) assay described recently (19Suzuki H. Fukunishi Y. Kagawa I. Saito R. Oda H. Endo T. Kondo S. Bono H. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). β-Catenin in fusion with the VP16 transactivation domain was expressed in CHO-K1 cells together with ∼15,000 mouse full-length cDNAs fused in-frame with the DNA binding domain of Gal4, and interaction was monitored with the pG5luc reporter. Several known binding partners of β-catenin were identified among the expressed BD fusion proteins including TCF-4, APC, GSK3β, cadherin, and inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF-4 (ICAT) (data not shown). In addition to these molecules, we screened out the murine homologue of the PDZ domain protein, TIP-1, as a novel binding partner of β-catenin (Fig. 1A). TIP-1 has been first identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a Tax-interacting protein (22Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and recent work has shown that it can also bind glutaminase L and rhotekin (23Olalla L. Aledo J.C. Bannenberg G. Marquez J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Reynaud C. Fabre S. Jalinot P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33962-33968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Human and mouse TIP-1 are highly similar small proteins (14 kDa) that seem to be involved in the Rho signaling pathway (24Reynaud C. Fabre S. Jalinot P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33962-33968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between β-catenin and TIP-1, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed on lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged TIP-1 and HA-tagged β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 1B, β-catenin was readily observed in the anti-Myc immunocomplex. Similar results were obtained by using U2OS cells (data not shown). β-Catenin is a component of the adherens junctions but exerts its transcriptional activity in the nucleus, whereas TIP-1 has been shown to be a cytoplasmic protein (24Reynaud C. Fabre S. Jalinot P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33962-33968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To correlate the interaction data with subcellular localization, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of ectopically expressed proteins in U2OS cells. As expected, HA-β-catenin showed mainly nuclear localization (Fig. 1C), whereas Myc-TIP-1 localized both to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus (Fig. 1C). The subcellular localization of overexpressed TIP-1 was confirmed with two different monoclonal antibodies against Myc tag and with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against TIP-1. Similar results were obtained by using 293, NIH3T3, and HCT-116 cells or when TIP-1 was expressed in fusion with the green fluorescent protein (data not shown). These results suggest that β-catenin and TIP-1 interact in vivo and that complex formation probably takes place in the nucleus. To test whether the association between TIP-1 and β-catenin is direct, we performed pull-down assays with purified GSTTIP-1 in the presence of in vitro translated β-catenin. As positive controls, we used in vitro translated human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax and rhotekin, two previously described binding partners of TIP-1 (22Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Reynaud C. Fabre S. Jalinot P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33962-33968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, a strong and specific interaction was detected between TIP-1 and β-catenin, suggesting that β-catenin physically associates with TIP-1. TIP-1 Binds β-Catenin via Its PDZ Domain—TIP-1 belongs to the class I of PDZ proteins that are known to recognize the X(S/T)X(V/I/L)-COOH motif in their targets C terminus (25Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), a sequence that is also possessed by β-catenin (DTDL-COOH). In fact, two class I PDZ proteins, MAGI-1 and LIN-7, have been shown to interact with β-catenin through these residues (14Perego C. Vanoni C. Massari S. Longhi R. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3978-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Dobrosotskaya I.Y. James G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). First, we wanted to confirm that the association with β-catenin is mediated by the PDZ domain of TIP-1. The single PDZ domain of TIP-1 is located centrally and flanked by short N- and C-terminal sequences (22Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Olalla L. Aledo J.C. Bannenberg G. Marquez J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Various deletion mutants of TIP-1 were tested in an in vivo interaction assay with coexpressed β-catenin, and the obtained results clearly demonstrated the requirement of the intact PDZ domain for complex formation (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, although the removal of the first 12 amino acids of TIP-1 had no significant effect on the interaction with β-catenin, deletion of the last eight residues resulted in a 3-fold reduction of binding efficiency, suggesting a possible role for this protein region in the formation or stability of the complex. We next wanted to dissect the target sequence in β-catenin that is required for the interaction with TIP-1. For this purpose, we performed in vitro pull-down assays with GST-TIP-1 by using either the WT or a mutant form of β-catenin that lacks the PDZ-recognition motif from its C terminus (β-catenin-(1-777)). As reported in Fig. 2B, the readily observed interaction between β-catenin and TIP-1 was almost completely abolished by the removal of the DTDL sequence from the C terminus of β-catenin. To our surprise, however, β-catenin-(1-777) was able to bind TIP-1 in vivo although significantly weaker than the full-length protein (Fig. 2C). This result suggests the existence of either an in vitro non-accessible second binding site or, alternatively, a protein that may act as a molecular bridge to mediate the interaction between TIP-1 and β-catenin. To clarify this point, we repeated the in vivo interaction assay with several deletion mutants of β-catenin and mapped the region spanning between amino acids 173 and 483 responsible for the reduced complex formation with TIP-1 in the absence of the C-terminal DTDL sequence (Fig. 2D). Although it is known that PDZ proteins can recognize internal sequences as well (26Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), the size and the three-dimensional structure of the identified segment makes the presence of such a motif rather unlikely. On the other hand, this region comprises Armadillo repeats 2-8 that is the binding surface for several known β-catenin-interacting proteins (27Bienz M. Clevers H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate a direct physical association between the extreme C terminus of β-catenin and the PDZ domain of TIP-1 and reveal an alternative mechanism for complex formation in vivo. TIP-1 Inhibits the Transcriptional Activity of β-Catenin—Because β-catenin contains several transactivating elements in its C terminus (28Hecht A. Litterst C. Huber O. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18017-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we wished to analyze the biological significance of the interaction by measuring the transcriptional activity of β-catenin upon coexpression of TIP-1. As a first approach, β-catenin-(683-781) in fusion with the DNA binding domain of Gal4 was coexpressed with increasing amounts of Myc-TIP-1 in CHO-K1 cells and transcriptional activity was measured with the pG5luc reporter. As shown in Fig. 3A, TIP-1 repressed the transcriptional activity of the BD-β-catenin chimera in a dose-dependent manner. To test the effect of TIP-1 on the transactivation function of β-catenin under more physiological conditions, we applied the TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH reporters that contain a series of either WT or mutant TCF-4 binding sites, respectively, upstream of the luciferase gene (16Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). 293 cells were cotransfected with fixed amounts of β-catenin (either WT or 1-777 mutant) and luciferase reporters together with increasing amounts of TIP-1. As shown in Fig. 3B, TIP-1 inhibited β-catenin transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. The transcriptional activity of β-catenin-(1-777) was also decreased by TIP-1, but significantly higher amounts of TIP-1 were required to the same inhibitory effect with respect to the WT (Fig. 3B). This observation is in line with the in vivo binding data (Fig. 2, C and D) and confirms the existence of a secondary interaction in a functional assay. TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH reporters had the same basal activity in these cells in the absence of exogenous β-catenin, and overexpression of TIP-1 had no effect on any of the reporters under this condition (data not shown). We next addressed whether TIP-1 could repress the transcriptional activity of endogenous β-catenin in colorectal cancer cells harboring either truncated APC (HT-29) or mutations in the GSK3β phosphorylation sites of β-catenin (HCT-116 and SW48). Overexpression of TIP-1 decreased TOPFLASH reporter activity in a dose-dependent fashion in all of the three cell lines (Fig. 3, C and D, and data not shown), suggesting that TIP-1 could act as a potent inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Endogenous TIP-1 Affects β-Catenin Function—To understand the role of TIP-1 in the β-catenin pathway, we first assessed whether complex formation occurs between endogenous proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A, β-catenin was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with TIP-1 from HCT-116 cells, thus confirming that the interaction takes place under physiological conditions. We next measured the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in HCT-116 cells where expression of endogenous TIP-1 was down-regulated using small interfering RNAs specific for human TIP-1 (siTIP-1). As shown in Fig. 4B, we observed a modest but reproducible increase in TOPFLASH reporter activity in cells transfected with siTIP-1 as compared with the ones transfected with control siRNA (siCONT). TIP-1 Reduces the Growth Rate of Colorectal Cancer Cells—Overexpression of β-catenin results in increased proliferation and enhanced anchorage-independent growth of normal epithelial cells, underlying its oncogenic function (29Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ICAT, a reported inhibitor of β-catenin transactivation function (30Tago K. Nakamura T. Nishita M. Hyodo J. Nagai S. Murata Y. Adachi S. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Shibuya H. Akiyama T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar), reduces the growth and colony-forming ability of tumor cells in soft agar (31Sekiya T. Nakamura T. Kazuki Y. Oshimura M. Kohu K. Tago K. Ohwada S. Akiyama T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3322-3326PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed colony formation assays in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. Equal amounts of empty or TIP-1-encoding expression vectors conferring resistance to neomycin were transfected, and surviving colonies were counted after 2 weeks of selection in Geneticin-containing medium. As shown in Fig. 5A, ∼50% reduction in colony numbers was observed in the TIP-1-transfected cells. This decrease in the number of resistant colonies could be attributed to either the death or the reduced growth rate of TIP-1-expressing cells. Transient transfection of TIP-1 did not cause cell death, although we observed a significant inhibition (30-50%) of S phase entry in those cells by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay (data not shown). Cell lines of HCT-116 and HT-29 expressing Myc-TIP-1 were established next to assess their colony formation ability in soft agar. As shown in Fig. 5B, the anchorage-independent proliferative capacity of the Myc-TIP-1-expressing cells was significantly reduced. Altogether these results demonstrate that ectopically expressed TIP-1 inhibits the growth properties of colorectal cancer cells harboring deregulated β-catenin activity. In this work, we have shown that the PDZ protein TIP-1 physically interacts with β-catenin and inhibits its transcriptional activity. TIP-1 binds primarily to the PDZ recognition sequence located at the extreme C terminus of β-catenin. Deletion of these residues, however, did not completely abolish association between the two proteins in vivo, and we have defined a secondary interaction region comprising Armadillo repeats 2-8 by deletion mapping. The size, structure, and location of this segment suggest the existence of a protein, which binds β-catenin and TIP-1 simultaneously, hence mediating their complex formation. Further research is required to identify this hypothetical protein. In addition, we have also identified eight amino acids of TIP-1, flanking its PDZ domain C-terminally, which seem to be required for efficient interaction with β-catenin. Future works may address whether these residues confer specificity for substrate recognition. The evidence that overexpression of TIP-1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of β-catenin while down-regulation of endogenous TIP-1 expression has a positive effect on it strongly suggest that TIP-1 is a critical component of the β-catenin regulatory network. TIP-1 may exhibit its action by affecting the stability or subcellular localization of β-catenin, or alternatively, it may influence complex formation between β-catenin and TCF-4 or components of the transcriptional machinery. Ectopic expression or knock-down of TIP-1 had no detectable effect on the protein levels of β-catenin as judged by Western blot analysis (data not shown). TIP-1 has been shown to be exclusively cytoplasmic (24Reynaud C. Fabre S. Jalinot P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33962-33968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although we observed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the overexpressed protein (Fig. 1C). Because of its small size, it is plausible that TIP-1 freely shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus. Notably, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (32Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas glutaminase L is a nuclear protein (33Olalla L. Gutierrez A. Campos J.A. Khan Z.U. Alonso F.J. Segura J.A. Marquez J. Aledo J.C. J. Biol.

Although several PDZ proteins are components of the adherens junctions, we did not observe localization of TIP-1 into these structures even in case of coexpression with β-catenin (data not shown). TIP-1 may cause the cytoplasmic retention of β-catenin, hence inhibiting its association with TCF-4 in the nucleus that is prerequisite for activation of Wnt target genes. However, we were not able to detect visible changes in the localization of β-catenin upon overexpression of TIP-1 (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The intrinsic transactivating capability of β-catenin relies on the presence of transactivating elements located both N- and C-terminally that are able to recruit general transcription factors like TATA-binding protein for target gene promoters (28Hecht A. Litterst C. Huber O. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18017-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, the more potent C-terminal transactivation domain directly associates with the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP (34Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Displacement of these proteins or TCF-4 from β-catenin by competitive binding is seen as a prospective therapeutic approach for the treatment of colorectal cancers. Indeed, ICAT binds Armadillo repeats 5-12 and inhibits β-catenin transcriptional activity by displacing both TCF-4 and p300 (38Graham T.A. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Xu W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the primary and secondary binding sites of TIP-1 on β-catenin partially overlap with the interaction region of p300 and TCF-4, respectively. Experiments aimed to investigate whether the inhibitory effect of TIP-1 is based on competitive binding are in progress in our laboratories. The evidence that TIP-1 overexpression reduces both colony formation and anchorage-independent growth of colorectal cancer cells raises the possibility that it may function as a tumor suppressor. Interestingly, the TIP-1 gene is located at the short arm of human chromosome 17 that is frequently lost in colon carcinomas (40Baker S.J. Fearon E.R. Nigro J.M. Hamilton S.R. Preisinger A.C.

It will be important to see the presence and/or level of TIP-1 transcript in the various stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. Information regarding the regulation of the gene and identification of novel targets of its product may help to better understand the biological function and mechanism of action of TIP-1.

This protein is encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) that overlaps the core gene in the +1 frame (core+1 ORF). In vitro this protein is produced by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism. However, similar studies failed to detect the ARFP/F/core+1 protein in the HCV-1a (H) isolate. To clarify this issue and to elucidate the functions of this protein, we examined the expression of the core+1 ORF by the HCV-1 and HCV-1a (H) isolates in vivo, in transfected cells. For this purpose, we carried out luciferase (LUC) tagging experiments combined with site-directed mutagenesis studies. Our results showed that the core+1-LUC chimeric protein was efficiently produced in vivo by both isolates. More importantly, neither changes in the specific 10-A residue region of HCV-1 (codons 8-11), the proposed frameshift site for the production of the ARFP/F/core+1 protein in vitro, nor the alteration of the ATG start site of the HCV polyprotein to a stop codon significantly affected the in vivo expression of the core+1 ORF. Furthermore, we showed that efficient translation initiation of the core+1 ORF is mediated by internal initiation codon(s) within the core/core+1-coding sequence, located between nucleotides 583 and 606. Collectively, our data suggest the existence of an alternative translation initiation mechanism that may result in the synthesis of a shorter form of the core+1 protein in transfected cells.

Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). This virus establishes chronic infection in most acutely infected individuals, frequently leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Saito I. Miyamura T. Ohbayashi A. Harada H.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). HCV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus. It is a member of the Hepacivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family (4Murphy F.A. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Ghabrial S.A. Jarvis A.W. Martelli G.P. Mayo M.A. Summers M.D. Virus Taxonomy. Sixth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Springer-Verlag, Vienna & New York1995: 424-426Google Scholar). The viral genome is ∼10-kb long and encodes a 3011-amino acid polyprotein precursor. This polyprotein is co- and post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases giving rise to three structural (core, E1, and E2) and at least six non-structural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins (5Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Initiation of translation of the HCV genome is controlled by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located mainly within the 5′-non-coding region of the viral RNA, between nucleotides 42 and 341 or 356, the 3′-limit being controversial (6Rijnbrand R.C. Lemon S.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 85-116PubMed Google Scholar). The core protein, which forms the viral nucleocapsid, is predicted to be 191 amino acids long and to have a molecular mass of 23 kDa (p23). Further processing of p23 produces the mature core protein (p21), consisting of 173-182 amino acids (7Ray R.B. Ray R. FEMS Microbiol.

An additional HCV polypeptide of 16/17 kDa (p16/p17) has recently been discovered (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol.

This polypeptide, named the ARFP (for alternative reading frame protein), F (for frameshift protein) or core+1 (to describe the location of this novel protein), is synthesized in vitro from the initiator codon of the polyprotein sequence followed by a +1 ribosomal frameshift operating in the region of core codons 8-14 (9Varaklioti A.

Moreover, circulating anti-core+1 antibodies have been detected in HCV-infected individuals, suggesting that this protein is produced during natural HCV infection (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17713-17721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Walewski J.L. Keller T.R. Stump D.D. Branch A.D.

Interestingly, a non-structural protein is encoded by the N-terminal structural region of a number of positive sense RNA viruses like Pestiviruses (Npro protease, Ref. 12Rumenapf T. Stark R. Heimann M. Thiel H.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2544-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Apthoviruses (L *The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

Virol. 1999; 73: 8519-8526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are believed to play essential roles in the viral life cycle. Moreover, it is tempting to speculate that some of the functional properties attributed to the core are in fact due to the ARFP/F/core+1 protein, as both proteins are probably produced simultaneously in certain experimental conditions (7Ray R.B. Ray R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 202: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To investigate the biological importance of the ARFP/F/core+1 protein, as a first step, we assessed the expression of the core+1-coding sequence in mammalian cells. During the course of these experiments, we examined the expression of the core+1 ORF by HCV-1, which efficiently synthesizes the ARFP/F/core+1 p16/p17 protein in vitro, in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and by HCV-1a (H), in which no p16/p17 has been detected (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17713-17721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For this, we carried out transient transfection assays based on the luciferase tagging approach combined with site-directed mutagenesis analysis. The luciferase tagging approach was chosen because it allows the sensitive enzymatic detection of the core+1 translation product and can be used to assess the relative expression levels of the core and core+1 ORFs in the two HCV isolates. Our results show that, unlike in the in vitro expression studies, both HCV-1 and HCV-1a (H) efficiently express the core+1 ORF in transfected cells. More importantly, our genetic analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that in transfected cells efficient translation initiation of core+1 is mediated from internal translation initiation codons located between nt 583 and 606, resulting in the synthesis of a shorter form of the core+1-LUC chimeric protein. This form of the ARFP/F/core+1 chimeric protein is synthesized even when the core is not produced.

This set of primers converts the start codon of the luciferase-coding region (ATG) into a glycine codon (GGG). pHPI-1311, -1313, and -1312 were constructed by replacing the 203-bp NheI-XbaI fragment of the dicistronic pHPI-1046 (previously described, Ref. 14Psaridi L.

The primers change the initiator codon of the luciferase-coding region into a glycine codon (ATG → GGG). pHPI-1328, -1329, and -1330 were generated by replacing the 203-bp NheI-XbaI fragment of pHPI-1046 with the 435-bp NheI-XbaI fragments of pHPI-748, -749, -750, respectively (previously described, Ref. 9Varaklioti A.

To facilitate plasmid characterization, most of the mutations inserted into the dicistronic constructs pHPI-1333 (HCV-1) and pHPI-1335 (HCV-1a (H)) were recloned into pHPI-1046 by replacing the wild-type 203-bp NheI-XbaI fragment with the corresponding fragment of the mutated template. The monocistronic constructs pHPI-1362 and -1363 contain the same IRES-core-LUC cassette as pHPI-1333 and -1332 respectively, cloned between the HindIII and SalI sites of pEGFPN3 (Clontech). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—For all the plasmids, Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) supplemented with 120 mm KCl and 0.5 mm Mg(OAc)2 were used. DNA (3 μg) from each plasmid was linearized and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type pHPI-1331, -1333, -1332, -1334, -1335, -1336, and the corresponding mutated dicistronic constructs were linearized with PstI. In vitro translation experiments were carried out on uncapped RNAs in a total volume of 25 μl using [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The translation products (5 μl) were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. Cells and DNA Transfection Experiments—BHK-21 and Huh-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM/FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells seeded in 6-well plates (60% confluence) were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in the presence of Lipofect-AMINE plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The medium was replaced with new DMEM/FBS 24 h post-transfection. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline 48 h post-transfection and lysed in 260 μl of 1× luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly LUC was quantified by mixing 20 μl of extract with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and measuring the luminescence directly with a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer. In the case of the dicistronic constructs, CAT was quantified with the CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—The goat polyclonal antibody against the firefly luciferase protein was obtained from Promega Corporation at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Thirty-six hours after transfection with pHPI-1362 or pHPI-1363, monolayers of BHK-21 cells (∼107 cells) were metabolically labeled for 12 h with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) per ml of methionine-free medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. The labeled cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of total volume of triple detergent buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were mixed by vortexing and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were incubated with 10 μl of anti-LUC polyclonal antibody on a rocker overnight at 4 °C. Protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added (20 μl) to this mixture and the reactions were incubated in the same conditions for an additional 2 h. After microcentrifugation, the agarose beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by autoradiography. The Core+1 ORF Is Efficiently Expressed in Transfected Cells—As all previous studies concerning the expression of the core+1 ORF have been carried out primarily in in vitro systems based on rabbit reticulocyte lysates, we examined core+1 translation from the HCV-1 and HCV-1a (H) isolates in mammalian cells. For this, we carried out transient transfection assays, initially in BHK-21 cells, and monitored the expression of core and core+1 ORFs by tagging the ORFs with the luciferase gene (LUC) as described before (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17713-17721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. The cDNA sequences containing the entire IRES and part of the core-coding sequences (nt 9-630) from HCV-1 and HCV-1a (H) fused to the LUC gene in all three frames were transferred into a dicistronic vector in which CAT was the first gene. The dicistronic cassettes CAT-IRES-core-LUC were placed under the control of a CMV/T7 promoter to allow the use of the same DNA plasmid for expression in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, to eliminate the possibility of internal translational initiation events triggered by the initiator codon of the LUC gene, the ATG was changed to a GGG codon. The DNA constructs are illustrated in Fig. 1A. With this modified dicistronic expression system, the expression of the LUC gene is directly related to the expression of the fused core or core+1-coding sequences, and CAT activity serves as an internal control to standardize transfection efficiencies in vivo or potential variations in the transcript abundance in vitro. BHK-21 cells were transfected with each construct, and 48 h later LUC and CAT activities were measured. Fig. 1, B and C show the level of LUC expression relative to CAT in the transfected cells. In the case of HCV-1, substantial amounts of luciferase were expressed from the core+1-LUC cassette of pHPI-1333, as the levels of the luciferase activity were similar to that of the core-LUC fusion protein derived from pHPI-1331 (Fig. 1Ba). Only background levels of luciferase activity were detected following the expression of the corresponding negative control core-1-LUC construct (pHPI-1332). Surprisingly, in contrast to in vitro (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17713-17721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), very high levels of luciferase activity were observed from construct pHPI-1335, which contains the core+1 ORF from HCV-1a (H) fused to the LUC gene. The levels were about 200% of that of the HCV-1a (H) core-LUC hybrid protein yielded from pHPI-1334 (Fig. 1Ca). Again, the corresponding negative control plasmid (pHPI-1336) resulted in background levels of luciferase expression. Thus, the HCV-1 core+1 LUC-tagged protein is efficiently produced in vivo, with similar translation levels as the core-coding sequence. More importantly, unlike in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, our data indicate that the HCV-1a (H) isolate efficiently expresses the core+1 ORF in transiently transfected BHK-21 cells. To confirm the divergence between the previous in vitro and our current in vivo studies, the same DNA plasmids were tested for expression in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 1, B and C). As anticipated, the in vitro translation of the core-LUC construct from HCV-1 (pHPI-1331) or HCV-1a (H) (pHPI-1334) resulted in the synthesis of a chimeric core-LUC protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa (Fig. 1, B and Cb, lane 1). Furthermore, in agreement with previous data (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17713-17721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), when pHPI-1333, containing the core+1-LUC cassette from HCV-1, was used, a hybrid protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa was produced (Fig. 1Bb, lane 2). On the contrary, pHPI-1335, carrying the equivalent core+1-LUC cassette from HCV-1a (H), exhibited no luciferase expression (Fig. 1Cb, lane 2). The 72-kDa protein was not produced by pHPI-1332 (HCV-1) or pHPI-1336 (HCV-1a (H)), which carry the LUC gene fused to the -1 frame of the core-coding region (Fig. 1, B and Cb, lane 3). These data confirm previous in vitro expression studies from our laboratory showing that the core+1 ORF was expressed from the HCV-1 core-coding region but not from the HCV-1a (H) equivalent. They also reveal that the predominant translation mechanism that directs the expression of ARFP/F/core+1 ORF differs in vitro and in transfected cells. The A-rich Sequence at Codons 8-11 of the HCV-1 Core-coding Region Is Not Essential for the Production of the ARFP/F/Core+1 Protein in Transfected Cells—The core-coding region of HCV-1a (H) lacks the 10 consecutive A residues found at codons 8-11 (nt 364-373) of the HCV-1 genome, a known slippery site prone to ribosomal frameshift events. Thus, we directly assessed the importance of the 10-A residue region for the expression of the core+1 ORF in transfected cells as compared with that in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. For this purpose, mutational studies were performed based on previously described naturally occurring mutations at the proposed frameshift site (codons 8-14). Specifically, Yeh et al. (15Yeh C.T. Lo S.Y. Dai D.I. Tang J.H. Chu C.M. Liaw Y.F. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) provided evidence that a p16 protein from the core-coding region of clinical isolates from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was produced in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The detected protein was reported as being a short form of the core protein even though the protein was immunologically distinct from the p21 core. The presence of this protein was associated with specific missense mutations within codons 9-11, none of which generate a 10-A residue sequence. To determine the effect of these naturally occurring mutations on the production of the ARFP/F/core+1 protein in vivo, the dicistronic constructs pHPI-1333 (HCV-1) and pHPI-1335 (HCV-1a (H)) were used as templates. In the case of HCV-1 (Fig. 2A), insertion of mutation N18, which contains two A to G substitutions and an A to C substitution at nt 366, 367, and 373 respectively (codons 9 and 11), gave rise to pHPI-1382, whereas mutation N19, which carries an A to G substitution and two A to C substitutions at nt 367, 369, and 373 respectively (codons 9, 10, and 11), resulted in pHPI-1383. For HCV-1a (H) (Fig. 2B), insertion of mutation N15, which contains an A to G change at position 366 (codon 9), gave rise to pHPI-1395, and insertion of N16, which carries an A to C substitution at nt 369 (codon 10), resulted in pHPI-1396. Both N15 and N16 mutations contain a single substitution as the HCV-1a (H) isolate already carries a G and a C at positions 367 and 373 respectively. None of these mutations had a significant effect on luciferase activity in vivo (Fig. 2, C and Da), indicating that the presence of the 10 consecutive adenines at codons 8-11, as found in the HCV-1 isolate, is not critical for core+1 ORF expression in vivo. However, in vitro none of the above mutants produced detectable levels of the core+1-LUC hybrid protein (Fig. 2, C and Db, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, mutations that disrupt the 10-A residue sequence within codons 8-11 of the core-coding region fail to support the production of the core+1-LUC protein in vitro, whereas the same mutations have no effect on the expression of the protein in vivo. Thus, our data do not appear to be consistent with those previously reported (15Yeh C.T. Lo S.Y. Dai D.I. Tang J.H. Chu C.M. Liaw Y.F. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reason for this is not clear at the moment, but it is likely to be due to differences in the core-coding sequence beyond codons 9-11 between the HCV isolates used in the two studies or to differences between the two rabbit reticulocyte lysate expression systems. Overall, our results indicate that the A-rich region at codons 8-11 is critical for the expression of the ARFP/F/core+1 protein only in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The ATG Initiator Codon of the HCV Core-coding Region Is Not Essential for the Expression of the ARFP/F/Core+1 Protein in Transfected Cells—To investigate further the molecular mechanism(s) implicated in the in vivo expression of the core+1 ORF, two mutations were introduced into the core-coding region of the core+1-LUC-tagged constructs of both the HCV-1 (pHPI-1333) and HCV-1a (H) (pHPI-1335) isolates (Fig. 3A). Mutation N3 converted the ATG initiator codon of the core ORF into a terminator codon and mutation N6 introduced a stop codon at the 25th position of the core-coding sequence at nt 414 (P25, CCG). The resulting plasmids were named pHPI-1343 and pHPI-1344 for HCV-1, and pHPI-1346 and pHPI-1347 for HCV-1a (H), respectively. If a ribosomal frameshift mechanism is indeed responsible for the production of the ARFP/F/core+1 protein in vivo, then the N3 mutation should abrogate the production of the chimeric protein, whereas N6 should have no effect. However, transfection studies showed that not only the N3 mutation failed to block core+1 expression but also the resulting mutant exhibited increased levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 4, A and B) compared with the wild-type core+1-LUC (positive control). Similar data were obtained for both HCV-1 (Fig. 4Aa) and HCV-1a (H) (Fig. 4Ba). Additionally, the N6 mutation resulted in increased levels of luciferase activity in both isolates; the levels of luciferase activity detected in these constructs were similar to those observed in constructs carrying the N3 mutation (Fig. 4, A and Ba). These results suggest that, in contrast to in vitro (9Varaklioti A. Vassilaki N. Georgopoulou U. Mavromara P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17713-17721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the in vivo translation of the core+1 ORF does not require core expression. Instead, our data suggest that blocking the translation of the core ORF has a positive effect on the translation of the core+1 ORF.Fig. 4Effect of mutations within nucleotide sequences that flank codons 8-11 of the HCV-1 (A) and the HCV-1a (H) (B) core-coding region on the expression of core+1-LUC chimeric gene. The wild-type pHPI-1333 (HCV-1) and pHPI-1335 (HCV-1a (H)) and N3, N6 mutant variants pHPI-1343, pHPI-1344 (HCV-1), and pHPI-1346, pHPI-1347 (HCV-1a (H)), respectively, were used to transfect BHK-21 cells (a) or transcribed in vitro and equal amounts of RNAs were translated in Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysates (b). a, duplicate cultures of BHK-21 cells were transfected with the wild-type or the mutated constructs.

Furthermore, as expected, the core+1-LUC constructs (WT, N3,"

The emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in Staphylococci, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, has become a major medical concern. With the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in hospitals throughout the world (1Hiramatsu K. Cui L. Kuroda M. Ito T.

A possible strategy for the development of new antibacterials is to target bacterial virulence factors. The S. aureus arsenal of virulence factors includes secreted toxins (10Bailey C.J.

Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 405-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Staphopains A and B are the major secreted cysteine proteases of S. aureus. The literature contains evidence both for and against their role as virulence factors. Random mutagenesis has shown that transposon insertion into the V8-proteinase gene attenuates S. aureus virulence in three separate animal models (mouse abscess, bacteraemia, and wound infection models) (17Coulter S.N. Schwan W.R. Ng E.Y. Langhorne M.H. Ritchie H.D. Westbrock-Wadman S. Hufnagle W.O. Folger K.R. Bayer A.S. Stover C.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). More recent work suggests that loss of virulence could be because of a polar effect of the insertion event on the downstream sspB gene encoding staphopain B (18Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, inactivation of the sspB gene attenuates S. aureus virulence in the skin abscess model. In contrast, staphopain A, a close homologue of staphopain B, appears to be dispensable for virulence at least in this model. 1L. Shaw, E. Golonka, J. Potempa, and S. Foster, submitted for publication.1L. Shaw, E. Golonka, J. Potempa, and S. Foster, submitted for publication. Staphopains A and B are remote members of the papain superfamily of enzymes and are encoded on the genome as preproenzymes in the scp and ssp loci, respectively. Recently, it was shown that a short open reading frame in the ssp operon termed sspC codes for an inhibitor of staphopain B, the cysteine protease in this operon (19Massimi I. Park E. Rice K. Müller-Esterl W. Sauder D. McGavin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41770-41777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This initial finding could be extended to the scp operon: the second open reading frame in this operon, termed scpB, codes for an inhibitor of ScpA/staphopain A (20Rzychon M. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Potempa J. Dubin A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite the homology between staphopains A and B (47% amino acid identity over 174 residues) and between the scpB and sspC gene products (18% amino acid identity over 109 residues), the inhibitors are specific for the proteases in their own operon. To emphasize this extraordinary specificity against the staphylococcal proteases and other papain-like proteases, they have been termed staphostatin A and B, respectively (20Rzychon M. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Potempa J. Dubin A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The structure of mature staphopain A is known (21Hofmann B. Schomburg D. Hecht H.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49 (102): 102Crossref Google Scholar). It shows that staphopains are remote members of the papain superfamily of enzymes with cathepsin B as their closest structural neighbor among the eukaryotic enzymes. Our recent determination of the staphostatin B structure (22Rzychon M. Filipek R. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Dubin A. Potempa J. Bochtler M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that staphostatins are not significantly similar to cystatins at the structural level, even though they resemble type I and II cystatins in length and secondary structure. Staphostatins form eight-stranded mixed β-barrels, which result from hydrogen bonding of a three-stranded ψ-loop motif to a five-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet on both sides. In structural terms, staphostatin B is most closely related to lipocalins and to a number of protease inhibitory and regulatory domains that form β-barrels. In this article, we present the crystal structure of the staphostatin B-staphopain B complex at 1.8-Å resolution and report evidence that the unusual binding mode is relevant in solution as well. Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—Staphostatin B was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described before (20Rzychon M. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Potempa J. Dubin A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutants of staphostatin B were generated according to the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis protocol and could be purified like the wild-type with the exception of the C-terminal deletion mutant (Δ99–109) that was insoluble. For purification of staphopain B from the native source, culture supernatant was brought to 80% ammonium sulfate saturation. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 30 min) and the pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6. After extensive dialysis against the same buffer, the sample was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 1 h) and loaded on a DE-52 column (Whatman) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6. After extensive washing, bound protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). Elution fractions were checked by SDS-PAGE and assayed for proteolytic activity by zymography or by the azocoll (Calbiochem) assay (23Chavira Jr., R. Burnett T.J. Hageman J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Fractions containing staphopain B (typically 70–100 mm NaCl) were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 2 m ammonium sulfate, and subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). In a final step, the eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, to remove salt. Alternatively, prostaphopain B was cloned into pGEX-5T (24Berthold H. Frorath B. Scanarini M. Abney C.C. Ernst B. Northemann W. Biotech. Lett. 1992; 14: 245-250Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and expressed in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion construct with the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase moiety linked to proenzyme via a thrombin cleavable linker. The hybrid protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaved on the column with V8 protease at room temperature (5 h, 1:1000 weight ratio of the V8 proteinase to prostaphopain B). Eluted protein was then bound to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 200 mm NaCl in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8. Staphopain B was recovered from the column with 20 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. In some purifications, this affinity purification step was replaced with hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) running a gradient from 2 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein eluted close to the end of the gradient. Both procedures yielded sufficient amounts of enzyme for analytical work, but not enough protein for crystallization. Therefore, we settled for an inactive mutant of mature staphopain B with alanine replacing the active site cysteine. A variant of overlap PCR was used to generate the mutant open reading frame, which was subsequently cloned via EcoRI and XhoI into a derivative of pET15b (Novagen) that lacks the original EcoRI site of the vector and carries six histidines and an EcoRI site downstream of the original NcoI site. Thus, the N-terminal sequence of our construct was MGHHHHHHEFDQV..., where DQV are the first residues of the native staphopain B sequence. E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown at 37 °C and, after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, were shifted to 30 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with lysozyme and DNase I, and opened by sonication as usual. After centrifugation (40,000 rpm, 30 min) to remove insoluble debris, supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with 10 mm imidazole in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) and eluted with 30 mm imidazole also in buffer A. The eluate was concentrated, mixed with a slight stoichiometric excess of inhibitor, and the mixture applied to a Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column in buffer B (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The eluate was concentrated on YM-10 Centricons to a final OD (280 nm) between 30 and 50 and used for crystallization. Analysis of Inhibitor Processing—Inhibitor processing was tested with protease preparations from both recombinant and native sources. Incubation with the protease was done in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and in the presence of 2 mm cysteine to maintain the activity of staphopain B. For MALDI-TOF 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Abz, o-aminobenzoyl; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonic acid; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; ssp, staphylococcal serine protease. traces, incubations were done at room temperature, and recombinant protease was used in 1:1 molar ratio with inhibitor. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed with a Bruker Reflex IV MALDI-TOF spectrometer equipped with delayed ion extraction working in the linear mode. All samples were prepared by the dried droplet method. Briefly, 0.5 μl of sample was mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 96% ethanol) and 0.5 μl of the mixture was deposited on a stainless steel target plate. Design and Characterization of a Synthetic Staphopain B Substrate—The fluorescence-quenched peptide Abz-Gln-Gly-Ile-Gly-Thr-Ser-Arg-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-Asp-OH was designed as a mimic of the binding loop of staphopain B and was synthesized by Auspep Pty. Ltd. (Parkville, Australia). Mass spectrometry confirmed that staphopain B cleaves the substrate into fragments Abz-Gln-Gly-Ile-Gly-OH and H2N-Thr-Ser-Arg-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-Asp-OH, as expected from the staphostatin B-staphopain B cocrystal structure. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored with a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer (model RF-5301 PC) with λex = 325 nm and λem = 414 nm. All assays to characterize the substrate were done in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm cysteine, 0.001% (w/v) CHAPS, and 5 mm EDTA. The dissociation constant Km was estimated from the dependence of the initial velocity of the reaction on substrate concentration (between 10 and 60 μm) by hyperbolic regression analysis (program Hyper, version 1.1s, 1996). The estimate of Km was ∼38 μm. For the determination of k cat/Km , staphopain B (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 nm) was added to 1 μm substrate and the fluorescence intensity (INT) was followed for 30 min (data not shown). Progress curves were fitted to the equation INT = Io + I max(1-exp(–[E] k cat/Km t)), where Io is the initial fluorescence of the uncleaved substrate, I max the maximum fluorescence intensity, and [E] is the total enzyme concentration, which describes the expected change of fluorescence over time for [S] ≪ Km. The k cat was found to be 1.7 s–1 for our buffer conditions. Analysis of Inhibitor Affinity—Analytical gel filtration runs were performed with a Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column in buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl). Quantitative assays of protease inhibitor dissociation constants were done with the synthetic substrate Abz-Gln-Gly-Ile-Gly-Thr-Ser-Arg-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-Asp-OH in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm cysteine. Assays were done in a 600-μl reaction volume with either 50 or 100 nm staphopain B and 1 μm substrate. Initial hydrolysis rate was determined as a function of inhibitor concentration (varied between 0 and 100 μm inhibitor). The ratio of vo /v of the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitor versus the initial velocity in the presence of the inhibitor is expected to depend on the apparent Ki * according to vo /v = 1 + [I]/Ki *, where Ki * is the apparent inhibitor dissociation constant and [I] the inhibitor concentration. Apparent inhibitor affinities Ki * were read from Dixon-type plots, and were essentially identical to true affinities for Ki as expected from the equation Ki * = (1 + [S]/Km)Ki and as demonstrated experimentally by a variation of substrate concentration (from 1 to 10 μm). The Ki determination would have profited from measurements at higher inhibitor concentrations for the G98R variant. Because of limited solubility of the mutant, this was unfortunately not possible. Crystallization—Initial crystallization screens were set up at room temperature (21 °C) using the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops with 0.5 ml of reservoir and a mixture of 2 μl of reservoir and protein solution each in the crystallization drop. With a reservoir solution containing 2 m (NH4)2SO4 and 5% isopropyl alcohol, initial, but intergrown crystals could be obtained. This problem was overcome with the addition of 0.4 μl of 1.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. Crystals could be grown over a period of between 1 and 2 weeks, but deteriorated within fractions of a minute upon opening the crystallization container, even without any addition of reservoir buffer. After much experimentation, we learned that after injecting buffer D (a 9:1 mixture of 2.8 m (NH4)2SO4 and (2R,3R)-(–)-2,3-butanediol) into the drop, the container could be opened safely and the crystal transferred to buffer D, which was sufficient for cryoprotection. The best specimen frozen in this way diffracted on BW6/DESY to 1.8 Å. Crystals contained two copies of the protease and the inhibitor each in the asymmetric unit and belonged to space group P212121.

Schomburg D. Hecht H.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49 (102): 102Crossref Google Scholar) that allowed us to construct a homology model for staphopain B with all non-conserved side chains mutated to alanine using SCWRL (25Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). With this search model, an automated MOLREP (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) run searching for two copies of our homology model identified a clear solution. Further MOL-REP searches for the inhibitor molecules were unsuccessful, but FFFEAR (27Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) searches in maps generated with phases from the two placed protease molecules correctly located one of the two inhibitor molecules, which could easily be associated with a particular copy of the protease in our crystals. Application of the local symmetry between the two copies of protease in the asymmetric unit then identified the second copy of inhibitor. At the time the structure was solved the high resolution synchrotron dataset was not available. Once this dataset became available, we repeated the structure solution starting from the two placed copies of protease. Automatic ARP/WARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) model building produced a largely complete main chain trace for both copies of inhibitor in the asymmetric unit, thus providing another independent conformation for the staphostatin B fold. Data collection and refinement parameters are presented in Table I. Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Determination—Staphostatin B was expressed and purified as previously described (20Rzychon M. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Potempa J. Dubin A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several attempts to heterologously express recombinant mature staphopain B in E. coli failed, presumably because of toxicity of the active protein to its host. We therefore settled for an inactive mutant of the protease with alanine replacing the active site cysteine. This inactive form of staphopain B could be expressed in E. coli in quantity, and a version with the N-terminal His tag could be purified in good yield (see “Experimental Procedures”). Gratifyingly, comigration of inactive protease and inhibitor both in native gels and on gel filtration columns confirmed that the mutant form of the protease had retained the strong affinity of the wild-type for its inhibitor. We thus proceeded to crystallize the complex from stoichiometric mixtures of protease and inhibitor. Crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å on BW6/DESY. The structure was easily solved with models of the components as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, we used molecular replacement to locate two copies of the homology model of staphopain B that were based on the published structure of mature staphopain A (21Hofmann B. Schomburg D. Hecht H.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49 (102): 102Crossref Google Scholar). Maps phased with this partial model were of sufficient quality to locate the two copies of inhibitor in two independent ways. The extent of protein-protein contacts leaves no doubts as to which inhibitor molecule should be assigned to which protease molecule. Although located in different environments, the two complexes in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical. A summary of data collection and refinement parameters is presented in Table I. The Structure of Staphopain B—As expected from the high sequence identity between staphopains A and B, the structure of staphopain B is in excellent agreement with the homology model that could be produced on the basis of the staphopain A structure (21Hofmann B. Schomburg D. Hecht H.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49 (102): 102Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, like all proteases that belong to the papain clan of cysteine proteases, staphopain B consists of two domains, which are generally referred to as the L- and R-domain according to their orientation left and right of the active site cleft in the “standard view” for this superfamily of proteases (29McGrath M.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 181-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). As in other superfamily members, the L-domain is built from the N-terminal part of the sequence with the exception of the most N-terminal residues, and contains the active site helix that carries the nucleophilic cysteine at its amino terminus. In staphopains, the L-domain is more compact than in other papain-like enzymes. In essence, it only contains one additional helix and the linker that connects it to the R-domain. The R-domain contributes the catalytic histidine and asparagine and is built around a six-stranded, antiparallel pseudobarrel. We consider the barrel “pseudo,” because the two strands formed from residues Ser-367 to Asp-370 and from residues Leu-375 to Leu-378 are too far apart to be linked by main chain hydrogen bonds. The barrel is significantly different from the barrel in all other papain-like proteases, including cathepsin B, by far the closest staphopain relative (see Fig. 1). One hairpin that contributes two strands to the staphopain barrel is so far unique to staphopains, and a second hairpin loop is significantly shorter and does not bend backwards as in all other papain-like enzymes. The Staphostatin B-Staphopain B Interface—In standard orientation staphostatin B binds to the “top” of staphopain (see Fig. 2A), roughly interacting with the analogous segments of protease that are also used for contacts with either cystatins (30Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2B) or the globular domains of profragments (31Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 32Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (not shown). Nevertheless, because the staphostatin, cystatin, and profragment folds are unrelated, the details of the staphostatin B-staphopain B interaction are without precedence in protease-inhibitor complexes so far. The interaction of staphopain B with staphostatin B buries a total surface area of about 2300 Å2 and involves contacts of the inhibitor with the L- and R-domains and the active site cleft of protease. Excluding contacts of the active site spanning residues with protease, there are few specific contacts of the inhibitor with the L-domain. An array of ordered water molecules is located at the interface between protease and inhibitor in both copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit of our crystals. In at least one copy of the complex, there is some additional, as yet unidentified density possibly representing a component of the buffer, and in one copy of the complex, Asp-239 of protease forms a salt bridge with Lys-38 of inhibitor. The R-domain of protease makes only contacts with residues in the C-terminal half of the inhibitor sequence. Once more excluding contacts to the active site spanning residues of inhibitor, all contacts are contributed by residues that are located in two loops of the six-stranded pseudobarrel of protease. Interestingly, these are the two loops that are specific for staphopains in the papain superfamily (see Fig. 2). We therefore expect that the contacts of inhibitor with R-domain contribute significantly to the specificity of staphostatins for staphopains. In particular, the salt bridge of Lys-66 of inhibitor with Asp-335 of protease and the salt bridge between Asp-80 of inhibitor and Arg-382 of protease appear favorable. Staphostatins Bind Similar to Substrates—The most prominent interactions between staphostatin B and staphopain B are mediated through loop residues 97 to 101 of inhibitor that span the active site of protease in the forward direction (see Fig. 2A). In analogy to “standard mechanism” inhibitors of serine proteases, we call this loop of inhibitor “the binding loop.” The binding loop is very well ordered in the staphostatin B-staphopain B complex, and its conformation is essentially identical in both copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit. Interestingly, this conformation does not appear to be preformed in free staphostatin B, because both copies of inhibitor in crystals of staphostatin B alone (22Rzychon M. Filipek R. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Dubin A. Potempa J. Bochtler M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) are significantly different (see Fig. 3A). Although the binding loop is of course not cleaved by the inactive alanine mutant of protease in our crystals, the interaction with protease is best described in terms of Berger and Schechter's nomenclature (33Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) for the interaction between substrates and their target proteases. 3This nomenclature describes residues of a protease substrate according to their distance to the scissile peptide bond. Residues on the N-terminal side are called P1, P2, P3, etc., with P1 closest to the scissile bond. Residues on the C-terminal side are referred to as P1′, P2′, P3′, etc. The corresponding binding sites for these residues in the protease active site cleft are called S1, S2, S3, etc., and S1′, S2′ and S3′, etc., respectively. Residues P2 to P3′ of the binding loop are in contact with protease (see Fig. 3B). The P2 residue in staphostatin B is Ile-97. Its carbonyl oxygen and amide are engaged in hydrogen bonds with Thr-284 of protease, and the side chain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket lined by residues Pro-286, Met-289, Leu-325, Ala-341, and Tyr-387 (S2 pocket not shown in Fig. 3B). The isoleucine side chain does not seem to fill the pocket entirely, and leucine could fit as well. As the P2 residue in staphostatin A is leucine, we suspect that the extraordinary specificity of staphostatins for the proteases in their own operon is probably not because of S2-P2 interactions. The P1 residue is Gly-98, a conserved glycine in all known staphostatin sequences. With Ramachandran angles (φ,ψ) ∼ (145°, 120°), this residue has a strained backbone conformation that would be sterically forbidden for any other residue (and lead to a close contact of the Cβ with Ser-241O of protease). It appears that this conformation is mainly fixed through hydrogen bonds, although in part indirectly. Gly-98NH donates a hydrogen bond to Gly-339O and may rece"

However, it remains unknown whether other co-repressor(s) are also involved with Ski in the negative regulation of the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways. Here, we report that the co-repressor homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) directly binds to both c-Ski and Smad1. HIPK2 efficiently inhibited Smad1/4-induced transcription from the Smad site-containing promoter. A dominant negative form of HIPK2, in which the ATP binding motif in the kinase domain and the putative phosphorylation sites were mutated, enhanced Smad1/4-dependent transcription and the BMP-induced expression of alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, the c-Ski-induced inhibition of the Smad1/4-dependent transcription was suppressed by a dominant negative form of HIPK2. The HIPK2 co-repressor activity may be regulated by an uncharacterized HIPK2 kinase. These results indicate that HIPK2, together with c-Ski, plays an important role in the negative regulation of BMP-induced transcriptional activation.

These results indicate that HIPK2, together with c-Ski, plays an important role in the negative regulation of BMP-induced transcriptional activation. Transcriptional regulation in a variety of signaling pathways is regulated through the combined actions of many repressors and co-repressors. The products (c-Ski and Sno) encoded by the c-ski gene (1Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and another member of the ski gene family, the sno (ski-related novel gene) gene (2Nomura N. Sasamoto S. Ishii S. Date T. Matsui M. Ishizaki Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5489-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), act as co-repressors and directly bind to two additional co-repressors N-CoR/SMRT and mSin3A, via their N-terminal cysteine-rich regions and C-terminal coiled-coil regions, respectively (3Nomura T.

N-CoR and SMRT, which share significant homology, were originally identified as co-repressors that mediate transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors (4Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M.

Although these three co-repressors (N-CoR/SMRT, mSin3, and c-Ski/Sno) are not involved in the single macromolecular complex, they are needed for the transcriptional repression mediated by nuclear hormone receptors, Mad, and possibly other repressors (3Nomura T.

In fact, c-Ski and Sno were demonstrated to be required for the transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor Rb (18Tokitou F. Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Yasukawa T. Kohno I. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4485-4488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In addition to N-CoR/SMRT, mSin3, and c-Ski/Sno, multiple other co-repressors have been identified recently. One of them is homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HIPK2), which was originally identified as the protein bound to the homeodomain protein NK-3 (19Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NK-3 belongs to the NK-2 family of proteins, which includes a large number of vertebrate homeodomain transcription factors that have important functions during embryonic development and organogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 20Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). HIPK2 directly binds to another co-repressor, Groucho, and also to HDAC1 (21Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated whether HIPK2 can interact with other co-repressors, including c-Ski/Sno. The unique characteristic of HIPK2 is the possession of a kinase activity that is essential for mediating the NK-3-dependent transcriptional repression (19Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). HIPK2 localizes to nuclear speckles, and SUMO-1 modification of HIPK2 is required for this localization (22Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).By recruiting the HDAC complex, c-Ski/Sno not only mediate the transcriptional silencing induced by various repressors, but also negatively regulate the transcriptional activation induced by Smad proteins (23Sun Y Liu X.

Members of the Smad group of proteins act as transcriptional activators and mediate TGF-β, BMP, and activin signaling from receptors to nuclei (for review see Refs. 27Massague J. Wotton D.

In contrast, in the report by Wang et al. (46Wang W. Mariani F.V. Harland R.M. Luo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14394-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), a direct interaction between Ski and Smad1 was detected, and Ski antagonized the BMP signaling in Xenopus explants. One possibility is that this discrepancy is because of uncharacterized factors that could be also required for the Ski-mediated inhibition of the BMP-induced transcription.Here we have found that HIPK2 binds directly to both c-Ski and Smad1 and plays an important role in negatively regulating the Smad1/4-induced transcriptional activation in BMP signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSGST Pull-down Assays—The GST-c-Ski, GST-Smad3, and GST-Smad4 fusion proteins, which contain the full-length human c-Ski, the full-length human Smad3, and the full-length Smad4, respectively, were described previously (3Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 47Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The plasmids for the expression of GST-Smad1 and GST-Smad2, which contain the full-length human Smad1 and Smad2, were constructed using the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids to express the GST-HIPK2-ID, GST-Smad1CT, GST-Smad1NT1, and GST-Smad1NT2 fusion proteins, which contained the homeodomain interaction domain of HIPK2 (amino acids 539-844), the N-terminal 320 amino acids of Smad1, the C-terminal 257 amino acids of Smad1, and the C-terminal 149 amino acids of Smad1, respectively, were also generated using the pGEX vector. Approximately 15 μg of the GST fusion protein were used per assay. For the in vitro translation of HIPK2 and c-Ski, various cDNA fragments were cloned into the pSPUTK vector (Stratagene) containing the SP6 promoter and the Xenopus β-globin 5′-untranslated region. For the binding between HIPK2 and GST-Smad1-4, Binding Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% skim milk, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) was used. For the binding between c-Ski and GST-HIPK2-ID, Binding Buffer A lacking salt was used. The washing buffer was the same as Binding Buffer A, but it contained no skim milk.Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), 293T cells were transfected with the FLAG-HIPK2 expression plasmid (4 μg) and the c-Ski expression plasmid (4 μg) with or without the plasmid (1 μg) expressing the constitutively active form of the BMP type IA receptor (ALK3QD). The chicken cytoplasmic β-actin promoter was used for expression of FLAG-HIPK2 and c-Ski, whereas the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter was used to express ALK3QD. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were disrupted by incubation with Lysis Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) containing 250 mm NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C, and the lysates were prepared by centrifugation. After decreasing the NaCl concentration to 125 mm by the addition of lysis buffer lacking NaCl, immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) or with mouse normal IgG. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibodies and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).To examine the co-immunoprecipitation of HIPK2 with Smad1/4, 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of the FLAG-HIPK2 expression plasmid (4 μg), the Myc-Smad1 expression plasmid (2 μg), and the HA-Smad4 expression plasmid (2 μg) together with or without the ALK3QD expression plasmid (0.5 μg). To express Myc-Smad1 and HA-Smad4, the chicken cytoplasmic β-action promoter was used. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described above except for the use of LSLD buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20% glycerol) (48Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) instead of Lysis Buffer A. Anti-Myc and anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, respectively.For two-step co-immunoprecipitation, three dishes of 293T cells (7 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with mixture of the plasmids to express FLAG-HIPK2 (1.4 μg), Myc-Smad1 (1.57 μg), HA-Smad4 (1.43 μg), and Ski (1.6 μg) using LipofectAMINE Plus. For the control of 1st immunoprecipitation, the plasmid to express HIPK2 lacking tag was used. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were lysed with LSLD buffer, sonicated briefly, and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (100 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with Lysis Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl three times, and the FLAG-linked protein complex was eluted with 300 μl of Lysis Buffer A containing 250 mm NaCl and 3× FLAG peptide (300 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Second immunoprecipitation was performed using 150 μl of eluate and 350 μl of Lysis Buffer A containing 464 mm NaCl and 0.8 μg of anti-Ski (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or control IgG followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose.To examine the co-immunoprecipitation of c-Ski and endogenous Smad1 and HIPK2, 293T cells were co-transfected with the plasmids that express c-Ski (16 μg) and ALK3QD (6 μg). Co-immunoprecipitation of c-Ski and endogenous Smad1 was performed as described above except for the use of Lysis Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Anti-Smad1/5/8 antibody (N-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-c-Ski rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-329; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, respectively. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous HIPK2 and endogenous Smad1, Lysis Buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), anti-HIPK2 goat polyclonal antibody (C-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for immunoprecipitation, and anti-Smad1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate) for Western blotting were used. For co-immunoprecipitation of c-Ski and endogenous HIPK2, Lysis Buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), anti-HIPK2 goat polyclonal antibody (C-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for immunoprecipitation, and anti-c-Ski rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-329; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for Western blotting were used.Subcellular Localization of HIPK2, c-Ski, and Smad1—CV-1 cells (2 × 105 cells/6-cm dish) were transfected with the FLAG-HIPK2 expression plasmid (1.5 μg) and the c-Ski expression plasmid (1.5 μg). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation in the blocking solution, the cells were incubated with an anti-HIPK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody, which was raised against GST-HIPK2-SmaI containing the region between amino acids 860 and 1141 of HIPK2, and anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibodies, followed by incubation with FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM510; Zeiss). To investigate the co-localization of HIPK2 and Smad1, CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of the FLAG-HIPK2 expression plasmid (1.5 μg), the Myc-Smad1 expression plasmid (0.75 μg), and the Smad4 expression plasmid with or without the ALK3QD expression plasmid (0.5 μg). Immunostaining was performed similarly to that described above using an anti-HIPK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).Luciferase Reporter Assays—In the experiments using the (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc reporter, C2C12 cells (2 × 105 cells/6-cm dish) were transfected with a mixture containing the (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc reporter plasmid (0.5 μg), the ALK3QD expression plasmid (0.8 μg), the plasmids to express various effector proteins described below, and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) (0.2 μg), in which the thymidine kinase core promoter was linked to the Renilla luciferase gene. The effector plasmids to express Smad1, Smad4, c-Ski, and the wild-type and mutant forms of HIPK2 (each 0.5 μg) were used for the co-transfection assays. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3.5 μg by the addition of control plasmid lacking the cDNA to be expressed. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega).In the experiments using the 12xGCCG-Luc reporter, a mixture of 12xGCCG-Luc (40 ng), pRL-CMV (2.5 ng), pcDNA3-Smad1, and pcDNA3-Smad4 (40 ng), pact-Ski (10 ng), and pact-HIPK2 (80 ng) and with or without pcDNA3-ALK3-QD (60 ng) was transfected into C2C12 cells (1.7 × 104/well in 24-well plate) using LipofectAMINE Plus. The cells were incubated for 36-40 h, and firefly luciferase activity was measured, together with Renilla luciferase activity (for an internal control), using a dual luciferase assay system.Effect of Dominant Negative Form of HIPK2 on the BMP-induced Expression of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)—The retroviral expression plasmid for the FLAG-tagged dominant negative form of HIPK2 (FLAG-HIPK2-K221R-STY) was constructed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus vector pDON-AI (Takara). To generate C2C12 cell pools that express FLAG-HIPK2-K221R-STY, together with the neomycin-resistance gene, C2C12 cells were infected with viruses and then grown in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml). To examine the effects of BMP-2 on muscle and osteoblast differentiation, C2C12 cells were inoculated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2. After an overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and various concentration of BMP-2 and then the cells were cultured for an additional 3 days. Cell lysates were prepared using ALP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), and ALP activity was then determined essentially as described previously by Katagiri et al. (49Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). ALP activity in the lysate was measured at 37 °C in a buffer containing 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma) and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 10.5, for 30 min using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate. The enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of p-nitrophenol produced per min per mg of protein. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad).RESULTSHIPK2 Directly Binds to c-Ski in Vitro—During the search for various c-Ski-interacting proteins, we found that HIPK2 binds directly to c-Ski. The wild-type HIPK2 protein translated in vitro efficiently bound to the GST-c-Ski fusion protein in a pull-down assay (Fig. 1). The HIPK2 protein contains, from the N terminus, the kinase domain, the homeodomain protein-interacting domain, the PEST domain, which is thought to regulate protein stability, and the tyrosine- and histidine-rich domain (Fig. 1A, top). The HIPK2 mutant lacking the homeodomain protein-interacting domain did not bind to c-Ski, whereas the HIPK2 fragment containing only the homeodomain protein-interacting domain (amino acids 539-844) efficiently interacted with c-Ski. Thus, the region containing the homeodomain protein-interacting domain of HIPK2 binds directly to c-Ski.To identify the specific region in the c-Ski protein that interacts with HIPK2, we next performed similar GST pull-down assays using various forms of c-Ski translated in vitro and the GST-HIPK2 fusion protein containing the homeodomain protein-interacting domain (Fig. 2, A and B). The results indicated that the two regions in the c-Ski protein bind to HIPK2, the C-terminal coiled-coil region (amino acids 556-728) and the region overlapping the cysteine-rich N-CoR binding domain (amino acids 197-330).Fig. 2The two regions in c-Ski protein interact with HIPK2. A, schematic representation of the c-Ski proteins used. The domain structure of c-Ski is shown on the top. The results of binding assays shown in C are indicated on the right. The relative binding activities are designated ++, +, and -, which indicate the binding of 12-17, 2.5-7, and less than 1% of the input proteins, respectively. WT, wild-type.

The GST-HIPK2 fusion proteins containing the c-Ski binding domain (amino acids 539-844) that were bound by the glutathione-Sepharose resin were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. C, various forms of in vitro translated 35S-c-Ski was mixed with the GST-HIPK2 resin. The bound proteins were analyzed on 10% (left panel) or 15% (right panel) SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. In input lanes, the amount of c-Ski was 10% of that used for the binding assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vivo Interaction between HIPK2 and c-Ski—The in vivo interaction between HIPK2 and c-Ski was investigated wi"
https://openalex.org/W2068513032,"In Na,K-ATPase membrane preparations from shark rectal glands, we have previously identified an FXYD domain-containing protein, phospholemman-like protein from shark, PLMS. This protein was shown to associate and modulate shark Na,K-ATPase activity in vitro. Here we describe the complete coding sequence, expression, and cellular localization of PLMS in the rectal gland of the shark Squalus acanthias. The mature protein contained 74 amino acids, including the N-terminal FXYD motif and a C-terminal protein kinase multisite phosphorylation motif. The sequence is preceded by a 20 amino acid candidate cleavable signal sequence. Immunogold labeling of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit and PLMS showed the presence of α and PLMS in the basolateral membranes of the rectal gland cells and suggested their partial colocalization. Furthermore, through controlled proteolysis, the C terminus of PLMS containing the protein kinase phosphorylation domain can be specifically cleaved. Removal of this domain resulted in stimulation of maximal Na,K-ATPase activity, as well as several partial reactions. Both the E 1∼P → E 2-P reaction, which is partially rate-limiting in shark, and the K+ deocclusion reaction, E 2(K) → E 1, are accelerated. The latter may explain the finding that the apparent Na+ affinity was increased by the specific C-terminal PLMS truncation. Thus, these data are consistent with a model where interaction of the phosphorylation domain of PLMS with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit is important for the modulation of shark Na,K-ATPase activity. In Na,K-ATPase membrane preparations from shark rectal glands, we have previously identified an FXYD domain-containing protein, phospholemman-like protein from shark, PLMS.

Thus, these data are consistent with a model where interaction of the phosphorylation domain of PLMS with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit is important for the modulation of shark Na,K-ATPase activity. The Na,K-ATPase is the enzyme responsible for active transport of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membranes of animal cells (for recent review, see Ref. 1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). It establishes and maintains the electrochemical gradients for Na+ and K+ responsible for generation of a resting membrane potential necessary for excitability of muscle and nerve cells, co- and counter-transport of ions and nutrient molecules across the cell membrane, as well as the regulation of cell volume. The enzyme is composed of two essential subunits; a catalytic α-subunit, which undergoes conformational changes that couple ATP hydrolysis to ion transport, and the heavily glycosylated β-subunit responsible for maturation, assembly, and membrane targeting of the enzyme. Different isoforms of the α- and β-subunit have been identified, and these have unique kinetic properties and tissue distributions. As a housekeeping enzyme the regulation of the Na,K-ATPase is very complex and occurs at many different levels, including both rapid (short term) and sustained (long term) hormonal control. Recently, considerable interest have been directed at studying the role of protein-protein interactions in the acute hormonal regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity. Indeed, regulation of transport ATPases by interaction with small regulatory proteins is a well known mechanism to achieve modulation of ATPase activity in vivo (for review see Ref. 2Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. Christensen H.R.Z. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2001; 33: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

The small protein called the γ-subunit is the first example of a small single transmembrane protein interacting with and regulating Na,K-ATPase (8Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The γ-subunit has been shown to modulate Na,K-ATPase activity in the kidney by affecting the E 2/E 1 equilibrium toward E 1, thus regulating the affinity for ATP at its low affinity site and the cytoplasmic Na+ and K+ competition (11Pu H.X.

The γ-subunit has a highly distinct distribution along different parts of the nephron allowing differential regulation of ion transport along different nephron segments (12Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The γ-subunit is a member of a family of small hydrophobic proteins, now termed the FXYD domain-containing protein family (13Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This family includes phospholemman (PLM or FXYD1) (14Palmer C.J. Scott D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the γ-subunit (FXYD2) (15Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), mammary tumor protein of 8-kDa molecular mass (MAT-8 or FXYD3) (16Morrison B.W. Moorman J.R. Kowdley G.C. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), channel-inducing factor (CHIF or FXYD4) (17Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), related to ion channel (RIC or FYXD5) (18Fu X. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), as well as FXYD6 and FXYD7. Until recently the physiological functions of the FXYD proteins (except FXYD2) were unknown. However, it has now become evident that they are tissue-specific regulators of ion transporters (see recent reviews, Refs. 19Crambert, G., and Geering, K. (2003) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/166/re1.Google Scholar and 20Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News. Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). Originally, this idea was substantiated by the identification of a PLM homologue (phospholemman-like protein from shark, PLMS) that was shown to specifically interact with and modulate Na,K-ATPase in the shark rectal gland (21Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations by Crambert et al. (22Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), who used a co-expression system to study the effects of mammalian FXYD1 on Na,K-ATPase activity, indicated that PLM interacts with and regulates Na,K-ATPase isoforms. Indeed, both FXYD 4 (CHIF) and FXYD7 have been recently reported to be tissue-specific regulators of Na,K-ATPase (23Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.D. Gerring K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems conceivable that most, if not all, members of the FXYD protein family are tissue-specific regulators of Na,K-ATPase. The regulatory interaction of Na,K-ATPase with FXYD proteins seems to play an important role in cellular physiology and pathophysiology. For instance, the physiological relevance of the γ-subunit has recently been substantiated by identification of a point mutation of a glycine residue, which is highly conserved among all FXYD proteins, which correlates with a renal magnesium deficiency (25Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, phenotypic analysis of CHIF knockout mice indicated that CHIF plays a vital role in the tolerance to high K+ loading (26Aizman R. Asher C. Fuzesi M. Latter H. Lonai P. Karlish S.J.D. Garty H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F569-F577Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, characterization and localization of FXYD proteins in different tissues represents an important aim in identifying regulatory mechanisms of ion transport under physiological and pathophysiological states. Little is known about the three-dimensional functional interactions leading to regulation of the Na,K-ATPase by FXYD proteins. Spatial localization of the γ-subunit has been indirectly inferred from cryo-electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals (27Hebert H. Purhonen P. Vorum H. Thomsen K. Maunsbach A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or from thermal denaturation experiments (28Donnet C. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They seem to indicate that the γ-subunit is associated with the C terminus of the α-subunit being located either between the M2/M9 or the M9/M10 transmembrane segments. Recently, the kinetic effects of γ on Na,K-ATPase were allocated to distinct domains within the γ-subunit (29Pu X.P. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, mutagenesis studies of both the γ-subunit and CHIF indicated that the FXYD motif was important for long term and stable association with the α-subunit, whereas the basic residues located at the C terminus of CHIF are not necessary for association but are important determinants for the functional effects of CHIF on Na,K-ATPase (23Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.D. Gerring K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that residues in the transmembrane segment of γ and CHIF are important for their association with and regulation of the Na,K-ATPase (30Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PLM and its homologue PLMS are the only members of the FXYD family known to be phosphorylated by protein kinases. The C terminus of PLMS is heavily phosphorylated by PKC (21Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as is the case for PLM (14Palmer C.J. Scott D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that dephosphorylated PLMS associated more strongly with the α-subunit than PKC-phosphorylated PLMS (21Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction between PLMS and the shark α-subunit could be controlled by protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation reactions in a similar way to that proposed for the phospholamban (PLN) regulation of the Ca-ATPase in cardiac tissue in response to hormonal stimulation (3Kimura Y.

Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PLMS, or disruption of interactions within the transmembrane domain by treatment with non-solubilizing concentrations of the non-ionic detergent C12E8 have been shown to result in activation of the shark Na,K-ATPase by relieving the inhibitory effect of PLMS (21Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This again emphasizes the implication of multiple domain interaction between FXYD regulatory proteins and Na,K-ATPase, as is the case for PLN regulation of Ca-ATPase. In the present study we aim to further characterize the molecular interactions that result in the regulation of shark Na,K-ATPase by PLMS. To begin this, we have first cloned PLMS and determined its primary amino acid sequence from cDNA. In addition, we have characterized the cellular distribution of both PLMS and the α-subunit in rectal gland cells using immunocytochemical methods. Finally, through controlled proteolysis we have been able to preferentially cleave a 5-kDa fragment from the C terminus of PLMS, which contains the protein kinase phosphorylation sites. Using this approach, we have characterized the functional effects of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of PLMS and shark Na,K-ATPase. Some results of this study have been previously reported (31Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 986: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted using a modification of the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) as described previously (33Cutler C.P. Brezillon S. Bekir S. Sanders I.L. Hazon N. Cramb G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R222-R229Google Scholar). In brief, tissues were collected and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen before transfer and storage at –80 °C. The tissue was pulverized using a mortar and pestle and then homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% (v/v) Sarkosyl, and 90 mm 2-mercaptoethanol using a Polytron PT 10 homogenizer (Kinematica Ltd.) set at position 5, for 2 × 20–30 s. Following homogenization, total RNA was extracted by the sequential addition of 0.1 volume of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.5 volume of water-saturated phenol, and finally 0.2 volume of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane. Tubes were vortexed briefly between the additions of each solution and then centrifuged at 3900 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman J6-MC centrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc.). The upper aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a fresh tube, and then 2.5 volumes of 2-propanol and 0.2 volume of 1.2 m NaCl, 0.8 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0, was added sequentially with vortexing. The resulting solution was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, before centrifugation at 3900 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was washed twice in 80% ethanol before drying under vacuum at room temperature for 5 min. After resuspension of the pellet in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated Milli-Q water, diluted samples (1:100) were prepared and the absorbance measured at 260 and 280 nm (Philips PU 8620 spectrophotometer) to estimate both the concentration and purity of the RNA samples. RNA samples from each extract were also run on denaturing formaldehyde gels and stained with ethidium bromide (as detailed below) to ensure that no degradation of the RNA had occurred. Cloning and Sequencing—First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out in a total reaction volume of 20 μl containing 5 μg of total rectal gland RNA, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 μm oligo(dT)12–18, 1 mm each of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs; dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP), and 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The reaction was incubated at 45 °C for 2 h and then stored frozen at –20 °C for use in PCR. This single strand cDNA template was used for the amplification and isolation of the initial 203-bp fragment with the sequences further 5′ or 3′ to this subsequently obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the Marathon RACE kit (Clontech, Basingstoke, UK) as described previously (33Cutler C.P. Brezillon S. Bekir S. Sanders I.L. Hazon N. Cramb G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R222-R229Google Scholar). All PCR reactions were carried out using 0.5 μl of cDNA template in a total volume of 20 μl, comprising 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 4 pmol each of sense and antisense primers, and 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (BioGene Ltd., Cambs, UK). Primers used were as follows. Initial amplifications were carried out using Squ-1 sense (CGXTTCACTTACGACTACTAC) and Squ-1 antisense (CCGCCTGCGGGTGGACAGACGGCG) primer pairs (X = any base). Subsequent nested 5′ and 3′-RACE reactions employed 5′-RACE-1 (CACACAGCACTGCGGCCAC), 5′-RACE-2 (CCACAATCAGTCCGACAACACGC), 3′-RACE-1 (GCGTGTTGTCGGACTGATTGTGG), and 3′-RACE-2 (GTGGCCGCAGTGCTGTGTG) primers in amplifications with the Marathon kit primers AP-1 (CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) and AP-2 (ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC). PCR was performed using a hot start technique with an initial 2-min incubation at 92 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final incubation of 72 °C for 10 min. DNA fragments within PCR reactions were either purified directly using an Edge Biosystems Quick-Step PCR purification kit (VH Bio Ltd., Gosforth, UK) or separated by Tris acetate-EDTA-agarose gel electrophoresis (34Sambrook J. Gething M.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 224-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and bands of interest were purified using a Gene-clean II DNA purification kit (Anachem Ltd., Luton, UK). 3′- and 5′-RACE products were produced in nested PCR reactions using Squalus PLMS-specific sense and antisense primers in conjunction with the Marathon kit nested primers AP1 and AP2. PCR fragments generated using the initial primers or by RACE amplification were blunt-ended by incubation for 15 min at 72 °C with 0.025 unit/μl Pfu DNA polymerase in 1× Pfu buffer (Stratagene) containing 0.2 mm dNTPs and then cloned into TOP10 cells using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Positive colonies were identified by colony PCR, and cDNA fragments from at least four different clones were sequenced in both directions using a Big Dye Terminator sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Biosystems, Warrington, UK) as described previously (33Cutler C.P. Brezillon S. Bekir S. Sanders I.L. Hazon N. Cramb G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R222-R229Google Scholar). Sequences were combined and analyzed using the GeneJockey II software package (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed as described previously (33Cutler C.P. Brezillon S. Bekir S. Sanders I.L. Hazon N. Cramb G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R222-R229Google Scholar). The probe used for Northern analysis was a full-length cDNA containing the complete sequence shown in Fig. 1. Total RNA (5 μg, as measured by absorbance at 260 nm) extracted from various Squalus tissues was resuspended in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) containing 12.5 m formamide and 2.2 m formaldehyde and then denatured at 65 °C for 15 min and snap-cooled on ice before adding 0.1 volume of 5% “Loading Dyes” (0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol, and 50% glycerol; all w/v). Samples (30–100 μl) were then loaded onto the agarose gel (1.2% agarose w/v (Biogene Ltd.), MOPS buffer containing 6.7% (v/v) formaldehyde) and electrophoresed at 135 V (5 V/cm) for 1.5–2 h in MOPS buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were stained for 30 min in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 5 μg/ml ethidium bromide before destaining for 1–2 h in several changes of 0.1 m ammonium acetate before viewing on a UV transilluminator. The integrity and relative amounts of RNA loaded onto each lane were qualitatively assessed by viewing the sharpness and intensity levels of ethidium bromide-stained 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands as quantified using a gel documentation and analysis system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). The staining intensities of the tissue rRNA bands were compared with a known standard, and the amount of total RNA loaded on each lane was re-determined. The separated RNAs were electroblotted overnight using TAE (40 mm Tris base, 0.35% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) as blotting buffer (25 V, 0.75 amps) onto a Zeta Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). RNA blots were prehybridized in 10 ml of UltraHyb (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) for 6 h at 47 °C and then hybridized overnight in the same solution with the 32P-labeled Squalus PLMS probe (Megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were washed sequentially at 47 °C in 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS, then 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and finally 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min before analysis of radioactive intensity by electronic autoradiography (Instant Imager, Canberra Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). The blots were finally incubated at –80 °C with x-ray film (Kodak BioMax MS) for autoradiography (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Cellular Localization of PLMS and Na,K-ATPase α-Subunit—Salt glands from two sharks were immersion-fixed for 2 h with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 150 mm NaCl, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). Small tissue blocks from the middle of the glands were cryo-protected with 2.3 m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed on thin (60–80 nm) cryosections, which were cut at –120 °C from the frozen tissue on a Reichert Ultracut S cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria). Immunolabeling and staining was performed as previously described (35Manusbach A.B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 268-275Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were first preincubated in PBS containing 0.1% skimmed milk powder and 50 mm glycine. The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-PLMS antibodies, rabbit anti-Na,K-ATPase α-subunit antibodies, or pre-immune sera diluted 1:100–1:1600 in PBS containing 0.1% skimmed milk powder. The primary antibodies were visualized using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10-nm colloidal gold particles (GAR.EM1O, Bio-Cell Research Laboratories, Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:50 in PBS with 0.1% skimmed milk powder and polyethylene glycol (5 mg/ml). The Ultrathin cryosections were stained with uranyl acetate in methylcellulose before examination in a Zeiss 912 or a Philips 208 electron microscope. Immunolabeling controls consisted of substitution of the primary antibody with rabbit pre-immune IgG or incubation without primary antibody. All controls showed absence of specific labeling. Na,K-ATPase Preparation and Hydrolytic Activity—In this study, purified Na,K-ATPase-containing membranes from the rectal gland of Squalus acanthias were used. Purification of membrane fragments was as previously described (36Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations, ranging from 3 to 5 mg/ml, were determined using Peterson's modification of the Lowry method (37Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific activity was ∼ 30 units/mg at 37 °C and 10.5 units/mg at 24 °C (1 unit = 1 μmol of Pi/min). The ATPase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 30 mm histidine, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.06% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 10 μm ATP (containing 0.03 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP), and variable concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and ATP as indicated in separate figure legends. The concentration of Pi hydrolyzed from ATP was measured as previously described (38Lindberg O. Ernster L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1956; 3: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA and PKC Phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase—PKA phosphorylation was performed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP (Tris salt) containing γ-[32P]ATP (3 μCi/pmol), 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 μg of protein, and 2 milliunits of PKA. The catalytic subunit of PKA was purchased from Sigma. PKC phosphorylation was performed in a typical assay mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 20 μm l-α-phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 10 μm dioleoyl 1, 2-sn-glycerol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 100 μm ATP (Tris-salt) containing 3 μCi/pmol γ-[32P]ATP, 4 μg of protein, and 0.13 μg of purified PKC. PKC was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and contained the Ca2+-dependent (conventional) isoforms (α, βI, βII, and γ). The phosphorylation reaction for both kinases was initiated by the addition of ATP, allowed to proceed for 30 min at 24 °C, and terminated by the addition of 16 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The phosphorylated proteins were separated using Tricine-based SDS-PAGE (3% resolution gel, 9% intermediate, and 16% resolving gels, unless indicated elsewhere). Molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). For the detection of 32P-assisted kinase phosphorylation, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and then analyzed by autoradiography overnight at –80 °C. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, then washed for 1 h with PBS buffer containing 5% Tween 20, and incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibody. The membranes were washed again with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody for 2 h. After washing, the proteins were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For the detection of the α-subunit from shark rectal gland and pig kidney, the antibody NKA1002–1016 was used (kindly provided by Jesper V. Møller, Department of Biophysics, University of Aarhus). Preparation of Trypsinized PLMS—To obtain cleavage of the C terminus of PLMS, membrane-bound enzyme was incubated with trypsin (w/w trypsin to protein 1:1000) for 0–10 min on ice in the presence of 130 mm NaCl or 20 mm KCl, plus 1 mm EDTA. The trypsinization reaction was started by the addition of trypsin and stopped by adding a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The mixtures was diluted 10-fold with imidazole buffer (25 mm) and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h. The membranes were washed with imidazole and centrifuged again, then finally suspended in a 30 mm histidine buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25% glycerol, and stored at –20 °C. All p"

Crystallographic structures show two different configurations for the binding of ubiquinone at the Q<sub>i</sub> site of mitochondrial <i>bc</i> <sub>1</sub> complexes in which histidine (His-201 in bovine sequence) is either a direct H-bond donor or separated by a bridging water. The paramagnetic properties of the SQ formed at the site provide an independent method for studying the liganding of this intermediate species. The antimycin-sensitive SQ formed at the Q<sub>i</sub> site by either equilibrium redox titration, reduction of the oxidized complex by ascorbate, or addition of decylubihydroquinone to the oxidized complex in the presence of myxothiazol all showed similar properties. The electron spin echo envelope modulation spectra in the <sup>14</sup>N region were dominated by lines with frequencies at 1.7 and 3.1 MHz. Hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy spectra showed that these were contributed by a single nitrogen. Further analysis showed that the <sup>14</sup>N nucleus was characterized by an isotropic hyperfine coupling of ∼0.8 MHz and a quadrupole coupling constant of ∼0.35 MHz. The nitrogen was identified as the N-ϵ or N-δ imidazole nitrogen of a histidine (it is likely to be His-217, or His-201 in bovine sequence). A distance of 2.5–3.1 Å for the O–N distance between the carbonyl of SQ and the nitrogen was estimated. The mechanistic significance is discussed in the context of a dynamic role for the movement of His-217 in proton transfer to the site."
https://openalex.org/W1991062983,"In mature B cells RelB-containing complexes are constitutively present in the nucleus, and they are less susceptible to inhibitory κB proteins. In most other cell types inhibitory κB proteins prevent nuclear translocation and activation of NFκB. We reasoned that this characteristic might be because of post-translational modifications of RelB. In Drosophila, signal-dependent phosphorylation of the Rel homologue Dorsal at serine 317 has been shown to be critical for nuclear import. The evolutionary conservation of this serine prompted us to analyze the function of the corresponding site in RelB. As a model system we used the murine S107 plasmacytoma cell line, which lacks endogenous RelB expression. Analysis of S107 cells expressing wild type RelB and serine 368 mutants reveals that serine 368 is not required for nuclear import but that it is critical for RelB dimerization with other members of the NFκB family. Similar effects were obtained when the conserved serine in RelA was mutated. We further demonstrate that expression of functional RelB, but not of serine 368 mutants, severely reduces p52 generation and strongly increases expression of the p52 precursor, p100. Wild type RelB, but not mutant RelB, prolonged p100 half-life. We therefore suggest an inhibitory effect of RelB on p100 processing, which is possibly regulated in a signal-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2024162443,"The reciprocal regulation of noncapacitative and capacitative (or store-operated) Ca2+ entry in nonexcitable cells (Mignen, O., Thompson, J. L., and Shuttleworth, T. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35676–35683) represents a switching between two distinct Ca2+-selective channels: the noncapacitative arachidonate-regulated Ca2+ channels (ARC channels) and the store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC channels). This switch is directly associated with the change from oscillatory to sustained Ca2+ signals as agonist concentrations increase and involves a Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the ARC channels. Here we show that this process is mediated via a calcineurin-dependent inhibition of the noncapacitative ARC channels. Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of calcineurin activity (using cyclosporin or the FK506 analogue ascomycin, and a transfected C-terminal domain of the calcineurin inhibitory protein CAIN, respectively) results in a complete reversal of the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the ARC channels. Agonist concentrations that result in oscillatory Ca2+ signals and specifically activate Ca2+ entry through the ARC channels fail to increase calcineurin activity. However, agonist concentrations that activate the store-operated Ca2+ channels and produce prolonged increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations increase calcineurin activity. Thus, calcineurin is the key mediator of the reciprocal regulation of these co-existing channels, allowing each to play a unique and non-overlapping role in Ca2+ signaling. The reciprocal regulation of noncapacitative and capacitative (or store-operated) Ca2+ entry in nonexcitable cells (Mignen, O., Thompson, J. L., and Shuttleworth, T. J. (2001) J. Biol.

A general feature of these Ca2+ signals is an enhanced entry of extracellular Ca2+. At high agonist concentrations, this entry is directly responsible for the resulting sustained, elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, and for refilling of the intracellular stores following termination of the receptor activation. However, such sustained Ca2+ signals are not thought to be the major form of Ca2+ signal under physiological conditions, at least in most cells. Instead, the oscillatory Ca2+ signals generated by low agonist concentrations are considered to be more physiologically relevant, and here the principle role of the receptor-activated entry of Ca2+ is not to directly contribute to the changes in Ca2+, but to modulate the frequency of the oscillations (3Rooney T.A.

Despite these very distinct roles in shaping the overall Ca2+ signal at different agonist concentrations, it was originally assumed that the entry of Ca2+ under both these conditions occurred via the ubiquitous capacitative or store-operated mechanism (6Putney Jr., J.W.

However in recent years evidence has accumulated indicating that, in many cell types, a novel noncapacitative pathway whose activation is dependent on arachidonic acid is responsible for the Ca2+ entry during oscillatory Ca2+ signals (8Shuttleworth T.J.

Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Only at higher agonist concentrations, when store depletion is more prolonged and profound, are the store-operated channels (e.g. CRAC channels) activated. Interestingly, it was found that the sustained elevated levels of [Ca2+] i that result from this activation of the store-operated channels act to turn-off the ARC channels (13Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific mode of Ca2+ entry is switched at different agonist concentrations between the ARC channels and the store-operated channels, a phenomenon we have described as the “reciprocal regulation” of Ca2+ entry (13Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the ARC channels that underlies this phenomenon is strictly dependent on an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ per se, occurs at cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations only slightly above resting values, and is a slow process with maximal inhibition taking up to 2 min (13Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is precisely the situation that would be generated when store-operated channels are activated following the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores by high concentrations of appropriate agonists. The result is that, despite the co-existence of these two parallel Ca2+ entry pathways in cells, they are not simply alternative, mutually redundant, routes of entry. The process of reciprocal regulation of Ca2+ entry results in the coordination of their activity in an agonist concentration-dependent manner that prevents their simultaneous activation, allowing each entry pathway to play a unique and non-overlapping role in Ca2+ signaling. Using a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches, we now demonstrate that this Ca2+-dependent effect is mediated via the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B). Moreover, we show that calcineurin is specifically activated at the agonist concentrations associated with a sustained elevated Ca2+ signal, but not during oscillatory Ca2+ signals. This activation pattern explains how the ARC channels are turned off under the conditions where the store-operated channels are activated, thereby demonstrating the critical role of calcineurin in the reciprocal regulation of Ca2+ entry. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic receptor (m3-HEK cells, generous gift from Dr. Craig Logsdon, University of Michigan) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C as previously described (9Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were carried out using the TransIT-293 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophysiological Recordings—Patch-clamp recordings of macroscopic whole-cell currents were performed using an Axopatch-1C patchclamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) as previously described (10Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The standard pipette (internal) solution contained (mm): cesium acetate 140, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1.22, EGTA 5, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2) unless otherwise specified. CaCl2 was added to this solution to achieve the desired free Ca2+ concentration as computed with Maxchelator (14Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The standard extracellular solution contained (mm): NaCl 140, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 10, CsCl 5, d-glucose 10, HEPES 10 (pH 7.4). Both MgCl2 and CaCl2 were omitted from this solution for the experiments involving divalent-free external solutions and the osmolarity (320 mOsmol/liter) was maintained with additional d-glucose. Whole-cell currents were recorded using 250 ms voltage steps to –80 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV delivered every 2 s. Current-voltage relationships were recorded either by using 150 ms voltage ramps from –100 to +30 mV, or by pulsing to a series of potentials between –100 mV and +30 mV at 10 or 20 mV intervals. No significant difference was seen in the data obtained between these two methods. Data were sampled at 20 kHz during the voltage steps and at 5.5 kHz during the voltage ramps and digitally filtered off-line at 1 kHz. Initial current-voltage relationships obtained before activation of ARC currents, were averaged and used for leak subtraction of subsequent current recordings. Changes in the external (bath) solution were by perfusion of solution through the patch-clamp chamber (rate of ∼1.5 ml/min). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Single Cell Digital Imaging Microscopy—Cells transfected with the GFP-NFAT4-n construct were visualized using a Nikon inverted epifluorescence microscope with a ×100 oil immersion objective. Illumination was via a TILL Polychrome IV monochromator and images were collected using a 12-bit interline charge coupled device camera (Sensicam), and TILL VisION software. Luciferase Assays—calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT was determined using the PathDetect system (Stratagene). This utilizes a construct consisting of the reporter gene linked to a basic promoter element (TATA box) and four tandem repeats of an NFAT-binding element. Cells were treated with the relevant concentration of agonist (carbachol) for 30 min, and activation of the transfected construct determined by luciferase assays after a further 5-h incubation using the manufacturer's instructions. As a negative control, cells were transfected with the pCIS-CK plasmid, which does not contain any cis-acting DNA elements, and were incubated and assayed in an identical way. Ca2 + -dependent Inhibition of ARC Channels Does Not Require Permeating Ca2 + Ions and Is Acutely Sensitive to Ca2 + Concentrations in the Physiological Range—As noted above this reciprocal regulation, or more specifically the inhibition of ARC channels at high agonist concentrations, is a Ca2+-dependent phenomenon. Although a Ca2+-dependent inhibition of overall channel activity is seen in several types of Ca2+ channels, including the store-operated CRAC channels (15Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), these inhibitions generally reflect an effect of the Ca2+ ions passing through the channel and interacting with a site close to the inner face of the channel pore. As such, they operate within a relatively rapid time frame, typically of less than a second, and inactivation is directly related to the amount of Ca2+ current through the channel. Such fast inactivation by permeating Ca2+ ions is not seen in currents through ARC channels (10Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Ca2+-dependent inhibition described for ARC channels is still observed in divalent-free external media, when the channels are conducting monovalent cations (13Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This feature proved useful as, in our previous studies, we were unable to fully quantify the Ca2+-dependence of the inhibition of macroscopic ARC currents in their normal Ca2+-conducting mode because of the very small current magnitudes seen at values approaching maximal inhibition (∼0.2 pA/pF). We therefore determined the relevant macroscopic currents through the ARC channels in their monovalent permeant mode in the absence of external divalent ions, where the currents are ∼40-fold larger. Although the overall Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the currents appeared similar for both Ca2+-conducting and monovalent-conducting modes, a concern was that complete removal of external divalent ions and/or the switch to the monovalent permeant mode might influence the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channels. By making further refinements to our patch-clamp setup, we have now succeeded in obtaining the full Ca2+-dependent inhibition curve for the ARC channels in their normal Ca2+-conducting state. HEK293 cells, stably transfected with the m3 muscarinic receptor (m3-HEK cells) were patch-clamped in the whole-cell configuration using internal (pipette) solutions containing buffered Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 nm. Macroscopic currents through the ARC channels were then induced by exogenous application of arachidonic acid (8 μm) and measured during 250 ms pulses to a potential of –80 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. The data obtained confirm our previous findings (Fig. 1). Increasing the internal Ca2+ concentration to values greater than 100 nm markedly reduced the magnitude of the macroscopic Ca2+ currents through the ARC channels (Fig. 1, A and C), without affecting the basic features of the current (Fig. 1B). Maximal inhibition of ∼65% was achieved at an internal Ca2+ concentration of 400 nm (Fig. 1C). An essentially identical inhibition was seen in the currents measured in divalent-free external media, when the channels are conducting monovalent cations (Fig. 1D). Clearly, as previously argued (13Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the observed inhibition is independent of Ca2+ entering through the channels or of any resulting local domain of elevated Ca2+, and instead reflects an effect of the global level of cytosolic Ca2+. Effect of Calmodulin Inhibition on the Ca2 + -dependent Inhibition of ARC Channels—We argued that the high sensitivity, yet indirect, inhibition of the ARC channels by internal Ca2+ suggested the possible involvement of calmodulin. In cells preincubated with the calmodulin inhibitor W7 (10 μm for 15–30 min), inward currents through the ARC channels measured at –80 mV with an internal Ca2+ concentration of 400 nm averaged 0.33 ± 0.04 pA/pF (n = 8), significantly larger than those seen in control cells under the same conditions (0.19 ± 0.02 pA/pF, n = 5) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, preincubation with W7 had no effect on the normal ARC currents recorded at 100 nm internal Ca2+ (0.47 ± 0.05 pA/pF versus 0.52 ± 0.04 pA/pF, n = 4 and 6, respectively). Preincubation with W7 therefore caused an ∼40% reversal of the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of ARC currents. Similar preincubation with another calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium (10 μm) increased the magnitude of the ARC currents seen at 400 nm internal Ca2+ to 0.55 ± 0.05 pA/pF, a value not significantly different from the normal currents seen at 100 nm internal Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that calmidazolium induces an essentially complete reversal of the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of ARC currents. However, it was noted that the resulting current/voltage relationship was markedly more linear than normally observed (Fig. 2B, open circles), raising concerns that calmidazolium may be inducing nonspecific effects. Nevertheless, the data did suggest a possible involvement of calmodulin in the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the ARC channels. Calcineurin and the Ca2 + -dependent Inhibition of ARC Channels; Effects of Cyclosporin A and Ascomycin—As it seemed that any effect of calmodulin was unlikely to be direct, given the slow response to elevated internal Ca2+ concentrations (13Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we considered that this may reflect a calmodulin-dependent enzymatic effect, most likely either a phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. We reasoned that a phosphorylation reaction was unlikely because our standard internal (pipette) solution contained no ATP. We therefore focused on a possible action of a calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, the most obvious candidate being the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B). Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin typically involves the use of the immunosupressants cyclosporin A (CspA) and FK506 (16Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3608) Google Scholar) which, in the presence of their corresponding intracellular immunophilins cyclophilin A and FKBP12, sterically prevent access of the substrate thereby blocking phosphatase activity (17Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. et al.Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 18Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells in CspA (1 μm for 15–30 min) increased the magnitude of the inward ARC currents seen at –80 mV with 400 nm internal Ca2+ from 0.19 ± 0.02 pA/pF (n = 5) to 0.47 ± 0.05 pA/pF (n = 6), a value not significantly different from the normal currents observed with 100 nm internal Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A and C). Examination of the macroscopic current density over the entire range of internal Ca2+ from 0 to 400 nm Ca2+ demonstrated that this effect was specific to the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the ARC channels as the currents at low internal Ca2+ (up to 100 nm) were unaffected by CspA (Fig. 3B). Similarly, preincubation of the cells with ascomycin (5 μm for 15–30 min), a close structural analog of FK506 (19Peterson L.B. Cryan J.G. Rosa R. Martin M.M. Wilusz M.B. Sinclair P.J. Wong F. Parsons J.N. O'Keefe S.J. Parsons W.H. Wyvratt M. Sigal N.H. Williamson A.R. Wiederrecht G.J. Transplantation. 1998; 65: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), also completely reversed inhibition of ARC currents observed at 400 nm Ca2+ without affecting the currents seen at 100 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). The increased current density through the ARC channels selectively observed at high internal Ca2+ concentrations (400 nm) following pretreatment with CspA or ascomycin occurred without changing the characteristic inwardly rectifying nature, and high positive reversal potential, typical of normal ARC currents (Fig. 3D). Together then, these data using two chemically unrelated immunosupressants demonstrate that the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of currents through the ARC channels is selectively reversed by inhibition of the Ca2+-CaM-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Although the above data indicate the involvement of calcineurin, this does not necessarily mean that such an action is direct. For example, it has been shown that calcineurin can activate protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) by dephosphorylation of the PP1 inhibitory peptide, inhibitor-1 (20Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) with the result that PP1 activity can be functionally partially Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent. Therefore, the observed effects of CspA or ascomycin could reflect a decrease in the calcineurin-mediated activation of PP1. To examine this possibility, we used the highly specific and potent PP1 inhibitor tautomycin (21MacKintosh C. Klumpp S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and applied it internally via the pipette to ensure that this inhibitor had ready access to the cytosol. Using this approach, inclusion of 0.1 μm tautomycin in the pipette failed to affect the magnitude of the ARC current density measured at –80 mV with 400 nm internal Ca2+ (0.16 ± 0.03 pA/pF versus 0.19 ± 0.02 pA/pF, n = 5) (Fig. 3E). We therefore conclude that a calcineurin-dependent regulation of PP1 activity is not involved in the observed effect of the immunosupressants CspA and ascomycin on currents through ARC channels at high internal Ca2+ concentrations. Calcineurin and the Ca2 + -dependent Inhibition of ARC Channels; Effects of Overexpression of CAIN—The above data rely on a strictly pharmacological approach to identify the biochemical mechanisms underlying the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of ARC the channels. Although CspA and ascomycin (or FK506) are widely used in such studies, they are known to have additional calcineurin-independent effects in various cells. Arguing against such effects are the findings that the drugs only influence the currents seen at higher Ca2+ concentrations (250 and 400 nm), and not at 100 nm Ca2+ where activation of calcineurin would be minimal. Nevertheless, we felt it was important to use a non-pharmacological approach to confirm that calcineurin was indeed involved in the responses seen. We therefore examined the effect of expressing the calcineurinbinding domain from the endogenous protein CAIN. CAIN (also known as cabin-1) is an endogenous noncompetitive inhibitor of calcineurin (22Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which binds calcineurin with high affinity (Ki of ∼ 450 nm) at a site distinct from the FK506/FKBP binding sites. Full length CAIN is a protein of ∼240 kDa, but the calcineurin binding sites lie within a C-terminal domain encompassed by residues 1881–2173. Expression of this portion alone specifically inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (22Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This C-terminal calcineurin inhibitory domain was fused with GFP to create a GFP-c-CAIN fusion construct. Individual cells transfected with this construct were selected based on the appearance of green fluorescence and their currents compared with those recorded in cells transfected with a simple GFP construct alone. The magnitude of the inward ARC currents at –80 mV with an internal Ca2+ concentration of 400 nm in the GFP-c-CAIN transfected cells averaged 0.52 ± 0.04 pA/pF (n = 4) (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). This compares with values of 0.19 ± 0.02 pA/pF (n = 5) for control cells, and 0.23 ± 0.05 pA/pF (n = 4) for cells transfected with a control GFP construct (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, currents measured with an internal Ca2+ concentration of 100 nm were unaffected by transfection of the CAIN construct. Mean values were 0.49 ± 0.004 pA/pF (n = 4) for the GFP-c-CAIN transfected cells, compared with 0.52 ± 0.04 pA/pF (n = 6) for control cells, and 0.52 ± 0.03 (n = 3) for cells transfected with the control GFP construct (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). Overall, these data indicate that cells expressing the calcineurin-binding CAIN construct showed a complete reversal of the normal Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the ARC currents. Calcineurin and the Activity of Store-operated Channels— Although we have demonstrated that inhibition of calcineurin is effective in reversing the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of currents through ARC channels, it was important to determine whether this effect was specific to these conductances. Most relevant was the question of whether calcineurin activity also influenced currents through the endogenous store-operated Ca2+-selective (SOC) currents in the m3-HEK cells (10Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These currents display most of the characteristic features of the classic CRAC channels first described in mast cells and Jurkat lymphocytes (24Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 25Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In particular, they are highly Ca2+ selective, show marked inward rectification, very positive reversal potentials, inhibition by La3+ and by 2-APB and, most importantly their activation is entirely dependent on depletion of internal Ca2+ stores (10Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of calcineurin activity on these conductances, we included adenophostin (2 μm) in the pipette solution. Previous studies have shown this high affinity agonist for the InsP3 receptor to be particularly effective at depleting agonist-sensitive internal Ca2+ stores and maximally activating store-operated conductances including CRAC (26Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Broad L.M. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32881-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Preincubation of the cells with either CspA or ascomycin (1 and 5 μm, respectively, for 15–30 min) resulted in inward currents through the SOC channels measured at –80 mV with 400 nm internal Ca2+ of 0.38 ± 0.03 pA/pF (n = 12) and 0.41 ± 0.03 (n = 5) respectively. These values indicate that the immunosupressants induced an ∼35% reduction in the currents through the SOC channels measured at 400 nm internal Ca2+. However, it is uncertain whether this reflects a calcineurin-dependent effect as a similar reduction in SOC currents was observed with 5 μm ascomycin when measured with 100 nm internal Ca2+ (0.57 ± 0.04 pA/pF, n = 7, versus 0.43 ± 0.03 pA/pF, n = 17, for controls and ascomycin-treated cells, respectively). At only 100 nm internal Ca2+, we would predict that activation of calcineurin would be minimal, suggesting that the observed effects of these drugs on currents through SOC channels are unlikely to be related to calcineurin activity. This was confirmed by experiments examining the SOC currents activated by 2 μm adenophostin in cells overexpressing the calcineurin-binding GFP-c-CAIN construct. In these, expression of the GFP-c-CAIN construct had no effect on the magnitude of the mean inward current through the SOC channels at –80 mV with an internal Ca2+ concentration of 400 nm (0.55 ± 0.04 pA/pF,"

We previously identified human GalNAc4S-6ST cDNA and showed that the recombinant GalNAc4S-6ST could transfer sulfate efficiently to the nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4) residues. We here present evidence that GalNAc4S-6ST should be involved in a unique nonreducing terminal modification of chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). From the nonreducing terminal of CS-A, a GlcA-containing oligosaccharide (Oligo I) that could serve as an acceptor for GalNAc4S-6ST was obtained after chondroitinase ACII digestion. Oligo I was found to be GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA(2SO4)-GalNAc(6SO4) because GalNAc(4SO4) and ΔHexA(2SO4)-GalNAc(6SO4) were formed after chondroitinase ABC digestion. When Oligo I was used as the acceptor for GalNAc4S-6ST, sulfate was transferred to position 6 of GalNAc(4SO4) located at the nonreducing end of Oligo I. Oligo I was much better acceptor for GalNAc4S-6ST than GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcAGalNAc(6SO4). An oligosaccharide (Oligo II) whose structure is identical to that of the sulfated Oligo I was obtained from CS-A after chondroitinase ACII digestion, indicating that the terminal modification occurs under the physiological conditions. When CS-A was incubated with [35S]PAPS and GalNAc4S-6ST and the 35S-labeled product was digested with chondroitinase ACII, a 35S-labeled trisaccharide (Oligo III) containing [35S]GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residue at the nonreducing end was obtained. Oligo III behaved identically with the sulfated Oligos I and II. These results suggest that GalNAc4S-6ST may be involved in the terminal modification of CS-A, through which a highly sulfated nonreducing terminal sequence is generated.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The resulting sulfated chains show significant structural diversity depending on the type of tissues and cells or age of the animal from which CS was extracted. Among the sulfotransferases involved in the formation of the divergent structure, sulfotransferases belonging to the chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase family (2Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y.

Uronosyl 2-O-sulfotransferase was cloned as a sulfotransferase belonging to the heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase family (10Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D.

We previously purified GalNAc4S-6ST from squid cartilage (11Ito Y. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34728-34736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and identified human GalNAc4S-6ST cDNA on the basis of amino acid sequences of the squid enzyme (12Ohtake S. Ito Y. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43894-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Unlike squid GalNAc4S-6ST, human GalNAc4S-6ST exhibited high activity toward the nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4) residue of CS. Such specificity of human GalNAc4S-6ST suggests that human GalNAc4S-6ST may be involved in the modification of the nonreducing terminal of CS. The sulfotransferase activities capable of modifying the terminal end of CS-A have been found in quail oviduct (13Nakanishi Y. Shimizu M. Otsu K. Kato S. Tsuji M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5443-5449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human serum (14Inoue H. Otsu K. Yoneda M. Kimata K. Suzuki S. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol.

It has been shown that, in CS of aggrecan obtained from various sources, GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residues are present at the nonreducing end much more abundantly than in the internal repeating units (15Otsu K.

The proportion of the nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4,6-SO4) contained in the aggrecan has been reported to decrease in osteoarthritis (19Plaas A.H.K. West L.A. Wong-Palms S. Nelson F.R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CS of thrombomodulin, which is involved in the antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant activity, has been reported to bear GalNAc(di-SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(di-SO4) at the nonreducing end (20Bourin M.C. Lundgren-Akerlund E. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15424-15431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CS may participate in the various physiological processes through the nonreducing terminal structures containing GalNAc(4,6-SO4) residues; however, the structure and biosynthesis of the nonreducing terminal regions of CS have not been fully understood. In this report, we investigated the structure of the nonreducing ends that could be sulfated by GalNAc4S-6ST and found that GalNAc4S-6ST transfers sulfate to a unique nonreducing terminal sequence, GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA(2SO4)-GalNAc(6SO4), to yield a highly sulfated structure similar to the structure found in thrombomodulin CS. Our findings suggest that GalNAc4S-6ST may be involved in the terminal modification of CS, through which a highly sulfated nonreducing terminal sequence is generated. Materials—The following commercial materials were used. H235SO4 was from Perkin-Elmer; chondroitinase ACII, chondroitinase ABC, chondro-6-sulfatase, CS-A from whale cartilage, CS-C from shark cartilage, DS form pig skin, ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-6S, ΔDi-4S, ΔDi-2S, ΔDi-diSD, and ΔDi-diSE were from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan); a Partisil-10 SAX column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) was from Whatman; a YMC-Pack Polyamine II HPLC column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) was from YMC (Tokyo, Japan); CS-A from sturgeon notochord, unlabeled PAPS, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate, N-acetylgalactosamine 4,6-bissulfate, hyaluronidase (bovine testis), β-glucuronidase (bovine liver, type B-3), and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactonic acid-1,4-lactone were from Sigma; and Hiload Superdex 30 HR 16/60 and Fast Desalting Column HR 10/10 were from Amersham Biosciences.

Disaccharide compositions of CS from various origins were determined by absorbance at 232 nm of unsaturated disaccharides separated by SAX-HPLC after chondroitinase ACII digestion.

Open table in a new tab A trisaccharide, GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4) (Tri-44), was prepared from CS-A as described (11Ito Y. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34728-34736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three tetrasaccharides, GlcAGalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4), GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc (4SO4), and GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4), were prepared from shark cartilage CS-C by digestion with hyaluronidase as described below and purified by Superdex 30 chromatography and SAX-HPLC. The digests of hyaluronidase were applied to the Superdex 30 column, and tetrasaccharide fractions were collected. The tetrasaccharide fractions were further separated with SAX-HPLC. Under the conditions described below, GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4), GlcAGalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4), and a mixture of GlcAGalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) and GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcAGalNAc(6SO4) were eluted at 36.3, 37.5, and 34.5 min, respectively. The latter two peaks were collected separately and purified with Superdex 30 chromatography. Separation of GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcAGalNAc(6SO4) and GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) could be achieved by HPLC on a YMC-Pack Polyamine II column. From these tetrasaccharides, trisaccharides GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) (Tri-46), GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4) (Tri-64), and GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) (Tri-66) were prepared by digestion with β-glucuronidase as described below. The trisaccharides were further purified with SAX-HPLC and Superdex 30 chromatography. Structure of these trisaccharides were confirmed by SAX-HPLC after chondroitinase ACII digestion (Fig. 1). The compositions determined from the elution pattern indicated in Fig. 1 are shown in Table II. The galactosamine contents of glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides were determined by the Morgan-Elson method as modified by Strominger et al. (24Strominger J.L. Park J.T. Thompson R.E. J. Biol.

Ito Y. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43894-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The purified protein was visualized with Western blot as described below before or after N-glycosidase F digestion (Fig. 2). After N-glycosidase F digestion, a single protein band was detected at the migration position of 66 kDa that agreed well with the molecular weight, 66,160, calculated from the cDNA. Western Blot Analysis—The affinity-purified GalNAc4S-6ST was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was washed with acetone and digested with recombinant N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) by the methods recommended by the manufacturer. After digestion, the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and stained with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The blot was developed with polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase using an ECL detection kit and a Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Assay of Sulfotransferase Activity—GalNAc4S-6ST activity was assayed by the method described previously (12Ohtake S. Ito Y. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43894-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 2.5 μmol of imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 μmol of CaCl2, 1 μmol of reduced glutathione, 25 nmol (as galactosamine) of CS-A or trisaccharides, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5.0 × 105 cpm), and enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. After the reaction was stopped, 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by the precipitation with ethanol followed by gel chromatography with a fast desalting column as described previously (2Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was determined. When oligosaccharides were used as acceptors, the reaction mixtures were applied directly to the Superdex 30 column as described below, and the 35S-labeled oligosaccharides were separated from 35SO4 and [35S]PAPS. Digestion with Hyaluronidase, β-Glucuronidase, Chondroitinase ACII, Chondroitinase ABC, and Chondro-6-sulfatase—Digestion with hyaluronidase was carried out for 24 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 0.7 ml, 35 mg of CS-C, 0.15 m NaCl in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Digestion with β-glucuronidase was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 200 μl, tetrasaccharide (∼1 μmol as galactosamine), 10 μmol of sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 100 nmol of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactonic acid-1,4-lactone, 4 μmol of sodium fluoride, and 18 units of β-glucuronidase. Under these conditions, removal of the nonreducing terminal GlcA was complete, and no release of inorganic sulfate was observed. Unless otherwise stated, digestion with chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC under the standard conditions was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 25 μl, 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans or 35S-labeled trisaccharides, 1.25 μmol of Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC. For degrading oligosaccharides derived from the nonreducing terminal of CS-A with chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase ACII, a strong condition was used under which digestion with chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase ACII was carried out in the reaction mixtures described above three times successively; first with 120 milliunits enzyme for 28 h, second with 100 milliunits enzyme for 18 h, and finally with 100 milliunits enzyme for 7 h. The new enzymes were added after heating the reaction mixtures at 100 °C for 1 min. Digestion with chondro-6-sulfatase under the standard conditions was carried out for 5 h at 37 °C in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 25 μl, trisaccharides or GalNAc(4,6-SO4), 1.25 μmol of Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 100 milliunits of chondro-6-sulfatase. After digestion of oligosaccharides with chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase ACII under the strong conditions, digestion with chondro-6-sulfatase was carried out twice successively in the reaction mixtures described above; first with 100 milliunits enzyme for 17 h and second with 100 milliunits enzyme for 5 h. Removal of Unsaturated Uronic Acid by Mercuric Acetate—Removal of unsaturated uronic acid was carried out as described (26Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Roden L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides containing unsaturated uronic acid were dried and dissolved in 1 ml of 35 mm mercuric acetate in 25 mm Tris with 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The reaction was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. After the reaction was over, the samples were applied to Dowex 50 (H+) column (bed volume, 1 ml). The column was washed with 3 ml of water. The flow-through fractions and the washings were combined and lyophilized. The lyophilized materials were further purified with Superdex 30 and SAX-HPLC. Identification of Uronic Acid—Glycosaminoglycans or oligosaccharides (100 nmol as galactosamine) were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. The hydrolysates were dried in a vacuum desiccator on P2O5 and NaOH. The dried materials were dissolved in distilled water and applied to a column of Dowex 50 (H+) (bed volume, 0.5 ml). The flow-through fractions were concentrated to dryness and spotted on a cellulose thin layer plate (Funakoshi, Kyoto, Japan). The plate was developed with a solvent (pyridine:ethyl acetate:acetic acid: water, 5:5:1:3) for 4 h and stained with silver nitrate. To remove 2-O-sulfate, we treated Oligo I with 0.4 m NaOH before hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (27Ishihara M. Kariya Y. Kikuchi H. Minamisawa T. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Oligo I was lyophilized in the presence of 0.4 m NaOH twice and then neutralized with acetic acid. The 2-O-desulfated products were isolated with Superdex 30 chromatography. Superdex 30 Chromatography and HPLC—A Superdex 30 16/60 column was equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and run at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected. Separation of the degradation products formed from 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans and 35S-labeled oligosaccharides were carried out by HPLC using a Whatman Partisil-10 SAX column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) equilibrated with 8 or 5 mm KH2PO4. The column was developed with gradient A (8 mm KH2PO4 for 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 8 to 720 mm KH2PO4) or gradient B (5 mm KH2PO4 for 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 5 to 500 mm KH2PO4) depending of the lot of the column; the gradient used is indicated in the legend for each figure. The fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a column temperature of 40 °C. The conditions used for HPLC using a YMC-Pack Polyamine II column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) were the same as those for SAX-HPLC, except that the column was developed with 10 mm KH2PO4 for 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 10 to 500 mm KH2PO4. Isolation of an Oligosaccharide with the Acceptor Activity for GalNAc4S-6ST from the Nonreducing Terminal of Chondroitin Sulfate—We previously showed that GalNAc4S-6ST efficiently transferred sulfate to the nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4) residue of CS-A to yield GalNAc(4,6-SO4) (12Ohtake S. Ito Y. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43894-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a highly sulfated trisaccharide bearing GalNAc(4,6-SO4) at the nonreducing end was obtained from the nonreducing terminal of thrombomodulin CS by a partial digestion with chondroitinase ABC (20Bourin M.C. Lundgren-Akerlund E. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15424-15431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GalNAc4S-6ST may possibly be involved in the synthesis of the highly sulfate trisaccharide structure from a corresponding precursor. To determine whether commercially available CS-A also contains a unique nonreducing terminal structure that could serve as the acceptor for GalNAc4S-6ST, we tried to isolate oligosaccharides from the nonreducing end of CS-A after chondroitinase ACII digestion. The strategy for detection of oligosaccharides released from the nonreducing end is based on the fact that oligosaccharides derived from the internal repeating units have unsaturated uronic acid and hence show the absorption at 232 nm, but those derived from the nonreducing end exhibit no absorption at this wavelength. Instead, oligosaccharides released from the nonreducing end of CS are able to be detected by the absorption at 210 nm. CS-A (550 μmol as galactosamine) was digested for 18.5 h at 37 °C with chondroitinase ACII in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 10 ml, 500 μmol of Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 units of chondroitinase ACII. The digest was subjected to gel filtration on Superdex 30 (Fig. 3A). Fractions containing trisaccharides to tetrasaccharides (indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 3A) were pooled and separated with SAX-HPLC (Fig. 3, B and C). When the elution profile from the SAX-HPLC detected by the absorbance at 210 nm (Fig. 3B) was compared with the elution profile detected at 232 nm (Fig. 3C), two peaks eluted around 29 and 33.5 min were found to have much higher absorption at 210 nm than at 232 nm. Of these two peaks, we analyzed the peak eluted at 33.5 min (indicated by arrowhead X in Fig. 3B), because the peak at 29 min was not obtained reproducibly. The materials eluted at 33.5 min were designated as Oligo I and were purified by the second SAX-HPLC and Superdex 30 chromatography. About 0.57 μmol (as galactosamine) of Oligo I was obtained from 550 μmol of whale cartilage CS-A. Oligo I showed absorption at 210 nm but not at 232 nm (Fig. 4, A and B). Oligo I was not degraded completely by chondroitinase ABC under the standard conditions but degraded completely under the strong conditions. When the completely degraded Oligo I was separated with SAX-HPLC, two peaks corresponding to GalNAc(4SO4) and ΔDi-diSD were detected (Fig. 4C). When Oligo I was digested with chondro-6-sulfatase after digestion with chondroitinase ABC, the second peak disappeared and shifted to the position of ΔDi-2S (Fig. 4D). These observations clearly indicate that Oligo I is a trisaccharide with three sulfate groups, GalNAc(4SO4)-HexA(2SO4)-GalNAc (6SO4). When Oligo I was digested with chondroitinase ACII under the standard conditions, no peaks corresponding to GalNAc(4SO4) and ΔDi-diSD were detected (data not shown). Even under the strong conditions, only 59% of Oligo I was degraded with chondroitinase ACII to yield GalNAc(4SO4) and ΔDi-diSD (Fig. 4E). To determine whether the observed resistance of Oligo I against chondroitinase ACII digestion might be due to the presence of IdoA in Oligo I, we analyzed the kind of HexA contained in Oligo I. Oligo I was hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h, and the hydrolysates were separated with thin layer chromatography. Under the hydrolysis conditions, GlcA was released from CS-A and Tri-44 (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4), and IdoA was released from DS (Fig. 5, lane 3). No partial degradation products were detected when DS was hydrolyzed, indicating that the α-l-iduronosyl bonds were more labile than the β-d-glucuronosyl bonds as reported previously (28Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). From the hydrolysates of Oligo I, no IdoA was detected. Instead, GlcA was clearly detected after 2-O-desulfation by the treatment with sodium hydroxide (Fig. 5, lane 6). These observations indicate that the apparent resistance of Oligo I against chondroitinase ACII is not due to the presence of IdoA residue but due to the sulfation pattern of this oligosaccharide.Fig. 5Thin layer chromatography of the hydrolysates of CS-A, DS, Tri-44, and Oligo I.

https://openalex.org/W2071253898,"Plasticity of smooth muscle α-actin gene expression in fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells is mediated by opposing effects of transcriptional activators and repressors. Among these factors, three single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, Purα, Purβ, and MSY1, have been implicated as coregulators of a cryptic 5′-enhancer module. In this study, a molecular analysis of Purβ, the least well characterized member of this group, was conducted. Southwestern and Northwestern blotting of purified Purβ deletion mutants using smooth muscle α-actin-derived probes mapped the minimal single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding domain to a conserved region spanning amino acids 37–263. Quantitative binding assays indicated that the relative affinity and specificity of Purβ for single-stranded DNA were influenced by purine/pyrimidine content; by non-conserved regions outside amino acids 37–263; and by cell-derived proteins, specifically MSY1. When overexpressed in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells, Purβ (but not Purα) inhibited transcription of a smooth muscle-specific mouse α-actin promoter transgene. Structural domains required for Purβ repressor activity included the minimal DNA-binding region and a C-terminal domain required for stabilizing high affinity protein and nucleic acid interactions. Purβ inhibitory activity in transfected A7r5 cells was potentiated by MSY1, but antagonized by serum response factor, reinforcing the idea that interplay among activators and repressors may account for phenotypic changes in smooth muscle α-actin-expressing cell types.

Arteriosclerosis is a progressive process exacerbated by vascular disease and injury in which reprogramming of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; VSM, vascular smooth muscle; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TEF-1, transcription enhancer factor-1; SRF, serum response factor; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Pur/Pyr, polypurine/polypyrimidine. and adventitial fibroblasts contribute to aberrant neointimal growth of the vessel wall (1Libby P.

In normal contractile VSMCs and injury-activated myofibroblasts, the biochemical hallmark of the differentiated phenotype is expression of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) α-actin, a cytoskeletal protein that plays an essential role in mediating both vascular and wound contraction (5Trinkle L.A.

Importantly, reduction in cellular VSM α-actin expression has been reported to coincide with a switch to a more proliferative and migratory phenotype in myofibroblasts in vitro (9Ronnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and in VSMCs in vivo (10Regan C.P. Adam P.J. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, characterization of regulatory factors that inhibit VSM α-actin gene expression in these cell types may provide insight into the molecular biology governing phenotypic modulation and may also reveal targets of opportunity in the clinical management of unrestricted arterial remodeling. The 5′-flanking region of the mouse VSM α-actin gene contains several highly conserved MCAT, CArG, and G/C-rich cis-regulatory elements that serve as binding sites for multiple positive and negative trans-acting factors present in cultured fibroblasts, undifferentiated myoblasts, and VSMCs (11Kelm Jr., R.J.

Several of these factors, Purα, Purβ, and MSY1, demonstrate preferential binding affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and appear to function as transcriptional repressors (12Carlini L.E.

Mechanistically, association of Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 with opposing stands of an asymmetric polypurine/polypyrimidine tract (PE, -195 to -165) that overlaps or is close to several core TEF-1 (MCAT, -182 to -176)-, Sp1/Sp3 (THR, -170 to -150; and TCE, -53 to -43)-, and SRF (CArG2, -120 to -111; and CArG1, -70 to -61)-binding sites has been proposed to block the enhancer activity of these composite cis-elements by limiting access of certain activators to double-stranded DNA and/or by interfering with higher order interactions among TEF-1, SRF, and Sp1/Sp3 (12Carlini L.E.

Although this hypothetical mechanism of repression is consistent with in vitro DNA binding, protein interaction, and promoter mutagenesis studies previously reported (12Carlini L.E. Getz M.J.

This is a biochemically salient point because Pur proteins have been reported to bind ssDNA as either homo- or heterodimers (11Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These issues raise an important question. Which protein(s) among Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 are the key player(s) in mediating repression of the VSM α-actin promoter in cell types associated with neointimal hyperplasia? Although the molecular properties of Purα are relatively well characterized (19Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comparable knowledge about the Purβ isoform is lacking. For example, it is unknown whether individual Pur family members, which now include Purα, Purβ, and Purγ (20Liu H. Johnson E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2417-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), are functionally redundant or distinct in terms of their ssDNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory properties. Although Purα and Purβ are 71% identical at the amino acid level, striking differences exist near the N and C termini (21Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In light of a recent report implicating Purβ and MSY1 in cardiovascular remodeling in vivo (22Subramanian S.V. Kelm R.J. Polikandriotis J.A. Orosz C.G. Strauch A.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the goal of this study was to characterize the biochemical and functional properties of Purβ in relation to its cis-element-binding partners in a well established VSMC model in vitro. Oligonucleotide and Antibody Probes—The synthetic oligonucleotide probes used in this study were derived from selected sequences present in the 5′-region (-194 to -165) and the protein-coding region (amino acids 43–53) of the mouse VSM α-actin gene (12Carlini L.E.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against specific regions of mouse Purα or Purβ have been characterized previously (11Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

The PCR products were agarose gel-purified, digested with restriction enzymes, and subcloned into pQE30 (QIAGEN Inc.) to create fusion constructs encoding His-tagged Purβ mutants with an N-terminal MRGSH6 polyhistidine epitope. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109, purified, and sequenced. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified using Ni2+-NTA spin columns (QIAGEN Inc.) as previously described (11Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

Cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter-driven expression plasmids encoding His-tagged Purβ mutants were constructed by subcloning EcoRI/SalI cDNA fragments released from pQE30 constructs into pCI (Promega). Construction of mammalian cell expression plasmids encoding full-length His or Myc epitope-tagged Purα, Purβ, MSY1, TEF-1, and SRF was described previously (12Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All plasmids used for transfection studies were purified by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Protein-ssDNA Binding—Selected ssDNA probes were immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter wells (StreptaWell, Roche Applied Science) by application of 10 nm 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide diluted in coating buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2) at 100 μl/well. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, coating buffer was removed by aspiration, and wells were rinsed twice with wash buffer (coating buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). Blocking buffer (wash buffer containing 2.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) was then applied at 300 μl/well. Blocking buffer was removed after 1 h, and wells were washed once. This was followed immediately by application (100 μl/well) of varying amounts of either AKR-2B nuclear protein (800–12.5 μg/ml) or purified recombinant Purβ (100–1.56 nm) to selected wells in duplicate. To protect against proteolysis, nuclear protein was serially diluted in ice-cold assay buffer (wash buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) just prior to application to the DNA-coated wells. In experiments conducted with AKR-2B nuclear protein, wells were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. In separate experiments conducted with purified recombinant Purβ, wells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Protein solution containing free (i.e. unbound) Purβ was removed, and wells were washed three times. Rabbit anti-mouse Purβ antibody (antibody B302–324) diluted in assay buffer minus poly(dI-dC) to 1.0 μg/ml was applied at 100 μl/well. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, primary antibody solution was removed, and wells were washed three times. Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:8000 in wash buffer was then applied at 100 μl/well. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, wells were washed four times, and 100 μl of the chromogenic horseradish peroxidase substrate ABTS® (Roche Applied Science) was applied. Absorbance measurements at 405 nm were made ∼10 min after addition of substrate using a microplate reader. In experiments conducted with AKR-2B nuclear protein, Purα was similarly detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of Purα (11Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 1 mm EDTA was used in place of 1.5 mm MgCl2 in the coating, blocking, assay, and wash buffers to assess the requirement for divalent cations in protein-DNA interaction. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assays—Rat A7r5 VSMCs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and 1.5g/liter NaHCO3 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transient transfection experiments, 1.2 × 105 cells were seeded on 60-mm plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Typically, cells were ∼40–50% confluent at the time of transfection. Cells were cotransfected with 3 μg of SMP8-CAT reporter plasmid (24Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S. Chernausek S. Witte D. LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and 3 μg of total expression plasmid using GenePORTER™ reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) at a ratio of 3 μl/μg of DNA. Control transfections were performed with pSVβ reporter plasmid. Three hours after adding DNA, the cells were fed 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 20% fetal bovine serum and then 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h later. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed using 0.5 ml of 1× CAT lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) for 30 min. Whole cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cleared extracts were stored at -80 °C. Total protein in extracts from the transfected cells was determined using the BCA dye binding assay (Sigma). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Expression of CAT and β-galactosidase reporters was quantified using commercial ELISAs (Roche Applied Science). Reporter values were normalized with respect to total cell protein. Transfections were routinely performed in triplicate or quadruplicate and repeated three to four times. Selected data sets were subjected to analysis of variance to assess statistical significance at p < 0.05. Post hoc comparisons were performed using Bonferroni's t test. Immunoblotting for Detection of Transgene Expression—Equivalent amounts of lysed cell protein was precipitated by adding a 5× volume of absolute ethanol to pooled extracts of transfected cells. Samples were incubated at -20 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Air-dried pellets were dissolved in 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample preparation buffer with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and then heated at 95 °C for 3 min. Denatured proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) minigels and then transferred to Immobilon-P™ membrane (Millipore Corp.) at 4 °C in buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 90 min at 125 V and 250 mA. Blots were blocked overnight with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk powder dissolved in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Blots were then transferred to fresh blocking buffer containing primary antibody and incubated for 2 h. Antibody RGS·His™ (QIAGEN Inc.) at 250 ng/ml was used to detect His-tagged proteins (Purα, Purβ, and Purβ mutants), whereas mouse anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 100 ng/ml was employed for detection of Myc-tagged proteins (TEF-1, MSY1, and SRF). Following primary antibody incubation, blots were washed four times with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for a total of 30 min and then incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:2000 dilution for 1 h. Blots were washed again as described above, and bands were visualized by chemiluminescent detection (ECL™ reagent, Amersham Biosciences) as directed by the manufacturer. In some cases, blots were reprobed with mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc.) to verify equivalent protein loading. BenchMark™ prestained protein markers (Invitrogen) were used to calibrate immunoblots. Other Analytical Methods—Northwestern blotting, Southwestern blotting, and colorimetric solid-phase binding assay for the detection of protein-nucleic acid interaction were performed as previously described (23Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38268-38275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mapping of the Purβ ssDNA/RNA-binding Domain—Bacterial expression plasmids encoding His-tagged N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of Purβ were constructed (Fig. 1A). Mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. As shown in Fig. 1B, deletion mutants prepared in this fashion were sufficiently pure to warrant further biochemical analysis. To identify the minimal nucleic acid-binding domain of mouse Purβ, parallel Northwestern (protein-RNA) and Southwestern (protein-DNA) blotting of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants was conducted. The ssDNA and RNA probes used in these experiments were derived from the coding region of the VSM α-actin gene as previously described (23Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38268-38275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the pattern of reactivity among the various mutants was quite similar for both probes, indicating substantial overlap in amino acid sequences that dictate ssDNA and RNA binding. With the exception of the C186 mutant (Fig. 2, lane 4), which interacts with RNA, but not with ssDNA, mutants lacking one or more of the highly conserved basic/aromatic or acidic/leucine-rich repeat nodules failed to bind the ssDNA and RNA probes. In short, the central region spanning amino acids 37–263 constitutes the minimal single-stranded nucleic acid-binding domain of Purβ.Fig. 2Minimal ssDNA/RNA-binding domain of mouse Purβ maps to amino acids 37–263. The His-tagged Purβ mutants shown in Fig. 1 were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE (250 ng/lane) on a 14% minigel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. After overnight incubation in blocking buffer, the blots were probed with 32P-endlabeled ssDNA (A) or RNA (B) sequences (∼1 nm, 106 cpm/ml) corresponding to the Pur/MSY1 exon-binding site encoding amino acids 44–53 of mouse VSM α-actin (23Kelm Jr., R.J.

A competitive assay using the purine-rich strand of the VSM α-actin polypurine/polypyrimidine (Pur/Pyr) element as a probe (biotinylated PE-F) revealed striking differences in apparent affinity for the various competitor oligonucleotides tested (Fig. 3A). Purine-rich oligonucleotides such as PE-F, CE-F, and PUR-F were more effective competitors than pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides such as CE-R and PUR-R. CE-F and CE-R correspond to the forward and reverse stands, respectively, of the Purα/β-interacting VSM α-actin exon 3 protein-coding element identified by our group (23Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K.

PUR-F and PUR-R correspond to the forward and reverse strands, respectively, of the human c-myc PUR element, one of the earliest Purα-binding sequences identified (26Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.-W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mutant oligonucleotide designated CE-Fmu2, which is completely defective in Purα/β binding when analyzed by either band shift or pulldown assay of cell extracts (21Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K.

Consistent with the results of Southwestern blotting, full-length Purβ and the N37/C263 mutant both competed for biotinylated PE-F binding to immobilized wild-type Purβ when evaluated in the quantitative colorimetric binding assay format (Fig. 3B). However, the data also clearly indicate that the N37/C263 mutant was a much less effective competitor than the full-length wild-type protein, implying a previously unrecognized role for the N and/or C terminus of Purβ in enhancing ssDNA-binding affinity by at least an order of magnitude. These results indicate that the affinity of recombinant Purβ for ssDNA varies greatly depending upon the sequence and composition of the target oligonucleotide studied and suggest that the alleged specificity for purine-rich ssDNA is not absolute, at least for the purified E. coli derived protein. Modulation of Purβ-ssDNA Binding by MSY1—To test the hypothesis that additional factors present within the eukaryotic cell might account for the remarkable specificity of fibroblast- and smooth muscle cell-derived Pur proteins for purine-rich ssDNA (12Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), binding of nuclear extract-derived Pur proteins to each strand of the Pur/Pyr element (PE-F and PE-R, respectively) was analyzed by semiquantitative ELISA. Varying amounts of AKR-2B fibroblast nuclear protein were incubated with microtiter wells coated with equimolar amounts of biotinylated PE-F or PE-R. After washing with buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, solid-phase Pur protein·ssDNA complexes were detected using rabbit antibodies that are highly specific for either Purα or Purβ (Fig. 4, circles and triangles, respectively). As expected based upon previous band supershift studies and pull-down assays (11Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38268-38275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), fibroblast-derived Purα and Purβ interacted exclusively with the purine-rich PE-F strand when assayed by ELISA (Fig. 4, compare closed and opened symbols). The pyrimidine-rich PE-R stand did not support binding of cell-derived Pur proteins in this format. The same ELISA system was next applied using purified recombinant protein in an attempt to quantify the ssDNA-binding affinity of E. coli expressed Purβ. Surprisingly, significant high affinity binding by His-tagged Purβ to both strands of the Pur/Pyr element was detected (Fig. 5A). Inclusion of Mg2+, which has been previously reported to enhance ssDNA binding by purified Purα (16Muralidharan V. Tretiakova A. Steplewski A. Haas S. Amini S. Johnson E. Khalili K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), did not alter this result (Fig. 5D), implying that the presence of other factors is likely required to impart purine-rich ssDNA-binding specificity upon Purβ. Assuming that the E. coli derived protein was not missing some critical post-translational modification essential for ssDNA-binding specificity, it was reasoned that the most likely candidate for such an effect was MSY1, given the precedent for the capacity of human YB-1 to alter the ssDNA-binding properties of human Purα in vitro (27Chen N.N.

Our current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions of NGF is in part based on the studies with PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, which differentiate into sympathetic neuron-like cells upon NGF treatment. Here we report that the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), one of the signaling molecules shared by several neuropoietic cytokines of the interleukin-6 family, is specifically up-regulated in PC12 cells following treatment with NGF. Attenuation of LIFR signaling through stable transfection of antisense- or dominant negative-LIFR constructs enhances NGF-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells. On the contrary, overexpression of LIFR retards the growth of neurites. More importantly, whereas NGF-induced Rac1 activity is enhanced in antisense-LIFR and dominant negative-LIFR expressing PC12 cells, it is reduced in LIFR expressing PC12 cells. Following combined treatment with NGF and ciliary neurotrophic factor, sympathetic neurons exhibit attenuated neurite growth and branching. On the other hand, in sympathetic neurons lacking LIFR, neurite growth and branching is enhanced when compared with wild type controls. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that LIFR expression can be specifically induced by NGF and, besides its known function in cell survival and phenotype development, activated LIFR signaling can exert negative regulatory effects on neurite extension and branching of sympathetic neurons.

NGF was originally identified based on its ability to support the survival and development of sympathetic and specific subsets of sensory neurons. Intense studies on the molecular mechanisms of NGF functions have been conducted using the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, which has been widely used as a model system to study neuronal differentiation. Upon NGF treatment, PC12 cells exhibit morphological and biochemical changes and undergo differentiation to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype. NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is characterized by the formation of filamentous actin containing spikes within minutes, followed by the extension of neurite processes with growth cone-like structures (4Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). These differentiated cells also express a wide variety of neuronal markers, including voltage-gated sodium channels, enzymes for synthesis of neurotransmitters, and components of the neuronal cytoskeleton (5Kalman D.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8971-8980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed some of the key signaling molecules, such as Erks, which are involved in the signaling cascade leading from the activation of NGF receptor to the acquisition of a neuronal phenotype (10Markus A. Patel T.D. Snider W.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms of signal transduction involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth are just beginning to be unraveled. In addition to the neurotrophins, the neuropoietic cytokines or the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family, represent another group of neurotrophic factors. Members of this family include IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1, and cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cardiotrophin-like factor complex (11Taga T.

Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These cytokines exhibit a wide range of biological functions in the regulation of various complex cellular processes such as hematopoiesis and neuronal differentiation. Whereas IL-6 and IL-11 induce homodimerization of gp130 to activate the signaling cascade, other members of the IL-6 family induce heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFR. Homodimerization of gp130 or heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFR results in the activation of receptor pre-associated Janus kinases (Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2) (15Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 16Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Activated Jaks phosphorylate the tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of gp130 and LIFR. These phosphotyrosine residues in turn act as docking sites for the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) transcription factors, such as STAT3 (17Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 651-662Crossref Scopus (2500) Google Scholar, 18Ohtani T. Ishihara K. Atsumi T. Nishida K. Kaneko Y. Miyata T. Itoh S. Narimatsu M. Maeda H. Fukada T. Itoh M. Okano H. Hibi M. Hirano T. Immunity. 2000; 12: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT3 forms a homodimer or a heterodimer with STAT1, which, upon translocation into the nucleus, regulates the expression of cytokine responsive genes. One of the distinctive features of neuronal cells is their capability to extend or retract neurites and adjust the direction of growth cone in response to environmental cues. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that neurotrophins are involved in the dynamic regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton and neuroplasticity (19Gallo G. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). NGF has been shown to collaborate with the neuropoietic cytokines, such as LIF and CNTF, to influence the differentiation program of neuronal progenitors (21Ip N.Y. Boulton T.G. Li Y. Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 443-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Verdi J.M. Ip N. Yancopoulos G.D. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These studies suggest that the neuronal differentiation program involves sequential and cooperative actions of different types of neurotrophic factors. However, how these collaborations exert effects on the process of neuronal differentiation, such as the dramatic morphological changes of neuronal cells, remains elusive. Here we report that LIFR, one of the common signaling molecules shared by several IL-6 family cytokines, is specifically up-regulated by NGF in PC12 cells. Whereas attenuation of LIFR signaling enhances neurite outgrowth, overexpression of LIFR inhibits the extension of neurites. Thus, NGF-induced LIFR signaling exerts negative regulatory effects on the neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation. More importantly, LIFR signaling modulates the activation of Rac1 during the initiation phase of neuronal differentiation, and controls the expression of some neuronal cytoskeletal protein, such as β-tubulin III. The inhibitory effects of LIFR signaling on neurite outgrowth can similarly be observed with primary cultures of sympathetic neurons upon treatment with CNTF. Moreover, developing sympathetic neurons lacking LIFR exhibit enhanced extension and branching of neurites. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the LIFR signaling induced by NGF exert negative regulatory effects on the outgrowth and branching of neurites in developing sympathetic neurons. Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (6%, v/v), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (6%, v/v), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Cells were routinely grown on 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes (Falcon) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 7.5% CO2 and medium was changed every 3 days. For NGF-induced differentiation, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/dish 1 day before treatment with the appropriate growth factors, and serum concentration was reduced to 1%. NGF (Alomone labs), EGF (gift from Prof. W. K. Wong, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), or LIF (Invitrogen) were added at the concentration of 50 ng/ml. Half of the culture medium was changed every 3 days and supplemented with additional NGF or EGF. For the studies on STAT3 phosphorylation, cells were washed twice with DMEM, and then starved in DMEM for 4 h. Rat CNTF (50 ng/ml, purified in our laboratory) or mouse LIF (50 ng/ml) were applied to the cultures for 15 min as indicated. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stable transfection, PC12 cells were incubated in the standard culture medium for 48 h after transfection and cells were passaged at 1:20 dilution followed by addition of G418 at 400 μg/ml. After a 3-week selection, single colonies were isolated and screened for the presence of appropriate constructs. Positive clones were maintained in the culture medium with G418 at 200 μg/ml. For the preparation of primary culture of sympathetic neurons, superior cervical ganglia (SCG) were dissociated from postnatal day 1 mice and cultured as described previously (24Wong V. Pearsall D. Arriaga R. Ip N.Y. Stahi N. Lindsay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 313-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with a slight modification in the medium consisting of Neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen), NGF (10 ng/ml), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Non-neuronal cells were eliminated by treatment with cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) on culture days 1 and 3. Animals—LIFR +/- mice, generated on the B6,129/J genetic background and C57BL6 STOCK (for expanding the LIFR +/- mice), were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were bred to allow for the generation of homozygote, heterozygote, and wild type littermates. The genotyping of mice carrying LIFR mutations was performed as described previously (25Ware C.B. Horowitz M.C. Renshaw B.R. Hunt J.S. Liggitt D. Koblar S.A. Gliniak B.C. McKenna H.J. Papayannopoulou T. Thoam B. Cheng L. Donovan P.J. Peschon J.J. Bartlett P.F. Willis C.R. Wright B.D. Carpenter M.K. Davison B.L. Gearing D.P. Development. 1995; 121: 1283-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were maintained at the Animal Care Facility of HKUST. SCGs were collected from E18 mice and dissociated as described above. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Full-length rat LIFR cDNA was amplified from a rat brain cDNA library and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed using a ABI310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Antisense LIFR insert was amplified using full-length rat LIFR-pcDNA3 vector as the template. 5′ primer 5′-TAGGCGGCCGCATGGGAGCTTTCTC-3′ contains a NotI site, and 3′ primer 5′-AGAGAATTCACCTCCCAGGTGGCATTG-3′ contains an EcoRI site. PCR product was digested with NotI/EcoRI restriction enzymes and then subcloned into pcDNA3 vector. For the construction of dominant negative LIFR-GFP fusion protein expression vector, cDNA sequence for the extracellular and transmembrane region of rat LIFR was amplified using full-length rat LIFR-pcDNA3 vector as the template. 5′ primer 5′-ACTGAATTCGGACAATGGGAGCTTTCTC-3′ contains an EcoRI site, and 3′ primer 5′-TCTGGATCCCGATAGCAGAGGATGC-3′ contains a BamHI site. PCR product was digested with EcoRI/BamHI restriction enzymes and subcloned into an EGFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), with the coding sequence for EGFP protein fused in-frame after the sequence for the transmembrane region of rat LIFR. Reverse-transcription PCR and Southern Blot Analysis—Total RNA of PC12 cells was extracted using acid guanidinium thiocyanate method as previously described (26Ip F.C. Fu A.K. Tsim K.W. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2393-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of cDNA, 5 μg of total RNA was mixed with 0.5 μm oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice, reverse-transcription mixture (1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units/μl Superscript II reverse-transcriptase) was added. Reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min and terminated at 70 °C for 15 min. One-tenth of the cDNA mixture was used as the template for subsequent PCR amplification. PCR primers and conditions for the amplification of gp130, LIFR, and CNTFR fragments were according to the previous report (27Zaheer A. Zhong W. Lim R. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Primers used were: LIF, 5′ primer, 5′-AGTCAACTGGCTCAACTCAACG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CTGGACCACCGCACTAATGACT-3′; OSM, 5′ primer, 5′-CTTCCCCAGTGAGGACATGCTC-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CATGAAGCGGTGATAGC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′ primer, 5′-TGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT-3′. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and then transferred onto nylon membranes. DNA blots were hybridized with appropriate probes and exposed to Eastman Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film at -80 °C overnight. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—PC12 cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (NaOV), and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma)) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron). Following blocking with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody (1:500 or 1:1,000) at 4 °C overnight, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000) for 1 h, and detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot system (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used included anti-LIFR (Santa Cruz), β-tubulin III (Sigma), anti-phosphothreonine PAK (Cell Signaling), and anti-PAK1 (Cell Signaling). STAT3 Phosphorylation Assay—Cultured cells were starved for 4 h in serum-free DMEM culture medium without antibiotics. After starvation, 50 ng/ml factors were applied and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer and insoluble material was pelleted. Protein concentrations of supernatants were assayed using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Total cell lysates (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using an antiphosphotyrosine STAT3 (Tyr-705) antibody (Cell Signaling). After stripping membranes in a stripping buffer (0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, and 2% SDS), a STAT3 specific antibody (Santa Cruz) was used for the detection of total STAT3 expression. Rac1 and RhoA Assays—Measurement of Rac1 and RhoA activities was performed using commercial kits (Upstate). LIFR mutant PC12 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 3 × 106 cells/plates for Rac1 activity assay and 6 × 106 cells/plate for RhoA activity assay. After a 24-h culture, cells were changed to serum-free DMEM for 4 h. Cells were then treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times and lysed for 30 min with the cell lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaOV, and 1 mm sodium fluoride). Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with agarose/glutathione S-transferase/p21-binding domain for Rac1 activity assay or agarose/glutathione S-transferase/Rhotekin Rho binding domain for RhoA activity assay with continuous rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed three times with the cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× protein loading buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 (1:1,000) or rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoA antibody (1:1,000) followed by a 1-h incubation of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000) and detected using the ECL Western blot system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc.), and the amounts of active Rac1 and RhoA were normalized by total amounts of Rac1 and RhoA in cell lysates, respectively. Immunocytochemical Staining—PC12 cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 4% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate, 1:1,000) at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times. F-actin was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:500), which was added together with the secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:1,000). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were mounted with Mowiol and analyzed under Olympus confocal microscope. Quantification of Neurite Outgrowth and Cell Size—In the morphological study of LIFR stable cell lines, the length of the longest neurite of individual cells was recorded using MetaMorph version 5.0r1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.), whereas cell size was determined using the longest diameter of the cell. For each measurement, at least 80 cells per dish were counted from randomly selected fields and n = 3 dishes. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. For cultured SCG neurons, length of the longest neurite and total neurite length were measured to quantify the neurite outgrowth. The total number of tip ends was counted to represent the number of branching from individual neurons. For each measurement, 50 cells per dish were counted, and n = 3 dishes. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. In the study using LIFR knockout mice, eight mice from each group were studied in 5 separate preparations. The length of the longest neurite, total neurite length, and tip addition of 50 cells were recorded for each culture. NGF Specifically Up-regulated LIFR Expression in PC12 Cells—To investigate whether the expression of the CNTF receptor complex was affected by neuronal differentiation, we examined the mRNA expression of CNTFR, gp130, and LIFR in PC12 cells maintained in growth medium supplemented with high serum or low serum that was conductive for neuronal differentiation. Reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed the reduction of LIFR mRNA in low serum condition, whereas CNTFRα and gp130 remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 1a). LIFR transcript and protein expression were induced after treatment with NGF for 7 days, and reached the highest level on day 14 (Fig. 1, b and c). The expression of gp130 and CNTFR, however, remained unchanged in response to NGF (data not shown). Whereas EGF also induced Erk phosphorylation (10Markus A. Patel T.D. Snider W.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 28Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it did not induce LIFR expression after treatment for 14 days (data not shown). In addition to LIFR, the expression of LIF and OSM was also induced after 7 days of NGF treatment (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, we found that phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine 705 was also induced by NGF after 8-14 days of treatment, with a temporal profile similar to that observed with increased LIFR expression (Fig. 1d). Whereas PC12 cells normally do not respond to CNTF or LIF, a 7-day priming with NGF resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 upon treatment with CNTF or LIF (Fig. 1e). Similar STAT3 activation was not observed with PC12 cells pre-treated with EGF (Fig. 1e). Construction of PC12 Cell Lines Stably Expressing Antisense-LIFR and Dominant Negative-LIFR—To explore the putative function of LIFR signaling in NGF-induced PC12 differentiation, we stably transfected antisense (AS)-LIFR and dominant negative (DN)-LIFR constructs into PC12 cells (Fig. 2a). AS-LIFR expressing stable clones were screened based on the reduced basal level of protein expression of LIFR in PC12 cells cultured in growth medium. At least two individual AS-LIFR stable clones were selected for further experiments with similar results and representative data from one of the AS-LIFR clones is presented in this study. Unlike S-LIFR PC12 cells, NGF-primed AS-LIFR PC12 cells did not exhibit STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to CNTF treatment, indicating that the lack of LIFR expression in these cells abolished the cytokine response (Fig. 2b). We have employed an additional approach to attenuate the LIFR signaling in PC12 cells by transfecting a dominant negative-LIFR construct such that the heterodimerization and the downstream JAK-STAT signaling pathway would not be activated in response to cytokine treatment (Fig. 2a). PC12 cells stably transfected with DN-LIFR were selected based on the expression of DN-LIFR-GFP fusion protein as revealed under the fluorescence microscope. At least two individual DN-LIFR stable clones were selected for further experiments, and representative data from one of the clones is presented in this study. The expression of DN-LIFR was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-LIFR antibody (data not shown). Expression of the truncated LIFR-GFP fusion protein partially inhibited CNTF induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (∼60%) in PC12 cells (Fig. 2c). AS-LIFR and DN-LIFR PC12 Cells Showed Enhanced NGF-induced Neurite Outgrowth and Increased β-Tubulin III Expression—Unlike parental or S-LIFR PC12 cells, AS-LIFR PC12 cells extended short processes in the absence of NGF and exhibited larger cell diameter (Fig. 3, a-c). Upon treatment with NGF, AS-LIFR cells rapidly extended longer neurites when compared with S-LIFR cells (Fig. 3, a and c). The observed morphological difference in both S-LIFR and AS-LIFR cells persisted after NGF application for 7 days. Prior to NGF treatment, DN-LIFR cells were morphologically indistinguishable when compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 3a). Like AS-LIFR cells, DN-LIFR cells also extended longer neurites after being treated with NGF for 2 days. However, the morphological difference between mock and DN-LIFR cells was less obvious after 7 days of NGF treatment (Fig. 3, a and d). The extent of neurite outgrowth in AS-LIFR cells following combined treatment with NGF and LIF was similar to that observed with NGF alone (Fig. 3e). PC12 cells expressing LIFR mutants were treated with NGF for 14 days and the expression of β-tubulin type III was examined by Western blot analysis. AS-LIFR cells expressed a higher basal level of β-tubulin III when compared with S-LIFR control (Fig. 3f) and the expression was maintained throughout the course of NGF treatment. Unlike AS-LIFR cells, the induction of β-tubulin III expression in S-LIFR cells was more delayed (Fig. 3g). Blockade of LIFR Signaling Enhanced Basal and NGF-induced Rac1 Activation—As the small GTPase Rac1 is required for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, we next examined whether Rac1 activation was involved in the spontaneous and enhanced neurite outgrowth observed in AS-LIFR and DN-LIFR cells. Consistent with previous reports (29Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), NGF induced rapid activation of Rac1, with the maximum activity detected at 3 min (Fig. 4a). In AS-LIFR cells, NGF induced further elevation of Rac1 activity at 3 min (∼3-fold increase when compared with S-LIFR). Similar enhancement of Rac1 activity was observed with DN-LIFR cells (data not shown). The subcellular distribution of Rac1 and F-actin following NGF treatment of PC12 cells was also examined. When S-LIFR PC12 cells were treated with NGF for 3 min, both Rac1 and F-actin were induced to translocate to the protrusions. Prior to NGF addition, Rac1 and F-actin were already located at the protrusions in AS-LIFR cells (Fig. 4b) and further NGF-induced Rac1 translocation was not observed in these cells. Because the basal level of Rac1 activity was higher in AS-LIFR than S-LIFR cells (Fig. 5a), we examined whether such elevated levels of basal Rac1 activation might lead to spontaneous neurite outgrowth in AS-LIFR cells after replating of the cells in the absence of NGF. PC12 cells were removed from the plates and allowed to settle on another tissue culture plate for the time period indicated in Fig. 5b. The distribution of Rac1 and F-actin in S-LIFR and AS-LIFR cells was examined after replating. Whereas S-LIFR cells remained round in shape after replating, short protrusions extended from AS-LIFR cells after 1 h of replating. Interestingly, Rac1 and F-actin were found to translocate to the tips of protrusions in replated AS-LIFR cells in the absence of NGF (Fig. 5b), in a manner similar to that observed in PC12 cells following NGF treatment (Fig. 4b). The extension of these short processes occurred in parallel with the translocation of Rac1 and F-actin.Fig. 5Basal Rac1 activity in AS-LIFR and DN-LIFR cells. a, the basal Rac1 activity in PC12 cells (including S-LIFR and AS-LIFR cells, mock and DN-LIFR) was determined. Activated Rac1 was measured using agarose bead-PAK and the amount of activated Rac1 and total Rac1 was determined using anti-Rac1 antibody. b, subcellular distribution of endogeneous Rac1 and F-actin in S-LIFR and AS-LIFR PC12 cells after replating. After the indicated times of replating, cells were fixed and stained with a Rac1 specific antibody (green) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (red). Merged images are on the right panels."

We demonstrate that expression of 18- and 72-kDa fragments derived from the NMHC II-B C terminus that contain EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation sites serve as dominant-negative mutations for EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation and localization. Both fragments inhibited the EGF-dependent phosphorylation by competing with NMHC II-B on the myosin heavy chain kinase. However, only expression of the 72-kDa fragment resulted in cells with abnormalities in cell shape, focal adhesions, and chemotaxis. We found that the 72-kDa (but not 18-kDa) fragment is capable of self-assembly. To our knowledge, these results provide the first strong evidence that EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation is required for the cellular localization of NMHC II-B and that NMHC II-B is required for normal cell attachment and for chemotactic response.

Cell motility and chemotaxis play a critical role in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Two cellular systems are involved in mammalian cell chemotaxis: the signaling system that binds the extracellular signal to a receptor and to intracellular signaling proteins. These latter proteins transfer the signal to the cytoskeletal system (actin and myosin II) that serves as a motor for moving the cell toward the chemoattractant (for reviews, see Refs. 1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar and 2Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the involvement and regulation of myosin II in these processes. Myosin II is a hexamer composed of two heavy chains of ∼200 kDa and two pairs of light chains of 20 and 17 kDa. Vertebrates have at least two genes for non-muscle myosin II heavy chains, and these encode separate isoforms of the heavy chain (A and B) (3Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J.

Recent studies indicate that myosins II-A and II-B have different enzymatic activity and are differently localized within the cell (5Cheng T.P.O. Murakami N. Elzinga M.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; NMHC, non-muscle myosin heavy chain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. stimulation of prostate metastatic tumor cells (TSU-pr1) results in transient phosphorylation and alteration in the cellular localization of non-muscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC) II-A and NMHC II-B with different kinetics (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further showed that the kinetics of subcellular localization correlate with the in vivo kinetics of NMHC II-B (but not NMHC II-A) phosphorylation. Thus, NMHC II-B may be involved in the chemotaxis of prostate tumor cells toward EGF (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we further investigate the role of NMHC II-B and its regulation by phosphorylation in the chemotaxis of TSU-pr1 cells toward EGF. We expressed NMHC II-B rod fragments containing the in vivo EGF-dependent phosphorylation sites and found that they served as dominant-negative mutations abolishing EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation. In addition, the two fragments differ in their ability to interact with NMHC II-B in vivo. This difference allowed us to determine the role of phosphorylation of NMHC II-B in its cellular localization and cell adhesion, as well as the role of NMHC II-B in chemotaxis. We present evidence that phosphorylation of NMHC II-B in response to EGF is required for its localization within the cell and that NMHC II-B plays a crucial role in chemotaxis. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—This study used a prostate carcinoma cell line, TSU-pr1 (11Iizumi T. Yazaki T. Kanoh S. Kondo I. Koiso K. J. Urol. 1987; 137: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), derived from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastasized to lymph nodes (kindly provided by Dr. Antonnino Passaniti, Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Cloning of NMHC II-B Rod Domains—All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We used the expression vector pEGFP (Clontech), which allows expression of proteins fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). The pGFP-Tail expression vector was constructed as follows. The 502-bp reverse transcription-PCR product obtained from the 3′-end of NMHC II-B (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was restricted with HindIII and rendered blunt, followed by restriction with EcoRI and ligation into EcoRI-SmaI sites in plasmid pEGFP-C1 (hereafter termed GFP-tail). To generate the pGFP-Rod expression vector, full-length NMHC II-B (13Wei Q. Adelstein S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was restricted with BamHI to give a 1971-bp fragment from the 3′-end of NMHC II-B. The BamHI fragment was cloned into pEGFP-C2 restricted with BamHI (hereafter termed GFP-rod). Expression of the NMHC II-B tail fragment in Escherichia coli was described previously (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of the rod fragment in E. coli, we constructed pET21-Rod. The BamHI fragment containing the rod sequences described above was cloned into pET21 restricted with BamHI. Tail and rod fragments were purified as described previously (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—Cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in a 6-well plate and then transfected with 7 μg of plasmid DNA in N(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 14 days of selection with 400 μg/ml G418, antibiotic-resistant cell colonies were transferred to a 24-well plate. Stable transfected clones were isolated after careful examination under a fluorescent microscope. The most fluorescent clones were collected and tested by Western blot analysis for expression of GFP, GFP-tail, and GFP-rod. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analyses—Gel electrophoresis was carried out following the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). As described above, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plate. They were counted and lysed in SDS gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were blocked with 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and probed with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of NMHC II-B (1:2000) (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with anti-GFP antibody (1:300) (Rockland Inc.). The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase coupled to a secondary antibody (1:4000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL as previously described (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo Phosphorylation and Immunoprecipitation—1 × 106 cells were grown on 100-mm plates as described above. Cells were washed once with 5 ml of prewarmed starvation medium without phosphate (RPMI-H = RPMI 1640 medium containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and incubated for 2 h in RPMI-H containing 100 μCi of 32P. After starvation, cells were stimulated with 7 ng/ml EGF. At different times after stimulation, cells were lysed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold 2× modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (80 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min and spun at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of NMHC II-B or with anti-GFP antibody for 2 h on a rotator at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold 1× modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, subjected to Western blot analysis, and analyzed by autoradiography. The amounts of NMHC II-B and rod and tail fragments immunoprecipitated and the 32P incorporated into the proteins were determined by scanning the Western blot and autoradiogram, respectively, with a scanning laser densitometer. Band areas were quantified using the Quantity One software program (Bio-Rad). Relative phosphorylation of the proteins was determined by dividing the values obtained from autoradiography by the values obtained from Western blotting. For co-immunoprecipitation of the rod fragment and NMHC II-B, the rod fragment was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Rockland Inc.) as described above. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-NMHC II-B antibody. Triton-insoluble NMHC II-B Assay—3 × 105 TSU-pr1 cells were plated on 30-mm plates 1 day prior to the experiment. The cells were starved in RPMI-H for 2 h and stimulated with 7 ng/ml EGF. At the indicated time points, the cells were placed on ice, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and then lysed on ice with 100 μl of Triton solubility lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture). The Triton-soluble proteins were collected from the plates into fresh tubes to which 20 μl of 5× SDS gel loading buffer was added. To collect the Triton-insoluble proteins, 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the plates; the plates were scraped; and the proteins were collected into fresh tubes. Equal samples from the Triton-soluble and -insoluble proteins were analyzed by 7% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-NMHC II-B antibody (1:1000). To determine the relative amounts of NMHC II-B in the different fractions, the Western blots were scanned with a scanning laser densitometer as described above. Microscopy and Image Analysis—For indirect immunofluorescent staining, cells were grown to 60% confluence in 6-well dishes, in which coverslips coated with 27 μg/ml rat tail collagen I were placed at the bottom of the wells. Cells were washed twice with RPMI-H and incubated in RPMI-H for 2.5 h at 37 °C. To stimulate with EGF, 5 μl of 7 ng/ml EGF was placed at a prelabeled corner of the coverslip for 4 min at room temperature. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by three washes with PBS. A solution of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS was added to the coverslips, and they were incubated for 3 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. A polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal domain of myosin II-B (kindly provided by Dr. Robert S. Adelstein, Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) at 1:500 dilution, a monoclonal antibody against vinculin (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution, or a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine clone PT66 (Sigma) was added to the coverslips and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at 1:150 dilution was added to the coverslips and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes with PBS. 8 μl of mounting solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was added to each slide before mounting the coverslips. These were then examined using a ×40 objective under a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal laser scanning system. Confocal images were converted to TIFF format and transferred to a Zeiss imaging workstation for pseudo-color presentation. The relative intensity ratios of NMHC II-B in the cortex and cytoplasm were measured using Zeiss Imaging Software Version 3.80. Two regions of each cell were defined for analysis purposes, the cortex and the cytoplasm (see Fig. 3B). The intensity of the NMHC II-B fluorescence in each region was determined per μm2 using the above program. To visualize live cells, cells were grown in a chambered cover glass (Nunc) and observed using the above microscope with Nomarski optics. To visualize actin, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above, followed by staining with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (1 units/ml). Cells were then examined using a ×63 objective under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a Sensicam cooled imaging camera (Pco Inc.). In Vitro Solubility Assay of E. coli Expressed Rod Fragments—An E. coli expressed rod fragment (30 μg/ml) was dialyzed into 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, and various concentrations of NaCl. Samples of 100 μl were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and equivalent amounts of supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and their relative amounts were determined by scanning densitometry. Adhesion Assay—Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized (0.25% trypsin and 0.05% EDTA (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel)), and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. 3 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and allowed to attach for 15, 30, and 60 min in a humidified incubator as described above. Unattached cells were removed by replacing the medium. The number of adherent cells was determined by counting the number of fluorescent cells in 10 random fields at ×10 magnification. Chemomigration Assay—Blind-well Boyden chambers (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) were used with 13-mm diameter polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (12-μm pore size; Osmonics, Inc., Livermore, CA) coated with 5 μg/filter collagen IV (Sigma). 3 × 105 cells resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were placed in the upper compartment of the chamber. 5 ng/ml EGF in the above medium was added to the lower compartment, and the chambers were incubated for 1–4 h in a humidified incubator as described above. At the times indicated, the filters were removed, fixed, and stained using the Diff-Quik stain set (Dade Behring AG, Düdinger, Switzerland). Non-chemotactic cells were removed from the top surface of the filter with a wet cotton swab. The filters were mounted on glass slides with the bottom part facing up. 10 random fields from each filter were counted at ×40 magnification. EGF-dependent NMHC II-B Phosphorylation Is Inhibited by Expression of Rod and Tail Fragments—EGF stimulation of TSU-pr1 cells results in a transient increase in NMHC II-B phosphorylation that correlates with the EGF-dependent cellular localization of NMHC II-B (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation may play an important role in regulating NMHC II-B localization within the cell. To begin analyzing the role of phosphorylation of NMHC II-B in its regulation, we expressed, in TSU-pr1 cells, fragments of 18- or 72-kDa proteins that derived from the C terminus of NMHC II-B tagged with GFP. The resulting fusion proteins were the rod (102 kDa) and tail (48 kDa) fragments (Fig. 1). We previously showed that EGF stimulation of TSU-pr1 cells results in phosphorylation of NMHC II-B mediated by a kinase from the protein kinase C family (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both the rod and tail fragments contain the previously mapped protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (15Moussavi R.S. Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Murakami N. Singh S.S. Chauhan V.P.S. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16046-16055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Murakami N. Chauhan V.P.S. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1989-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of these fragments may function as dominant-negative mutations and compete with endogenous NMHC II-B for the EGF-dependent myosin heavy chain kinase. In this case, NMHC II-B would not be phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation, allowing the examination of the role of EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation in the regulation of NMHC II-B. To study whether expression of the rod and tail fragments inhibits EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation, we assayed NMHC II-B phosphorylation in cells expressing GFP only (control cells) and in cells expressing the tail or rod fragment (tail and rod cells) in response to EGF stimulation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2A. EGF stimulation of control cells resulted in a transient increase in NMHC II-B phosphorylation, as previously shown for TSU-pr1 cells (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas expression of rod or tail fragments abolished this phosphorylation. Quantification of several experiments such as that in Fig. 2A further established that expression of both rod and tail fragments inhibited EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Both rod and tail fragments appeared to function as dominant-negative mutations for EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation. In addition, these results indicate that the sites for in vivo EGF-dependent phosphorylation reside within the tail fragment. Furthermore, EGF stimulation of control cells resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in NMHC II-B phosphorylation compared with unstimulated cells. These findings indicate that EGF stimulation of control cells leads to the phosphorylation of at least three to four sites on NMHC II-B. To confirm that EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation is inhibited by rod or tail fragments due to competition on the myosin heavy chain kinase, we measured the in vivo phosphorylation levels of the rod or tail fragments in response to EGF stimulation. Fig. 2B shows that stimulation of rod and tail cell lines resulted in a transient increase in rod and tail phosphorylation with kinetics similar to those of NMHC II-B in control cells. The rod and tail fragments thus undergo phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation, and cells expressing these fragments are unable to phosphorylate NMHC II-B. Therefore, these fragments function as dominant-negative mutations by competing with endogenous NMHC II-B for the EGF-dependent myosin heavy chain kinase. In simpler eukaryotes such as Acanthamoeba or Dictyostelium, in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that myosin heavy chain phosphorylation affects the assembly properties of myosin II (18Kuznicki J. Albanesi J.P. Cote G.P. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6011-6014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ganguly C. Martin B. Bubb M. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of sites on the tail of mammalian myosin II has also been observed, but its biological significance is not clear (17Murakami N. Chauhan V.P.S. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1989-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Murakami N. Kotula L. Hwang Y.-W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11441-11451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To begin analyzing the role of NMHC II-B phosphorylation in the regulation of NMHC II-B filament assembly, we tested the effect of tail and rod fragment expression on the assembly properties of NMHC II-B in response to EGF stimulation. For this purpose, we subjected these cells to Triton solubility assay; control, tail, and rod cells stimulated with EGF were lysed in Triton X-100, and the amounts of NMHC II-B in the Triton-insoluble and -soluble fractions were determined by Western blot analysis with anti-NMHC II-B antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, EGF stimulation of control cells resulted in a transient increase in Triton-insoluble NMHC II-B. In contrast, this increase was not observed in tail and rod cells. These results indicate that the inhibition of EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation by expression of tail or rod fragments also affects the assembly properties of NMHC II-B. EGF stimulation of control cells resulted in a peak of Triton-insoluble NMHC II-B at 2 min and in a peak of phosphorylation at 6 min (Fig. 2B). NMHC II-B was unphosphorylated at the peak of NMHC II-B Triton insolubility, whereas there was a very small amount of Triton-insoluble NMHC II-B when NMHC II-B was at its peak of phosphorylation. These results suggest that phosphorylation of NMHC II-B makes the previously insoluble protein Triton-soluble. This hypothesis gains support from observations on rod and tail cells. Measurement of Triton-insoluble NMHC II-B in these cells revealed ∼20% more than in control cells. Most importantly, this amount of Triton-insoluble NMHC II-B in cells expressing rod or tail fragments did not change regardless of EGF stimulation. These results suggest that most of the NMHC II-B protein is Triton-insoluble in its unphosphorylated form, possibly because most of the protein is in the filament form. Taken together, these results suggest that heavy chain phosphorylation is biologically significant and plays a role in the regulation of NMHC II-B function through an effect on NMHC II-B filament formation. EGF-dependent NMHC II-B Localization Is Disrupted by Expression of Rod or Tail Fragments—As mentioned above, EGF stimulation of TSU-pr1 cells results in NMHC II-B phosphorylation that correlates with NMHC II-B achieving a specific cellular localization (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because expression of rod and tail fragments abolished EGF-dependent NMHC II-B phosphorylation (Fig. 2), we next determined the localization properties of NMHC II-B in these cell lines. To do this, we stimulated control, rod, and tail cell lines with EGF and stained them for indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody directed against the N-terminal domain of NMHC II-B (Fig. 1A , N-ab). Because the rod and tail fragments lack this domain, only endogenous NMHC II-B was stained (Fig. 3A). EGF stimulation of control cells caused NMHC II-B to associate with the cell cortex (Fig. 3A) (10Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of tail and rod fragments disrupted EGF-dependent NMHC II-B localization such that EGF stimulation of these cells did not result in NMHC II-B translocation to the cell cortex. NMHC II-B was localized in the cytoplasm in rod cells and in the cell cortex in tail cells regardless of EGF stimulation (Fig. 3A). To further establish that expression of rod and tail fragments disrupts EGF-dependent NMHC II-B translocation to the cortex, we determined the ratio of NMHC II-B fluorescence in the cell cortex to that in the cytoplasm before and after EGF stimulation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First, we defined the cortex and the cytoplasm regions for each cell (Fig. 3B) and then determined the fluorescence intensity of NMHC II-B per μm2 for each region. As shown in Fig. 3C, the cortex/cytoplasm fluorescence ratio of NMHC II-B in unstimulated GFP cells was 1.21; after EGF stimulation, the ratio increased to 1.82, an increase of ∼49%. In contrast, the cortex/cytoplasm ratio of NMHC II-B in rod and tail cells did not increase following EGF stimulation. The amount of NMHC II-B in rod cells before and after EGF stimulation was similar to that in unstimulated control cells, whereas the amount of NMHC II-B in tail cells was similar to that in stimulated control cells. These results clearly indicate that expression of rod and tail fragments disrupts EGF-dependent NMHC II-B translocation to the cell cortex. Expression of rod fragments also resulted in aberrant cell morphology (Fig. 3A) as well as in long protrusions of an average length of 38 μm (data not shown). Furthermore, the rod fragments co-localized with endogenous NMHC II-B (Fig. 3A , yellow spots), implying that rod fragments interact with endogenous NMHC II-B. Tail fragments did not show co-localization with NMHC II-B, indicating that, in contrast to rod fragments, tail fragments did not interact with NMHC II-B. This difference between rod and tail fragments with respect to their interaction with endogenous NMHC II-B was confirmed by immunoprecipitating the rod and tail fragments from rod and tail cell lines, respectively, using anti-GFP antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-NMHC II-B antibody. Fig. 3D shows that NMHC II-B co-immunoprecipitated with rod fragments; similar experiments preformed using tail cells indicated that tail fragments did not co-immunoprecipitated with NMHC II-B (data not shown). Quantification of several experiments such as that in Fig. 3D indicated that 11.5 ± 3.4% (S.D.) of total NMHC II-B co-immunoprecipitated with rod fragments. These results indicate that the rod (but not tail) fragment interacts with NMHC II-B. It is plausible that the rod fragment and NMHC II-B co-assembled to form heterodimers. To begin exploring the mechanism by which rod fragments co-assemble with NMHC II-B, we studied the assembly properties of rod and tail fragments in vitro. The rod and tail fragments were expressed in E. coli and assayed for solubility as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4, in 25 mm NaCl, ∼75% of the rod fragment was soluble; increasing the NaCl concentration to 125 mm resulted in an increase in rod insolubility such that only 30% of the rod fragment was soluble. Increasing the salt concentration resulted in solubility of the rod fragment; so at 275 mm NaCl, 75% of the rod fragment was soluble. Similar results were reported by Murakami et al. (16Murakami N. Singh S.S. Chauhan V.P.S. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16046-16055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the tail fragment was soluble in buffer containing NaCl up to 275 mm. These differences in the solubility properties between rod and tail fragments may result from the difference in lengths of the two fragments. Assuming that the observations shown in Fig. 4 reflect the in vivo situation of rod and tail fragments, then the rod fragment is most likely to be in the insoluble form and the tail fragment in the soluble form at physiological ionic strength. Furthermore, the ability of the rod fragment to assemble may result in the formation of rod and NMHC II-B heterodimers. This hypothesis is consistent with the results in Fig. 3A, in which the rod fragment appeared to be in aggregates and co-localized with endogenous NMHC II-B. As shown in Fig. 3A, the expressed rod fragment formed aggregates in different regions throughout the cell"
https://openalex.org/W2093532298,"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase catalyzes the divalent cation-dependent cleavage of HMG-CoA to form acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. In metal-dependent aldol and Claisen reactions, acidic residues often function either as cation ligands or as participants in general acid/base catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce conservative substitutions for the conserved acidic residues Glu-37, Asp-42, Glu-72, Asp-204, Glu-279, and Asp-280. HMG-CoA lyase deficiency results from a human mutation that substitutes lysine for glutamate 279. The E279K mutation has also been engineered; expression in Escherichia coli produces an unstable protein. Substitution of alanine for glutamate 279 produces a protein that is sufficiently stable for isolation and retains substantial catalytic activity. However, thermal inactivation experiments demonstrate that E279A is much less stable than wild-type enzyme. HMG-CoA lyase deficiency also results from mutations at aspartate 42. Substitutions that eliminate a carboxyl group at residue 42 perturb cation binding and substantially lower catalytic efficiency (104-105-fold decreases in specific activity for D42A, D42G, or D42H versus wild-type). Substitutions of alanine for the other conserved acidic residues indicate the importance of glutamate 72. E72A exhibits a 200-fold decrease in kcat and >103-fold decrease in kcat/Km. E72A is also characterized by inflation in the Km for activator cation (26-fold for Mg2+; >200-fold for Mn2+). Similar, but less pronounced, effects are measured for the D204A mutant. E72A and D204A mutant proteins both bind stoichiometric amounts of Mn2+, but D204A exhibits only a 2-fold inflation in KD for Mn2+, whereas E72A exhibits a 12-fold inflation in KD (23 microm) in comparison with wild-type enzyme (KD = 1.9 microm). Acidic residues corresponding to HMG-CoA lyase Asp-42 and Glu-72 are conserved in the HMG-CoA lyase protein family, which includes proteins that utilize acetyl-CoA in aldol condensations. These related reactions may require an activator cation that binds to the corresponding acidic residues in this protein family."

SV40 is a small DNA virus that has served as a powerful model system for dissecting fundamental biological processes including, DNA replication, transcription, and neoplastic transformation (1Fanning E.

The SV40 genome consists of a 5.2-kb circular duplex DNA molecule with a 300-bp regulatory region that contains SV40 promoter (including the viral origin of DNA replication) and enhancer elements (2Herendeen D.

However, the mechanisms by which SV40 T-Ag cooperates with the cellular proteins in vivo to facilitate viral DNA replication and transcription have not been fully elucidated. The interferon-inducible double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a major regulator of host antiviral defense and normal cellular protein synthesis (8Hovanessian A.G. J.

For example, viral infection leads to PKR activation with phosphorylation of its physiologic substrate, the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2α), that leads to inhibition of translation of mRNA (12Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). PKR also shuts down protein synthesis in uninfected cells following cellular stress responses that lead to inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis, including interleukin-3 growth factor withdrawal, serum deprivation, and treatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor-α and lipopolysaccharide (11Ito T.

In addition, it is now clear that PKR is a key regulator of protein synthesis but may also regulate other fundamental cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and signal transduction (19Judware R.

Findings reported here indicate that RAX has a novel, unexpected function to augment SV40 T-Ag-dependent DNA replication and transcription that is dependent on its dsRNA-binding domains but independent of PKR. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, CV-1, and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All transient transfection or co-transfection in these cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Luciferase Reporter Constructs and Expression Constructs—pGL3-luciferase reporter vectors (including pGL3-promoter vector and pGL3-basic vector) and pRL-Renilla luciferase reporter vectors (including pRL-SV40 vector and pRL-CMV vector) were obtained from Promega. pGL3-promoter vector contains the SV40 early promoter element, whereas pGL3-basic vector lacks promoter or enhancer elements. pRL-SV40 vector and pRL-CMV vector contain the SV40 early promoter/enhancer elements and the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter/enhancer elements, respectively. pGL3-SV40, pGL3-CMV, and pGL3-RSV luciferase reporter vectors were also created by subcloning the promoter/enhancers of SV40, CMV, and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) into the pGL3-basic vector, respectively. The SV40 promoter/enhancer sequence in the pGL3-SV40 and pRL-SV40 vectors contains the SV40 core origin of DNA replication and auxiliary elements including the 21-bp repeats and the 72-bp enhancer elements (23Pauly M. Treger M. Westhof E. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). pSV40 E-TAL luciferase reporter vector was created by subcloning the SV40 enhancer sequence from pRL-SV40 vector into pTAL-luciferase reporter vector (Clontech) that contains a TATA-like promoter (PTAL) region from the Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter. The hemagglutin (HA) epitope-tagged RAX cDNA (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was subcloned into expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pGC1, respectively. The pGC1 vector was derived from the pGL3-CMV vector by deleting the luciferase reporter gene cDNA. Expression plasmids of FLAG-tagged RAX and its mutants (such as K84A, K177A, ΔII and ΔI/II) were also created using expression vectors pIRESneo (Clontech) and pcDEF3 (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed using the Transformer Kit (Clontech). In K84A and K177A mutants the lysine codon was mutated to an alanine codon. ΔII and ΔI/II mutants were created by deleting the cDNA fragments coding amino acid residues 125–194 or residues 63–219 using the restriction enzymes followed by blunt-end ligation. An expression construct of SV40 large T antigen was created by subcloning the T-Ag cDNA fragment of SV40 genome/pRB322 into the pIRESneo vector. A FLAG-tagged eIF2α cDNA was also subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The expression vectors pcDNA3 and pcDEF3 contain the SV40 promoter/enhancer elements that function as the neomycin promoter, whereas pGC1 and pIRESneo do not contain such SV40 regulatory elements. Co-expression of RAX and eIF2α—Co-transfection of 0.5 μg of FLAG-RAX/pIRESneo (empty vector as a control) with 0.5 μg of FLAG-eIF2α/pcDNA3 into COS-7 cells was performed in 6-well plates. After 48 h cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). 50 μg of the lysate was loaded into a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and the same blot was also stained by Fast Green dye. Luciferase Assays—Co-transfection of 1 μg of HA-RAX/pGC1 (empty vector as a control) with 0.1 μg of pGL3-SV40 vector, pGL3-RSV vector, or pGL3-CMV vector into COS-7 cells was performed in 6-well plates. After 48 h cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). 0.1 μg of pGL3-SV40 luciferase vector was also co-transfected into CV-1 cells with a total of 1 μg of plasmids containing empty vector, RAX alone, T-Ag alone, or both RAX and T-Ag followed by luciferase assays. The plasmid combinations were 0.5 μg of pGC1 plus 0.5 μg of pIRESneo for the “empty vector,” 0.5 μg of HA-RAX/pGC1 plus 0.5 μg of pIRESneo for the “RAX alone,” 0.5 μg of pGC1 plus 0.5 μg of T-Ag/pIRESneo for the “T-Ag alone,” and 0.5 μg of RAX/pGC1 plus 0.5 μg of T-Ag/pIRESneo for the “both RAX and T-Ag,” respectively. Similar experiments were also carried out in HeLa cells. The total protein was measured for normalizing luciferase activity readings. To rule out the possibility that the observed effect of RAX on luciferase activity might be an artifact of a particular RAX expression vector or luciferase reporter vector used, other RAX expression plasmids (including HA-RAX/pcDNA3 and Flag-RAX/pIRESneo) and other luciferase reporter vectors (including pRL-SV40 and pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase vectors as well as pGL3-control vector (Promega), which contains both SV40 promoter and enhancer elements and was alternatively used as a pGL3-SV40 vector) were also tested in the studies. Similar results were obtained and some examples are shown under “Results.” Treatment of the PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP) was performed (25Hu Y. Conway T.W. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After the HA-RAX/pGC1 plasmid (empty vector as a control) was co-transfected with the pGL3-SV40 luciferase vector into COS-7 cells using the LipofectAMINE method, 2-AP was immediately added into the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media to a final concentration of 10 mm. After 48 h cells were lysed and luciferase activity was assayed as described above. Southern Blot Analysis—Co-transfection in COS-7 and CV-1 cells was carried out as described before. For plasmid isolation, cells were harvested and lysed in the plasmid lysis buffer (0.6% SDS, 10 mm EDTA). The lysate was added with NaCl to a final concentration of ∼1 m and incubated on ice overnight. The lysate was then centrifuged for 15 min at 13 × g to pellet chromosome DNA. The plasmids in the supernatant were extracted by phenol/chloroform and then precipitated by ethanol. The purified plasmids were linearized by the restriction enzymes and then digested by DpnI (26Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) followed by Southern blot analysis using the luciferase cDNA insert or the FLAG-eIF2α cDNA insert as probe that was radiolabeled using the RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Northern Blot Analysis—Co-transfection was performed as described above. Total RNAs were isolated using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) and probed with the radiolabeled luciferase cDNA insert. [35S]Methionine Labeling and Immunoblotting—Co-transfection was performed as described above. After 48 h, proteins in COS-7 cells that transiently express HA-RAX (or empty vector as a control) were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 60 min to assess protein synthesis (27Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10837-10841Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 20 mm microcystin-LR and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) followed by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and autoradiography. The same blot was also immunoblotted using antibodies against phospho-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology), eIF2α (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), HA (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics), and SV40 T-Ag (BD Pharmingen). Poly(I)·Poly(C)-Agarose Beads Binding Assays—Expression plasmids of FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant RAX as described earlier were transfected into COS-7 cells, respectively. After 48 h cells were lysed in buffer A. Aliquots (50 μg) of lysates were incubated with 20 μl of poly(I)·poly(C) or poly(C)-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5hat4 °C. These beads were washed three times with buffer A before boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted samples and 50 μg of the whole cell lysate (as input) were then loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. RAX Selectively Stimulates SV40 Promoter/Enhancer-dependent Gene Expression—To investigate the mechanism(s) by which RAX may regulate PKR, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing FLAG-tagged RAX and FLAG-tagged eIF2α. Surprisingly, Western blot analysis revealed that FLAG-RAX could significantly enhance the expression of the FLAG-eIF2α plasmid that was created in a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Fig. 1A). Fast Green staining confirmed that expression of total cellular proteins was not affected (Fig. 1B). RAX-mediated augmentation of exogenous gene expression was unexpected because RAX was initially identified and characterized as a cellular activator of PKR that inhibits protein synthesis (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 16Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because viral promoter/enhancers (such as those of SV40, CMV, and RSV) are commonly used to drive exogenous gene expression, we tested whether RAX could affect the transcriptional activity of these promoter/enhancer elements. A commercial pGL3-luciferase reporter vector (Promega) containing these viral promoter/enhancer elements was constructed and co-transfected into COS-7 cells along with a plasmid containing either an HA-tagged RAX or an empty vector. Luciferase expression results indicated that HA-RAX could significantly enhance SV40 promoter/enhancer-dependent gene expression (i.e. ∼10-fold increase) but had only a minimal effect on gene expression driven by the CMV or RSV promoter/enhancers (i.e. ∼1-fold increase, Fig. 2A). Western analysis demonstrates equal levels of HA-RAX or T-Ag expression (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effects of RAX on luciferase reporter gene expression in COS-7 cells. 1 μg of HA-RAX/pGC1 plasmid (empty vector as a control) was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with 0.1 μg of pGL3-luciferase reporter vector containing the promoter/enhancer of SV40, RSV, or CMV (pGL3-SV40, pGL3-RSV, or pGL3-CMV). After 48 h cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, relative luciferase activity.

Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Abundant expression of T-Ag occurs in COS-7 but not CV-1 cells (Figs. 2B and 3B). To test whether T-Ag expression was required for the RAX-mediated enhancement of luciferase gene expression, CV-1 cells were also co-transfected with a pGL3 SV40-luciferase vector and the plasmids containing HA-tagged RAX and/or T-Ag. Results indicated that while expression of HA-RAX alone had essentially no effect on luciferase gene expression, co-expression with the T-Ag can synergistically enhance the activity by over 45-fold (Fig. 3A). Because both HA-RAX and T-Ag were expressed at similar levels in CV-1 cells when transfected individually or together, variable expression levels could not account for HA-RAX-mediated enhancement of luciferase expression (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in addition to monkey COS-7 and CV-1 cells that are naturally SV40 permissive (28Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), RAX was also demonstrated to synergize with the T-Ag to stimulate SV40 promoter/enhancer-dependent luciferase gene expression in human HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). These findings clearly demonstrate that T-Ag expression is necessary for the synergistic enhancing effect of RAX on luciferase gene expression.Fig. 4A, RAX-mediated enhancement of luciferase reporter gene expression in HeLa cells. pGL3-SV40 luciferase reporter vector was co-transfected into HeLa cells with plasmids containing RAX and/or T-Ag followed by luciferase assays similarly as described in the legend to Fig. 3. B, effects of RAX on Renilla luciferase reporter gene expression in COS-7 cells. pRL-SV40 and pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase reporter vectors were used to repeat luciferase assays as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To rule out a nonspecific effect from the pGL3-Firefly luciferase reporter gene vector that might account for any differential reporter gene expression observed, a second luciferase reporter gene from another species was also tested. The pRL Renilla luciferase reporter vector (Promega) that contains either SV40 or CMV promoter/enhancer elements was expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4B). Results confirm that HA-RAX exerts a selective and specific effect that was not dependent on the luciferase gene because expression of the two different luciferase enzymes were both synergistically enhanced. These data rule out a nonspecific, species-specific enhancement of gene expression. Therefore, it is concluded that RAX-mediated enhancement of luciferase gene expression is specific for the SV40 promoter/enhancer elements and independent of the plasmid or reporter genes employed. RAX-mediated Enhancement of Gene Expression Occurs at the Level of Both DNA Replication and mRNA Expression—The wild-type SV40 origin of DNA replication is contained in both the pGL3- and pRL-luciferase reporter vectors. Plasmids containing this origin can replicate in cells expressing the T-Ag, such as COS-7 cells (28Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether HA-RAX could enhance SV40 origin-dependent plasmid DNA replication. To distinguish a newly replicated pGL3-luciferase plasmid in mammalian cells from the plasmid that was transfected into the cells, DpnI endonuclease was used because it would only cleave the transfected plasmid containing DpnI sites that were methylated during plasmid preparation in growing bacteria (26Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis using a radiolabeled luciferase cDNA probe revealed that pGL3-plasmid DNA replication occurred following transfection into mammalian cells and was significantly enhanced by HA-RAX (Fig. 5A). These findings indicated that RAX can stimulate SV40 promoter (origin)/enhancer-dependent DNA replication. This novel property of RAX was verified when it was shown that HA-RAX could also increase the replication of an unrelated FLAG-eIF2α/pcDNA3 plasmid in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5B). The pcDNA3 vector contains both CMV promoter/enhancer elements (for expressing the gene of interest) and the SV40 promoter (origin)/enhancer elements to allow replication of the FLAG-eIF2α/pcDNA3 in COS-7 cells. These findings help to explain how RAX can enhance expression of FLAG-eIF2α/pcDNA3 (Fig. 1A). Because RAX only slightly or moderately increased CMV promoter/enhancer activity (Figs. 2A and 4B) while significantly enhancing the FLAG-eIF2α expression, the mechanism may result primarily from RAX enhancement of SV40 promoter (origin)/enhancer dependent plasmid replication. Furthermore, because both pGL3-luciferase and the FLAG-eIF2α/pcDNA3 plasmids are different plasmid constructs, these results strongly suggest that RAX-mediated augmentation of DNA replication is not an artifact of a particular plasmid construct but rather is specific for the SV40 promoter (origin)/enhancer elements. To test whether the T-Ag was required for RAX-mediated enhancement of DNA replication, plasmid replication studies were carried out in CV-1 cells that lack T-Ag expression. Results indicated that expression of the T-Ag is required for RAX-mediated enhancement of SV40 promoter (origin)/enhancer dependent DNA replication (Fig. 5C). Northern analysis confirmed that HA-RAX synergistically increased SV40 promoter/enhancer-dependent luciferase mRNA expression in COS-7 and CV-1 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Results in CV-1 cells indicated that although the basal level of luciferase mRNA expression was undetectable, probably because of the small amount of luciferase vector used in the cotransfection, HA-RAX synergized with the co-expressed T-Ag to stimulate mRNA expression (Fig. 6B, comparing lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Because (luciferase) gene transcription primarily occurs downstream of plasmid replication, HA-RAX-enhancement of mRNA expression resulted, at least in part, from enhanced plasmid replication. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the magnitude of HA-RAX-mediated enhancement of mRNA expression appeared to be greater than that of plasmid DNA synthesis, especially in CV-1 cells, indicating that RAX likely stimulated SV40 regulatory element-dependent DNA transcription as well. Because the T-Ag can function in both SV40 DNA synthesis and transcriptional activation that are tightly coupled processes, RAX may cooperatively stimulate these two processes. DsRNA-binding Domains Are Required to Enhance Luciferase Gene Expression—RAX/PACT contains three putative dsRNA-binding motifs that are required for PKR activation (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 16Patel R.C. Sen G.C.

The first two dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBM) display high homology with the first dsRBM of PKR (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

Lys-84 and Lys-177 are conserved lysine residues located within the first and second dsRBMs that are necessary for the dsRNA binding of RAX (15Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.
