https://openalex.org/W4283164546,"Abstract In some immunocompromised patients with chronic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, considerable adaptive evolution occurs. Some substitutions found in chronic infections are lineage-defining mutations in variants of concern (VOCs), which has led to the hypothesis that VOCs emerged from chronic infections. In this study, we searched for drivers of VOC-like emergence by consolidating sequencing results from a set of 27 chronic infections. Most substitutions in this set reflected lineage-defining VOC mutations; however, a subset of mutations associated with successful global transmission was absent from chronic infections. We further tested the ability to associate antibody evasion mutations with patient-specific and virus-specific features and found that viral rebound is strongly correlated with the emergence of antibody evasion. We found evidence for dynamic polymorphic viral populations in most patients, suggesting that a compromised immune system selects for antibody evasion in particular niches in a patient’s body. We suggest that a tradeoff exists between antibody evasion and transmissibility and that extensive monitoring of chronic infections is necessary to further understanding of VOC emergence."

A large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC. Advanced polyps contain increasing numbers of stem-like cells, regulatory T cells and a subtype of pre-cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the cancerous state, we observe T cell exhaustion, RUNX1-regulated cancer-associated fibroblasts and increasing accessibility associated with HNF4A motifs in epithelia. DNA methylation changes in sporadic CRC are strongly anti-correlated with accessibility changes along this continuum, further identifying regulatory markers for molecular staging of polyps."

https://openalex.org/W4283166819,"Channelrhodopsins are used widely for optical control of neurons, in which they generate photoinduced proton, sodium or chloride influx. Potassium (K+) is central to neuron electrophysiology, yet no natural K+-selective light-gated channel has been identified. Here, we report kalium channelrhodopsins (KCRs) from Hyphochytrium catenoides. Previously known gated potassium channels are mainly ligand- or voltage-gated and share a conserved K+-selectivity filter. KCRs differ in that they are light-gated and have independently evolved an alternative K+ selectivity mechanism. The KCRs are potent, highly selective of K+ over Na+, and open in less than 1 ms following photoactivation. The permeability ratio PK/PNa of 23 makes H. catenoides KCR1 (HcKCR1) a powerful hyperpolarizing tool to suppress excitable cell firing upon illumination, demonstrated here in mouse cortical neurons. HcKCR1 enables optogenetic control of K+ gradients, which is promising for the study and potential treatment of potassium channelopathies such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and long-QT syndrome and other cardiac arrhythmias. The authors report a functional class of channelrhodopsins that are highly selective for K+ over Na+. These light-gated channels, named ‘kalium channelrhodopsins’, enable robust inhibition of mouse cortical neurons with millisecond precision."
https://openalex.org/W4283155441,"Barrier epithelia depend upon resident stem cells for homeostasis, defense, and repair. Epithelial stem cells of small and large intestines (ISCs) respond to their local microenvironments (niches) to fulfill a continuous demand for tissue turnover. The complexity of these niches and underlying communication pathways are not fully known. Here, we report a lymphatic network at the intestinal crypt base that intimately associates with ISCs. Employing in vivo loss of function and lymphatic:organoid cocultures, we show that crypt lymphatics maintain ISCs and inhibit their precocious differentiation. Pairing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we apply BayesPrism to deconvolve expression within spatial features and develop SpaceFold to robustly map the niche at high resolution, exposing lymphatics as a central signaling hub for the crypt in general and ISCs in particular. We identify WNT-signaling factors (WNT2, R-SPONDIN-3) and a hitherto unappreciated extracellular matrix protein, REELIN, as crypt lymphatic signals that directly govern the regenerative potential of ISCs."
https://openalex.org/W4283172172,"Abstract A general method to generate biosensors for user-defined molecules could provide detection tools for a wide range of biological applications. Here, we describe an approach for the rapid engineering of biosensors using PYR1 (Pyrabactin Resistance 1), a plant abscisic acid (ABA) receptor with a malleable ligand-binding pocket and a requirement for ligand-induced heterodimerization, which facilitates the construction of sense–response functions. We applied this platform to evolve 21 sensors with nanomolar to micromolar sensitivities for a range of small molecules, including structurally diverse natural and synthetic cannabinoids and several organophosphates. X-ray crystallography analysis revealed the mechanistic basis for new ligand recognition by an evolved cannabinoid receptor. We demonstrate that PYR1-derived receptors are readily ported to various ligand-responsive outputs, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like assays, luminescence by protein-fragment complementation and transcriptional circuits, all with picomolar to nanomolar sensitivity. PYR1 provides a scaffold for rapidly evolving new biosensors for diverse sense–response applications."
https://openalex.org/W4283159936,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease that may advance to fibrosis and lead to mortality; however, no pharmacotherapy is currently available. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of both the sodium–glucose cotransporters 1 and 2 with licogliflozin would lead to improvement in NASH. A total of 107 patients with phenotypic or histologic NASH were randomized (1:2:2) to receive oral administration of either placebo (n = 21), licogliflozin 30 mg (n = 43) or 150 mg (n = 43) once daily for 12 weeks. Licogliflozin 150 mg showed a significant 32% (80% confidence interval (CI): 21–43%; P = 0.002) placebo-adjusted reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase after 12 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint of the study. However, the 30 mg dose of licogliflozin did not meet the primary endpoint (placebo-adjusted reduction 21% (80% CI: 7–32%; P = 0.061)). Diarrhea occurred in 77% (33 of 43), 49% (21 of 43) and 43% (9 of 21) of patients treated with licogliflozin 150 mg, 30 mg and placebo, respectively, which was mostly mild in severity. No other major safety concerns were identified. Treatment with 150 mg licogliflozin led to reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase in patients with NASH. Studies of longer duration and in combination with drugs that have different mechanisms of action are needed to validate these findings and to define a role of licogliflozin as a therapeutic option for NASH. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03205150. In a phase 2a clinical trial in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, dual inhibition of sodium–glucose cotransporters 1 and 2 with 150 mg of licogliflozin led to reductions in serum alanine aminotranferase levels."
https://openalex.org/W4283162937,"Bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are vital for lifelong maintenance of healthy haematopoiesis. In inbred mice housed in gnotobiotic facilities, the top of the haematopoietic hierarchy is occupied by dormant HSCs, which reversibly exit quiescence during stress. Whether HSC dormancy exists in humans remains debatable. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show a continuous landscape of highly purified human bone marrow HSCs displaying varying degrees of dormancy. We identify the orphan receptor GPRC5C, which enriches for dormant human HSCs. GPRC5C is also essential for HSC function, as demonstrated by genetic loss- and gain-of-function analyses. Through structural modelling and biochemical assays, we show that hyaluronic acid, a bone marrow extracellular matrix component, preserves dormancy through GPRC5C. We identify the hyaluronic acid-GPRC5C signalling axis controlling the state of dormancy in mouse and human HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W4283163503,"Identification of cancer driver mutations that confer a proliferative advantage is central to understanding cancer; however, searches have often been limited to protein-coding sequences and specific non-coding elements (for example, promoters) because of the challenge of modeling the highly variable somatic mutation rates observed across tumor genomes. Here we present Dig, a method to search for driver elements and mutations anywhere in the genome. We use deep neural networks to map cancer-specific mutation rates genome-wide at kilobase-scale resolution. These estimates are then refined to search for evidence of driver mutations under positive selection throughout the genome by comparing observed to expected mutation counts. We mapped mutation rates for 37 cancer types and applied these maps to identify putative drivers within intronic cryptic splice regions, 5' untranslated regions and infrequently mutated genes. Our high-resolution mutation rate maps, available for web-based exploration, are a resource to enable driver discovery genome-wide."

https://openalex.org/W4283170758,"Chaperones tapasin and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-binding protein related (TAPBPR) associate with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein 1 (MR1) to promote trafficking and cell surface expression. However, the binding mechanism and ligand dependency of MR1/chaperone interactions remain incompletely characterized. Here in vitro, biochemical and computational studies reveal that, unlike MHC-I, TAPBPR recognizes MR1 in a ligand-independent manner owing to the absence of major structural changes in the MR1 α2-1 helix between empty and ligand-loaded molecules. Structural characterization using paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance experiments combined with restrained molecular dynamics simulations reveals that TAPBPR engages conserved surfaces on MR1 to induce similar adaptations to those seen in MHC-I/TAPBPR co-crystal structures. Finally, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion experiments using 19F-labeled diclofenac show that TAPBPR can affect the exchange kinetics of noncovalent metabolites with the MR1 groove, serving as a catalyst. Our results support a role of chaperones in stabilizing nascent MR1 molecules to enable loading of endogenous or exogenous cargo."
https://openalex.org/W4283031265,"Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a widely expressed protein that functions as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor and activator of Orai1 channels. In resting cells with replete Ca2+ stores, an inhibitory clamp formed by the coiled-coil 1 (CC1) domain interacting with the CRAC-activation domain (CAD) of STIM1 helps keep STIM1 in a quiescent state. Following depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, the brake is released, allowing CAD to extend away from the ER membrane and enabling it to activate Orai1 channels. However, the molecular determinants of CC1-CAD interactions that enforce the inhibitory clamp are incompletely understood. Here, we performed Ala mutagenesis in conjunction with live-cell FRET analysis to examine residues in CC1 and CAD that regulate the inhibitory clamp. Our results indicate that in addition to previously identified hotspots in CC1⍺1 and CC3, several hydrophobic residues in CC2 and the apex region of CAD are critical for CC1-CAD interactions. Mutations in these residues loosen the CC1-CAD inhibitory clamp to release CAD from CC1 in cells with replete Ca2+ stores. By contrast, altering the hydrophobic residues L265 and L273 strengthens the clamp to prevent STIM1 activation. Inclusion of the inactivation domain of STIM1 helps stabilize CC1-CAD interaction in several mutants to prevent spontaneous STIM1 activation. In addition, R426C, a human disease-linked mutation in CC3, affects the clamp but also impairs Orai1 binding to inhibit CRAC channel activation. These results identify the CC2, apex, and inactivation domain regions of STIM1 as important determinants of STIM1 activation."

https://openalex.org/W4283171665,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a metastatic nature. TNBC lacks the expression of the progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. The absence of these three receptors limits the therapy options. Meanwhile, conventional medication is not very effective in the treatment and prevention of TNBC. Developing innovative therapeutic agents from natural bioactive compounds is a viable option. In the current study, the natural compound thymoquinone (TQ) was used in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. A dose response to TQ (0-50 µM) was obtained following a 24-hour exposure. An Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection was used to study the apoptotic effect of TQ. With increasing TQ concentrations from 0-20 µM, flow cytometer examination revealed an increase in apoptotic cells. Nearly 80% of the cells studied were in the apoptotic phase at 20 µM. (early and late apoptosis). Meanwhile, at 30 µM, there was a significant drop in apoptotic cells, which may be interpreted as an increase in necrotic cells. Molecular-targeted therapy is a new approach in treating cancer. The effect of TQ on the expression of Nrf2(Nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2) and PD-L1 (Programmed death-ligand 1) was investigated using a specific primary antibody against these proteins. A Western blot analysis confirmed TQ's ability to change the expression of both proteins under investigation. According to normalized data, TQ had the ability to elicit more than 2-fold increase in Nrf2 expression in IFN-γ stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, co-treated cells (IFN-γ + TQ) showed a 65 percent reduction in PD-L1 expression. In conclusion, TQ was suggested as a promising anticancer option for treating TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4283267483,"Long hollow cylinders are commonly utilized in various technological applications, including liquid and gas transmission. As a result, its value is growing, becoming increasingly important to many research efforts. Compared with thermal isotropic homogeneous cylinders, thermo-viscoelastic orthotropic cylinders have less relevant data. In this paper, a thermoelastic fractional heat conduction model was developed based on the Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation to examine the axial symmetry problem of a viscoelastic orthotropic hollow cylinder. Atangana and Baleanu derivative operators with nonsingular and nonlocal kernels were used in constructing the fractional model. The thermal properties of the cylinder materials are assumed to be temperature-dependent. The Laplace transform is applied to solve the system of governing equations. The numerical calculations for temperature, displacement, and stress components are performed by the effect of fractional order, rotation, and changing thermal properties of the cylinder. The results showed that due to the presence of fractional derivatives, some properties of the physical fields of the medium change according to the value of the fractional order."
https://openalex.org/W4283160533,"A long-established strategy for transcription regulation is the tethering of transcription factors to cellular membranes. By contrast, the principal effectors of Hedgehog signalling, the GLI transcription factors, are regulated by microtubules in the primary cilium and the cytoplasm. How GLI is tethered to microtubules remains unclear. Here, we uncover DNA mimicry by the ciliary kinesin KIF7 as a mechanism for the recruitment of GLI to microtubules, wherein the coiled-coil dimerization domain of KIF7, characterized by its striking shape, size and charge similarity to DNA, forms a complex with the DNA-binding zinc fingers in GLI, thus revealing a mode of tethering a DNA-binding protein to the cytoskeleton. GLI increases KIF7 microtubule affinity and consequently modulates the localization of both proteins to microtubules and the cilium tip. Thus, the kinesin-microtubule system is not a passive GLI tether but a regulatable platform tuned by the kinesin-transcription factor interaction. We retooled this coiled-coil-based GLI-KIF7 interaction to inhibit the nuclear and cilium localization of GLI. This strategy can potentially be exploited to downregulate erroneously activated GLI in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4283260325,"Identifying individuals with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) can be an effective strategy for early diagnosis and delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Many approaches have been devised to discriminate those with EMCI from healthy control (HC) individuals. Selection of the most effective parameters has been one of the challenging aspects of these approaches. In this study we suggest an optimization method based on five evolutionary algorithms that can be used in optimization of neuroimaging data with a large number of parameters. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) measures, which measure functional connectivity, have been shown to be useful in prediction of cognitive decline. Analysis of functional connectivity data using graph measures is a common practice that results in a great number of parameters. Using graph measures we calculated 1155 parameters from the functional connectivity data of HC (n = 72) and EMCI (n = 68) extracted from the publicly available database of the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative database (ADNI). These parameters were fed into the evolutionary algorithms to select a subset of parameters for classification of the data into two categories of EMCI and HC using a two-layer artificial neural network. All algorithms achieved classification accuracy of 94.55%, which is extremely high considering single-modality input and low number of data participants. These results highlight potential application of rs-fMRI and efficiency of such optimization methods in classification of images into HC and EMCI. This is of particular importance considering that MRI images of EMCI individuals cannot be easily identified by experts."
https://openalex.org/W4283264676,"Today, different types of nanoparticles (NPs) are being synthesized and used for medical and agricultural applications. In this study, copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) were synthesized using the aqueous extract of mint ( Mentha longifolia L.). For the characterization of CuNPs, UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry were used. The UV-Visible absorption peak at 558 nm confirmed the formation of CuNPs. The XRD pattern confirmed the phase-centered crystalline nature of CuNPs. FTIR analysis showed the O-H, Cu-H and C-C bonds, indicating the active role of these functional groups as reducing agents of Cu ions to CuNPS. The synthesized NPs were found to have an almost spherical shape with an average size of 23 nm. When applied to wheat, a condition dependent effect of CuNPs was found. Variety 18-Elite Line 1, Elite Line 3, and 18-Elite Line 6 showed maximum germination and growth rate at 50 mg CuNPs/L, while variety 18-Elite Line 5 showed that increase at 25 mg CuNPs/L. Beyond these concentrations, the seed germination and growth of wheat declined. In conclusion, the application of CuNPs showed a beneficial effect in improving the growth of wheat at a certain concentration."
https://openalex.org/W4283265058,"Among older adults, decreased handgrip strength is associated with greater risk of frailty, and loss of physical function, mobility, lean mass, and overall muscular strength and power. Frailty is also associated with sarcopenia, for which handgrip strength measurement has been recommended for diagnostic purposes. Specific cutoff points for diagnosis have been identified, but use of different devices may affect measurement. Therefore to assess validity and reliability, we compared the two most frequently used devices, the Jamar hydraulic and Smedley spring handgrip dynamometers.Sixty-seven older (76.2 ± 0.9 years) men (n = 34) and women (n = 33) completed two trials of handgrip strength measurement on sequential days (T1, T2) using both devices in random order. Intraclass correlations were used to assess test-retest reliability, and Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess validity as the level of agreement between devices.There were significant (p < 0.001) relationships between devices at T1 (r = 0.94) and T2 (r = 0.94) and strong (p < 0.001) intraclass correlations were observed for both devices (Jamar = 0.98; Smedley = 0.96), indicating excellent reliability. However, there were significant differences between devices. Strength measured with Jamar was greater than Smedley at both T1 (27.4 ± 1.4 vs. 23.4 ± 1.1 kg, p < 0.001) and T2 (25.3 ± 1.4 vs. 21.8 ± 1.2 kg, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis confirmed these differences. Subgroup analysis to evaluate the effect of gender and age indicated that in women and old-old (>75 years) participants, differences between devices were closer to zero for both measurements compared to men and young-old (65-75 years) participants.Our results demonstrate that despite excellent reliability, there is poor agreement between devices, indicating a lack of validity. For use as a diagnostic tool, standardization and device-specific cutoff points for handgrip dynamometry are needed."
https://openalex.org/W4283267080,"The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is filled with hype and inflated expectations. Notwithstanding, AI is finding its way into numerous aspects of humanity including the fast-growing helping profession of coaching. Coaching has been shown to be efficacious in a variety of human development facets. The application of AI in a narrow, specific area of coaching has also been shown to work. What remains uncertain, is how the two compare. In this paper we compare two equivalent longitudinal randomised control trial studies that measured the increase in clients' goal attainment as a result of having received coaching over a 10-month period. The first study involved human coaches and the replication study used an AI chatbot coach. In both studies, human coaches and the AI coach were significantly more effective in helping clients reach their goals compared to the two control groups. Surprisingly however, the AI coach was as effective as human coaches at the end of the trials. We interpret this result using AI and goal theory and present three significant implications: AI coaching could be scaled to democratize coaching; AI coaching could grow the demand for human coaching; and AI could replace human coaches who use simplistic, model-based coaching approaches. At present, AI's lack of empathy and emotional intelligence make human coaches irreplicable. However, understanding the efficacy of AI coaching relative to human coaching may promote the focused use of AI, to the significant benefit of society."
https://openalex.org/W4283275344,"Misophonia is a clinical syndrome which is characterized by intense emotional and physical reactions to idiosyncratic sounds. However, its psychometric measurement is still in the early stages. This study describes the optimization of a self-report instrument, the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire (BMQ), and addresses its strengths in comparison to existing psychometric measures. This new measure integrates contemporary empirical findings and is based on the latest criteria of misophonia. A cross-sectional online study was conducted using data of 952 affected as well as non-affected individuals. The final BMQ-R consists of 77 items in 21 scales, which were selected using a probabilistic item selection algorithm (Ant Colony Optimization). The results of confirmatory factor analyses, the assessment of reliability, and an extensive construct validation procedure supported the reliability and validity of the developed scales. One outstanding strength of the BMQ-R is its comprehensive measurement of misophonic emotional and physical responses. The instrument further allows for distinguishing between behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dysregulation; the measurement of clinical insight and significance; as well as discerning reactive and anticipating avoidance strategies. Our work offers several improvements to the measurement of misophonia by providing a reliable and valid multidimensional diagnostical instrument. In line with the scientific consensus on defining misophonia, the BMQ-R allows to formally recognize individuals with misophonia and so to compare findings of future studies. Undoubtedly, this measure fills a research gap, which we hope will facilitate the investigation of causes and treatment of misophonia."
https://openalex.org/W4283015183,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a major acute phase protein and inflammatory marker, the expression of which is largely liver specific and highly inducible. Enhancers are regulatory elements critical for the precise activation of gene expression, yet the contributions of enhancers to the expression pattern of CRP have not been well defined. Here, we identify a constitutively active enhancer (E1) located 37.7 kb upstream of the promoter of human CRP in hepatocytes. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, in situ genetic manipulation, CRISPRi, and CRISPRa, we show that E1 is enriched in binding sites for transcription factors STAT3 and C/EBP-β and is essential for the full induction of human CRP during the acute phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that E1 orchestrates with the promoter of CRP to determine its varied expression across tissues and species through surveying activities of E1-promoter hybrids and the associated epigenetic modifications. These results thus suggest an intriguing mode of molecular evolution wherein expression-changing mutations in distal regulatory elements initiate subsequent functional selection involving coupling among distal/proximal regulatory mutations and activity-changing coding mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4283261260,"Background While restriction measures are critical in containing the COVID-19 outbreak, limited studies have investigated the behavioral and psychological impact of these measures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of physical and sedentary behavioral changes and online behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and life satisfaction among the Chinese population. Methods The data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 2145 residents aged between 18 and 80 in Hubei province, China between March 23, 2020, and April 9, 2020. Results Participants who had high frequencies of physical activities before or during the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited higher levels of life satisfaction. Participants who increased their sitting time during the pandemic or kept sitting for more than eight hours before and during the pandemic reported worse mental health than those who maintained less sedentary behavior. Besides, participants who used the Internet for information seeking, communication, and entertainment more frequently reported better mental health and life satisfaction. In contrast, there was a positive association between commercial use of the Internet and symptoms of mental disorders. Conclusion Given the link between physical and sedentary behavioral changes with worse mental wellbeing, strategies to reduce sedentariness and increase physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed."
https://openalex.org/W4283262834,"Background While the importance of involving older people in research is increasingly acknowledged, quantitative studies exploring the perspectives of larger samples of older people who take an active role in research on ageing and health are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the awareness of and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among older people in Sweden. Materials and methods Data derived from a survey (N = 881) of people aged 60 years or older in Sweden. Demographics, self-rated health, and attitudes were analysed using descriptive statistics. Awareness of and previous active involvement in research were analysed using chi-square tests and Mann Whitney tests. Factors associated with willingness to be actively involved in research were determined by logistic regressions. Results Of the 26% who responded (N = 881), 39% (n = 343) were aware that they could be actively involved in research. Awareness and previous active involvement in research were significantly associated with a higher level of education. Public involvement was believed to enhance research communication and enable valuable contributions related to ageing. The proportion of respondents who were willing to be actively involved in research was significantly higher for respondents with previous experience and a higher level of education. Conclusions Engaging older people in Sweden in research targeting active involvement in research presents a challenge. The study shows an over-representation of people with higher education, who tend to be more aware, have previous experience, and are more willing to be involved in research with public involvement. This implies a risk that groups with lower education are not represented, and that knowledge co-produced with mostly highly educated groups will lead to a biased picture. Further studies are needed to understand how an increased awareness of research and willingness to participate can be achieved. IRRID: RR2-10.2196/17759."
https://openalex.org/W4283017794,"Recent studies have shown that human solute carrier SLC19A3 (hSLC19A3) can transport pyridoxine (vitamin B6) in addition to thiamine (vitamin B1), its originally identified substrate, whereas rat and mouse orthologs of hSLC19A3 can transport thiamine but not pyridoxine. This finding implies that some amino acid residues required for pyridoxine transport, but not for thiamine transport, are specific to hSLC19A3. Here, we sought to identify these residues to help clarify the unique operational mechanism of SLC19A3 through analyses comparing hSLC19A3 and mouse Slc19a3 (mSlc19a3). For our analyses, hSLC19A3 mutants were prepared by replacing selected amino acid residues with their counterparts in mSlc19a3, and mSlc19a3 mutants were prepared by substituting selected residues with their hSLC19A3 counterparts. We assessed pyridoxine and thiamine transport by these mutants in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Our analyses indicated that the hSLC19A3-specific amino acid residues of Gln86, Gly87, Ile91, Thr93, Trp94, Ser168, and Asn173 are critical for pyridoxine transport. These seven amino acid residues were found to be mostly conserved in the SLC19A3 orthologs that can transport pyridoxine but not in orthologs that are unable to transport pyridoxine. In addition, these residues were also found to be conserved in several SLC19A2 orthologs, including rat, mouse, and human orthologs, which were all found to effectively transport both pyridoxine and thiamine, exhibiting no species-dependent differences. Together, these findings provide a molecular basis for the unique functional characteristics of SLC19A3 and also of SLC19A2."
https://openalex.org/W4283068683,"Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is associated with tissue deposition of TTR aggregates. TTR aggregation is initiated by dissociation of the native tetramer to form a monomeric intermediate, which locally unfolds and assembles into soluble oligomers and higher-order aggregates. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding requires kinetic and structural characterization of the low population intermediates formed. Here, we show that the monomeric intermediate exchanges with an ensemble of oligomers on the millisecond timescale. This transient and reversible exchange causes broadening of the 19F resonance of a trifluoromethyl probe coupled to the monomeric intermediate at S85C. We show the 19F linewidth and R2 relaxation rate increase with increasing concentration of the oligomer. Furthermore, introduction of 19F probes at additional TTR sites yielded distinct 19F chemical shifts for the TTR tetramer and monomer when the trifluoromethyl probe was attached at S100C, located near the same subunit interface as S85C, but not with probes attached at S46C or E63C, which are distant from any interfaces. The 19F probe at E63C shows that part of the DE loop, which is solvent accessible in the tetramer, becomes more buried in the NMR-visible oligomers. Finally, using backbone amides as probes, we show that parts of the EF helix and H-strand become highly flexible in the otherwise structured monomeric intermediate at acidic pH. We further find that TTR aggregation can be reversed by increasing pH. Taken together, this work provides insights into location-dependent conformational changes in the reversible early steps of a kinetically concerted TTR aggregation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4283159649,"Since the 1960s viral pathogenesis researchers have considered herpesviruses as an underlying factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reported molecular interactions between herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the parent of amyloid plaques pathognomonic for AD (Sapute-Krishnan et al., 2003 and 2006; Chen et al., 2011, Bearer and Wu, 2019). Furthermore, others report biochemical interactions between HSV-1 and autophagy. Using several brain banks for specimens of four brain regions in post-mortems of individuals with and without cognitive impairment prior to death. Readhead et al. 2018 found molecular-genetic evidence linking activity of 6 different human herpesviruses to AD, including HSV-1, HSV-2, HHN6, HHN7, VZV and CMV to AD. Of these, HHN6, a common virus causing a minor childhood illness thought to be a nuisance, emerged as most significant. Using a quantitative trait loci approach, a network of candidate AD-associated genes were found that correlated with viral load and activity. These ontology networks did not specifically consider autophagy genes. Our hypothesis is that viral replication and egress highjacks cellular membrane systems and thereby alters autophagic function. Those individuals carrying genetic variations that protect against this dynamic will be less vulnerable to cognitive impairment despite viral load, or viral load will be diminished. Here we first prepared lists of autophagy genes (ATG), including 180 we uniquely identified through machine learning, as well as lists from publications (Mitzushima, 2019) and websites (Autophagy Gene List, Tanpaku.org). We applied software developed by Readhead et al. 2018, available through Synapse.com, to expression and sequence data from post-mortem brains obtained from publications and public sites hosted by Alzheimer's Center brain banks. We first determined ATG expression levels correlating with either non-AD (<1 plaque per section, Braak<3, and no dementia, or pre-clinical AD, defined as Braak III-IV with no cognitive impairment. Virtually all ATG were down-regulated in pre-clinical compared to non-AD controls. Next we searched the list of quantitative trait loci (QTL) that correlated with increased viral load and activity for ATG genes from 300+ brains in the Nun's Study brain bank (ROSMAP) and the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB). Lastly, we correlated those ATG-associated QTL with expression levels of these genes in control and preclinical AD (Liang et al. 2007, 2008 and 2010). We found that decreased ATG expression due to single nucleotide polymorphisms correlate with viral load and AD. This study suggests autophagy is a novel mechanism linking herpesvirus to AD, which may aid in finding new diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Since HHV6 is a common infection of childhood, infecting nearly 100% of humans, identifying genetic vulnerabilities to persistence and progression will be critically important for prevention of adult AD."
https://openalex.org/W4283204380,"The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) is a social norm embedded in the patriarchal system and is resistant to change due to its roots in the tradition of the practising communities. Despite this difficulty in change, some women succeed in changing their attitudes towards the practice. In trying to understand what makes these women change their attitudes, we identified in a previous study, the critical life events at which change occurs (turning point). These turning points were described with emotions and conflicting feelings based on which we hypothesised that emotion regulation and the resolution of conflicts of loyalty might be possible mechanisms that explain the change of attitudes by the women. In this article, we sought to investigate how the mechanisms interact and how they were at play to explain the change. We, therefore, triangulated our previous data, fifteen women interviewed twice, with the published life stories and public testimonies of 10 women with FGM, and interviews of six experts chosen for their complementary fields of expertise to discuss the emerging concepts and theory, generated by our study. The data were analysed using framework analysis and an element of the grounded theory approach (constant comparison). As a result of our theorisation process, we propose a model of change in five stages (Emotion suppression, The awakening, The clash, Re-appropriation of self, and Reconciliation). This describes the process of a woman's journey from compliance with FGM and community norms to non-compliance. Our study reveals how the women whose stories were analysed, moved from being full members of their community at the cost of suppressing their emotions and denying their selves, to becoming their whole selves while symbolically remaining members of their communities through the forgiveness of their mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4283207887,"The identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants across the globe and their implications on the outspread of the pandemic, infection potential and resistance to vaccination, requires modification of the current diagnostic methods to map out viral mutations rapidly and reliably. Here, we demonstrate that integrating DNA barcoding technology, sample pooling and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) provide an applicable solution for large-population viral screening combined with specific variant analysis. Our solution allows high throughput testing by barcoding each sample, followed by pooling of test samples using a multi-step procedure. First, patient-specific barcodes are added to the primers used in a one-step RT-PCR reaction, amplifying three different viral genes and one human housekeeping gene (as internal control). Then, samples are pooled, purified and finally, the generated sequences are read using an Illumina NGS system to identify the positive samples with a sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 97.3%. Using this solution, we were able to identify six known and one unknown SARS-CoV-2 variants in a screen of 960 samples out of which 258 (27%) were positive for the virus. Thus, our diagnostic solution integrates the benefits of large population and epidemiological screening together with sensitive and specific identification of positive samples including variant analysis at a single nucleotide resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4283218514,"To evaluate if previously found associations between low serum bilirubin concentration and kidney function decline is independent of hemoglobin and other key confounders.Clinical trial data from the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial as well as the UK primary care electronic healthcare records, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), were used to construct three cohorts of patients at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The randomized clinical trial (RCT) cohort from the subset of SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial consisted of 10,555 type-2 diabetic patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The two observational data cohorts from CPRD consisted of 71,104 newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes (CPRD-DM2) and 82,065 newly diagnosed hypertensive (CPRD-HT) patients without diabetes. Cohorts were stratified according to baseline circulating total bilirubin levels to determine association on the primary end point of a 30% reduction from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the secondary end point of albuminuria.The confounder adjusted hazard ratios of the subpopulation with lower than median bilirubin levels compared to above median bilirubin levels for the primary end point were 1.18 (1.02-1.37), 1.12 (1.05-1.19) and 1.09 (1.01-1.17), for the secondary end point were 1.26 (1.06-1.52), 1.11 (1.01-1.21) and 1.18 (1.01-1.39) for SAVOR-TIMI 53, CPRD-DM2, CPRD-HT, respectively.Our findings are consistent across all cohorts and endpoints: lower serum bilirubin levels are associated with a greater kidney function decline independent of hemoglobin and other key confounders. This suggests that increased monitoring of kidney health in patients with lower bilirubin levels may be considered, especially for diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W4283257110,"As time plays a fundamental role in our social activities, scholars have studied temporal perception since the earliest days of experimental psychology. Since the 1960s, the ubiquity of color has been driving research on the potential effects of the colors red and blue on temporal perception and on its underlying mechanism. However, the results have been inconsistent, which could be attributed to the difficulty of controlling physical properties such as hue and luminance within and between studies. Therefore, we conducted a two-interval duration-discrimination task to evaluate the perceived duration of color stimuli under different equiluminant conditions: subjective or pupillary light reflex (PLR)-based equiluminance. The results, based on psychometric functional analyses and simultaneous pupillary recordings, showed that the perceived duration of red was overestimated compared with blue even when the intensity of the stimulus was controlled based on subjective equiluminance (Experiment 1). However, since blue is known to induce a larger PLR than red despite equiluminance, we conducted a controlled study to distinguish the indirect effect of pupillary response to temporal perception. Interestingly, the effect observed in Experiment 1 faded when the luminance levels of the two stimuli were matched based on PLR response (Experiment 2). These results indicate that duration judgement can be affected not only by the hue but also by different equiluminance methods. Furthermore, this causality between the equiluminance method and temporal perception can be explained by the fluctuations in incident light entering the pupil."
https://openalex.org/W4283264518,"Understanding non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among young people living with HIV (YLWH) is critical given the potential for aging-associated comorbidities resulting from HIV, especially in Cambodia where such data are limited. Therefore, we examined the prevalence and correlates of NCDs in YLWH and compared it to a nationally representative sample of young people not otherwise infected. We collected data from a sample of 370 YLWH aged 18-29 years attending three HIV clinics in Cambodia between 2019 and 2020. Our comparison group were 486 young people who participated in the Ministry of Health/WHO 2016 Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factor Surveillance (STEP survey). Both surveys used a standardized questionnaire to collect information on lifestyle factors and World Health Organization protocols for physical and biochemical measurements. We compared the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterolemia between the two groups and examined the relationship between these conditions and HIV. We found 16 (4%), 22 (6%), and 72 (20%) had diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterolemia, respectively, among YLWH, compared to 4 (1%), 22 (4%), and 49 (11%) among the general population. In logistic regression, YLWH were at higher odds of diabetes/prediabetes and high cholesterolemia compared with the young general population, aOR = 6.64 (95% CI 3.62-12.19) and aOR = 7.95 (95% CI 3.98-15.87), respectively. Our findings demonstrate that YLWH in Cambodia face multiple metabolic disorders and NCDs despite their young age and that accessible screening measures and treatment for these conditions are needed in order to combat NCDs in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4283033180,"Chaperones and other quality control machinery guard proteins from inappropriate aggregation, which is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. However, how the systems that regulate the ""foldedness"" of the proteome remain buffered under stress conditions and in different cellular compartments remains incompletely understood. In this study, we applied a FRET-based strategy to explore how well quality control machinery protects against the misfolding and aggregation of ""bait"" biosensor proteins, made from the prokaryotic ribonuclease barnase, in the nucleus and cytosol of human embryonic kidney 293T cells. We found that those barnase biosensors were prone to misfolding, were less engaged by quality control machinery, and more prone to inappropriate aggregation in the nucleus as compared with the cytosol, and that these effects could be regulated by chaperone Hsp70-related machinery. Furthermore, aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein (Httex1) in the cytosol appeared to outcompete and thus prevented the engagement of quality control machinery with the biosensor in the cytosol. This effect correlated with reduced levels of DNAJB1 and HSPA1A chaperones in the cell outside those sequestered to the aggregates, particularly in the nucleus. Unexpectedly, we found Httex1 aggregation also increased the apparent engagement of the barnase biosensor with quality control machinery in the nucleus suggesting an independent implementation of ""holdase"" activity of chaperones other than DNAJB1 and HSPA1A. Collectively, these results suggest that proteostasis stress can trigger a rebalancing of chaperone abundance in different subcellular compartments through a dynamic network involving different chaperone-client interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4283155915,"Current therapies for ischemic stroke focus on reperfusion but do not address the acute inflammatory response that results in significant reperfusion injury. To advance future therapies, a thorough understanding of the precise spatiotemporal underpinnings of leukocyte extravasation and infiltration is necessary. We describe the evolution of the inflammatory response in a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) stroke model at several time points after reperfusion and the modulation of this response with PECAM blockade.The transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion model (90 minutes of ischemia followed by reperfusion) was used to simulate large vessel occlusion stroke and recanalization. We used wide field and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the exact distribution of neutrophils with close examination of the leukocyte position with regard to the brain vasculature and the perivascular space. Flow cytometry of single cell suspensions was used to confirm cell identity at different time points post-stroke.Large ischemic strokes involving both the subcortex and cortex (over 20% of the ischemic hemisphere) were induced in mice. At 12 and 24 hours, leukocyte recruitment and extravasation was primarily localized to the cortical surface. This contrasts with other organs where there is considerable migration of neutrophils deep into the inflamed tissue by 24 hours. Flow cytometry showed at 24 hours a majority of leukocytes were neutrophils. Over 48 to 72 hours, leukocytes were increasingly found deeper into the subcortex. Throughout the infarct (determined with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining), leukocyte recruitment was not uniform but rather organized in clusters. Disrupting leukocyte diapedesis with PECAM function-blocking monoclonal antibody restricted leukocytes to within 500 microns of the surface when compared to control; and this was still evident at 72 hours (n=3 mice per group, p<0.01, Control 46% ± 4.0 %; PECAM-1 Ab 62% ± 5.0%). High-resolution wide-field microscopy confirmed inhibition of TEM by PECAM-1 blockade at 24 hours. Flow cytometry showed approximately equal numbers of monocytes and neutrophils at 72 hours.Our findings demonstrate that leukocyte infiltration into a stroke evolves over several days following reperfusion. The use of PECAM blockade modulates the natural progression of leukocytes into the infarcted stroke bed. A better understanding of leukocyte spatiotemporal infiltration and its regulators could help inform the next generation of therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4283170368,"Background Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a worldwide health problem without successful treatment. Aging is associate with obesity, which are known a risk factor that aggravate ALD. We and others have previously demonstrated that chronic plus binge alcohol increases adipose tissue lipolysis and promotes alcohol-induced liver injury through the adipose-liver crosstalk. In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy receptor protein SQSTM1/p62 in adipose-liver crosstalk and the effects of aging and obesity in ALD. Methods Whole-body p62 knockout (KO) and their matched wild type young (2-3 months) and aged (13-15 months) mice were subjected to chronic plus binge (Gao-binge) alcohol model. Adipose and liver tissues were collected for biochemical and histological analysis. Results p62 KO mice developed mature-onset obesity in aged mice with increased both white and brown adipose tissue mass. Gao-binge alcohol feeding decreased both the white and adipose mass regardless of the age and genotypes of mice. Alcohol feeding increased levels of serum free fatty acids regardless of the genotypes of the mice although the serum levels of glycerol only significantly increased in alcohol fed aged p62 KO mice. Alcohol feeding increased levels of serum ALT and hepatic triglyceride (TG) in both young and aged WT and p62 KO mice, but no significant differences were found among the young WT and p62 KO mice as well as aged WT vs young WT mice. However, alcohol-fed aged p62 KO mice had significantly higher levels of serum ALT and hepatic TG as well as fibrosis and inflammation markers than alcohol-fed aged WT mice. Mechanistically, aged p62 KO mice had increased de novo lipogenesis and senescence with increased senescence associated secretory phenotype with similar increased oxidative stress compared with matched WT mice. Conclusion We established a genetic obesity/metabolic syndrome mouse model with alcohol consumption. Loss of p62 in aged mice leads to obesity with metabolic syndrome that exacerbates alcohol-induced liver injury via increased de novo lipogenesis and senescence."
https://openalex.org/W4283206724,"During skeletal myogenesis, the zinc-finger transcription factors SNAI1 and SNAI2, are expressed in proliferating myoblasts and regulate the transition to terminally differentiated myotubes while repressing pro-differentiation genes. Here, we demonstrate that SNAI1 is upregulated in vivo during the early phase of muscle regeneration induced by bupivacaine injury. Using shRNA-mediated gene silencing in C2C12 myoblasts and whole-transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a collection of genes belonging to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway whose expression, induced by myogenic differentiation, was upregulated in absence of SNAI1. Among these, key ER stress genes, such as Atf3, Ddit3/Chop, Hspa5/Bip, and Fgf21, a myokine involved in muscle differentiation, were strongly upregulated. Furthermore, by promoter mutant analysis and Chromatin immune precipitation assay, we demonstrated that SNAI1 represses Fgf21 and Atf3 in proliferating myoblasts by directly binding to multiple E boxes in their respective promoter regions. Together, these data describe a new regulatory mechanism of myogenic differentiation involving the direct repressive action of SNAI1 on ER stress and Fgf21 expression, ultimately contributing to maintaining the proliferative and undifferentiated state of myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W4283210946,"Objectives Psychosis is a well established complication of non-prescription drug use. We sought to measure the 1-year mortality of emergency department patients with substance-induced psychosis (SIP). Methods This study was a multi-centre, retrospective electronic medical records review of patients presenting to the ED with substance-induced psychosis (SIP). We interrogated the hospital ED database from Jan 1, 2018 and Jan 1, 2019 to identify consecutive patients. All patients were followed for one year from index visit, and classified as alive/dead at that time. Patients were included in the study if they met the following criteria: 1) ED discharge diagnosis of psychosis NOS and a positive urine drugs of abuse screen (UDAS) or the patient verbally endorsed drug use, or 2) Mental disorder due to drug use and “disorganized thought”, “bizarre behavior” or “delusional behavior” documented in the chart and one or more of the following criteria: a) arrival with police, b) mental health certification, c) physical restraints, d) chemical restraints. We excluded patients who were not British Columbia residents, since we were unable to ascertain if they were alive or dead at 1 year from their index ED visit. Primary statistical analysis was logistic regression for risk of death in 1 year, based on plausible risk factors, selected a priori. Results We identified 813 presentations for SIP (620 unique patients). The median age of the entire cohort was 35 years (IQR 28–44), and 69.5% (n = 565) were male. Thirty five patients (4.3%; 95% CI 3.2–5.9) had died one year after their initial presentation to the ED for SIP. Separate multivariable logistic regression analyses, controlling for age, demonstrated schizophrenia (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.8–11.1) significantly associated with increased 1-year mortality. Conclusions In our study of patients presenting to the ED with SIP, the 1-year mortality was 4.3%. Controlling for age, schizophrenia was a notable risk factor for increased 1-year mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4283216151,"Nonlinear correlation exists in many types of biomedical data. Several types of pairwise gene expression in humans and other organisms show nonlinear correlation across time, e.g., genes involved in human T helper (Th17) cells differentiation, which motivated this study. The proposed procedure, called Kernelized correlation (Kc), first transforms nonlinear data on the plane via a function (kernel, usually nonlinear) to a high-dimensional (Hilbert) space. Next, we plug the transformed data into a classical correlation coefficient, e.g., Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), to yield a nonlinear correlation measure. The algorithm to compute Kc is developed and the R code is provided online. In three simulated nonlinear cases, when noise in data is moderate, Kc with the RBF kernel (Kc-RBF) outperforms Pearson's r and the well-known distance correlation (dCor). However, when noise in data is low, Pearson's r and dCor perform slightly better than (equivalently to) Kc-RBF in Case 1 and 3 (in Case 2); Kendall's tau performs worse than the aforementioned measures in all cases. In Application 1 to discover genes involved in the early Th17 cell differentiation, Kc is shown to detect the nonlinear correlations of four genes with IL17A (a known marker gene), while dCor detects nonlinear correlations of two pairs, and DESeq fails in all these pairs. Next, Kc outperforms Pearson's and dCor, in estimating the nonlinear correlation of negatively correlated gene pairs in yeast cell cycle regulation. In conclusion, Kc is a simple and competent procedure to measure pairwise nonlinear correlations."
https://openalex.org/W4283258618,"Background Practice-integrated education and professional development programs (also known as residencies), have been available to pharmacists in America and the United Kingdom for many years. In 2016, the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia launched Australia’s novel Foundation Residency Program to support the development of early-career pharmacists, and has been implemented across many hospitals nationally. This model was adopted by the South Australian (SA) public hospital pharmacy statewide service and was granted full accreditation. The study aimed to explore key stakeholders’ expectations and early perceptions of the structure, role and impact of the SA program and in that process, to identify key influencing factors and strategies informing future program planning and design. Methods Purposeful sampling was adopted to recruit participants who oversee preceptors and residents, across all employment levels and pharmacy service sites. Stakeholders participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcribed dataset was managed using NVivo software TM (version 10) and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis through the lens of the PRECEDE-PROCEED logic model framework. Results Thirty-three staff consented to participate. Participants were de-identified with a randomly assigned code number. Three key themes were identified using reflexive thematic analysis; alignment of program goals and visions, culture shift to prioritising workforce development as core business, program structure supports focused workforce development. Conclusions Participants view the residency as beneficial for development of the residents, preceptors, and the hospital pharmacy workforce. The multisite structure was a strength of the program. Whilst it was acknowledged that the rotations, cross-site rotations, and research project presented challenges, they were deemed worth the investment. Overall, it was felt that incremental increases in program capacity will occur over time, as culture changes, and as investing in workforce development becomes core business. The findings have led to several key recommendations to guide program expansion."
https://openalex.org/W4283262343,"The preliminary assessments of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have recently rekindled worries about the feasibility of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Notwithstanding the concern voiced by key academic and political actors, the actual evidence on the current gaps and distance from the goals is still very much unknown. This study estimates the global evolution curves for each health-related SDGs indicator in the World Health Organization's SDGs platform. These curves synthesize the transnational trends at play in the evolution of each health-related topic, offering an average global counterfactual to compare with the actual information for each country. The empirical investigation focuses on the American continent, highlighting the health gaps before the COVID-19 outbreak in 33 countries of the region. The study also extrapolates these trends to predict the evolution of the health-related SDGs in each of these countries over the next decade using as the baseline scenario the International Monetary Fund's economic forecasts. The results show a widening gap in the region, associated with the differential economic capacity of these countries. Some bottlenecks are shared by most countries in the continent, especially in the themes of violence and infectious diseases. The latter is likely to improve faster than other health themes in the next decade, whereas improvements in the theme non-communicable diseases can be more challenging. The findings provide much needed comparative evidence to guide the countries in the region to set priorities and concentrate efforts to accelerate progress in the health-related SDGs."
https://openalex.org/W4283262650,"Reproductive and genetic medicine are evolving rapidly, and new technologies are already impacting current practices. This includes technologies that can identify a couples’ risk of having a child with a genetic disorder. Responsible implementation of new technologies requires evaluation of safety and ethics. Valuable insights for shaping governance processes are provided by various stakeholders involved, including healthcare professionals. Their willingness to adopt these technologies and guide the necessary systemic changes is required for the successful implementation of these technologies. In this study, twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals from different disciplines in the field of reproductive and genetic healthcare in the Netherlands. Three emerging technologies were discussed: expanded carrier screening (ECS), non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and germline genome editing (GGE). By probing stakeholders’ views, we explored how culture, structure and practice in healthcare is being shaped by innovations and changing dynamics in genetic and reproductive medicine. The general consensus was that the implementation of reproductive genetic technologies nationwide is a slow process in Dutch healthcare. A “typical Dutch approach” emerged that is characterized by restrictive legislation, broad support for people living with disabilities, values of an egalitarian society and limited commercialisation. Different scenarios for embedding ECS in future practice were envisioned, while implementation of NIPD in clinical practice was considered obvious. Views on GGE varied among stakeholders. Previous implementation examples in the Netherlands suggest introduction of new technology involves an organized collective learning process, with pilot studies and stepwise implementation. In addition, introducing and scaling up new technologies is complex due to perceived barriers from the legislative framework and the complex relationship between the government and stakeholders in this area. This paper describes how the international trends and advances of technologies are expected to manifest itself in a national setting."

Methods Analysis of the Survey on Living with Chronic Disease in Canada–Arthritis Component. Respondents aged ≥20 years with health professional-diagnosed arthritis (n = 4,385) were characterized as reporting DK, OA or IAA. Variables: arthritis characteristics (duration, number and site of joints affected), arthritis impact (current pain and fatigue, difficulty in sleeping and daily activities, impact on life), health (self-rated general and mental health, life stress), arthritis management strategies (seeing health professionals, medication use, assistive devices, receipt of arthritis information, self-management activities). Multinomial logistic and log-Poisson regressions were used, as appropriate, to compare the DK to the OA and IAA groups. Results In this arthritis sample, 44.2% were in the DK group, 38.3% reported OA and 17.5% reported IAA. Those in the DK group were more likely to be younger, have low income, low education, and be of non-white cultural background compared to those with OA. There were no significant differences in arthritis impact, but the DK group was less likely to have received information on, or have used, arthritis management strategies. Conclusions The sociodemographic characteristics of the DK group suggest they likely have lower health literacy. They were less likely to have accessed health care and other support services, indicating this is an important group for health education, both for individuals with arthritis and health care providers."
https://openalex.org/W4283274291,"Background Mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, both with axillary lymph node dissection, are common treatments for early-stage breast cancer. Monopolar electrocautery is typically used for both procedures, despite evidence of improved clinical outcomes with HARMONIC FOCUS™+. This analysis evaluated the budget impact of adopting HARMONIC FOCUS™+ versus monopolar electrocautery for patients undergoing these procedures from an Italian hospital perspective. Methods Total costs for an annual caseload of 100 patients undergoing mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, with axillary lymph node dissection, with either the intervention or comparator were calculated. Italian clinical and cost input data were utilised. The analysis included costs for the device, operating room time, postoperative length of stay, treating seroma and managing postoperative chest wall drainage. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed uncertainty of model input values. Two scenario analyses investigated the impact of conservative estimates of postoperative length of stay reduction and daily hospital cost on the simulated cost difference. Results HARMONIC FOCUS™+ achieves annual savings of EUR 100,043 compared with monopolar electrocautery, derived from lower costs for operating room time, postoperative length of stay and seroma and postoperative chest wall drainage management, offsetting the incremental device cost increase (EUR 43,268). Cost savings are maintained in scenario analyses and across all variations in parameters in deterministic sensitivity analysis, with postoperative hospital stay costs being key drivers of budget impact. The mean (interquartile range) cost savings with HARMONIC FOCUS™+ versus monopolar electrocautery in probabilistic sensitivity analysis are EUR 101,637 (EUR 64,390–137,093) with a 98% probability of being cost saving. Conclusions The intervention demonstrates robust cost savings compared with monopolar electrocautery for mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, with axillary lymph node dissection, in an Italian hospital setting, and improved clinical and resource outcomes. These findings, with other clinical and cost analyses, support HARMONIC FOCUS™+ use in this setting."

https://openalex.org/W4283165663,"BAZ1B is one of several genes deleted in Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a complex, multisystem genetic condition that occurs in ~1 in 8000 live births. Also known as Williams Syndrome Transcription Factor (WSTF), BAZ1B is thought to be essential for neural crest migration. To evaluate the impact of Baz1b loss of function, we evaluated the “knockout first” allele of Baz1btm2a(KOMP)Wtsi. Quantitative PCR revealed markedly reduced, but not absent, expression of Baz1b, suggesting that Baz1btm2a(KOMP)Wtsi mutants are knockdowns rather than knockouts. Homozygous Baz1btm2a(KOMP)Wtsi mutant mice die just hours after birth, and both homozygous mutants and heterozygotes are smaller than age-matched wildtype littermates. Survival analyses conducted on 388 Baz1btm2a(KOMP)Wtsi mice revealed that heterozygotes and homozygous mutants are approximately three and sixteen times more likely to die than wildtype mice, respectively [hazard ratio for death in Baz1b+/-: 3.04 (95% CI, 1.83-5.06), p<0.0001; hazard ratio for death in Baz1b-/-: 15.83 (95% CI, 8.54-29.37); p<0.0001]. Furthermore, a linear mixed effects model for the weights of wildtype and heterozygous mice over a 29-day period showed a significant difference in size based on genotype (mean: WT 7.97 g, Baz1b+/-6.56 g, p<0.0001). Because neural crest lineages contribute to cardiac development, structure, and function, we hypothesized that early sudden death and failure to thrive in mutant mice may be at least partially attributable to cardiac abnormalities. To evaluate any morphologic and functional abnormalities, we performed microCT and echocardiography. MicroCT analysis of the hearts from P0 pups did not reveal congenital heart disease typical of neural crest defects (e.g. tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, double outlet right ventricle, or interrupted aortic arch). Echocardiograms, performed at 1-month to align with the growth analysis timeline, revealed mildly decreased ejection fraction (EF, median: WT 64%, Baz1b+/- 56%, p<0.01) and fractional shortening (FS, median: WT 34%, Baz1b+/-29%, p<0.01), increased left ventricular internal dimension at diastole (LViDd) normalized to animal size (median: WT 0.22 mm/g, Baz1b+/- 0.27 mm/g, p<0.05), and unchanged left ventricular posterior wall dimension at diastole (LVPWd) normalized to body size (median: WT 0.041 mm/g, Baz1b+/-0.048 mm/g, p=0.19) in Baz1b+/- when compared to wildtype. However, Baz1b+/- LVPWd is significantly smaller than WT when body size is not considered (median: WT 0.63 mm, Baz1b+/-0.62 mm, p<0.01), suggesting a relationship between cardiac function and mutant animal growth (all tests for genotype in n=14 WT and n=14 Baz1b+/- by Mann-Whitney U Test). Taken together, our data suggest that Baz1b+/- mice exhibit a dilated cardiomyopathy and that dosage for this gene may contribute to early death, decreased somatic growth, and cardiac abnormalities in Baz1b mutant mice. Additional analyses in older mice and with mutants generated using the conditional Baz1btm2a(KOMP)Wtsi allele will allow us to better explore the mechanisms of both the growth failure and cardiomyopathy phenotypes in this model."
https://openalex.org/W4283206206,"Abstract Ankyrin repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (ANKFN1) is reported to be involved in human height and developmental abnormalities, but the expression profile and molecular function of ANKFN1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance and biological function of ANKFN1 in HCC and investigate whether ANKFN1 can be used for differential diagnosis in HCC. Here, we showed that ANKFN1 was upregulated in 126 tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous tissues in HCC patients. The upregulation of ANKFN1 in HCC was associated with cirrhosis, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and poor prognosis. Moreover, silencing ANKFN1 expression suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and subcutaneous tumorigenesis in vivo. However, ANKFN1 overexpression promoted HCC proliferation and metastasis in an orthotopic liver transplantation model and attenuated the above biological effects in HCC cells. ANKFN1 significantly affected HCC cell proliferation by inducing G1/S transition and cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ANKFN1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via activation of the cyclin D1/Cdk4/Cdk6 pathway by stimulating the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, ANKFN1-induced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were partially reversed by ERK1/2 inhibitors. Taken together, our results indicate that ANKFN1 promotes HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by activating the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Our work also suggests that ANKFN1 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC."

In the quantitative analyses, we apply interrupted time series analysis and difference-in-differences analysis to data on antisocial behaviour derived from CCTV footage, and to police calls-for-service data. In the qualitative analysis, we apply thematic analysis to data from semi-structured interviews with 33 local stakeholders. We find a statistically significant increase in observed antisocial behaviour, but statistically significant decreases in violence and drug and alcohol offences, except when other small cities are used as a control group. In the qualitative analysis, a large majority of interviewees thought that the policy had reduced alcohol-related harm and increased safety, although a number of possible unintended consequences were also noted, including a reallocation of police resources, a redistribution of night-time drinking towards the suburbs, and a change in the demand for taxi companies. Overall, there is evidence only that the policies have reduced perceived alcohol-related harm, rather than reducing measures of harm."

There are few published studies examining the reliability of commonly used performance analysis tools. The aim of this project was to assess the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the NetballStats application and to make comparisons between live and video-based coding situations. Two ‘coders’ coded eight netball matches using the NetballStats application, coding each match live, then twice from video. Level of agreement was assessed for frequency counts across the variables coded. Results showed that intra-rater agreement was higher than inter-rater agreement and that reliability from video coding is better than from live coding. High frequency events automatically coded by the application and events that are well defined had greater levels of agreement than lower frequency events and subjectively judged events. Live coding situations underrepresent occurrence of events, particularly for high frequency events such as ‘possession’. To ensure reliability between coders, clubs should provide an extensive training program to coders with clear instructions on coding subjective events. Coaches should be aware that live coding underestimates some event types and factor this into their decision making processes."
https://openalex.org/W4283263152,"The first COVID-19 case in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was reported on 10 March 2020 in Kinshasa, prompting the government to promote internationally agreed non-pharmacological interventions for infection prevention and control. Public compliance to these measures is critical and depends on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of communities regarding COVID-19, for which there was no data. This study aimed to bridge that gap.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kinshasa in June 2020, during the emergency state, following a four-stage sampling process. Master's students from the Kinshasa School of Public Health conducted the survey. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed.The study enrolled 726 women and 600 men (mean age: 43; SD 16-85). Nearly everyone heard about COVID-19 (mainly through television, radio, and street reports), but only 17% were highly knowledgeable about its transmission modes, signs and symptoms, and preventive measures. More than 80% of participants believed in the disease's seriousness; however, only 21% found the total lockdown acceptable. Nonetheless, 86% reported regular hand cleaning and mask-wearing followed by physical distancing (72%). Poorer, younger, and non-Catholic participants were overall markedly less knowledgeable and had comparatively lower levels of health-protective attitudes, acceptance, and practices. The education level and household size did not matter. Female participants tended to show fewer enabling attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 prevention measures compared to men.Adequate public health information to improve the population's KAP related to COVID-19 is critical and must be designed with and delivered to the community-considering the specific needs of diverse sub-groups and contexts. Studies in Kinshasa and similar settings are necessary to understand the barriers to and enablers of acquiring, applying, and maintaining the optimal population's KAP for COVID-19 prevention and control."
