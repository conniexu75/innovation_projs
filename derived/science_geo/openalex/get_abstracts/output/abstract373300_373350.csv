https://openalex.org/W2014704298,"A-Maize-ing Maize is one of our oldest and most important crops, having been domesticated approximately 9000 years ago in central Mexico. Schnable et al. (p. 1112 ; see the cover) present the results of sequencing the B73 inbred maize line. The findings elucidate how maize became diploid after an ancestral doubling of its chromosomes and reveals transposable element movement and activity and recombination. Vielle-Calzada et al. (p. 1078 ) have sequenced the Palomero Toluqueño ( Palomero ) landrace, a highland popcorn from Mexico, which, when compared to the B73 line, reveals multiple loci impacted by domestication. Swanson-Wagner et al. (p. 1118 ) exploit possession of the genome to analyze expression differences occurring between lines. The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations among lines was used by Gore et al. (p. 1115 ) to generate a Haplotype map of maize. While chromosomal diversity in maize is high, it is likely that recombination is the major force affecting the levels of heterozygosity in maize. The availability of the maize genome will help to guide future agricultural and biofuel applications (see the Perspective by Feuillet and Eversole )."
https://openalex.org/W1970311849,Maize is an important crop species of high genetic diversity. We identified and genotyped several million sequence polymorphisms among 27 diverse maize inbred lines and discovered that the genome was characterized by highly divergent haplotypes and showed 10- to 30-fold variation in recombination rates. Most chromosomes have pericentromeric regions with highly suppressed recombination that appear to have influenced the effectiveness of selection during maize inbred development and may be a major component of heterosis. We found hundreds of selective sweeps and highly differentiated regions that probably contain loci that are key to geographic adaptation. This survey of genetic diversity provides a foundation for uniting breeding efforts across the world and for dissecting complex traits through genome-wide association studies.

https://openalex.org/W1963978672,"The Mizoroki-Heck reaction, which couples aryl halides with olefins, has been widely used to stitch together the carbogenic cores of numerous complex organic molecules. Given that the position-selective introduction of a halide onto an arene is not always straightforward, direct olefination of aryl carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds would obviate the inefficiencies associated with generating halide precursors or their equivalents. However, methods for carrying out such a reaction have suffered from narrow substrate scope and low positional selectivity. We report an operationally simple, atom-economical, carboxylate-directed Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H olefination reaction with phenylacetic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid substrates, using oxygen at atmospheric pressure as the oxidant. The positional selectivity can be tuned by introducing amino acid derivatives as ligands. We demonstrate the versatility of the method through direct elaboration of commercial drug scaffolds and efficient syntheses of 2-tetralone and naphthoic acid natural product cores."
https://openalex.org/W2104400024,"Chromosomal translocations are a hallmark of leukemia/lymphoma and also appear in solid tumors, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. By establishing a cellular model that mimics the relative frequency of authentic translocation events without proliferation selection, we report mechanisms of nuclear receptor-dependent tumor translocations. Intronic binding of liganded androgen receptor (AR) first juxtaposes translocation loci by triggering intra- and interchromosomal interactions. AR then promotes site-specific DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at translocation loci by recruiting two types of enzymatic activities induced by genotoxic stress and liganded AR, including activation-induced cytidine deaminase and the LINE-1 repeat-encoded ORF2 endonuclease. These enzymes synergistically generate site-selective DSBs at juxtaposed translocation loci that are ligated by nonhomologous end joining pathway for specific translocations. Our data suggest that the confluence of two parallel pathways initiated by liganded nuclear receptor and genotoxic stress underlies nonrandom tumor translocations, which may function in many types of tumors and pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2044292152,"Fanconi Cross-Links Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disease characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and dramatically increased cancer susceptibility. Cells derived from Fanconi anemia patients are sensitive to agents that cause DNA interstrand cross-links, indicating that under normal circumstances the Fanconi pathway controls the repair of these DNA lesions. Knipscheer et al. (p. 1698 , published online 12 November) found that two Fanconi anemia proteins, FANCI and FANCD2, promoted the DNA replication–coupled repair of interstrand cross-links in cell extracts. The FANCI-FANCD2 complex was required for the incisions that unhook the cross-link and for the insertion of a nucleotide across from the damaged template base during lesion bypass."
https://openalex.org/W1994889754,"Although the North American megafaunal extinctions and the formation of novel plant communities are well-known features of the last deglaciation, the causal relationships between these phenomena are unclear. Using the dung fungus Sporormiella and other paleoecological proxies from Appleman Lake, Indiana, and several New York sites, we established that the megafaunal decline closely preceded enhanced fire regimes and the development of plant communities that have no modern analogs. The loss of keystone megaherbivores may thus have altered ecosystem structure and function by the release of palatable hardwoods from herbivory pressure and by fuel accumulation. Megafaunal populations collapsed from 14,800 to 13,700 years ago, well before the final extinctions and during the Bølling-Allerød warm period. Human impacts remain plausible, but the decline predates Younger Dryas cooling and the extraterrestrial impact event proposed to have occurred 12,900 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2079321797,"Recruiting the Components for Cell Division A complete chromosome set must be apportioned to each daughter cell during cell division. A number of molecular mechanisms check that chromosome pairs or homologs are correctly aligned and attached to microtubules just before they separate to the two daughters; their spatial orientation ensures an even inheritance of the genome. One critical component of this system is the protein kinase Bub1. Kawashima et al. (p. 172 , see the Perspective by Javerzat ; published online 19 November) now show that the main substrate for Bub1 kinase activity in fission yeast is the chromatin protein histone H2A. Phosphorylation of H2A recruits the shugoshin proteins to chromatin, and especially to centromeres, where they also act to ensure correct chromosome segregation. This link between Bub1, histone H2A phosphorylation, and shugoshin is conserved in budding yeast and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046087996,"Quick Spin Flips Quantum computation holds the tantalizing promise of vastly improving the efficiency of traditional computers. Among the many solid-state candidates for storing and manipulating quantum information, nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond are especially attractive because they can be used at room temperature and stay operational for milliseconds at a time. To use this coherence time efficiently, it is important to achieve fast manipulation of the spins in the system. Fuchs et al. (p. 1520 , published online 19 November; see the Perspective by Gerardot and Öhberg ) used pulses of strong microwave magnetic field to probe the dynamics of single spins in a nitrogen vacancy center. In this “strong-driving” nonlinear regime, extremely quick spin flips of less than a nanosecond in duration were observed, offering the possibility that up to a million operations could be performed on a single spin during its coherence time."
https://openalex.org/W1996519776,"Local Selection of Magic Traits Ecological interactions can favor specialization, and sexual selection can induce reproductive isolation; however, these processes are insufficient by themselves to create new species. They must act in concert and on the same set of genes. Van Doorn et al. (p. 1704 , published online 26 November; see the Perspective by Mank ) present a theoretical model that shows that within a larger population the evolution of mating preferences will favor sexual ornaments that indicate the degree of adaptation to the local ecological conditions, for example, the abundant song of a male bird that can obtain food easily because it has the right bill size for the seeds in that locale. Once mate choice evolves on the basis of a signal of local adaptation, natural and sexual selection will mutually enforce each other, ultimately leading to speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2003100061,"Under certain circumstances, three or more interacting particles may form bound states. While the general few-body problem is not analytically solvable, the so-called Efimov trimers appear for a system of three particles with resonant two-body interactions. The binding energies of these trimers are predicted to be universally connected to each other, independent of the microscopic details of the interaction. By exploiting a Feshbach resonance to widely tune the interactions between trapped ultracold lithium atoms, we find evidence for two universally connected Efimov trimers and their associated four-body bound states. A total of eleven precisely determined three- and four-body features are found in the inelastic loss spectrum. Their relative locations on either side of the resonance agree well with universal theory, while a systematic deviation from universality is found when comparing features across the resonance."

https://openalex.org/W1963874139,"Acidic Ocean One consequence of the historically unprecedented level of CO 2 in the atmosphere that fossil fuel burning has caused, in addition to a warmer climate, is higher concentrations of dissolved CO 2 in the oceans. This dissolved CO 2 makes the oceans more acidic, and thus less saturated with respect to calcium carbonate. This has important ramifications for organisms that have calcium carbonate skeletons, which depend for their survival on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the waters where they live. Yamamoto-Kawai et al. (p. 1098 ) report that in 2008, surface waters of the Canada Basin became undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a relatively soluble form of calcium carbonate incorporated into the shells or skeletons of many types of marine plankton and invertebrate. This undersaturation occurred much sooner than had been anticipated and has important implications for the composition of the Arctic ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2015133408,"Gardening for Ants and Termites Among the social insects, ants and termites are the most diverse and ecologically dominant. Termites are known to engage in a mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and Pinto-Tomás et al. (p. 1120 ) have identified similar relationships occurring among leaf-cutter ants, which maintain specialized nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their fungus gardens. Together, these mutualisms are a major source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. How is the evolutionary stability of such mutualistic cooperation maintained? Aanen et al. (p. 1103 ) show that the Termitomyces fungus cultured by termites remains highly related because mycelia of the same clone fuse together and grow more efficiently to out-compete rare clones."
https://openalex.org/W2145909184,"The site on HIV-1 gp120 that binds to the CD4 receptor is vulnerable to antibodies. However, most antibodies that interact with this site cannot neutralize HIV-1. To understand the basis of this resistance, we determined co-crystal structures for two poorly neutralizing, CD4-binding site (CD4BS) antibodies, F105 and b13, in complexes with gp120. Both antibodies exhibited approach angles to gp120 similar to those of CD4 and a rare, broadly neutralizing CD4BS antibody, b12. Slight differences in recognition, however, resulted in substantial differences in F105- and b13-bound conformations relative to b12-bound gp120. Modeling and binding experiments revealed these conformations to be poorly compatible with the viral spike. This incompatibility, the consequence of slight differences in CD4BS recognition, renders HIV-1 resistant to all but the most accurately targeted antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1973978759,"Robust control over the positions, orientations, and assembly of nonspherical colloids may aid in the creation of new types of structured composite materials that are important from both technological and fundamental standpoints. With the use of lithographically fabricated equilateral polygonal platelets, we demonstrate that colloidal interactions and self-assembly in anisotropic nematic fluids can be effectively tailored via control over the particles' shapes. The particles disturb the uniform alignment of the surrounding nematic host, resulting in both a distinct equilibrium alignment and highly directional pair interactions. Interparticle forces between polygonal platelets exhibit either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetries, depending on whether their number of sides is odd or even, and drive the assembly of a number of ensuing self-assembled colloidal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2022554776,"Several common genetic variations have been associated with type 2 diabetes, but the exact disease mechanisms are still poorly elucidated. Using congenic strains from the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rat, we identified a 1.4-megabase genomic locus that was linked to impaired insulin granule docking at the plasma membrane and reduced beta cell exocytosis. In this locus, Adra2a, encoding the alpha2A-adrenergic receptor [alpha(2A)AR], was significantly overexpressed. Alpha(2A)AR mediates adrenergic suppression of insulin secretion. Pharmacological receptor antagonism, silencing of receptor expression, or blockade of downstream effectors rescued insulin secretion in congenic islets. Furthermore, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human ADRA2A gene for which risk allele carriers exhibited overexpression of alpha(2A)AR, reduced insulin secretion, and increased type 2 diabetes risk. Human pancreatic islets from risk allele carriers exhibited reduced granule docking and secreted less insulin in response to glucose; both effects were counteracted by pharmacological alpha(2A)AR antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2026967280,"A Glimpse of Wet Carbonic Acid Both carbon dioxide and bicarbonate play extraordinarily widespread roles in biochemical and geochemical reactions. It is surprising therefore that carbonic acid, the intermediate in the water-coupled interconversion of these two compounds, has never been directly characterized in aqueous solution. Adamczyk et al. (p. 1690 , published online 12 November) have succeeded in glimpsing the elusive acid by inducing an aqueous photoacid (a compound rendered transiently more acidic upon light absorption) to react with dissolved bicarbonate. Using infrared spectroscopy, they show that the carbonic acid product persists for nanoseconds. Analysis of its formation kinetics affords a direct p K a value of 3.5, substantially lower than the effective value derived from observations of the net bicarbonate/carbon dioxide equilibrium."

Microquasars have proved difficult to detect in high-energy gamma rays (&gt; 100 megaelectron volts). Using the Fermi Large Area Telescope, Abdo et al. (p. 1512 , published online 26 November; see the Perspective by Bignami ) now report the detection of variable gamma-ray emission from the microquasar Cygnus X-3. The gamma-ray flux is modulated at the orbital period of Cygnus X-3, and its variation is correlated with the radio emission originating from the microquasar's relativistic jets."
https://openalex.org/W2064396596,"Dysbindin Function in Synaptic Homeostasis Homeostatic signaling systems are widely believed to stabilize neural function over prolonged periods of time. However, the molecular mechanisms of homeostatic signaling in the nervous system are largely unknown, and direct links between defective homeostatic signaling and disease-causing genes remain obscure. Dickman and Davis (p. 1127 ) performed a large-scale, electrophysiology-based genetic screen for mutations that specifically disrupt synaptic homeostasis. DTNBP1 is one of two genes that are most strongly and consistently associated with schizophrenia susceptibility in humans. The Drosophila homolog of DTNBP1 (dysbindin) was identified in the screen and was found to function during synapse development, baseline neurotransmission, and synaptic homeostasis. Dysbindin altered the calcium-dependence of vesicle release and was essential in the presynaptic neuron for both the induction and expression of synaptic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2020363034,"Dissecting TFIIB Mechanics Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) requires five protein cofactors for promoter recognition and initiation of transcription. The factor TFIIB is implicated in start site selection and stabilization of the initial transcript. The co-crystal structure of Pol II and TFIIB showed an N-terminal “finger” region located in the RNA exit channel, but the core C-terminal region of TFIIB was disordered. Now Liu et al. (p. 206 ; published online 12 November) present a structure of the same complex determined under different conditions in which the C-terminal structure is well localized but the finger is disordered. Docking DNA into the structure suggests that the C-terminal region stabilizes initial promoter melting. After transcription of a few bases, TFIIB probably switches to the alternate conformation where the C-terminal region is released and the finger region stabilizes the initial transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2027572818,"Periplasmic Redox Regulation The oxidation state of intracellular and extracellular proteins are carefully managed by cellular redox machineries. Depuydt et al. (p. 1109 ) discovered a reducing system that protects single cysteine residues from oxidation in the bacterial periplasm. DsbG, a thioredoxin-related protein, appears to be a key player in that system and is the first reductase identified in the periplasm of Escherichia coli . Together with DsbC, DsbG controls the global sulfenic acid content of this compartment. Sulfenic acid formation is a major posttranslational modification in the periplasm, and three homologous L,D-transpeptidases are substrates of DsbG. Sulfenic acid formation is not restricted to E. coli , but is ubiquitous. Because proteins from the thioredoxin superfamily are widespread, similar thioredoxin-related proteins may control cellular sulfenic acid more widely."

Understanding how these ancient deposits form may lead to more efficient metal extraction and give clues about early Earth. Bekker et al. (p. 1086 ) studied sulfur and iron isotopes in 2.7-billion-year old Fe-Ni sulfide deposits from Canada and Australia and found that most of the metal-scavenging sulfur was originally atmospheric in origin. Photochemical reactions in the ancient oxygen-free atmosphere produced sulfide that eventually circulated to the sea floor and mixed with newly erupted komatite magmas. Thus, global surface processes in the oceans, atmosphere, and on continents are geochemically linked to ore-forming processes within Earth."

Cluster formation prevents transfer of copper from the chaperone to target enzymes. The results provide a basis for developing drugs that target metallation pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2091817043,What qualifies a neural representation for a role in subjective experience? Previous evidence suggests that the duration and intensity of the neural response to a sensory stimulus are factors. We introduce another attribute--the reproducibility of a pattern of neural activity across different episodes--that predicts specific and measurable differences between conscious and nonconscious neural representations independently of duration and intensity. We found that conscious neural activation patterns are relatively reproducible when compared with nonconscious neural activation patterns corresponding to the same perceptual content. This is not adequately explained by a difference in signal-to-noise ratio.
https://openalex.org/W1964323868,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is an important element against permeability of bactericidal agents, including antimicrobial peptides. However, structural determinants of antimicrobial peptides for LPS recognition are not clearly understood. Pardaxins (Pa1, Pa2, Pa3, and Pa4) are a group of pore-forming bactericidal peptides found in the mucous glands of sole fishes. Despite having a low net positive charge, pardaxins contain a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities. To elucidate the structural basis of LPS interactions of pardaxins, herein, we report the first three-dimensional structure of Pa4 bound to LPS micelles. The binding kinetics of Pa4 with LPS is estimated using [15N-Leu-19] relaxation dispersion NMR experiments. LPS/Pa4 interactions are further characterized by a number of biophysical methods, including isothermal titration calorimetry, 31P NMR, saturation transfer difference NMR, dynamic light scattering, and IR spectroscopy. In the LPS-Pa4 complex, Pa4 adopts a unique helix-turn-helix conformation resembling a “horseshoe.” Interestingly, the LPS-bound structure of Pa4 shows striking differences with the structures determined in lipid micelles or organic solvents. Saturation transfer difference NMR identifies residues of Pa4 that are intimately associated with LPS micelles. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into the outer membrane permeabilization by pardaxin."

https://openalex.org/W2062560208,"The development of some solid tumors is associated with overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and often correlates with poor prognosis. Near field scanning optical microscopy, a technique with subdiffraction-limited optical resolution, was used to examine the influence of two inhibitors (the chimeric 225 antibody and tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor AG1478) on the nanoscale clustering of EGFR in HeLa cells. The EGFR is organized in small clusters, average diameter of 150 nm, on the plasma membrane for both control and EGF-treated cells. The numbers of receptors in individual clusters vary from as few as one or two proteins to greater than 100. Both inhibitors yield an increased cluster density and an increase in the fraction of clusters with smaller diameters and fewer receptors. Exposure to AG1478 also decreases the fraction of EGFR that colocalizes with both rafts and caveolae. EGF stimulation results in a significant loss of the full-length EGFR from the plasma membrane with the concomitant appearance of low molecular mass proteolytic products. By contrast, AG1478 reduces the level of EGFR degradation.

IntroductionThe plasma membrane of the cell is a complex, carefully regulated, dynamic structure that is compartmentalized into cell surface domains such as lipid rafts, caveolae, and clathrin-coated pits (1Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are postulated to be dynamic nanodomains ranging in size from 10 to 200 nm that are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and certain proteins and that play an important role in assembling signaling complexes (2Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar, 4Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1597-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Caveolae are invaginated lipid raft domains (50–150 nm) whose stability at the plasma membrane is attributable to the formation of stable oligomers of their coat protein, caveolin-1 (5Parton R.G. Hanzal-Bayer M. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Caveolae are thought to serve as concentrators of various signal transduction machineries. Clathrin-coated pits (100–150 nm) internalize rapidly upon formation at the plasma membrane, and their lateral cell surface mobility is enhanced by actin cytoskeleton depolymerization (6Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), 3The abbreviations used are: EGFRepidermal growth factor receptor(s)MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseNSOMnear field scanning optical microscopyTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinemAbmonoclonal antibodyFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferGFPgreen fluorescent protein. a 170-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, is one of four members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in oncogene signaling. The initial step in receptor activation involves binding of the EGF peptide to the extracellular domain leading to dimerization or activation of pre-existing dimers (7Citri A. Yarden Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 8Ferguson K.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, the EGFR is auto-phosphorylated in several tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain, creating high affinity sites for various adaptor molecules that transmit the mitogenic signal to the Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway (9Ciardiello F. Tortora G. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 821-828PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Ras initiates a multistep phosphorylation cascade that leads to the activation of MAPKs, ERK1, and ERK2, which regulate transcription of molecules that are linked to cell proliferation, survival, and transformation. Enhanced EGFR expression has been detected in glioblastoma, breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and renal carcinomas (10El-Rayes B.F. LoRusso P.M. Brit. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR is associated with poor prognosis in many tumors including brain and breast cancer. Two main anti-EGFR strategies are currently exploited in clinical development: chimeric anti-receptor antibodies such as 225 (cetuximab), which binds directly to the ligand-binding site on the extracellular domain and has similar affinity to EGF peptide, and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as tryphostin AG1478, gefitinib (ZD1839), or erlotinib (OSI-774) that compete with ATP for binding to the EGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Both classes of therapeutics have shown encouraging preclinical and clinical activity in a variety of tumors (11Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 2787-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 12Sebastian S. Settleman J. Reshkin S.J. Azzariti A. Bellizzi A. Paradiso A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1766: 120-139PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the development of resistance to some therapies illustrates the need for a more detailed understanding of the factors that regulate EGFR signaling (12Sebastian S. Settleman J. Reshkin S.J. Azzariti A. Bellizzi A. Paradiso A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1766: 120-139PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yu C. Hale J. Ritchie K. Prasad N.K. Irudayaraj J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The nanometer scale clustering of receptors in higher order assemblies has attracted increased attention in studies of receptor biology and signal transduction. The functional consequences of receptor assemblies include their potential for inter-receptor communication and increased signaling efficiency, as well as their information processing capacity (14Irvine D.J. Hue K.A. Mayes A.M. Griffith L.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 120-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Membrane domains such as lipid rafts, caveolae, and clathrin-coated pits provide one mechanism for spatial and temporal control of the assembly of nanoscale signaling domains (15Pontier S.M. Percherancier Y. Galandrin S. Breit A. Galés C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24659-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, progress in understanding the assembly of signaling complexes and their association with membrane domains has so far been hampered by the limited availability of methods for the direct visualization of proteins and complexes with high spatial resolution in the membranes of intact cells.A mechanistic understanding of EGFR activation in a tumor cell environment requires knowledge of the spatial organization of the receptor on the cell surface. Recently single molecule fluorescence and single particle tracking have provided insight on the role of EGFR dimers and oligomers but in most cases do not visualize the entire population of receptors (16Saffarian S.

We report the use of near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) to probe the distribution and nanometer scale associations of EGFR in HeLa cells and to determine the influence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 and 225 EGFR-blocking antibody on the distribution of EGFR. NSOM is one of an emerging group of super-resolution methods for fluorescence imaging with subdiffraction resolution (18Hell S.W. Nat.

NSOM has recently been used for nanoscale fluorescence imaging of membrane protein clusters with spatial resolution below 100 nm in fixed cells (22Ianoul A. Street M. Grant D. Pezacki J. Taylor R.S.

Using NSOM, we show that EGFR is distributed in nanometer-sized clusters in the plasma membrane and that association with lipid raft and caveolae domains regulates receptor sequestration and trafficking in response to activation and/or inhibition in HeLa adenocarcinoma cells.DISCUSSIONRecent clinical results demonstrate the efficacy of EGFR-targeting therapy for colorectal, head, and neck cancer and promise wider use of EGFR-targeting drugs for lung cancer treatment. However, because only a fraction of patients responds successfully to therapy and risks of recurrence are still high, further investigation is required to improve our understanding of the complex network of signaling pathways underlying EGFR-driven cancer progression. Moreover, a better understanding of the mechanism of drug action in cells expressing high levels of EGFR is central to understanding how EGFR overexpression influences tumor biology. It is also critical for developing cancer therapeutics that selectively inhibit signaling pathways.Clustering of proteins in large signaling complexes provides a mechanism for controlling protein interaction probabilities and modulating the efficiency of signal transduction. Thus, evaluating the size and composition of these signaling complexes and their relationship to membrane domains is an area of significant interest. Various methods have been used to study the dimerization of receptors, but the assembly of individual receptors or small oligomers into larger complexes is a more challenging problem because it requires methods for visualizing interacting proteins on a length scale that is intermediate between the nearest neighbor interactions probed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the diffraction-limited spatial resolution available with confocal microscopy. Here we have employed near field microscopy to examine the early processes in EGFR signal transduction, with the goal of understanding how the dynamic organization of membrane receptors is modulated by receptor agonists or antagonists.We show that EGFR in unstimulated cells is organized in clusters with variable sizes (from 50 to ∼300 nm in diameter) and intensities; more than 50% of clusters have <24 receptors, although there is a small fraction of clusters with greater than 65 molecules. The clustering of EGFR in the absence of ligand is consistent with recent studies of ErbB receptors (16Saffarian S. Li Y. Elson E.L. Pike L.J. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Sergé A. Bertaux N. Rigneault H. Marguet D. Nat.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Clayton et al. (33Clayton A.H. Tavarnesi M.L. Johns T.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4589-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have used image correlation microscopy to estimate an average EGFR cluster density of 33/μm2 with 10–30 EGFR/cluster in fixed HeLa cells. FRET and fluorescence lifetime imaging indicated the presence of higher order oligomers, with most FRET states localized in clusters containing 15–30 proteins. This organization of receptors into nanoscale complexes was predicted to enhance the sensitivity of EGFR to changes in concentration of EGF peptide and to give rise to “long range conformational spread effects that would be absent or diminished if the receptors existed as isolated monomers or dimers at low density on the cell surface” (33Clayton A.H. Tavarnesi M.L. Johns T.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4589-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, our study and the work of Clayton et al. provide a detailed picture of the distribution of EGFR on the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. The EGFR is organized in clusters with a range of sizes and receptor densities and with a significant fraction of receptor oligomers in the larger clusters. Similar receptor aggregation has been observed for a variety of integral membrane proteins (15Pontier S.M. Percherancier Y. Galandrin S. Breit A. Galés C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24659-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Ianoul A. Grant D.D. Rouleau Y. Bani-Yaghoub M. Johnston L.J. Pezacki J.P. Nat. Chem.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).EGF-stimulated cells show a larger fraction of small clusters (<100 nm) with fewer receptors/cluster compared with control cells. The relatively modest changes in cluster size and density after EGF stimulation suggest that receptors are preorganized in nanoscale domains on the cell surface and that cellular mechanisms exist for organization of the EGFR, independent of ligand activation. The results parallel those obtained using immunoelectron microscopy of several ErbB receptors stably expressed in CHO cells (35Yang S. Raymond-Stintz M.A. Ying W. Zhang J. Lidke D.S. Steinberg S.L. Williams L. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2763-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Receptor clustering was observed, even at low expression levels, with anywhere from 1 to 80 EGFR/cluster. No change in cluster size was observed for either EGFR or ErbB2 following ligand stimulation, although ErbB3 cluster sizes increased after EGF treatment. The lack of colocalization of the three ErbB receptors led to the hypothesis that receptor segregation provides a mechanism for limiting heterodimerization. Changes in clustering behavior as a function of ligand activation are obviously complex for EGFR family receptors, because an earlier study reported a larger cluster diameter after activation of ErbB2 receptors overexpressed in SKBR3 cells (36Nagy P. Jenei A. Kirsch A.K. Szöllosi J. Damjanovich S. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our work and the literature studies discussed above have examined protein clustering in fixed cells, thus giving a snapshot of the dynamic behavior of the receptor. However, a similar picture emerges from studies in live cells. For example, three receptor populations were observed for quantum dot-labeled EGFR in COS cells: one that diffuses freely, one that is transiently confined in <100 nm diameter domains, and one that is immobile (17Sergé A. Bertaux N. Rigneault H. Marguet D. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A fluorescence correlation spectroscopy study for eGFP-EGFR expressed in CHO cells has concluded that EGFR is a complex mix of monomer (70%), dimer (20%), and oligomer (10%) in control cells, with an average of 1.3 EGFR/cluster prior to activation with EGF peptide (16Saffarian S. Li Y. Elson E.L. Pike L.J. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). By contrast, a single molecule fluorescence study of GFP-EGFR transiently transfected in HeLa cells concluded that dimers formed after EGF peptide treatment (37Xiao Z. Zhang W. Yang Y. Xu L. Fang X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Significant changes in the nanoscale distribution of EGFR are observed after treatment with the two inhibitors that we have examined. For example, the cluster size decreases and the cluster density increases by a factor of 2 after AG1478 treatment. A similar increase in cluster density (∼2.5 times) with a concomitant decrease in the number of receptors/cluster was observed by Clayton et al. (33Clayton A.H. Tavarnesi M.L. Johns T.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4589-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation leads to the loss of EGFR superstructures. Consistent with these findings, treatment of purified EGFR with the tyrosine inhibitor PD153035 inhibited clustering (38Jia C. Zhou Z. Liu R. Chen S. Xia R. Bioelectromagnetics. 2007; 28: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, using NSOM we have visualized the changes in cluster distribution directly, showing that AG1478 treatment leads to localization of many small individual EGFR clusters in larger patches. This illustrates the importance of examining receptor organization on both micrometer and nanometer length scales.It is interesting that inhibitors that either interfere with ligand binding to the extracellular domain or prevent phosphorylation of intracellular residues have similar effects on the nanoscale clustering of EGFR. By contrast, ligand activation leads to less pronounced changes in the nanoscale organization of the receptor. Both observations merit further investigation. The significance of understanding the oligomeric state of the EGFR in the presence of AG1478 is underscored by the recent observation that AG1478 alters the conformation of EGFR dimers, allowing the binding of an anti-EGFR antibody with enhanced therapeutic potential (39Gan H.K. Walker F. Burgess A.W. Rigopoulos A. Scott A.M. Johns T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2840-2850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, the combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with anti-EGFR antibodies to treat cancer is an area of active clinical investigation (40Matar P. Rojo F. Cassia R. Moreno-Bueno G. Di Cosimo S. Tabernero J. Guzmán M. Rodriguez S. Arribas J. Palacios J. Baselga J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6487-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).EGF peptide binding triggers the internalization and subsequent degradation of the activated receptor, thereby desensitizing the cells for mitogenic signals (41Alexander A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 729-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a few studies have reported EGFR degradation products after EGF treatment (42Ness G.O. Haugen D.R. Varhaug J.E. Akslen L.A. Lillehaug J.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Alwan H.A. van Zoelen E.J. van Leeuwen J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35781-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), to the best of our knowledge this is the first observation of these products in the plasma membrane. We have shown that addition of EGF to HeLa cells gives a decreased amount of mature receptor (170-kDa EGFR) at the plasma membrane and a relative increase in the 130-kDa protein. The three EGFR bands at 170, 150, and 130 kDa have previously been observed in other human tumors, and it was assumed that the 150- and 130-kDa proteins were breakdown products of the EGFR (45Gullick W.J. Marsden J.J. Whittle N. Ward B. Bobrow L. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the enhanced receptor degradation in HeLa cells (46Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was reversed by AG1478 and to a lesser extent by 225 antibody treatment. We have previously demonstrated that 225 mAb induces EGFR internalization and down-regulation, resulting in a 40% decrease in surface EGFR (32Jaramillo M.L. Leon Z. Grothe S. Paul-Roc B. Abulrob A. O'Connor-McCourt M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).At present we cannot determine the relative contribution of each EGFR degradation product to the fluorescence signals detected using NSOM and confocal microscopy because the antibody used binds to all three EGFR proteins. However, it would be useful to visualize the different EGFR products and study their spatial localization. This might be feasible by selecting antibodies against unique sequences and conformations for the individual EGFR products. It would also be of interest to determine whether the EGFR degradation products undergo signaling and, if so, how they respond to stimuli and inhibitors.Caveolae assemble signaling molecules in discrete plasma membrane subdomains, providing proximity for their interaction and facilitating cross-talk between different signaling pathways (47Gumbleton M. Abulrob A.G. Campbell L. Pharm. Res. 2000; 17: 1035-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we show that close to half the plasma membrane EGFR (∼45%) is localized in clusters that contain caveolin-1 in both control and EGF-stimulated cells. The presence of EGFR in clusters with caveolin-1 has potential for tuning the specificity of cell signaling. These clusters also provide a high density of EGFR molecules in the plane of the plasma membrane, which may be required for efficient conversion to higher order EGFR oligomers. Indeed Sigismund et al. (48Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) found that in HeLa cells EGFR undergoes distinct post-translational modifications and becomes committed to different internalization routes, as a function of EGF ligand dose and receptor activation. At low EGF concentrations, the EGFR is tyrosine-phosphorylated, fully competent for signaling, nonubiquitinated, and internalized through clathrin-coated pits, whereas at high EGF concentrations (as used here), EGFR becomes ubiquitinated and is endocytosed through caveolae (48Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar).Previously we have shown an up-regulation of total cellular caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression in U87MG human glioblastoma cells after 24 h of AG1478 treatment, although this observation was not reproduced in squamous cell carcinoma A431 cells (29Abulrob A. Giuseppin S. Andrade M.F. McDermid A. Moreno M. Stanimirovic D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6967-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study the plasma membrane caveolin-1 protein expression was up-regulated after exposure to 1 h of AG1478, indicating that different cell types have different responses to tyrosine kinase inhibition. Whether the observed discrepancies are due to the different experimental approaches or are caused by real differences in the observed systems (and if so, the cause of caveolin-1 up-regulation and its interaction with EGFR) is yet to be determined.The colocalization of EGFR with lipid rafts was similar to caveolae in both control and activated cells (40–44%). The results indicate three distinct populations of receptor, with both raft and caveolae localized EGFR as well as a significant population that does not localize in either membrane domain. The average diameter for the raft domains visualized using GM1-cholera toxin B was 110 nm, within the predicted range for raft sizes (4Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1597-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar) and in reasonable agreement with recent NSOM studies showing nanoscale domains for GM1 and GM3 (diameters of 159 and 190 nm, respectively) in fixed, immunostained Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and for asialo-GM1 in fixed HeLa cells (∼90 nm) (30Abulrob A. Lu Z. Brunette E. Pulla D. Stanimirovic S. Johnston L.J. J. Micros. 2008; 232: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 49Chen Y. Qin J. Chen Z.W. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2268-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These estimates are larger than those from measurements of hindered diffusion of lipids or raft-anchored proteins in the plasma membrane of live cells. For example, stimulated emission depletion fluorescence nanoscopy provided evidence for raft domains <20 nm in size (50Eggeling C. Ringemann C. Medda R. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Polyakova S. Belov V.N. Hein B. von Middendorff C. Schönle A. Hell S.W. Nature. 2009; 457: 1159-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Similarly, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy showed hindered diffusion of GFP-Thy-1, consistent with the existence of nanodomains <60 nm in size, in the plasma membrane of mouse T cells (51Lasserre R. Guo X.J. Conchonaud F. Hamon Y. Hawchar O. Bernard A.M. Soudja S.M. Lenne P.F. Rigneault H. Olive D. Bismuth G. Nunès J.A. Payrastre B. Marguet D. He H.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The lack of suitable methods to measure dynamic nanodomains in live cells has led to confusion concerning the size, and even the existence, of membrane rafts. However, advances in super-resolution microscopies are starting to address this problem; the limited data available so far support the hypothesis of a range of raft sizes (4Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1597-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). It appears that estimates based on a “snapshot” in fixed cells give larger sizes than do dynamic measurements on live cells.A recent study has concluded that EGF induces coalescence of two types of GM1-enriched raft domains: one in which EGFR is surrounded by a lipid shell composed predominantly of GM1 and a second containing GM1 and several glycosylphosphatidylinositol-GFP molecules (52Hofman E.G. Ruonala M.O. Bader A.N. van den Heuvel D. Voortman J. Roovers R.C. Verkleij A.J. Gerritsen H.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NSOM provides evidence for a small fraction of larger EGFR domains for EGF-treated cells but shows minimal increase in the size of raft domains in the presence of EGF. Thus, it is likely that GM1 nanoclusters, if they occur under our conditions in HeLa cells, coexist within the individual raft domains (average diameter of 110 nm) observed by NSOM. This could be tested by combining FRET with NSOM imaging.In conclusion, the lateral organization"

https://openalex.org/W2082355313,"Tandem of P domains in a weak inwardly rectifying K(+) channel 1 (TWIK1) is a K(+) channel that produces unusually low levels of current. Replacement of lysine 274 by a glutamic acid (K274E) is associated with stronger currents. This mutation would prevent conjugation of a small ubiquitin modifier peptide to Lys-274, a mechanism proposed to be responsible for channel silencing. However, we found no biochemical evidence of TWIK1 sumoylation, and we showed that the conservative change K274R did not increase current, suggesting that K274E modifies TWIK1 gating through a charge effect. Now we rule out an eventual effect of K274E on TWIK1 trafficking, and we provide convincing evidence that TWIK1 silencing results from its rapid retrieval from the cell surface. TWIK1 is internalized via a dynamin-dependent mechanism and addressed to the recycling endosomal compartment. Mutation of a diisoleucine repeat located in its cytoplasmic C terminus (I293A,I294A) stabilizes TWIK1 at the plasma membrane, resulting in robust currents. The effects of I293A,I294A on channel trafficking and of K274E on channel activity are cumulative, promoting even more currents. Activation of serotoninergic receptor 5-HT(1)R or adrenoreceptor alpha2A-AR stimulates TWIK1 but has no effect on TWIK1I293A,I294A, suggesting that G(i) protein activation is a physiological signal for increasing the number of active channels at the plasma membrane."

IntroductionIn Escherichia coli the inner membrane contains essential energy transducing complexes such as components of the electron transport chain.

In this pathway, the bacterial signal recognition particle targets ribosome-bound nascent chains to the SecYEG translocase via the signal recognition particle receptor FtsY. Membrane insertion of these proteins proceeds by a cotranslational “threading mechanism” in which the accessory protein YidC is postulated to play an important role in the clearance of transmembrane segments (TMSs) 2The abbreviations used are: TMStransmembrane segmentIMVinner membrane vesiclePMFproton motive forceNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. from the SecYEG channel (1Scotti P.A.

Cell. 2007; 18: 1897-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This highlights that although the general function of Oxa1/Alb3/YidC family proteins is known, each member plays a specific and in some cases yet to be identified role in the biogenesis of respiratory proteins.In a recent study, we showed that YidC depletion in E. coli resulted in a cessation of growth under anaerobic conditions and that this growth defect may be in part due to reduced levels of the complex I homolog in bacteria, the NADH:ubiquinone reductase, or NADH dehydrogenase I, in the membrane (21Price C.E. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26921-26927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In particular, levels of the smallest membrane subunit K (NuoK) decreased. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of YidC in NuoK membrane biogenesis and to determine the structural features of NuoK underlying this role. We found that in vitro synthesized NuoK requires both SecYEG and YidC for insertion and that two conserved negative charges in TMSs 2 and 3 determine the dependence of NuoK on YidC for insertion.DISCUSSIONAll of the subunits of the bacterial complex I, NADH dehydrogenase I, are encoded by the nuo operon. In E. coli, NADH dehydrogenase I contains 13 subunits, NuoA through to NuoN with NuoC and NuoD fused to form one protein. If any of these subunits are absent, a functional enzyme complex cannot be formed (37Schneider D. Pohl T. Walter J. Dörner K. Kohlstädt M. Berger A. Spehr V. Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that levels of the small membrane subunit NuoK are greatly reduced upon YidC depletion (21Price C.E. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26921-26927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A decrease in the levels of NuoK in the membrane could have been due to the absence of one of the other subunits under YidC-depleting conditions, but as we now demonstrate, YidC is directly involved in the insertion of NuoK. Using IMVs we showed that the levels of YidC and SecYEG affected the efficiency of NuoK insertion. The decrease in insertion efficiency in YidC− IMVs was not due to the impaired ability of the IMVs to generate a PMF because in the absence of a PMF, the efficiency of insertion of NuoK was even enhanced. It has been shown with M13 procoat Lep and CyoA derivatives that the presence of positive charges in the translocated loops of these derivatives created proteins that only inserted in the absence of a PMF (38Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Celebi N. Dalbey R.E. Yuan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1282-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). NuoK contains one negatively charged residue in the periplasmic loop between TMSs 2 and 3, whereas the cytoplasmic loop between TMSs 1 and 2 and the C-terminal tail contain numerous positively charged amino acids. The protein topology therefore follows that predicted by the “positive inside rule” (40von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and it is not immediately obvious why the PMF would inhibit protein insertion. NADH dehydrogenase I is the preferred NADH dehydrogenase under anaerobic growth conditions (41Tran Q.H. Bongaerts J. Vlad D. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Unlike NADH dehydrogenase II, the proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase I is energy-conserving, which is needed under the “energy limited” conditions of growth without oxygen. It is possible that NuoK insertion is enhanced under such conditions when the PMF is reduced and NADH dehydrogenase I is needed.Although the number of known YidC-dependent membrane proteins has increased during recent years, the exact mechanism of YidC in membrane protein insertion remains enigmatic. YidC has been shown to contact the TMSs of numerous integral membrane proteins in various cross-linking studies (24van der Laan M. Houben E.N. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42Yu Z. Koningstein G. Pop A. Luirink J. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and yet YidC is dispensable in the insertion of most of these proteins (26van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 45van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Using in vitro insertion into proteoliposomes, we show that NuoK minimally requires both YidC and SecYEG for insertion. Subunit a of the cytochrome oxidase, CyoA, has also been shown to require both YidC and SecYEG for insertion in vitro (12du Plessis D.J. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12248-12252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on the individual insertion requirements of constructs containing either the N- or C-terminal parts of CyoA, it has been suggested that SecYEG and YidC work sequentially in the insertion of CyoA with YidC inserting the N-terminal hairpin and SecYEG inserting the C-terminal TMS and long periplasmic C-terminal tail (13van Bloois E. Haan G.J. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10002-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 46Celebi N. Yi L. Facey S.J. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This strict sequential insertion is only alleviated when a long linker between TMSs 1 and 2 is introduced, after which the C terminus can insert independently of the N-terminal hairpin (39Celebi N. Dalbey R.E. Yuan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1282-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly the introduction of numerous positive charges in the signal peptide and TMS 1 block the insertion of this protein via the YidC pathway but do not result in default insertion via the Sec translocon (39Celebi N. Dalbey R.E. Yuan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1282-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).We observed that the presence of the negative charges in TM 2 and 3 determines the YidC-dependent insertion. NuoK contains single glutamates in TM2 and 3, which are required for high ubiquinone activity (35Kervinen M. Pätsi J. Finel M. Hassinen I.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Substitution of the glutamates at positions 36 and 72 for lysines produced a protein that, like most studied integral membrane proteins, required only SecYEG for integration into the membrane. This supports a model in which the TMSs of YidC have a role in forming a membrane chaperone, assisting the integration of less hydrophobic, negatively charged TMSs, similar to that proposed for Oxa1 (34Saint-Georges Y. Hamel P. Lemaire C. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13814-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Saint-Georges Y. Hamel P. Lemaire C. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13814-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of just one glutamate-containing TMS renders the entire protein still YidC-dependent, and it is only when both glutamates have been substituted for lysines that the protein can be inserted by SecYEG, unassisted by YidC. NuoK is one of many integral membrane respiratory proteins that contain membrane-negative charges. NuoA has a similar structure to NuoK with glutamates at positions 81 and 102 (TM2 and 3) and an asparate at position 79 (TM2). It would be of interest if these similar structural features necessitate YidC in the insertion process.In the well studied substrate of YidC, Foc, mutation of an aspartate at position 61 (TM2) to a glycine produces an ATP synthase that contains an enzymatically active F1 part but no functional F0 (47Wachter E. Schmid R. Deckers G. Altendorf K. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There were, however, detectable levels of the mutant Foc present in the membrane. Attempts to elucidate the insertion requirements for this mutant in vitro were unsuccessful because of the proteinase K-resistant nature of the protein. 3S. Kol and J. de Keyzer, unpublished data. Substitution of a glycine for aspartate in TM1 of Foc results in a mutant form of the protein that is still dependent of YidC for insertion but that does not form an oligomeric ring structure as the wild type protein does (32Kol S. Turrell B.R. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29762-29768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 48Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L.

Thus the introduction of a negative charge into a TMS is tolerated by the YidC-only mode of insertion. Of the other proteins shown to insert with the assistance of YidC, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, and the phage coat proteins M13 and Pf3 have membrane-located negative charges. CyoA, however, does not contain any membrane-negative charges. YidC is not essential for the insertion of FtsQ (26van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and LepB (49de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), even though interaction between these proteins and YidC during membrane insertion has been observed (1Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24van der Laan M.

FtsQ does not contain any membrane-embedded charges, whereas LepB contains a glutamate in TM2. There must therefore be structural features other than membrane-located negative charges that confer YidC dependence to proteins.YidC is remarkably resilient to single amino acid substitutions, and even when TMSs 4 and 5 were swapped for unrelated TMSs, YidC activity was retained (33Jiang F. Chen M. Yi L. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48965-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that it is the presence of the C-terminal 5 TMSs and not the specific sequences of the hydrophobic stretches that is essential for YidC activity. Our data support the hypothesis that YidC serves as a platform from which TMSs are integrated into the membrane. Furthermore, YidC is essential for NuoK TMS integration when membrane-embedded negative charges are present. The involvement of YidC in the integration of such TMSs may provide an explanation as to its conserved function in the biogenesis of respiratory proteins that often contain essential-for-function negative charges providing a basis for future mutagenesis studies on other YidC substrates. IntroductionIn Escherichia coli the inner membrane contains essential energy transducing complexes such as components of the electron transport chain. The majority of inner membrane proteins are inserted cotranslationally via the general secretory pathway otherwise known as the Sec system. In this pathway, the bacterial signal recognition particle targets ribosome-bound nascent chains to the SecYEG translocase via the signal recognition particle receptor FtsY. Membrane insertion of these proteins proceeds by a cotranslational “threading mechanism” in which the accessory protein YidC is postulated to play an important role in the clearance of transmembrane segments (TMSs) 2The abbreviations used are: TMStransmembrane segmentIMVinner membrane vesiclePMFproton motive forceNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. from the SecYEG channel (1Scotti P.A.

A small subset of integral membrane proteins are targeted directly to YidC where they are integrated into the membrane in a Sec-independent manner. YidC belongs to the evolutionarily conserved Oxa1/Alb3/YidC family. Oxa-related proteins have been identified in all genomes sequenced to date and are postulated to have evolved before the divergence of the three major domains of life (3Pohlschröder M. Hartmann E.

https://openalex.org/W2045336448,"Sepsis is a severe medical condition causing a large number of deaths worldwide. Recent studies indicate that the septic susceptibility is attributable to the vascular ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel. However, the mechanisms underlying the channel modulation in sepsis are still unclear. Here we show evidence for the modulation of vascular K(ATP) channel by septic pathogen lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In isolated mesenteric arterial rings, phenylephrine (PE) produced concentration-dependent vasoconstriction that was relaxed by pinacidil, a selective K(ATP) channel opener. The PE response was disrupted with a LPS treatment. In acutely dissociated aortic smooth myocytes the LPS treatment augmented K(ATP) channel activity, and hyperpolarized the cells. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that LPS raised Kir6.1 and SUR2B transcripts in a concentration-dependent manner, which was suppressed by transcriptional inhibition. Consistently, the same LPS treatment did not affect Kir6.1/SUR2B channels in a heterologous expression system. The LPS effect on Kir6.1 and SUR2B expression was abolished in the presence of NF-kappaB inhibitors. Several other Toll-like receptor ligands also stimulated Kir6.1 and SUR2B expression to a similar degree as LPS. Thus, the effect of LPS on vasodilation involves up-regulation of K(ATP) channel expression, in which the NF-kappaB-dependent signaling plays an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1986134245,"Gamma-amminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of vertebrates, serves as an autocrine/paracrine signaling molecule during development, modulating a number of calcium (Ca(2+))-dependent processes, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation, acting via 2 types of GABA receptors (GABARs): ionotropic GABA(A)Rs and metabotropic GABA(B)Rs. Here, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which possess the capacity for virtually unlimited self-renewal and pluripotency, synthesize GABA and express functional GABA(A)Rs and GABA(B)Rs, as well as voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. On activation, both GABAR types triggered synergistically intracellular calcium rise. Muscimol (a GABA(A)R agonist) induced single Ca(2+) transients involving both VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx and intracellular stores, while baclofen (a GABA(B)R agonist) evoked Ca(2+) transients followed by intercellular Ca(2+) waves and oscillations that were resistant to antagonists and entirely dependent on Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Prolonged treatment with muscimol slightly inhibited, while baclofen or SR95531 (a GABA(A)R antagonist) significantly facilitated, mESC proliferation. GABA(A)R-specific ligands also induced morphological and gene expression changes indicating a differentiation shift. Our data suggest that the interplay between GABARs and downstream (coupled) effectors differentially modulates mESC proliferation/differentiation through selective activation of second messenger signaling cascades.-Schwirtlich, M., Emri, Z., Antal, K., Máté, Z., Katarova, Z., Szabó, G. GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors of distinct properties affect oppositely the proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells through synergistic elevation of intracellular Ca(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W1996174977,"Extinction Distinctions The distribution of affected organisms can help reveal the mechanisms of mass or background extinctions. This has often been studied by comparing effects on land versus in the ocean, or across latitudes, for example. Miller and Foote (p. 1106 ) now analyze extinction patterns in shallow seas around continents, versus open-ocean coastal regions from the Permian through the Cretaceous, a period spanning three major mass extinctions. The mass extinctions all affected organisms in the open coastal environment greater than those inhabiting shallow seas, but at other times the pattern was opposite. Thus, organisms in these environments may have very different evolutionary histories."
https://openalex.org/W2035092535,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tgl2 protein shows sequence homology to Pseudomonas triacylglycerol (TAG) lipases, but its role in the yeast lipid metabolism is not known. Using hemagglutinin-tagged Tgl2p purified from yeast, we report that this protein carries a significant lipolytic activity toward long-chain TAG. Importantly, mutant hemagglutinin-Tgl2p(S144A), which contains alanine 144 in place of serine 144 in the lipase consensus sequence (G/A)XSXG exhibits no such activity. Although cellular TAG hydrolysis is reduced in the tgl2 deletion mutant, overproduction of Tgl2p in this mutant leads to an increase in TAG degradation in the presence of fatty acid synthesis inhibitor cerulenin, but that of Tgl2p(S144A) does not. This result demonstrates the lipolytic function of Tgl2p in yeast. Although other yeast TAG lipases are localized to lipid particles, Tgl2p is enriched in the mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction purified from the TGL2-overexpressing yeast shows a strong lipolytic activity, which was absent in the tgl2 deletion mutant. Therefore, we conclude that Tgl2p is a functional lipase of the yeast mitochondria. By analyzing phenotypic effects of TGL2-deficient yeast, we also find that lipolysis-competent Tgl2p is required for the viability of cells treated with antimitotic drug. The addition of oleic acid, the product of Tgl2p-catalyzed lipolysis, fully complements the antimitotic drug sensitivity of the tgl2 null mutation. Thus, we propose that the mitochondrial Tgl2p-dependent lipolysis is crucial for the survival of cells under antimitotic drug treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2128217572,"A change of cytosolic pH 7 to 4 opens the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. However, the overall gating mechanism leading to channel opening, especially the contribution of the cytoplasmic domain, remains unsolved. Here we report that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain resulted in changes in channel conductance and gating behavior at pH 4 without channel opening at pH 7. To probe for rearrangements in the cytoplasmic domain during channel opening, amino acid residues were substituted with cysteines and labeled with a fluorophore (tetramethylrhodamine maleimide) that exhibits increased fluorescence intensity upon transfer from a hydrophilic to hydrophobic environment. In all cases channel open probability (P(o)) was approximately 1 at pH 4 and approximately 0 at pH 7. Major increases in fluorescence intensity were observed for tetramethylrhodamine maleimide-labeled residues in the cytoplasmic domain as pH changed from 7 to 4, which suggests the fluorophores shifted from a hydrophilic to hydrophobic environment. Dipicrylamide, a lipid soluble quencher, reduced the fluorescence intensities of labeled residues in the cytosolic domain at pH 4. These results reveal that a decrease in pH introduces major conformational rearrangements associated with channel opening in the KcsA cytoplasmic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2156383079,"Kinetic intermediates that appear early during protein folding often resemble the relatively stable molten globule intermediates formed by several proteins under mildly denaturing conditions. Molten globules have a substantial amount of secondary structure but lack virtually all tertiary side-chain packing characteristics of natively folded proteins. Due to exposed hydrophobic groups, molten globules are prone to aggregation, which can have detrimental effects on organisms. The molten globule that is observed during folding of alpha-beta parallel flavodoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii is a remarkably non-native species. This folding intermediate is helical and contains no beta-sheet and is kinetically off-pathway to the native state. It can be trapped under native-like conditions by substituting residue Phe(44) for Tyr(44). To characterize this species at the residue level, in this study, use is made of interrupted hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by NMR spectroscopy. In the molten globule of flavodoxin, the helical region comprising residues Leu(110)-Val(125) is shown to be better protected against exchange than the other ordered parts of the folding intermediate. This helical region is better buried than the other helices, causing its context-dependent stabilization against unfolding. Residues Leu(110)-Val(125) thus form the stable core of the helical molten globule of alpha-beta parallel flavodoxin, which is almost entirely structured. Non-native docking of helices in the molten globule of flavodoxin prevents formation of the parallel beta-sheet of native flavodoxin. Hence, to produce native alpha-beta parallel protein molecules, the off-pathway species needs to unfold."
