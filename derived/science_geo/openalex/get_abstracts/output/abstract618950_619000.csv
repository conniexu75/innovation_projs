https://openalex.org/W2887216690,"Cancer-secreted exosomal miRNAs are emerging mediators of cancer-stromal cross-talk in the tumor environment. Our previous miRNAs array of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) clinical specimens identified upregulation of miR-221-3p. Here, we show that miR-221-3p is closely correlated with peritumoral lymphangiogenesis and lymph node (LN) metastasis in CSCC. More importantly, miR-221-3p is characteristically enriched in and transferred by CSCC-secreted exosomes into human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) to promote HLECs migration and tube formation in vitro, and facilitate lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis in vivo according to both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Furthermore, we identify vasohibin-1 (VASH1) as a novel direct target of miR-221-3p through bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter assay. Re-expression and knockdown of VASH1 could respectively rescue and simulate the effects induced by exosomal miR-221-3p. Importantly, the miR-221-3p-VASH1 axis activates the ERK/AKT pathway in HLECs independent of VEGF-C. Finally, circulating exosomal miR-221-3p levels also have biological function in promoting HLECs sprouting in vitro and are closely associated with tumor miR-221-3p expression, lymphatic VASH1 expression, lymphangiogenesis, and LN metastasis in CSCC patients. In conclusion, CSCC-secreted exosomal miR-221-3p transfers into HLECs to promote lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis via downregulation of VASH1 and may represent a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for metastatic CSCC patients in early stages."

Yet, less is known about its relationship with common metabolic disorders and how sex and ageing affect the overall comorbidity patterns of adult ADHD. We aimed to examine associations of adult ADHD with several common psychiatric and metabolic conditions. Through the linkage of multiple Swedish national registers, 5,551,807 adults aged 18 to 64 years and living in Sweden on December 31, 2013 were identified and assessed for clinical diagnoses of adult ADHD, substance use disorder (SUD), depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypertension. Logistic regression models and regression standardization method were employed to obtain estimates of prevalence, prevalence difference (PD), and prevalence ratio (PR). All comorbid conditions of interest were more prevalent in adults with ADHD (3.90% to 44.65%) than in those without (0.72% to 4.89%), with the estimated PRs being over nine for psychiatric conditions (p < 0.001) and around two for metabolic conditions (p < 0.001). Sex differences in the prevalence of comorbidities were observed among adults with ADHD. Effect modification by sex was detected on the additive scale and/or multiplicative scale for the associations of adult ADHD with all comorbidities. ADHD remained associated with all comorbidities in older adults aged 50 to 64 when all conditions were assessed from age 50 onwards. The comorbidity patterns of adult ADHD underscore the severity and clinical complexity of the disorder. Clinicians should remain vigilant for a wide range of psychiatric and metabolic problems in ADHD affected adults of all ages and both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2892633782,"It was recently reported that men self-cite >50% more often than women across a wide variety of disciplines in the bibliographic database JSTOR. Here, we replicate this finding in a sample of 1.6 million papers from Author-ity, a version of PubMed with computationally disambiguated author names. More importantly, we show that the gender effect largely disappears when accounting for prior publication count in a multidimensional statistical model. Gender has the weakest effect on the probability of self-citation among an extensive set of features tested, including byline position, affiliation, ethnicity, collaboration size, time lag, subject-matter novelty, reference/citation counts, publication type, language, and venue. We find that self-citation is the hallmark of productive authors, of any gender, who cite their novel journal publications early and in similar venues, and more often cross citation-barriers such as language and indexing. As a result, papers by authors with short, disrupted, or diverse careers miss out on the initial boost in visibility gained from self-citations. Our data further suggest that this disproportionately affects women because of attrition and not because of disciplinary under-specialization."

We measured balance, gait, strength, falls, cognition, mood, PD severity, and quality of life before and after 16 weeks of high dose vitamin D supplementation or placebo. All participants also received 1000 mg calcium once daily.Fifty-one randomized participants completed sixteen weeks of high dose vitamin D supplementation or placebo. The intervention resulted in a rise in serum concentrations of vitamin D (25-OH) (30.2 ng/ml to 61.1 ng/ml) and was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Serum vitamin D (25-OH) levels rose steadily and did not suggest a leveling off at the end of the 16 weeks. There was not an improvement in the primary endpoint, balance as measured by the Sensory Organization Test (p = 0.43). A post hoc analysis examining treatment effects in younger (ages 52-66) versus older (ages 67-86) participants found a significant improvement in the SOT of 10.6 points in the younger half of the cohort (p = 0.012).Short term, high dose vitamin D supplementation appears safe in persons with PD, but did not significantly improve balance as measured with the Sensory Organization Test in this pilot study population. A post hoc analysis suggests that vitamin D may have potential for improving balance in a younger population with PD. High dose vitamin D supplementation in PD needs further study especially in light of new research suggesting that mega doses and even moderate doses (as low as 4000IU a day) may increase falls in an older populations.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01119131."
https://openalex.org/W4243295398,"The interrelationship between public interest in endangered species and the attention they receive from the conservation community is the 'flywheel' driving much effort to abate global extinction rates. Yet big international conservation non-governmental organisations have typically focused on the plight of a handful of appealing endangered species, while the public remains largely unaware of the majority. We quantified the existence of bias in popular interest towards species, by analysing global internet search interest in 36,873 vertebrate taxa. Web search interest was higher for mammals and birds at greater risk of extinction, but this was not so for fish, reptiles and amphibians. Our analysis reveals a global bias in popular interest towards vertebrates that is undermining incentives to invest financial capital in thousands of species threatened with extinction. Raising the popular profile of these lesser known endangered and critically endangered species will generate clearer political and financial incentives for their protection."
https://openalex.org/W2609755919,"In human societies, agents are assumed to experience being the author of their own actions. These basic motoric experiences of action are influenced by social hierarchies, leading to surprising and morally significant results. Here we ask whether, under coercion, the sense of agency and responsibility pass from the person who receives orders to the person who gives them. Volunteers took turns to play the roles of 'commander', 'agent' or 'victim' in a task where the commander coerced the agent to deliver painful shocks to the 'victim'. We used 'intentional binding' as an implicit measure of sense of agency in both commanders and agents, in conditions of coercion and free-choice. We observed a reduced sense of agency when agents received coercive instructions, relative to when they freely chose which action to execute. We also found that sense of agency in the commanders was reduced when they coerced agents to administer the shock on their behalf, relative to when they acted by themselves. This last effect was associated with the commander's self-reported level on a psychopathy scale. Thus, coercion resulted in neither commander nor agent feeling agency for the effect of the action, as measured through implicit methods. Our results could have profound implications for social decision-making and social regulation of moral behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2893617621,"To evaluate the use of off-label and unlicensed medicines in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a teaching maternity hospital specialized in high risk pregnancy.A prospective cohort study was conducted between August 2015 and July 2016. All newborns admitted to the NICU who had at least one medication prescribed and a hospital stay longer than 24 hours were included. The classification of off-label and unlicensed drugs for the neonatal population was done according to the information of Food and Drug Administration.A total of 17421 medication items were analyzed in 3935 prescriptions of 220 newborns. The proportion of newborns exposed to off-label drugs was 96.4%, and to unlicensed medicines was 66.8%. About one-half (49.3%) of the medication items were off-label and 24.6% were unlicensed. The main reason for off-label and unlicensed classification was, respectively, frequency of administration and the administration of adaptations of pharmaceutical forms.Although there are actions to encourage the development of pharmacological studies with neonates, this study observed a high rate of prescription and exposure of newborns to off-label and unlicensed drugs in NICUs and pointed out areas of neonatal therapy that require scientific investment."

The superfamily of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases has vital functions in the metabolism and detoxification of a large variety of drugs and environmental toxins. However, in other instances, P450 enzymes have been known to initiate deleterious effects, such as the production of reactive intermediates leading to toxic and carcinogenic effects (1Rendic S. Guengerich F.P. Contributions of human enzymes in carcinogen metabolism.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2012; 25 (22531028): 1316-138310.1021/tx300132kCrossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).

CYP1A1 has a preference for substrates that are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as the environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (2Shimada T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to carcinogens by cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1B1.Cancer Sci. 2004; 95 (14720319): 1-610.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03162.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Due to the roles of CYP1A1 in human carcinogenesis, inhibition of CYP1A1 activity has been considered as a potential target for cancer chemoprevention (3Chun Y.J. Ryu S.Y. Jeong T.C. Kim M.Y.

In contrast, other efforts have been explored for utilizing CYP1A1 oxidative metabolism to activate anticancer prodrugs in a tissue-selective manner (5Sutherland M. Gill J.H. Loadman P.M. Laye J.P.

To employ either CYP1A1 inhibition or leverage its oxidative power for therapeutic purposes requires detailed knowledge of the active-site interactions with potential ligands. A single crystal structure of CYP1A1 was previously determined, in complex with the small-molecule inhibitor α-naphthoflavone (ANF) (7Walsh A.A. Szklarz G.D. Scott E.E. Human cytochrome P450 1A1 structure and utility in understanding drug and xenobiotic metabolism.J. Biol.

This structure revealed a narrow and closed active site not much larger than the ANF ligand itself. The other family 1 human P450 enzymes, CYP1A2 (8Sansen S. Yano J.K. Reynald R.L. Schoch G.A. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Adaptations for the oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exhibited by the structure of human P450 1A2.J. Biol.

However, xenobiotic-metabolizing P450 enzymes often have rather flexible structures to accommodate the variety of substrates an individual enzyme interacts with, so it can be difficult to extrapolate a range of potential P450/ligand interactions from a single structure. In particular, a number of known 1A1 substrates and inhibitors reported in the literature reveal substrate and inhibitor sizes and geometries that are not compatible with the dimensions of the currently defined CYP1A1/ANF active site. The purpose of the current study was to probe CYP1A1 active-site flexibility and potentially capture CYP1A1 in conformationally distinct states that would be useful in trying to employ CYP1A1 as a potential therapeutic target. To accomplish this, ligands with high CYP1A1 affinity and larger sizes were co-crystallized with the CYP1A1 enzyme. This study describes two novel CYP1A1 structures, one with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib used in anticancer therapy and another with the furanocoumarin P450 inhibitor bergamottin. These new structures of CYP1A1 provide insight into some of the structural rearrangements that allow for the accommodation of diverse CYP1A1 ligand structures. The previous crystal structure of CYP1A1 was with the planar, fused multicyclic ligand α-napthoflavone enclosed within a narrow, planar active site (7Walsh A.A. Szklarz G.D. Scott E.E. Human cytochrome P450 1A1 structure and utility in understanding drug and xenobiotic metabolism.J. Biol.

Many CYP1A1 substrates and inhibitors do include features of various fused aromatic ring systems, often elongated in one dimension. The active-site cavity for the CYP1A1/ANF structure conforms to these aspects, but it is not particularly helpful in discerning how other CYP1A1 ligands with larger sizes and/or varying dimensions are accommodated by the active site. Whereas some human cytochrome P450 enzymes have multiple structures demonstrating significant flexibility in active-site conformation to accommodate different ligand classes, the CYP1 family enzymes have often been assumed to be comparatively static, in part because of the absence of structural evidence otherwise. To probe the malleability of the CYP1A1 active site, reported CYP1A1 ligands (substrates and/or inhibitors) that possessed a range of different chemical features and shapes were identified as potential candidates for crystallography. The ligands were broadly segmented into the following classes: azole inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anticancer prodrugs, and natural products from the furanocoumarin and stilbenoid classes. To provide a ranking according to the potency of their interactions with CYP1A1, IC50 values were determined (e.g. see Fig. 1) for each ligand. About half of the compounds tested had reasonably potent inhibition of CYP1A1-mediated activity (Table 1), defined herein as IC50 < 1 μm. This series included a number of azoles, which are often potent, broad spectrum P450 inhibitors. Not surprisingly, then, the azoles clotrimazole, miconazole, and tioconazole were three of the four most potent inhibitors. These are all smaller azoles (344–417 g/mol) with a compact overall structure. Larger azoles with extended structures like ketoconazole and posaconazole (531 and 700 g/mol) were 4–7-fold less potent but still had IC50 values in the nanomolar range. However, fluconazole, which is smaller and has an overall structure more similar to miconazole and tioconazole, did not significantly inhibit CYP1A1, so size is certainly not the only consideration.Table 1Inhibition of CYP1A1 given as IC50 ± S.E.Table 1Inhibition of CYP1A1 given as IC50 ± S.E. One of the interests of CYP1A1 in human health is its role in cancer, both as a potential generator of carcinogenic species and in the metabolism of certain anti-cancer drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs CYP1A1 has been demonstrated to interact with include erlotinib (10Li J. Zhao M. He P. Hidalgo M. Baker S.D. Differential metabolism of gefitinib and erlotinib by human cytochrome P450 enzymes.Clin.

Michielin O. In vitro biotransformation of imatinib by the tumor expressed CYP1A1 and CYP1B1.Biopharm. Drug Dispos. 2008; 29 (18188833): 103-11810.1002/bdd.598Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and ponatinib (12Lin D. Kostov R. Huang J.T.J. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Novel pathways of ponatinib disposition catalyzed by CYP1A1 involving generation of potentially toxic metabolites.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

These drugs displayed nanomolar to low micromolar IC50 values, with erlotinib being the most potent (IC50 = 180 ± 10 nm). Again, it was the more extended imatinib and ponatinib that were less potent inhibitors (IC50 > 1 μm), perhaps indicating that they might not fit the CYP1A1 active site as well. Metabolism of erlotinib and ponatinib by CYP1A1 has been reported to generate reactive electrophilic metabolites that may contribute to some of the observed life-threatening toxicities associated with these drugs (12Lin D.

CYP1A1 has yet another connection to cancer therapeutics in that the tissue location and metabolic capability of CYP1A1 have suggested its utility in the activation of several different prodrugs to reactive electrophilic species leading to DNA damage and cell death (6Bruno R.D.

This included the benzothiazole GW610 (16Stone E.L. Citossi F. Singh R. Kaur B. Gaskell M. Farmer P.B. Monks A. Hose C. Stevens M.F. Leong C.O. Stocks M. Kellam B. Marlow M. Bradshaw T.D.

In contrast, the compound AQ4N is activated by CYP1A1 to the active topoisomerase inhibitor AQ4 under hypoxic conditions (17Yakkundi A. McErlane V. Murray M. McCarthy H.O. Ward C. Hughes C.M.

Two natural products were suggested as CYP1A1 ligands in the literature and were tested. The first was the furanocoumarin bergamottin found in grapefruit and other citrus and well-known to inhibit CYP3A4 and cause variations on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of common drugs (18He K. Iyer K.R. Hayes R.N. Sinz M.W. Woolf T.F. Hollenberg P.F. Inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A4 by bergamottin, a component of grapefruit juice.Chem. Res.

Bergamottin also inhibits CYP1A2, but with attenuated potency (19Olguín-Reyes S. Camacho-Carranza R. Hernández-Ojeda S. Elinos-Baez M. Espinosa-Aguirre J.J.

At least in the ANF-bound structures, CYP1A1 possesses a slightly larger active-site volume compared with CYP1A2 (7Walsh A.A. Szklarz G.D. Scott E.E. Human cytochrome P450 1A1 structure and utility in understanding drug and xenobiotic metabolism.J. Biol.

Additionally, comparison of selective ligand features between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 suggested a preference of CYP1A1 for ligands with longer strip-like geometry, whereas CYP1A2-selective compounds were more triangular in shape (21Liu J. Sridhar J. Foroozesh M. Cytochrome P450 family 1 inhibitors and structure-activity relationships.Molecules. 2013; 18 (24287985): 14470-1449510.3390/molecules181214470Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The other natural product suggested in the literature to interact with CYP1A1 was the trans-stilbene resveratrol found in red wine. Herein, resveratrol was an order of magnitude less potent than bergamottin at inhibiting CYP1A1 activity. The resveratrol IC50 value of ∼1.4 μm was more similar to the tyrosine kinase drugs imatinib and ponatinib. A number of other diverse compounds ranging from moieties such as imidazole and indole to the analgesic acetaminophen were also tested for inhibitory potency toward CYP1A1. Additionally, endogenous fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (22Schwarz D. Kisselev P. Ericksen S.S. Szklarz G.D. Chernogolov A. Honeck H. Schunck W.H. Roots I.

The small chemical moieties indole, imidazole, and the drug acetaminophen resulted in exceedingly weak inhibition of CYP1A1 activity, with IC50 values >100 μm. The binding affinity of these small compounds is likely weak, and they may not make extensive interactions with the active site. The endogenous arachidonic acid substrate was only weakly inhibitory, with an IC50 value of 3.8 μm. Overall, this screen of many CYP1A1 ligands suggested that several of the imidazole azoles, bergamottin, and erlotinib had significantly different structures from α-napthoflavone but IC50 values less than 200 nm and might be good candidates for structural studies probing the flexibility of the CYP1A1 active site. As examples of structurally diverse CYP1A1 ligands with relatively low IC50 values, the binding of bergamottin and erlotinib were further characterized by determining their affinities and binding modes via UV spectroscopy. Tandem cuvettes were employed to blank out the intrinsic absorbance of both bergamottin and erlotinib, which overlap the wavelength range of the P450 heme Soret peak monitored to detect ligand binding. Titration of CYP1A1 with either bergamottin or erlotinib resulted in a blue shift of the Soret peak, with a peak forming at ∼391 nm and a trough at 427–429 nm when observed in difference mode (Fig. 2). Such a Type I binding profile is indicative of displacement of the water from the heme iron. The Kd for bergamottin was 370 ± 40 nm (Fig. 2), which is in a similar range to its IC50 value determined herein and the dissociation constant for ANF (∼300 nm) reported previously (7Walsh A.A. Szklarz G.D. Scott E.E. Human cytochrome P450 1A1 structure and utility in understanding drug and xenobiotic metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23508959): 12932-1294310.1074/jbc.M113.452953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The Kd measured for erlotinib was 1.07 ± 0.04 μm (Fig. 2), indicating that erlotinib binds to the CYP1A1 resting state with lower affinity compared with bergamottin and ANF. However, both ligands have affinities and solubilities that can support saturation of CYP1A1 for structure determination. Structures were subsequently determined with both bergamottin and erlotinib at resolutions of 2.85 and 3.0 Å, respectively. Both structures were solved in the P212121 space group with very similar unit cell dimensions and contained four copies of the protein within the asymmetric unit. For both structures, all four copies within the asymmetric unit were very similar, although two of them tended to be more disordered with regions of weaker electron density for some protein side chains and the active-site ligand. The 1A1/erlotinib structure disorder prevented reliable modeling of the loop between E and F helices in one molecule (D). Like the previous CYP1A1/ANF crystal structure, the loop connecting the H and I helices had significant disorder in both the CYP1A1/bergamottin and CYP1A1/erlotinib structures of most molecules and could only be reliably modeled in one chain for each respective co-crystal structure. This most complete and best defined molecule (molecule A) will be specifically referenced in the following discussion. The overall tertiary structures of the two new CYP1A1 ligand complexes with bergamottin and with erlotinib are highly similar to the previously determined structure of CYP1A1 with the ligand ANF (Fig. 3). Compared with the previous CYP1A1/ANF structure, the new structures with bergamottin and erlotinib both had root mean square deviations of 0.37 Å for Cα atoms. A distinctive feature of the previous CYP1A1/ANF structure, one conserved in the homologous CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 structures but not other human P450 enzymes, is a disruption in the helical character of the F helix as it passes over the active site. This five-residue break in the F helix is also present in the two new CYP1A1 structures. It has been postulated that this disruption of the F-helix could be significant in terms of allowing flexibility in substrate binding and dynamics (7Walsh A.A. Szklarz G.D. Scott E.E. Human cytochrome P450 1A1 structure and utility in understanding drug and xenobiotic metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23508959): 12932-1294310.1074/jbc.M113.452953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The density does support the localization of some additional small molecules from the crystallization solutions. In both structures, a molecule of the detergent CHAPS is found on the protein surface oriented lengthwise along the G helix of some molecules, distant from the active site. In all four of the molecules in the asymmetric unit, bergamottin is positioned similarly in the CYP1A1 active site. Its fused psoralen ring system is oriented distal from the heme, with π–π interactions to the parallel side chain of the F-helix residue Phe-224. The geranyloxy chain of bergamottin extends toward the heme, bending at the 3′ position so that the rest of the chain lies over the heme, slightly off center of the iron. The terminal dimethyl portion of this ligand chain is directed toward a cluster of hydrophobic residues that are part of the β4 and K/β1–4 loops, including Val-382 (Fig. 4A). These residues close off the bottom portion of the CYP1A1 active-site cavity opposite from the I-helix. There is a hydrogen bond formed between the ketone oxygen of the bergamottin psoralen moiety and the side chain nitrogen of Asn-222. This combination of interactions between bergamottin and the CYP1A1 active site results in the 6′ and 7′ carbons of the geranyloxy chain closest to the heme iron, at distances of 4.8 and 5.1 Å, respectively, suggesting that oxidation might occur at one or more of these positions. Reports of bergamottin metabolism by P450 enzymes in the literature are few but important in terms of the “grapefruit juice effect” wherein metabolism of the furan ring of the psoralen moiety results in reactive intermediates causing mechanism-based inhibition of the P450 enzyme, whereas metabolism on the geranyloxy chain produces stable metabolites (23Kent U.M. Lin H.L. Noon K.R. Harris D.L. Hollenberg P.F. Metabolism of bergamottin by cytochromes P4502B6 and 3A5.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318 (16785317): 992-100510.1124/jpet.105.099887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Metabolism by CYP1A1 has not been reported previously, but the Hollenberg group investigated bergamottin metabolism by CYP3A4 (18He K. Iyer K.R. Hayes R.N. Sinz M.W. Woolf T.F. Hollenberg P.F. Inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A4 by bergamottin, a component of grapefruit juice.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11 (9548795): 252-25910.1021/tx970192kCrossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), CYP3A5, and CYP2B6 (23Kent U.M. Lin H.L. Noon K.R. Harris D.L. Hollenberg P.F. Metabolism of bergamottin by cytochromes P4502B6 and 3A5.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318 (16785317): 992-100510.1124/jpet.105.099887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Bergamottin is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, consistent with metabolism on the psoralen ring. For CYP3A5, the primary metabolite involved oxidization at the 1′-carbon of the geranyl-oxy chain, leading to cleavage of the geranyl chain to form bergaptol. In contrast, CYP2B6 produced major metabolites from oxidations on the terminal end of the geranyl-oxy chain. Both CYP3A5 and CYP2B6 were also capable of generating bergamottin metabolites that formed GSH conjugates following furan ring oxidation, but the dominant metabolite was different for each enzyme, suggesting different preferences for bergamottin orientation in the respective active sites. The current crystal structure of CYP1A1 with bergamottin suggests that this enzyme prefers to bind bergamottin more like CYP2B6 than CYP3A5 and would be more likely to oxidize the terminal portion of the geranyl chain. The current CYP1A1 structure does not indicate the potential for complete reorientation of bergamottin within the active-site cavity, which would be necessary for reactive metabolites. Although this cannot be ruled out, the observed orientation would suggest that CYP1A1 would have less tendency toward bergamottin bioactivation compared with other P450 enzymes, due to the specific interactions with the CYP1A1 active-site cavity that dictate ligand orientation. To determine whether the binding pose for bergamottin in the CYP1A1 active site is consistent with metabolite generation, turnover assays were performed with human CYP1A1 and human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. CYP1A1 produced at least four major metabolites at different substrate concentrations. At low concentrations of bergamottin, only one major metabolite was observed. At higher concentrations, a second metabolite was observed and then a third metabolite (Fig. 5). The third metabolite coelutes with authentic 6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin, whereas the other two metabolites are slightly less polar, suggesting that they are likely to be the individual 6′-hydroxy and 7′-hydroxy products. The identity of the much more polar fourth metabolite is unknown. Overall, however, the metabolite profile is generally consistent with the binding orientation observed in the X-ray structure. Erlotinib, marketed as Tarceva, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the EGFR and was approved for treatment of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

https://openalex.org/W2893322756,"An indigenous maize landrace from the Sierra Mixe region of Oaxaca, Mexico exhibits extensive formation of aerial roots which exude large volumes of a polysaccharide-rich gel matrix or “mucilage” that harbors diazotrophic microbiota. We hypothesize that the mucilage associated microbial community carries out multiple functions, including disassembly of the mucilage polysaccharide. In situ, hydrolytic assay of the mucilage revealed endogenous arabinofuranosidase, galactosidase, fucosidase, mannosidase and xylanase activities. Screening the mucilage against plant cell wall glycan-specific monoclonal antibodies recognized the presence of carbohydrate epitopes of hemicellulosic polysaccharides like xyloglucan (both non-fucosylated and fucosylated), xylan (both substituted and unsubstituted xylan domains) and pectic-arabinogalactans, all of which are potential carbon sources for mucilage microbial residents. Mucilage metagenome annotation using MG-RAST identified the members forming the microbial community, and gene fragments with predicted functions associated with carbohydrate disassembly. Data from the in situ hydrolytic activity and monoclonal antibody screening assays were used to guide the selection of five full length genes with predicted glycosyl hydrolase function from the GenBank database that were similar to gene fragments of high relative abundance in the mucilage metagenomes. These five genes were then synthesized for recombinant production in Escherichia coli. Here we report the characterization of an α-N-arabinofuranosidase (GH51) and an oligosaccharide reducing-end xylanase (GH8) from Flavobacterium johnsoniae; an α-L-fucosidase (GH29) and a xylan β-1,4 xylosidase (GH39) from Spirosoma linguale, and a β-mannosidase (GH2) from Agrobacterium fabrum. Biochemical characterization of these enzymes revealed a β-Mannosidase that also exhibits a secondary activity towards the cleavage of galactosyl residues. We also describe two xylanases (GH8 and GH39) from underexplored glycosyl hydrolase families, one thermostable α-L-Fucosidase (GH29) and a thermostable α-N-Arabinofuranosidase (GH51)."
https://openalex.org/W2894515119,"Phenotypic plasticity and subsequent generation of intratumoral heterogeneity underly key traits in malignant melanoma such as drug resistance and metastasis. Melanoma plasticity promotes a switch between proliferative and invasive phenotypes characterized by different transcriptional programs of which MITF is a critical regulator. Here, we show that the acid ceramidase ASAH1, which controls sphingolipid metabolism, acted as a rheostat of the phenotypic switch in melanoma cells. Low ASAH1 expression was associated with an invasive behavior mediated by activation of the integrin alphavbeta5-FAK signaling cascade. In line with that, human melanoma biopsies revealed heterogeneous staining of ASAH1 and low ASAH1 expression at the melanoma invasive front. We also identified ASAH1 as a new target of MITF, thereby involving MITF in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Together, our findings provide new cues to the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells and identify new anti-metastatic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2894381910,"Deeper reefs are often considered to be less susceptible to local and global disturbances, such as overfishing, pollution and climate change, compared to shallow reefs and therefore could act as refugia for shallow water species. Hence, the interest on deeper reefs has happened at a time when shallow reefs are undergoing unprecedented changes. Here we investigated the hypothesis that fish community differed from shallow to deeper reefs due to factors apart from habitat structure and quality and therefore discuss for the first-time insights of a ""deep refuge hypothesis"" from Brazilian reefs. We collected data on fish community, benthic community and physiological conditions of two coral species on shallow (< 6 m) and deep reefs (> 25 m). No significant difference on substratum composition was observed comparing sites and depths. Additionally, physiological data on corals also showed similar oxidative status and growth conditions when comparing the two-coral species in shallow and deep reefs. Conversely, our study demonstrated strong differences on reef fish communities in terms of abundance, species richness, trophic groups, size classes and groups of interest when comparing shallow and deeper reefs. Fish abundance was 2-fold higher and species richness was up to 70% higher on deeper reefs. Also, a significant difference was observed comparing trophic groups of reef fish. Macrocarnivore, Mobile invertebrate feeders, Planktivores, Sessile Invertebrates Feeders and Roving Herbivores were more abundant on deeper reefs. On the other hand, Territorialist Herbivores almost exclusively dominated shallow reefs. Strong differences were also observed comparing the abundance of reef fish groups of interest and their respective size classes between shallow and deeper reefs. Ornamental, Great Herbivores and Groupers showed clear differences, with higher abundances being observed in deeper reefs. Considering size classes, larger individuals (> 15 cm) of Great Herbivores, Groupers and Snapper were uniquely recorded at deeper reefs. Additionally, individuals with > 30 cm were recorded almost exclusively on deeper reefs for all the analyzed groups of interest. Our findings suggest that fishing pressure on the target species may be attenuated on deeper reefs, and these regions may therefore be considered as areas of refuge from shallow water impacts. Therefore, the likely potential for deeper reefs protect species from natural or anthropogenic disturbances increases the attention of marine conservation planning and resource management on including deeper reefs in protected areas."

https://openalex.org/W2892624109,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a significant health problem, progresses through the course of several pathologies including steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. There are no effective FDA-approved medications to prevent or treat any stages of ALD, and the mechanisms involved in ALD pathogenesis are not well understood. Bioactive lipid metabolites play a crucial role in numerous pathological conditions, as well as in the induction and resolution of inflammation. Herein, a hepatic lipidomic analysis was performed on a mouse model of ALD with the objective of identifying novel metabolic pathways and lipid mediators associated with alcoholic steatohepatitis, which might be potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the disease. We found that ethanol and dietary unsaturated, but not saturated, fat caused elevated plasma ALT levels, hepatic steatosis and inflammation. These pathologies were associated with increased levels of bioactive lipid metabolites generally involved in pro-inflammatory responses, including 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid, 9,10- and 12,13-dihydroxy-octadecenoic acids, 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids, and 8,9- and 11,12-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids, in parallel with an increase in pro-resolving mediators, such as lipoxin A4, 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid, and 10S,17S-dihydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid. Elucidation of alterations in these lipid metabolites may shed new light into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALD development/progression, and be potential novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2894529428,"Background and purpose Anemia is associated with worse outcome in stroke, but the impact of anemia with intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular therapy has hardly been delineated. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of anemia on infarct evolution and outcome after acute stroke treatment. Methods 1158 patients from Bern and 321 from Los Angeles were included. Baseline data and 3 months outcome assessed with the modified Rankin Scale were recorded prospectively. Baseline DWI lesion volumes were measured in 345 patients and both baseline and final infarct volumes in 180 patients using CT or MRI. Multivariable and linear regression analysis were used to determine predictors of outcome and infarct growth. Results 712 patients underwent endovascular treatment and 446 intravenous thrombolysis. Lower hemoglobin at baseline, at 24h, and nadir until day 5 predicted poor outcome (OR 1.150–1.279) and higher mortality (OR 1.131–1.237) independently of treatment. Decrease of hemoglobin after hospital arrival, mainly induced by hemodilution, predicted poor outcome and had a linear association with final infarct volumes and the amount and velocity of infarct growth. Infarcts of patients with newly observed anemia were twice as large as infarcts with normal hemoglobin levels. Conclusion Anemia at hospital admission and any hemoglobin decrease during acute stroke treatment affect outcome negatively, probably by enlarging and accelerating infarct growth. Our results indicate that hemodilution has an adverse effect on penumbral evolution. Whether hemoglobin decrease in acute stroke could be avoided and whether this would improve outcome would need to be studied prospectively."
https://openalex.org/W2893648937,"The objective of the study was to identify markers of hypocapnic cerebral hypoperfusion (HYCH) in patients with orthostatic intolerance (OI) without tachycardia and without orthostatic hypotension. This single center, retrospective study included OI patients referred for autonomic evaluation with the 10 min tilt test. Heart rate, end-tidal CO2 (ET-CO2), blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) from middle cerebral artery were monitored. HYCH was defined by: (1) Symptoms of OI; (2) Orthostatic hypocapnia (low ET-CO2); (3) Abnormal decline in orthostatic CBFv due to hypocapnia; 4) Absence of tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, or other causes of low CBFv or hypocapnia. Sixteen subjects met HYCH criteria (15/1 women/men, age 38.5±8.0 years) and were matched by age and gender to postural tachycardia patients (POTS, n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 16). During the tilt, CBFv decreased more in HYCH (-22.4±7.7%, p<0.0001) and POTS (-19.0±10.3%, p<0.0001) compared to controls (-3.0±5.0%). Orthostatic ET-CO2 was lower in HYCH (26.4±4.2 (mmHg), p<0.0001) and POTS (28.6±4.3, p<0.0001) compared to controls (36.9 ± 2.1 mmHg). Orthostatic heart rate was normal in HYCH (89.0±10.9 (BPM), p<0.08) and controls (80.8 ±11.2), but was higher in POTS (123.7±11.2, p<0.0001). Blood pressure was normal and similar in all groups. It is concluded that both HYCH and POTS patients have comparable decrease in CBFv which is due to vasoconstrictive effect of hypocapnia. Blood flow velocity monitoring can provide an objective biomarker for HYCH in OI patients without tachycardia."
https://openalex.org/W2893691944,"In this study, experiments are conducted to gauge the relative importance of model, initial condition, and driving climate uncertainty for simulations of malaria transmission at a highland plantation in Kericho, Kenya. A genetic algorithm calibrates each of these three factors within their assessed prior uncertainty in turn to see which allows the best fit to a timeseries of confirmed cases. It is shown that for high altitude locations close to the threshold for transmission, the spatial representativeness uncertainty for climate, in particular temperature, dominates the uncertainty due to model parameter settings. Initial condition uncertainty plays little role after the first two years, and is thus important in the early warning system context, but negligible for decadal and climate change investigations. Thus, while reducing uncertainty in the model parameters would improve the quality of the simulations, the uncertainty in the temperature driving data is critical. It is emphasized that this result is a function of the mean climate of the location itself, and it is shown that model uncertainty would be relatively more important at warmer, lower altitude locations."

Genetic testing for hereditary cancers is rapidly evolving due to the introduction of multigene panels, which may identify more mutations than the old screening methods. The aim of this study is the use of a Next Generation Sequencing panel in order to find the genes involved in the cancer predisposition of these families. For this study, 98 patients from these unexplained families were tested with a multigene panel targeting 94 genes involved in cancer predisposition. The mutations found were validated by Sanger sequencing and the segregation was studied when possible. We identified 19 likely pathogenic variants in 18 patients. Out of these, 8 were found in MMR genes (5 in MLH1, 1 in MSH6 and 2 in PMS2). In addition, 11 mutations were detected in other genes, including high penetrance genes (APC, SMAD4 and TP53) and moderate penetrance genes (BRIP1, CHEK2, MUTYH, HNF1A and XPC). Mutations c.1194G>A in SMAD4, c.714_720dup in PMS2, c.2050T>G in MLH1 and c.1635_1636del in MSH6 were novel. In conclusion, the detection of new pathogenic mutations in high and moderate penetrance genes could contribute to the explanation of the heritability of colorectal cancer, changing the individual clinical management. Multigene panel testing is a more effective method to identify germline variants in cancer patients compared to single-gene approaches and should be therefore included in clinical laboratories."

In this article, we show that multiple stakeholder perspectives and data sources should be used to capture key values for sustainable planning and management of urban green spaces. Using an urban forest in Helsinki, Finland as a case study, we incorporated data collected using public participation GIS, expert elicitation and forest inventories in order to investigate the guidance that the different types of data, and their integration, can provide for landscape planning. We examined the relationship and spatial concurrence between two social variables i.e. visitors' perceived landscape values and green space use, and two ecological variables i.e. forest habitat quality and urban biodiversity, using hot/coldspot analysis. We found weak correlations and low mean spatial coincidence between the social and ecological data, indicating great complementary importance to multi-criteria decision-making. In addition, there was a higher level of spatial agreement between the ecological datasets than between the social datasets. Forest habitat quality and urban biodiversity were positively correlated and spatially coincided moderately, while we found a negative correlation and very low overlap between visitor use and landscape values. This highlights the conceptual and spatial distinction between the general preferences and values citizens assign to public green spaces and the realized everyday use of these areas and their services. The resulting maps can inform planners on overall social and environmental quality of the landscape, and point out potential threats to areas of high ecological value due to intensive recreational use, which is crucial information for natural resource management. In the end, we discuss different strategies for managing overlaps and discrepancies between the social and ecological values."
https://openalex.org/W2893966352,"Delaying the time of start of school allows for longer sleep duration, better mood, and better school performance. In South Korea, a campaign was launched in 2014 to delay the school start time to 9 a.m. We analyzed the campaign's effects on adolescents' total sleep duration, sleepiness (presented as weekend catch-up sleep), emotions, and school performance. Based on data from 2013, changes of sleep patterns, emotions, and academic achievement in adolescents were evaluated using the 2012-2016 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based survey from two educational districts: Gyeonggi (fully participated in the delayed school start time campaign; intervention group) and Daegu/Gyeongbuk/Ulsan (DGU, never participated; control group). The primary outcomes were sleep duration, time of sleep onset, and difference in sleep duration between weekdays and the weekend. Secondary outcomes were the proportional changes of mood, stress, and school performance. The sleep duration of students in the intervention group temporarily increased in 2015. However, because there was a simultaneous delay in time of sleep onset, sleep duration returned to pre-campaign levels in 2016. Although sleep duration did not increase, weekend catch-up sleep decreased by approximately 19 minutes for students in the intervention group. Meanwhile, in the control group sleep duration tended to decrease over the same period. The impact of the campaign on students' emotions and school performance could not be confirmed. This study demonstrated that delaying the school start time to 9 a.m. reduced duration of weekend catch-up sleep with a transient increase in sleep duration in adolescents."

This ancillary study to the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) obtained baseline assessments (at randomization) of PWV and central systolic blood pressure (C-SBP) to: 1) characterize these vascular measurements in the SPRINT cohort, and 2) test the hypotheses that PWV and C-SBP are associated with glucose homeostasis and markers of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The SphygmoCor® CPV device was used to assess carotid-femoral PWV and its pulse wave analysis study protocol was used to obtain C-SBP. Valid results were obtained from 652 participants. Mean (±SD) PWV and C-SBP for the SPRINT cohort were 10.7 ± 2.7 m/s and 132.0 ± 17.9 mm Hg respectively. Linear regression analyses for PWV and C-SBP results adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity in relation to several markers of glucose homeostasis and CKD did not identify any significant associations with the exception of a marginally statistically significant and modest association between PWV and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (linear regression estimate ± SE, 0.001 ± 0.0006; P-value 0.046). In a subset of SPRINT participants, PWV was significantly higher than in prior studies of normotensive persons, as expected. For older age groups in the SPRINT cohort (age > 60 years), PWV was compared with a reference population of hypertensive individuals. There were no compelling associations noted between PWV or C-SBP and markers of glucose homeostasis or CKD.NCT01206062."
https://openalex.org/W2892877704,"The impact of risk factors on poor outcome after ischemic stroke is well known, but estimating the amount of poor outcome attributable to single factors is challenging in presence of multimorbidity. We aim to compare population attributable risk estimates obtained from different statistical approaches regarding their consistency. We use a real-life data set from the PROSCIS study to identify predictors for mortality and functional impairment one year after first-ever ischemic stroke and quantify their contribution to poor outcome using population attributable risks.The PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke (PROSCIS) is a prospective observational hospital-based cohort study of patients after first-ever stroke conducted independently in Berlin (PROSCIS-B) and Munich (PROSCIS-M). The association of baseline factors with poor outcome one year after stroke in PROSCIS-B was analysed using multiple logistic regression analysis and population attributable risks were calculated, which were estimated using sequential population attributable risk based on a multiple generalized additive regression model, doubly robust estimation, as well as using average sequential population attributable risk. Findings were reproduced in an independent validation sample from PROSCIS-M.Out of 507 patients with available outcome information after 12 months in PROSCIS-B, 20.5% suffered from poor outcome. Factors associated with poor outcome were age, pre-stroke physical disability, stroke severity (NIHSS), education, and diabetes mellitus. The order of risk factors ranked by magnitudes of population attributable risk was almost similar for all methods, but population attributable risk estimates varied markedly between the methods. In PROSCIS-M, incidence of poor outcome and distribution of baseline parameters were comparable. The multiple logistic regression model could be reproduced for all predictors, except pre-stroke physical disability. Similar to PROSCIS-B, the order of risk factors ranked by magnitudes of population attributable risk was almost similar for all methods, but magnitudes of population attributable risk differed markedly between the methods.Ranking of risk factors by population impact is not affected by the different statistical approaches. Thus, for a rational decision on which risk factor to target in disease interventions, population attributable risk is a supportive tool. However, population attributable risk estimates are difficult to interpret and are not comparable when they origin from studies applying different methodology. The predictors for poor outcome identified in PROSCIS-B have a relevant impact on mortality and functional impairment one year after first-ever ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2893230130,"The domesticated phenotype is a set of behavioural, morphological and physiological traits that is common for domesticated species. Previous research has found that selection for tameness only can give rise to correlated selection responses that resemble the domesticated phenotype. It has therefore been suggested that tameness may drive the domesticated phenotype as correlated traits. We selected Red Junglefowl for divergent levels of fear of human for eight generations and assessed possible correlated selection responses in other behaviours in semi-natural settings. Behavioural studies were carried out on birds from generations six to eight, and at different ages, in order to study possible effects on general activity, social behaviour and male courtship behaviour. We found that the differences between selection lines changed with age. Adult low fear birds were generally more active and high fear males showed a more intense courtship behaviour. Our study shows that several behaviours can be modified through correlated selection responses by selection on reduced fear of humans only, emphasising the putative role of tameness as a driver of domestication related phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2894441445,"This study examined the sexual reproductive cycle, energy storage and metabolic requirements of a Mediterranean gorgonian in a mesophotic ecosystem (~70 m depth). Paramuricea macrospina resulted to be a gonochoric internal brooding species with a 1:1 population sex ratio. Oogenesis lasted ~12–14 months, whereas spermatogenesis was significantly shorter, only lasting 6 months. Fertilization occurred during late summer (August) and larval release occurred during autumn (September–October). The organic matter and total lipid content showed a slight seasonal variability. Stable isotopic composition remained constant throughout the year, reflecting a general stability in gorgonian food sources. Conversely, the free fatty acid composition varied seasonally, reflecting changes in P. macrospina energetic demands probably related to gametogenesis and larval brooding. The reproductive ecology and biochemical composition of P. macrospina significantly differ from shallow coastal gorgonian species, reflecting the higher environmental stability of deeper environments."
https://openalex.org/W2893192500,"It is generally believed that stress wave superposition does occur and plays an important role in cutting blasting with a single free surface, in which explosive columns of several blast holes with short spacing are simultaneously initiated. However, considering the large scatter of pyrotechnic delay detonators that are used in most underground metal mines in China, the existence of stress wave superposition and the influence of this effect on rock fragmentation are questionable. In the present study, the stress wave interaction in short-delay blasting with a single free surface was studied through the use of the LS-DYNA code. Stress waves induced by two blast holes blasting with different delays were compared with the single blast hole case, and the effects of delay time, detonating location and spacing on stress wave superposition were investigated. The numerical results showed that for blast holes with a 1 m spacing, stress wave interaction only occurs when the delay time is 0 ms and does not occur for blasting with delays of more than 1 ms. An increase in the duration of a stress wave via optimizing the detonation location does not improve the stress wave interaction. For a 1 ms delay, stress wave superposition only occurs when the spacing is more than 4 m, which is a rare case in practice. The results indicated that the occurrence of stress wave superposition for blasting with a single free surface is strictly limited to conditions that would be difficult to achieve under the existing delay accuracy of detonators. Therefore, it is unrealistic to improve fragmentation via the stress wave interaction in field blasting. Furthermore, the numerical results of the stress wave interaction also show that there would be a great potential to reduce the hazardous vibrations induced by short-delay blasting by using electronic detonators with better control of delays in an order of several milliseconds."
https://openalex.org/W2893809177,"The present study utilizes perceptual hysteresis effects to compare the ambiguity of Mona Lisa's emotional face expression (high-level ambiguity) and of geometric cube stimuli (low-level ambiguity).In two experiments we presented series of nine Mona Lisa variants and nine cube variants. Stimulus ambiguity was manipulated by changing Mona Lisa's mouth curvature (Exp. 1) and the cubes' back-layer luminance (Exp. 2). Each experiment consisted of three conditions, two with opposite stimulus presentation sequences with increasing and decreasing degrees of ambiguity, respectively, and a third condition with a random presentation sequence. Participants indicated happy or sad face percepts (Exp. 1) and alternative 3D cube percepts (Exp. 2) by key presses. We studied the influences of a priori perceptual biases (long-term memory) and presentation order (short-term memory) on perception.Perception followed sigmoidal functions of the stimulus ambiguity morphing parameters. The morphing parameter for the functions' inflection points depended strongly on stimulus presentation order with similar effect sizes but different signs for the two stimulus types (positive hysteresis / priming for the cubes; negative hysteresis / adaptation for Mona Lisa). In the random conditions, the inflection points were located in the middle between those from the two directional conditions for the Mona Lisa stimuli. For the cube stimuli, they were superimposed on one sigmoidal function for the ordered condition.The hysteresis effects reflect the influence of short-term memory during the perceptual disambiguation of ambiguous sensory information. The effects for the two stimulus types are of similar size, explaining up to 34% of the perceptual variance introduced by the paradigm. We explain the qualitative difference between positive and negative hysteresis with adaptation for Mona Lisa and with priming for the cubes. In addition, the hysteresis paradigm allows a quantitative determination of the impact of adaptation and priming during the resolution of perceptual ambiguities. The asymmetric shifts of inflection points in the case of the cube stimuli is likely due to an a priori perceptual bias, reflecting an influence of long-term memory. Whether corresponding influences also exist for the Mona Lisa variants is so far unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2894286421,"Bipedal locomotion may occur over imperfect surfaces with bumps or other features that disrupt steady gait. An unexpected bump in the road is generally expected to slow down most types of locomotion. On wheels, speed may be regained quite readily with “cruise control” performed in continuous time. But legged locomotion is less straightforward, because the stance leg may be under-actuated, and the continuous-time dynamics are periodically disrupted by discrete ground contact events. Those events may also afford good control opportunities, albeit subject to the delay between discrete opportunities. The regulation of walking speed should ideally use these opportunities to compensate for lost time, and with good economy if possible. However, the appropriate control strategy is unknown. Here we present how to restore speed and make up for time lost going over a bump in the road, through discrete, once-per-step control. We use a simple dynamic walking model to determine the optimal sequence of control actions—pushing off from the leg at the end of each stance phase—for fast response or best economy. A two-step, deadbeat sequence is the fastest possible response, and reasonably economical. Slower responses over more steps are more economical overall, but a bigger difference is that they demand considerably less peak power. A simple, reactive control strategy can thus compensate for an unexpected bump, with explicit trade-offs in time and work. Control of legged locomotion is not as straightforward as with wheels, but discrete control actions also allow for effective and economical reactions to imperfect terrain."

(family Paguridae) is described from rocky subtidal reefs off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and illustrated using both conventional drawings and colour photographs, and via three-dimensional (3D) X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). Because of the limitation μCT has in detecting very fine and soft structures, a novel approach of manually drawing setation and spinulation onto the two-dimensional images of the 3D visualizations was used to illustrate the pereopods. In addition, an interactive figure and rotation movie clips in the supplement section complement the species description, and the 3D raw data of the 3D type data are downloadable from the Gigascience Database repository. The new species is the sixth species of Pagurus Fabricius, 1775 reported from South Africa and is closely allied to the Indo-Pacific P. boriaustraliensis Morgen, 1990 and P. pitagsaleei McLaughlin, 2002, from which it differs by its shorter ocular peduncles, by the armature of the carpus of the right cheliped, and also in colouration. This study presents the first description of a hermit crab in which a majority of taxonomic details are illustrated through 3D volume-rendered illustrations. In addition, colour photographs and COI molecular barcodes are provided, and the latter compared to COI sequences of specimens from Western Australia previously identified as P. boriaustraliensis and of specimens of P. pitagsaleei from Taiwan, as well as to three additional South African members of the genus.

https://openalex.org/W2892523396,"Whether and how anemia treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) before hemodialysis initiation may be associated with lower mortality after dialysis initiation is unknown. We compared all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in two groups of patients who experienced distinct anemia treatment patterns with ESAs before and after hemodialysis initiation. This retrospective cohort analysis included patients initiating hemodialysis April 1, 2012-June 30, 2013, identified from United States Renal Data System end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and pre-ESRD files. Patients treated with ESAs before and after hemodialysis initiation who maintained Hb ≥ 9.0 g/dL throughout (comparator group, n = 3662) were compared with patients with Hb < 9.0 g/dL before hemodialysis initiation (with or without ESAs) whose levels increased with ESAs after hemodialysis initiation (referent group, n = 4461). Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratio of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality after hemodialysis initiation. Of 20,454 patients, 4855 (23.7%) had Hb < 9.0 g/dL upon hemodialysis initiation; of these 4855, 26.6% received ESAs before initiation. Comparator group Hb levels increased from 8.2 ± 0.8 mg/dL upon initiation to 10.9 ± 1.2 with ESAs afterward. Comparator patients were more likely than referent patients to be younger (76.3 ± 6.7 versus 77.2 ± 6.9 years), male (51.5% versus 49.8%), and black (24.6% versus 18.6%). Risk of all-cause mortality was lower for the comparator group versus the referent group at 3 (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68-1.00, P = 0.052), 6 (0.86, 0.74-1.00, P = 0.047), and 12 (0.88, 0.78-0.99, P = 0.036) months. The pattern was similar for cardiovascular mortality. Hb ≥ 9.0 with ESAs before and after hemodialysis initiation was generally associated with lower post-initiation all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with predialysis Hb < 9.0 g/dL in patients whose Hb levels subsequently improved with ESAs after hemodialysis initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2893485649,"Family-centered care is one the most important indicators of high-quality care. The organizational citizenship behavior and commitment can enhance the quality of healthcare. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the organizational citizenship behavior on family-centered care considering the mediating role of multiple commitment. This descriptive study was conducted on 237 nurses working in pediatric and infant units of hospitals in Tehran city, Iran. The subjects were selected using the convenience sampling method. Data collection was performed using the Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale, Perceived Family-Centered Care Staff Questionnaire, Affective Commitment Scale, and Commitment to the Supervisor Scale. The SPSS v.22 and SEM-PLS v.2 software were used for data analysis. Results were extracted in the form of a standard model and fitted for indices pertaining to the measurement and structural models. Accordingly, the organizational citizenship behavior had a direct effect on family-centered care (β = 0.19, t = 2.39). Moreover, multiple commitment including commitment to the leader and commitment to the organization had indirect weak and moderate effects on the relationship between the organizational citizenship behavior and family-centered care, respectively. An inverse association was reported between commitment to the leader and family-centered care. Furthermore, the organizational citizenship behavior predicted family-centered care by 70% considering the mediating role of multiple commitment. Therefore, family-centered care as an indicator of high-quality care can be improved through enhancing the organizational citizenship behavior and organizational commitment among Iranian nurses working in pediatric wards."
https://openalex.org/W2894126789,"Background In China, register nurses (RNs) have a high risk of occupational exposure to blood/body fluids. The adherence behavior related to self-reporting of occupational exposure needs to be evaluated to protect RNs from healthcare-related infections. Objectives To assess adherence behaviors for self-reporting of occupational exposure to blood and body fluids among RNs and identify factors affecting self-reporting in Hunan Province, China for developing upgraded strategies. Methods Study participants, randomly selected from six tertiary hospitals in Changsha City, completed a structured questionnaire. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe basic demographic data. One-way analysis of variance was performed to assess whether adherence behaviors were correlated to each other; the multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with reporting exposure to blood/body fluids. Results In total, 548 RNs completed the questionnaire. All participants experienced sharp object injuries at least once during their career; 65.88% of participants were exposed to blood/body fluids thrice, and 31.2% experienced 1–5 occupational exposures in the past month. However, only 14.6% of participants submitted a blood/body fluid exposure report to a supervisor/official after every incident. Blood/body fluid exposure was associated with the non-usage of safety protocols. Only 10.2% of participants believed the employer paid more attention to needle-stick injuries (P<0.01) than to other injuries. Most participants (73.5%) reported the absence of psychological support after injuries (P<0.01). Nine personal and management factors were observed to be closely related to underreporting behavior. Conclusion The prevalence of exposure to blood/body fluids among RNs was high, and the underreporting rate was likely substantially underestimated. Safety-engineered devices must be adopted to decrease the prevalence of sharp object injuries. To encourage employees to report occupational exposure events, a series of hospital-wide actions need to be adopted."

https://openalex.org/W2892562286,"Excess glutamate during intense neuronal activity is not instantly cleared and may accumulate in the extracellular space. This has various long-term consequences such as ectopic signaling, modulation of synaptic efficacy and excitotoxicity; the latter implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the quantitative imaging of glutamate homeostasis of hippocampal slices from methyl-CpG binding protein 2 knock-out (Mecp2-/y) mice, a model of Rett syndrome (RTT), revealed unusual repetitive glutamate transients. They appeared in phase with bursts of action potentials in the CA1 neurons. Both glutamate transients and bursting activity were suppressed by the blockade of sodium, AMPA and voltage-gated calcium channels (T- and R-type), and enhanced after the inhibition of HCN channels. HCN and calcium channels in RTT and wild-type (WT) CA1 neurons displayed different voltage-dependencies and kinetics. Both channels modulated postsynaptic integration and modified the pattern of glutamate spikes in the RTT hippocampus. Spontaneous glutamate transients were much less abundant in the WT preparations, and, when observed, had smaller amplitude and frequency. The basal ambient glutamate levels in RTT were higher and transient glutamate increases (spontaneous and evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals) decayed slower. Both features indicate less efficient glutamate uptake in RTT. To explain the generation of repetitive glutamate spikes, we designed a novel model of glutamate-induced glutamate release. The simulations correctly predicted the patterns of spontaneous glutamate spikes observed under different experimental conditions. We propose that pervasive spontaneous glutamate release is a hallmark of Mecp2-/y hippocampus, stemming from and modulating the hyperexcitability of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2893528411,"Background Activation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) by pulse electric field (PEF) releases growth factors which promote wound healing (e.g., PDGF, VEGF for granulation, EGF for epithelialization). Aims To determine after PEF activation of therapeutic PRP: 1) platelet gel strength; 2) profile of released growth factors; 3) alpha- and T-granule release; 4) platelet morphology. Methods Concentrated normal donor PRP was activated by 5 μsec (long) monopolar pulse, ~4000 V/cm (PEF A) or 150 nsec (short) bipolar pulse, ~3000 V/cm (PEF B) in the presence of 2.5 mM (low) or 20 mM (high) added CaCl2. Clot formation was evaluated by thromboelastography (TEG). Surface exposure of alpha granule (P-selectin) and T-granule (TLR9 and protein disulfide isomerase [PDI]) markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Factors in supernatants of activated PRP were measured by ELISA. Platelet morphology was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results Time to initial clot formation was shorter with thrombin (<1 min) than with PEF A and B (4.4–8.7 min) but clot strength (elastic modulus, derived from TEG maximum amplitude) was greater with PEF B than with either thrombin or PEF A (p<0.05). Supernatants of PRP activated with PEF A had higher EGF levels than supernatants from all other conditions. In contrast, levels of PF4, PDGF, and VEGF in supernatants were not significantly different after PEF A, PEF B, and thrombin activation. T-granule markers (TLR9 and PDI) were higher after thrombin than after PEF A or B with low or high CaCl2. By TEM, platelets in PEF-treated samples retained a subset of granules suggesting regulated granule release. Conclusion Pulse length and polarity can be modulated to produce therapeutic platelet gels as strong or stronger than those produced by thrombin, and this is tunable to produce growth factor profiles enhanced in specific factors important for different stages of wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2893810171,"The purpose of this work is to investigate if the curve-fitting algorithm in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI experiments influences the diagnostic quality of calculated parameter maps.We compared the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and a Bayesian method (BM) in DCE data of 42 glioma patients, using two compartmental models (extended Toft's and 2-compartment-exchange model). Logistic regression and an ordinal linear mixed model were used to investigate if the image quality differed between the curve-fitting algorithms and to quantify if image quality was affected for different parameters and algorithms. The diagnostic performance to discriminate between high-grade and low-grade gliomas was compared by applying a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (statistical significance p>0.05). Two neuroradiologists assessed different qualitative imaging features.Parameter maps based on BM, particularly those describing the blood-brain barrier, were superior those based on LM. The image quality was found to be significantly improved (p<0.001) for BM when assessed through independent clinical scores. In addition, given a set of clinical scores, the generating algorithm could be predicted with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.91 and 1). Using linear mixed models, image quality was found to be improved when applying the 2-compartment-exchange model compared to the extended Toft's model, regardless of the underlying fitting algorithm. Tumor grades were only differentiated reliably on plasma volume maps when applying BM. The curve-fitting algorithm had, however, no influence on grading when using parameter maps describing the blood-brain barrier.The Bayesian method has the potential to increase the diagnostic reliability of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced parameter maps in brain tumors. In our data, images based on the 2-compartment-exchange model were superior to those based on the extended Toft's model."
https://openalex.org/W2892966590,"Purpose The aim was to assess personalised contrast media (CM) protocols—based on patient’s blood volume (BV) and automated tube voltage selection (ATVS)—in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Methods A total of 114 consecutive patients received an ECG-triggered or ECG-gated helical scan on a 3rd-generation dual-source CT with 70-120kV (ATVS) and 330mAsqual.ref. CM was adapted to BV, scan time (s) and kV. Image quality (IQ) was assessed in a 17-segment coronary model using attenuation values (HU), contrast-to-noise (CNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (objective IQ) and a Likert scale (subjective IQ: 1 = poor/2 = sufficient/3 = good/4 = excellent). ig Results Patient distribution was: n = 60 for 70kV, n = 37 80kV and n = 17 90kV. Mean BV was 5.4±0.6L for men and 4.1±0.6L for women. Mean CM volume (300 mg I/mL) and flow rate were: 30.9±6.4mL and 3.3±0.5mL/s (70kV); 40.8±7.1mL and 4.5±0.6mL/s (80kV); 53.6±8.6mL and 5.7±0.6mL/s (90kV). Overall mean HU was >300HU in 98.2% (112/114) of patients. Overall mean attenuation was below 300HU in two scans (70kV) due to late scan timing. Of 1.661 segments, 95.4% was assessable. Mean CNR was 14±4(70kV), 13±3(80kV) and 14±4(90kV); mean SNR was 10±2(both 70kV+80kV) and 9±2(90kV). Objective IQ was comparable between kV settings, protocols and sex. Subjective IQ was diagnostic in all scans and excellent-sufficient in 95.4% of segments. Conclusions Personalisation of CCTA CM injection protocols to BV and ATVS is a promising technique to tailor CM administration to the individual patient, while maintaining diagnostic IQ."
https://openalex.org/W2893683949,"Objectives We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of biological investigations in cases of eosinophilia in our area (French Alps). Methods We retrospectively included all adult patients attending the infectious disease and internal medicine units between 2009 and 2015 with eosinophilia ≥1 G/l. Results We identified 298 cases (129 women and 169 men). In 139 patients, eosinophilia had not been addressed. In the 159 others, the cause of eosinophilia was identified in 118 (74.2%). The main identified causes at the time were drug reactions (24.5%, mostly β-lactams and allopurinol), infectious diseases (17.0%), vasculitis (8.2%), autoimmune diseases (6.9%), and malignant diseases (6.2%). In patients with a skin rash, eosinophilia was significantly more often investigated, and a diagnosis significantly more often made. Helminthosis were mainly diagnosed in tropical travelers (18/24) excepting toxocariasis (3 non-travelers). Stool examination for helminthosis was positive in 5/76 patients (6.6%) (all tropical travelers); 391 helminth serologies were performed in 91 patients, with 7.9% being positive (all but 3 positive cases were travelers). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were positive in 26/112 patients (23.2%), with 9 cases of vasculitis identified. Conclusions Drug-related eosinophilia is the main etiology. Search for helminthosis is not recommended among non-travelers (excepting toxocariasis). ANCA should be performed early so as not to overlook vasculitis."
https://openalex.org/W2894066650,"Previous structural studies of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a crucial negative regulator of bone remodeling and osteoclastogenesis, were mostly limited to the N-terminal ligand-binding domains. It is now known that the three C-terminal domains of OPG also play essential roles in its function by mediating OPG dimerization, OPG-heparan sulfate (HS) interactions, and formation of the OPG-HS-receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) ternary complex. Employing hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS methods, here we investigated the structure of full-length OPG in complex with HS or RANKL in solution. Our data revealed two noteworthy aspects of the OPG structure. First, we found that the interconnection between the N- and C-terminal domains is much more rigid than previously thought, possibly because of hydrophobic interactions between the fourth cysteine-rich domain and the first death domain. Second, we observed that two hydrophobic clusters located in two separate C-terminal domains directly contribute to OPG dimerization, likely by forming a hydrophobic dimerization interface. Aided by site-directed mutagenesis, we further demonstrated that an intact dimerization interface is essential for the biological activity of OPG. Our study represents an important step toward deciphering the structure-function relationship of the full-length OPG protein."
https://openalex.org/W2892544236,"Diagnostic radiology examinations are generally very efficient processes optimized for high throughput and for serving the needs of physicians. On the downside, streamlined examinations disrupt the personal relationship between diagnosticians and patients. The radiology associations RSNA and ACR consider low visibility of radiologists a threat to the profession. Therefore, they launched counter-acting initiatives that aim at increasing patient satisfaction by providing more personal attention and care, and by raising knowledge about the discipline. However, they did not formulate concrete instructions on how to integrate care by radiologists into the examination process while inhibiting the flow minimally. From an internal patient satisfaction survey, we have seen that patients rated satisfaction with care and attention by physicians relatively low, indicating that patients would welcome a possibility to communicate with radiologists. In a controlled experimental setting, we have then changed our process to include a short medical history interview. Thereby we could corroborate that lack of educated communication is the primary cause of diminished satisfaction and could establish that the duration of the encounter is not critical to achieving improvement. Importantly, the interview also helped to improve the quality of the examination. Thus, short medical history interviews are a very efficient way to increase value by maximizing patient satisfaction and examination quality. Our approach is easy to implement in other radiology clinics that are interested in becoming more patient-centered and in raising patient satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2892752182,"Few land plants can synthesize and accumulate the osmoprotectant glycine betaine (GB) even though this metabolic trait has major adaptive importance given the prevalence of drought, hypersaline soils or cold. GB is synthesized from choline in two reactions catalyzed by choline monooxygenases (CMOs) and enzymes of the family 10 of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH10s) that gained betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (BADH). Homolog genes encoding CMO and ALDH10 enzymes are present in all known land plant genomes, but since GB-non-accumulators plants lack the BADH-type ALDH10 isozyme, they would be expected to also lack the CMO activity to avoid accumulation of the toxic betaine aldehyde. To explore CMOs substrate specificity, we performed amino acid sequence alignments, phylogenetic analysis, homology modeling and docking simulations. We found that plant CMOs form a monophyletic subfamily within the Rieske/mononuclear non-heme oxygenases family with two clades: CMO1 and CMO2, the latter diverging from CMO1 after gene duplication. CMO1 enzymes are present in all plants; CMO2s only in the Amaranthaceae high-GB-accumulators plants. CMO2s, and particularly their mononuclear non-heme iron domain where the active site is located, evolved at a faster rate than CMO1s, which suggests positive selection. The homology model and docking simulations of the spinach CMO2 enzyme showed at the active site three aromatic residues forming a box with which the trimethylammonium group of choline could interact through cation-π interactions, and a glutamate, which also may interact with the trimethylammonium group through a charge-charge interaction. The aromatic box and the carboxylate have been shown to be critical for choline binding in other proteins. Interestingly, these residues are conserved in CMO2 proteins but not in CMO1 proteins, where two of these aromatic residues are leucine and the glutamate is asparagine. These findings reinforce our proposal that the CMO1s physiological substrate is not choline but a still unknown metabolite."

Calpain-3 is abundant in skeletal muscle, where its mutation-induced loss of function causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.

Therefore, here we used recombinant rat calpain-2 as a stable surrogate and inserted IS1 into its equivalent position in the protease core. As it does in calpain-3, IS1 occupied the catalytic cleft and restricted the enzyme’s access to substrate and inhibitors. Following activation by Ca2+, IS1 was rapidly cleaved by intramolecular autolysis, permitting the enzyme to freely accept substrate and inhibitors. The surrogate remained functional until extensive intermolecular autoproteolysis inactivated the enzyme, as is typical of calpain-2. Although the small-molecule inhibitors E-64 and leupeptin limited intermolecular autolysis of the surrogate, they did not block the initial intramolecular cleavage of IS1, establishing its role as a propeptide. Surprisingly, the large-molecule calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, completely blocked enzyme activity, even with IS1 intact. We suggest that calpastatin is large enough to oust IS1 from the catalytic cleft and take its place.

https://openalex.org/W2893007544,"Forest lands hold great potential for Populus plantations, but in native boreal forests, soils normally have low pH and thus higher levels of aluminum ions (Al3+ and hydroxides). Aluminum (Al) is one of the major factors limiting plant growth on these soils by inhibiting root growth, thus reducing water and nutrient uptake and slowing growth. There is a large variation in Al resistance both among and within species. In this study, growth responses of greenhouse-grown hybrid aspen (P. tremula × tremuloides) and poplar (P. trichocarpa hybrids) were monitored in relation to changes in Al concentrations. In quartz sand, hybrid aspen was more tolerant to exogenous application of Al than P. trichocarpa hybrids. This difference in Al-tolerance was further confirmed by hematoxylin staining of the roots, with hybrid aspen displaying less staining after Al treatment than poplar clones. When planted on forest land with low pH, hybrid aspen increased growth after planting and showed low mortality. This was not the case for poplar clones; plant height decreased after planting and mortality increased. Together, our results suggest that differences in initial growth and survival on forest land among hybrid aspen and the tested poplar clones may be connected to differences in Al tolerance. Our findings that staining with hematoxylin can identify Al-tolerant Populus genotypes may help identify Al-tolerant genotypes suitable for forest land."
https://openalex.org/W2888971219,"Background Alexithymia, a difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions, has been associated with obesity and eating disorders in small-scale cross-sectional studies. Here, we assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and alexithymia in a large cohort of free-living Finnish adults over a 15-year period. Methods Participants were drawn from the Northern Finnish Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). The 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was used as a measure of alexithymia and was completed at the age of 31 years (31y: n = 4841), and 46 years (46y: n = 5404). BMI was recorded at both time points. Where data at both time points were available (n = 3274), the relationship between changes in BMI and TAS-20 over this time period was also investigated. Results BMI was significantly and positively associated with TAS-20 score (p<0.0001, both at 31 years and at 46 years of ages). The association remained statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders (sex, marital status and several socio-economic indicators). In individuals who experienced the greatest change in BMI (in either direction) over the 15-year period, there was a modest mean increase in TAS-20 score. Conclusions Our data revealed that TAS-20 score was correlated with and co-varied with body mass status. We suggest that future clinical research should consider the role of alexithymia in obesity. Further investigation of this relationship is warranted to ensure that the needs of obese subjects with undiagnosed alexithymia are considered in the design of weight management programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2892905365,"This study evaluated risks of emergency room visit (ERV) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 2005-2011, among patients with cardiologic and metabolic syndromes (CMS), in association with ambient environments.Pooled and area-specific weather related cumulative six-day (lags 0 to 5) relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of ERV for OHCA were evaluated for CMS cases, using distributed lag nonlinear models and multivariate meta-analytical second-stage model in association with the daily average temperatures and daily concentrations of air pollutants.ERV risk increased as average temperature dropped to <27°C. At the mean temperature of 14°C, the cumulative six-day RRs of ERV were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.46) for all OHCA patients, 1.74 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.84) for OHCA patients younger than 65 years old, and 1.99 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.81) for subjects with pre-existing hypertension. High temperature was also associated with elevated ERV of OHCA. Increased ERV risks in cases with pre-existing hypertension and diabetes mellitus were also associated with concentrations of air pollutants in northern Taiwan.Our data provided evidences to clinicians, emerging medical services and public health that the ERV risk for OHCA patients is greater at low temperature than at high temperature. Patients with cardio and metabolic disorders need to pay greater attention to low temperature and avoid heat wave."
https://openalex.org/W2651620993,"This study presents a French translation and validation of the Durand Adaptive Psychopathic Traits Questionnaire (DAPTQ; Durand, 2017), an instrument for assessing adaptive traits known to correlate with the psychopathic personality. The first sample, which included individuals from France and Canada (N = 135, 52% in France, Mage = 26.98, SD = 9.24), completed the DAPTQ in French, alongside measures of empathy, positive and negative affects, satisfaction with life, and self-esteem. The second sample included bilingual (French and English) individuals from France and Canada (N = 141, 52% in France, Mage = 29.73, SD = 9.09) who completed both versions of the DAPTQ (French and English), alongside measurements of perceived stress, trait anxiety, and creativity. The results support the DAPTQ–French version good internal consistency (α = .89/.87), convergent validity, and concurrent validity. Correlation between the DAPTQ total and subscales across versions (French-English) showed strong associations (r = .84 to .96). These findings support the cross-cultural equivalence of the DAPTQ and its effectiveness as a valid assessment method of adaptive traits in the field of psychopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2893474123,"We examined the effect of hearing two types of self-relevant words, one’s own name and the name of others, on vigilant attention, arousal, and subjective sleepiness during performing the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). Participants performed the PVT under three experimental conditions, (a) hearing own full name (high self-relevant condition), (b) hearing other’s name (low self- relevant condition) and (c) the control condition with no stimuli. Participants heard the names every 20 sec. Self-relevance was assessed before the experiment using the self-relevance scale. The results of the behavioral effects are relatively small and not consistently supported by all of the performance indicators. A tentative conclusion, based on the overall pattern of results, is that (1) arousal increased by hearing a name, regardless of its self-relevance, and (2) hearing less self-relevant stimuli such as other’s name had a distractive effect on ongoing task performance, although it increased arousal, being aware that further experiments are urgently necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2894255258,"The role of DNA methylation patterns in complex phenotypes remains unclear. To explore this question, we adapted our methods for rare variant analysis to characterize genome-wide murine DNA hybridization array to investigate methylation at CpG islands, shores, and regulatory elements. We have applied this platform to compare age and tissue- specific methylation differences in the brain and spleen of young and aged mice. As expected from prior studies, there are clear global differences in organ-specific, but not age-specific, methylation due mostly to changes at repetitive elements. Surprisingly, out of 200,000 loci there were only 946 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) between young and old samples (529 hypermethylated, 417 hypomethylated in aged mice) compared to thousands of tissue-specific DMCs. Hypermethylated loci were clustered around the promoter region of Sfi1, exon 2 of Slc11a2, Drg1, Esr1 and Foxa2 transcription factor binding sites. In particular, there were 75 hypermethylated Foxa2 binding sites across a 2.7 Mb region of chromosome 11. Hypomethylated loci were clustered around Mid1, Isoc2b and genome-wide loci with binding sites for Foxa2 and Esr1, which are known to play important roles in development and aging. These data suggest discreet tissue-independent methylation changes associated with aging processes such as cell division (Sfi1, Mid1), energy production (Drg1, Isoc2b) and cell death (Foxa2, Esr1)."
https://openalex.org/W2892980926,"Following a period of interruption of Gavi's funds for health system strengthening (HSS) in Cameroon and Chad, the two countries reprogramed their HSS grants. To implement the reprogrammed HSS, Chad committed to better management of the funds. Cameroon chose to channel the HSS funds through one of the health partners. This process is new to Gavi's HSS grants, and little is known about its effectiveness or characteristics. We investigated the advantages and disadvantages of this process to inform the global health community about the added value of this solution.We retrospectively evaluated Gavi's HSS programs in Cameroon and Chad through a mixed methodology. To explore the pros and cons of channeling the funds through a health partner, we triangulated data from document review, key informant interviews (KIIs), field visits, and financial analysis of HSS expenditures in both countries.Data triangulated from multiple sources showed that channeling HSS funds thorugh a health partner in Cameroon allowed compliance with budget, the development of a stronger accounting system at the Ministry of Health (MOH), and a rigid monitoring system. However, this mechanism delayed implementation by six months, accounted for 15% of the total cost, and created a tension around roles between MOH and the health partner. Achievement of program's output indicators was average. In Chad, expenditures complied with budget as well. However, implementation was delayed longer causing a second reprogramming of the funds. While the program had fewer output indicators in Chad, these were minimally achieved.To our knowledge, this is the first study of channeling Gavi HSS funds through a health partner. This new process contributed to a higher level of implementation, stronger monitoring, and strengthened accountability in Cameroon. Recipient countries of Gavi HSS grants who lack the financial management capacity can benefit from a similar process."
