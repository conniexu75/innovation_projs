https://openalex.org/W4237347820,"Single-wall fullerene nanotubes were converted from nearly endless, highly tangled ropes into short, open-ended pipes that behave as individual macromolecules. Raw nanotube material was purified in large batches, and the ropes were cut into 100- to 300-nanometer lengths. The resulting pieces formed a stable colloidal suspension in water with the help of surfactants. These suspensions permit a variety of manipulations, such as sorting by length, derivatization, and tethering to gold surfaces."

Here, actively dividing fetal fibroblasts were genetically modified with a marker gene, a clonal line was selected, and the cells were fused to enucleated mature oocytes. Out of 28 embryos transferred to 11 recipient cows, three healthy, identical, transgenic calves were generated. Furthermore, the life-span of near senescent fibroblasts could be extended by nuclear transfer, as indicated by population doublings in fibroblast lines derived from a 40-day-old fetal clone. With the ability to extend the life-span of these primary cultured cells, this system would be useful for inducing complex genetic modifications in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1983341875,Phase-matched harmonic conversion of visible laser light into soft x-rays was demonstrated. The recently developed technique of guided-wave frequency conversion was used to upshift light from 800 nanometers to the range from 17 to 32 nanometers. This process increased the coherent x-ray output by factors of 10 2 to 10 3 compared to the non–phase-matched case. This source uses a small-scale (sub-millijoule) high repetition-rate laser and will enable a wide variety of new experimental investigations in linear and nonlinear x-ray science.

https://openalex.org/W2030943228,"During hedgehog biosynthesis, autocatalytic processing produces a lipid-modified amino-terminal fragment (residues 24–197 in the human Sonic hedgehog sequence) that is responsible for all known hedgehog signaling activity and that is highly conserved evolutionarily. Published in vitro biochemical studies using Drosophila hedgehog identified the membrane anchor as a cholesterol, and localized the site of attachment to the COOH terminus of the fragment. We have expressed full-length human Sonic hedgehog in insect and in mammalian cells and determined by mass spectrometry that, in addition to cholesterol, the human hedgehog protein is palmitoylated. Peptide mapping and sequencing data indicate that the palmitoyl group is attached to the NH2 terminus of the protein on the α-amino group of Cys-24. Cell-free palmitoylation studies demonstrate that radioactive palmitic acid is readily incorporated into wild type Sonic hedgehog, but not into variant forms lacking the Cys-24 attachment site. The lipid-tethered forms of hedgehog showed about a 30-fold increase in potency over unmodified soluble hedgehog in a cell- based (C3H10T1/2 alkaline phosphatase induction) assay, suggesting that the lipid tether plays an important role in hedgehog function. The observation that an extracellular protein such as Shh is palmitoylated is highly unusual and further adds to the complex nature of this protein.

The hedgehog proteins are a family of extracellular signaling proteins that regulate various aspects of embryonic development both in vertebrates and in invertebrates (for reviews, see Refs. 1Perrimon N.

The most extensively characterized mammalian homolog is Sonic hedgehog (Shh), 1The abbreviations used are: Shh, Sonic hedgehog; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; PSD, post-source decay; Ihh, Indian hedgehog. which is involved in diverse embryonic induction events, including the induction of floor plate and establishment of ventral polarity within the central nervous system as well as proper anterior-posterior patterning of the developing limb (3Riddle R.D.

In mediating these effects, Shh is believed to act both as a short range, contact-dependent inducer and as a long range, diffusible morphogen. Shh is expressed in the embryonic notochord, and induces floor plate formation at the ventral midline of the neural tube in a contact-dependent manner (3Riddle R.D. Johnson R.L. Laufer E. Tabin C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 5Roelink H. Augsberger A. Heemskerk J. Korzh V. Norlin S. Ruiz I. Altaba A. Tanabe Y. Placzek M. Edlund T.

Data suggest Shh can also act as a long range, diffusible morphogen, to promote subsequent differentiation of ventral neurons in a region-specific manner; e.g. dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (7Wang M.Z.

It is presently unclear whether the same molecular species of Shh mediates both of these effects. While the mechanism of action of hedgehog proteins is not fully understood, biochemical and genetic data suggest that the hedgehog receptor is the product of the tumor suppressor genepatched (8Marigo V.

Shh is synthesized as a 45-kDa precursor protein that is cleaved autocatalytically to yield a 20-kDa NH2-terminal fragment that is responsible for all known hedgehog biological activity (residues 24–197 in the human gene sequence) and a 25-kDa COOH-terminal fragment that contains the autoprocessing machinery (15Lee J.J.

Nature. 1995; 374: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal fragment remains membrane-associated through the addition of a lipid tether at its COOH terminus (18Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 19Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W-J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C-H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This tether is critical for restricting the tissue localization of the hedgehog signal. Recent biochemical data have identified the lipid tether as a cholesterol (18Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), the addition of which is catalyzed by the COOH-terminal domain during the autoprocessing step. Here we expressed full-length human Shh in a variety of systems and in characterizing the proposed NH2-terminal fragment, determined that cholesterol alone could not account for the increased mass of the membrane-tethered form of the protein. We identified a second lipid modification, a palmitoyl group, attached at its NH2 terminus. Along with the cholesterol, the palmitic acid modification is likely to have evolved as part of the mechanism for regulating short range-long range signaling by hedgehog. The cDNA for full-length human Shh was provided as a 1.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (20Marigo V. Roberts D.J. Lee S.M.K. Tsukurov O. Levi T. Gastier J.M. Epstein D.J. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Seidman C.E. Jenkins N.A. Seidman J.G. McMahon A.P. Tabin C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (a gift of David Bumcrot from Ontogeny). 5′ and 3′ NotI sites immediately flanking the Shh open reading frame were added by unique site elimination mutagenesis using a Pharmacia kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The 1.4-kilobase NotI fragment carrying the full-length Shh cDNA was then subcloned into the insect expression vector, pFastBac (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculovirus was generated by using the procedures supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. The resulting virus was used to create a high-titer virus stock. Methods used for production and purification of Shh are described below. The presence of membrane-associated Shh was examined by FACS and Western blot analysis. Peak expression occurred 48 h post-infection. For Western blot analysis, supernatants and cell lysates from Shh-infected or uninfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% gradient gel under reducing conditions, transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and the Shh detected with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against an NH2-terminal Shh 15-mer peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate. The cell lysates were made by incubating the cells for 5 min at 25 °C in 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl or in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and then pelleting particulates at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge. For expression of full-length Shh in mammalian cells, the 1.4-kilobaseNotI fragment containing full-length Shh was cloned into a derivative of the pCEP4 (Invitrogen) vector, CH269 (21Sanicola M. Hession C. Worley D. Walus L. Carmillo P. Ehrenfels C. Robinson S. Jarworski G. Wei H. Tizard R. Whitty A. Pepinsky R.B. Cate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6238-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The construct was transfected into EBNA-293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. The expression of surface Shh was verified by FACS and Western blot analysis. A chimeric gene product in which the NH2-terminal fragment (residues 24–197) of human Shh had been fused to the hinge and CH2CH3 regions of human IgG1 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Other constructs encoding soluble human Shh (residues 24–197 without the lipid modification), a mutant version of soluble human Shh containing a Cys-24 to Ser point mutation (C24S), and soluble human Indian hedgehog (Ihh, residues 28–202 in the human gene sequence) were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged fusion proteins with an enterokinase cleavage site immediately adjacent to the start of the mature sequence. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fidelity of the final products after removal of the His tag with enterokinase was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The cDNA encoding the NH2-terminal fragment of rat Sonic hedgehog (residues 25–198 in the rat gene sequence) was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pBluebac III (Invitrogen) and expressed in insect cells essentially as described for the human full-length construct. The NH2-terminal fragment of rat Sonic hedgehog starts at Cys-25 and not at Cys-24 as in the human protein, since the signal sequence of the rat protein contains an additional amino acid residue. The rat sequence (residues 25–198) differs from the human sequence (residues 24–197) by only two residues; Ser-67 and Gly-196 in the human protein are replaced in the rat protein by threonine and aspartic acid, respectively. The membrane-tethered form of Shh was produced in High FiveTMinsect cells (Invitrogen) using the recombinant baculovirus encoding full-length Shh discussed above. High Five cells were grown at 28 °C in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 10-liter bioreactor controlled for oxygen. The cells were infected in late log phase at about 2 × 106 cells/ml with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 h post-infection (cell viability at the time of harvest was >50%). The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting cell pellet (150 g wet weight) was suspended in 1.2 liters of 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml E64, and 120 ml of a 10% solution of Triton X-100 was added. After a 30-min incubation on ice, particulates were removed by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min). All subsequent steps were performed at 4–6 °C. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 5.0 with a stock solution of 0.5 m MES, pH 5.0 (50 mm final), and loaded onto a 150-ml SP-Sepharose FF column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 300 ml of 5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, then with 200 ml of 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 5.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and bound hedgehog eluted with 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 5.5, 800 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The Shh was next subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography on a mAb 5E1-Sepharose resin that was prepared by conjugating 4 mg of the anti-hedgehog antibody (27Ericson J. Morton S. Kawakami A. Roelink H. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) per ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin. The SP-Sepharose elution pool was diluted with 2 volumes of 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, and batch loaded onto the 5E1 resin (1 h). The resin was collected in a column, washed with 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% hydrogenated Triton X-100 (Calbiochem), and eluted with 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 3.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% hydrogenated Triton X-100. The elution fractions were neutralized with 0.1 volumes of 1 m HEPES pH 7.5, and analyzed for total protein content from absorbance measurements at 240–340 nm, and for purity by SDS-PAGE. Fractions were stored at −70 °C. Peak fractions from three affinity steps were pooled, diluted with 1.3 volumes of 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.2% hydrogenated Triton X-100 and again batch loaded onto the 5E1 resin. The resin was collected in a column, washed with 3 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 1% octylglucoside (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and eluted with 25 mmNaH2PO4, pH 3.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% octylglucoside. The elution fractions were neutralized and analyzed as described above, pooled, filtered through a 0.2-micron filter, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. For metabolic labeling studies, High Five cells were seeded into T-75 flasks and infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding full-length Shh or with a control virus. 28 h post-infection the culture medium was replaced with 10 ml/flask of fresh medium supplemented with 250 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and the cells were further incubated for 12 h at 28 °C. The cells were removed from the flasks by scraping, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of 20 mmHEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors following the same protocol described above. Half of each lysate was treated for 1 h at 4 °C with 25 μl of 5E1-Sepharose and the other half with a control mAb-Sepharose of the same isotype. The resins were collected, washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and treated with electrophoresis sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% gradient gel, and visualized by fluorography (3-day exposure). Aliquots of Shh were subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a C4 column (Vydac, catalog number 214TP104, column dimensions 0.46-cm inner diameter by 25 cm) at ambient temperature. Bound components were eluted with a 30-min 0–70% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored at 280 nm and 0.5-min fractions were collected. 25-μl aliquots of fractions containing protein were dried in a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant), dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing hedgehog were pooled, concentrated 4-fold in a Speed Vac concentrator, and the protein content calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 26,030 liter mol−1 cm−1 that was calculated from the tyrosine and tryptophan content of Shh. Samples were subjected to ESI-MS on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with an electrospray ion source. A volume of 6 μl (1 pmol/μl) of HPLC-purified hedgehog was infused directly into the ion source at a rate of 10 μl/min using 50% water, 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid as the solvent in the syringe pump. Scans were acquired throughout the sample infusion. All electrospray mass spectral data were acquired and stored in profile mode and were processed using the Micromass MassLynx data system. Peptides from an endoproteinase Lys-C digest of pyridylethylated Shh were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on-line with a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The digest was separated on a Reliasil C18 column using a Michrom Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer system at a flow rate of 50 μl/min with a 25-min 5–85% acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Scans were acquired from m/z 400 to 2000 throughout the run and processed as described above. Sequencing of the tethered Shh was performed by post-source decay (PSD) measurement (22Spengler B. Hirsch D. Kaufmann R. Rapid. Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23Spengler B. Hirsch D. Kaufmann R. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 9678-9684Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) on a Voyager-DETM STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix (24Beavis R.C. Chaudhary T. Chait B.T. Org. Mass. Spectrom. 1992; 27: 156-158Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). 0.5 μl (1 pmol) of HPLC-purified endoproteinase Lys-C peptide was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile) on the target plate. To cover the entire spectrum of fragment ions, the mirror voltages were decreased from 20 to 1.2 kv in 11 steps. Soluble human Shh was labeled with [3H]palmitic acid in a cell-free system by using a modified version of a published procedure (25Caron J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A crude microsomal fraction from rat liver was prepared by subjecting a liver homogenate to sequential centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, 9,000 × g for 20 min, and 100,000 × gfor 30 min. The 100,000 × g pellet was suspended in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 10% sucrose and again pelleted at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The final pellet (derived from 10 g of liver) was suspended in 3 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.15% Triton X-100, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Reactions containing 3 μg of Shh, 1 μl of rat microsomes, 50 ng/ml coenzyme A (Sigma), 0.3 mm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were performed at room temperature for 1 h. Reactions were stopped with reducing electrophoresis sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% gradient gel, and visualized by fluorography. Shh was tested for function in a cell-based assay measuring alkaline phosphatase induction in C3H10T1/2 cells (26Kinto N. Iwamoto M. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Noji S. Ohnuchi H. Yoshioka H. KaKaoka H. Wado Y. Yuhao G. Takahashi H.E. Yoshiki S. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with a 5-day readout. The assay was performed in a 96-well format. Samples were run in duplicate. For tethered Shh (100 μg/ml), the samples were first diluted 200-fold with normal growth medium then subjected to serial 2-fold dilutions down the plates. Wells were normalized for potential effects of the added octylglucoside by including 0.005% octylglucoside in the culture medium. Blocking studies using the neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody 5E1 (27Ericson J. Morton S. Kawakami A. Roelink H. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) were performed by mixing Shh with serial dilutions of the antibody for 30 min at ambient temperature in culture medium prior to adding the test samples to the plates. When full-length human Shh was expressed in High Five insect cells, over 95% of the NH2-terminal fragment was in a cell-associated form. The Shh was purified from a detergent lysate of the cells by a combination of SP-Sepharose chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography on a 5E1-Sepharose column. By SDS-PAGE, the purified protein migrated as a single sharp band with apparent mass of 20 kDa (Fig. 1, lane c). The protein migrated faster by about 0.5 kDa than a soluble version of the protein that had been produced in E. coli (Fig. 1,lanes b-d), consistent with previously published data (19Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W-J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C-H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Similarly, as described (19Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W-J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C-H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), the soluble and membrane-bound Shh proteins were also readily distinguishable by reverse phase HPLC, where the tethered form eluted later in the acetonitrile gradient. The concentration of acetonitrile needed for elution of the membrane-bound form was 60 versus 45% for the soluble form, indicating a significant increase in the hydrophobicity of the protein. ESI-MS data for the soluble and membrane-bound forms of Shh showed primary species with masses of 19,560 and 20,167 Da, respectively (Fig.2). The measured mass of 19,560 Da matches the predicted mass for Shh starting with Cys-24 and terminating with Gly-197 (calculated mass of 19,560.02 Da). By contrast, the 20,167 Da mass did not match the predicted mass for residues 24–197 plus cholesterol (calculated mass of 19,928.64 Da), nor could the difference in the masses of the tethered and soluble forms, 607 Da, be accounted for by any known modification or by aberrant proteolytic processing. Since Porter et al. (18Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated thatDrosophila hedgehog contained a cholesterol moiety, it was possible that the mass difference in the human Shh was due, at least in part, to cholesterol (calculated average mass for esterified cholesterol is 368.65 Da). Indeed, the presence of a minor component in the mass spectrum of tethered Shh at 19,796 Da (371 Da smaller than the primary ion) supported this notion (Fig. 2 B). Further evidence for cholesterol modification was obtained by treating the tethered Shh with a mild alkali under conditions that can hydrolyze the cholesterol linkage without disrupting peptide bonds (18Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), and then reanalyzing the reaction products by MS. Base treatment caused a 387-Da shift in the observed mass of the tethered Shh, which is consistent with the loss of cholesterol plus water (see TableI), while the mass of soluble Shh was not affected by the treatment. Together, these observations suggested that the membrane-tethered human Shh contained two modifications with total mass of 607 Da, a cholesterol (368.65 Da), and a second moiety with mass of 238 Da. The similarity in mass between this value and the mass of a palmitoyl group (calculated mass of 238.47 Da) suggested that the protein might be palmitoylated, which was verified through more rigorous biochemical studies (see below). While the mass data clearly support the notion that Shh is cholesterol modified and have extended this observation to human Shh, the loss of water following base treatment is inconsistent with the proposed model in which the cholesterol is attached to the COOH-terminal carboxyl group through an ester linkage (18Porter J.A.

For samples subjected to LC-MS, the proteins were first treated with 4-vinyl pyridine. Calculated mass values were determined using average residue masses in part a, and protonated monoisotopic masses in part b. The distinctive chromatographic properties of the lipid-modified forms of Shh on reverse phase HPLC was used as an assay to quantify the extent of modification (see Fig.3 B). In this assay, the unmodified Shh elutes first (peak 1), followed by cholesterol-modified Shh (peak 2), and finally the Shh containing both the cholesterol and palmitic acid modifications (peak 3). Over 80% of the tethered Shh recovered from High Five cells contained both cholesterol and the palmitoyl moiety. The shoulder on peak 3 was caused by a modified form of the palmitoyl moiety, containing an unsaturated bond, that was identified through peptide mapping and sequence analysis by MALDI PSD measurement (data not shown). The mass of this variant was 2 Da smaller than that of the main peak. Direct evidence for palmitic acid modification was obtained using an in vitro modification reaction in which Shh was treated with [3H]palmitic acid under conditions that promote protein palmitoylation. As shown in Fig. 1 (lane e), Shh is readily labeled with the radioactive tracer. None of the approximately 100 other proteins in the reaction mixture were labeled (see the corresponding Coomassie Blue-stained gel profile inlane j), indicating a high degree of specificity of the palmitoylation reaction. As further evidence for the specificity of the palmitoylation reaction, we tested two Shh variants in which the site of palmitoylation (Cys-24, see below) had been elimin"

The device is more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous single-electron devices, with a constant gain from dc to greater than 100 megahertz. For a still-unoptimized device, a charge sensitivity of 1.2 x 10(-5) e/hertz was obtained at a frequency of 1.1 megahertz, which is about an order of magnitude better than a typical, 1/f-noise-limited SET, and corresponds to an energy sensitivity (in joules per hertz) of about 41 Planck's over 2pi."

Gβγ subunits can regulate a diverse array of effectors, including ion channels and enzymes. Gα subunits bound to guanine diphosphate (Gα-GDP) inhibit signal transduction through Gβγ subunits, suggesting a common interface on Gβγ subunits for Gα binding and effector interaction. The molecular basis for interaction of Gβγ with effectors was characterized by mutational analysis of Gβ residues that make contact with Gα-GDP. Analysis of the ability of these mutants to regulate the activity of calcium and potassium channels, adenylyl cyclase 2, phospholipase C-β2, and β-adrenergic receptor kinase revealed the Gβ residues required for activation of each effector and provides evidence for partially overlapping domains on Gβ for regulation of these effectors. This organization of interaction regions on Gβ for different effectors and Gα explains why subunit dissociation is crucial for signal transmission through Gβγ subunits."

In the present report, we investigated apoptosis induction by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in two human T cell lines, Jurkat and HuT-78.

It was further found that HuT-78 cells constitutively expressed the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB. TNF activated NF-κB in Jurkat cells but not in HuT-78 cells. HuT-78 cells were also resistant to NF-κB activation induced by phorbol ester, H2O2, ceramide, endotoxin, and interleukin-1.

Development of resistance to apoptosis induction by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents is one of the major problems in cancer therapy (1Baldini N. Nat.

Pathol. 1995; 175: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Besides these factors, an activated form of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB has recently been implicated in development of resistance to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (6Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar).Under normal conditions, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm in its inactive state as a heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and IκB-α (9Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). When activated IκB-α undergoes ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and degradation, and the p50-p65 complex is released to be translocated to the nucleus where it causes gene activation. The activation of NF-κB is initiated by a wide variety of stress stimuli, which themselves cause apoptosis. Among these are TNF, IL-1, x-rays, γ-radiation, phorbol ester, ceramide, endotoxin, calcium ionophores, and H2O2 (9Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

Several genes whose proteins are involved in tumor promotion and metastasis, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ELAM-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and matrix metalloprotease-9, are regulated by NF-κB (15Collins T.

How NF-κB is constitutively activated in some tumor cells and what role it plays in induction of resistance to apoptosis is not clear. In the present study, we show that in contrast to acute T cell leukemic Jurkat cells, cutaneous T cell lymphoma HuT-78 cells were resistant to the apoptotic effects of TNF and constitutively expressed high levels of activated form of NF-κB and of IκB-α simultaneously. The latter was resistant to TNF-induced IκB-α degradation and had a very long half-life. Neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies down-regulated the constitutive NF-κB activation and induced apoptosis in HuT-78 but not in Jurkat cells. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a quencher of reactive oxygen intermediates, also inhibited constitutively activated NF-κB and rendered HuT-78 cells susceptible to TNF-induced killing.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we investigated the mechanism by which tumor cells develop resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF. Two human T cell lines, Jurkat and HuT-78, were examined. While TNF inhibited the growth of Jurkat cells and activated caspase-3, it had no effect on HuT-78 cells; constitutive activation of NF-κB was demonstrated in HuT-78 cells and may account for this difference in growth and apoptosis induction. TNF and various other stimuli activated NF-κB in Jurkat cells but not in HuT-78 cells. Despite preactivated NF-κB, HuT-78 cells also expressed high levels of IκB-α, which unlike Jurkat cells, were resistant to TNF-induced degradation. The half-life of the IκB-α in HuT-78 cells is much longer than Jurkat cells. Antibodies against TNF down-regulated the constitutive activation of NF-κB and proliferation of HuT-78 cells, suggesting an autocrine role for TNF. The antioxidant PDTC also suppressed constitutive NF-κB activation and reversed sensitivity to TNF for cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that constitutive NF-κB activation causes resistance to apoptosis through generation of ROS and TNF.Our results show that HuT-78 cells express activated NF-κB and IκB-α simultaneously. This is not too surprising as the synthesis of IκB-α requires NF-κB activation (29Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), but why IκB-α fails to inhibit constitutively activated Nκ-kB, however, is not clear. Our results show that IκB-α in HuT-78 is degraded very slowly compared with Jurkat cells. In WEHI-3 cells, which were also shown to express constitutively activated NF-κB, the rate of degradation of IκB-α is faster than normal (30Miyamoto S. Chiao P.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3276-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that IκB-α phosphorylated at Tyr-42 is refractory to TNF-induced degradation (31Singh S. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that IκB-α from HuT-78 cells is phosphorylated at Tyr-42. Phosphotyrosine blots, however, did not reveal any tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). A lack of retarded mobility of IκB-α from HuT-78 cells on SDS-PAGE gels also indicated a lack of phosphorylation. It is possible that the p50-p65 heterocomplex is mutated so that it can no longer bind to endogenous IκB-α. However, it is unlikely because we found that the p50-p65 heterocomplex can bind both exogenously added IκB-α, can bind to the NF-κB binding site in the DNA, and is supershifted by the antibodies.NF-κB activation in HuT-78 cells was not only refractile to TNF, the constitutive DNA binding activity in these cells remained unchanged by a host of other NF-κB activators, including lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, ceramide, IL-1, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Western blot analysis indicated that besides a nuclear pool there is a cytoplasmic pool of p50-p65 in HuT-78 cells. Coprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis results indicated that the cytoplasmic pool of p50-p65 subunits in HuT-78 cells exists in complex with IκB-α. The absence of further activation by various stimuli suggest the lack of nuclear translocation of p50-p65 from the cytoplasm, perhaps because of decreased proteolytic activity of the enzyme required to degrade IκB-α, as noted earlier.Our results indicate that NF-κB activation and apoptosis are linked, but how constitutive activation of NF-κB prevents apoptosis of HuT-78 cells is not clear. Several genes that are known to down-regulate apoptosis are regulated by NF-κB activation, including the zinc finger protein A20 (32Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), manganese superoxide dismutase (33Perera C.S. St. Clair D.K. Mc Clain C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor for apoptosis) (34Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentery J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). It is possible that these genes are constitutively expressed in HuT-78 cells, thus leading to inhibition of apoptosis. Our results are consistent with reports that mice that lack the NF-κB p65 gene die early in embryonic development from massive cellular death of hepatic parenchyma (35Beg A. Sha W. Bronson R. Ghosh S. Nature. 1995; 37: 167-170Crossref Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic role of NF-κB was also demonstrated from the observation that embryonic fibroblast from IκB knockout mice are resistance to TNF (6Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). Similarly, transfection of a dominant negative form of IκB-α cDNA prevented the TNF-induced apoptosis of cells (7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 8Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar).Our results show that pretreatment of HuT-78 cells with PDTC inhibited constitutive NF-κB activation and sensitized the cells to TNF-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting a critical role of ROS. PDTC is a potent inhibitor of inducible NF-κB activation (28Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 36Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohardsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Baboir B.M. Cerutti P.A. Fridovich I. McCord J.M. Oxy-radicals in Molecular Biology and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 39-48Google Scholar). Generation of ROS has been proposed as an important mechanism to mediate the apoptotic and gene regulatory effects of TNF (39Schulze-Oshoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 40Goossens V. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 192-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results, however, indicate ROS is also involved in protection of cells from apoptosis by activating NF-κB.Besides PDTC, treatment of cells with anti-TNF antibodies also down-regulated NF-κB and inhibited cell growth. These results, which are consistent with previous report (41O'Connell A.M. Cleere R. Long A. O'Neill L.A.J. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggest an autocrine role for TNF in induction of resistance. In addition, studies employing a TNF expression vector and an antisense TNF mRNA expression vector transfected into TNF-sensitive and -insensitive cells clearly demonstrated that endogenously made TNF is protective against TNF-induced cytotoxicity (42Himeno T. Watanabe N. Yamauchi N. Maeda M. Tsuji Y. Okamoto T. Neda H. Niitsu Y. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4941-4945PubMed Google Scholar). These observations further confirm the inhibitory role of NF-κB in apoptosis. Additionally, our study demonstrates the autocrine growth-promoting role of TNF through the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. Inhibitors of both nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1 activation have been shown to block the neoplastic transformation response (43Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our study demonstrates the role of constitutively expressed NF-κB in the induction of resistance in HuT-78 cells through generation of TNF and ROS. Development of resistance to apoptosis induction by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents is one of the major problems in cancer therapy (1Baldini N. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Overcoming this resistance has been largely unsuccessful, because the mechanism of development of resistance is not understood.

Pathol. 1995; 175: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Besides these factors, an activated form of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB has recently been implicated in development of resistance to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (6Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Under normal conditions, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm in its inactive state as a heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and IκB-α (9Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). When activated IκB-α undergoes ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and degradation, and the p50-p65 complex is released to be translocated to the nucleus where it causes gene activation. The activation of NF-κB is initiated by a wide variety of stress stimuli, which themselves cause apoptosis. Among these are TNF, IL-1, x-rays, γ-radiation, phorbol ester, ceramide, endotoxin, calcium ionophores, and H2O2 (9Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar, 10Brach M.A. Gruss H.J. Kaisho T. Asano Y. Hirano T. Herrmann F. J. Biol.

(1997) J. Cell Sci.110 (pt 3),337–343Google Scholar) also cause NF-κB activation. Several genes whose proteins are involved in tumor promotion and metastasis, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ELAM-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and matrix metalloprotease-9, are regulated by NF-κB (15Collins T.

A progressive activation of constitutive NF-κB has recently been correlated with progression of breast cancer, melanoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (18Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P.

How NF-κB is constitutively activated in some tumor cells and what role it plays in induction of resistance to apoptosis is not clear. In the present study, we show that in contrast to acute T cell leukemic Jurkat cells, cutaneous T cell lymphoma HuT-78 cells were resistant to the apoptotic effects of TNF and constitutively expressed high levels of activated form of NF-κB and of IκB-α simultaneously. The latter was resistant to TNF-induced IκB-α degradation and had a very long half-life. Neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies down-regulated the constitutive NF-κB activation and induced apoptosis in HuT-78 but not in Jurkat cells. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a quencher of reactive oxygen intermediates, also inhibited constitutively activated NF-κB and rendered HuT-78 cells susceptible to TNF-induced killing. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we investigated the mechanism by which tumor cells develop resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF. Two human T cell lines, Jurkat and HuT-78, were examined. While TNF inhibited the growth of Jurkat cells and activated caspase-3, it had no effect on HuT-78 cells; constitutive activation of NF-κB was demonstrated in HuT-78 cells and may account for this difference in growth and apoptosis induction. TNF and various other stimuli activated NF-κB in Jurkat cells but not in HuT-78 cells. Despite preactivated NF-κB, HuT-78 cells also expressed high levels of IκB-α, which unlike Jurkat cells, were resistant to TNF-induced degradation. The half-life of the IκB-α in HuT-78 cells is much longer than Jurkat cells. Antibodies against TNF down-regulated the constitutive activation of NF-κB and proliferation of HuT-78 cells, suggesting an autocrine role for TNF. The antioxidant PDTC also suppressed constitutive NF-κB activation and reversed sensitivity to TNF for cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that constitutive NF-κB activation causes resistance to apoptosis through generation of ROS and TNF.Our results show that HuT-78 cells express activated NF-κB and IκB-α simultaneously. This is not too surprising as the synthesis of IκB-α requires NF-κB activation (29Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), but why IκB-α fails to inhibit constitutively activated Nκ-kB, however, is not clear. Our results show that IκB-α in HuT-78 is degraded very slowly compared with Jurkat cells. In WEHI-3 cells, which were also shown to express constitutively activated NF-κB, the rate of degradation of IκB-α is faster than normal (30Miyamoto S. Chiao P.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3276-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that IκB-α phosphorylated at Tyr-42 is refractory to TNF-induced degradation (31Singh S. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that IκB-α from HuT-78 cells is phosphorylated at Tyr-42. Phosphotyrosine blots, however, did not reveal any tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). A lack of retarded mobility of IκB-α from HuT-78 cells on SDS-PAGE gels also indicated a lack of phosphorylation. It is possible that the p50-p65 heterocomplex is mutated so that it can no longer bind to endogenous IκB-α. However, it is unlikely because we found that the p50-p65 heterocomplex can bind both exogenously added IκB-α, can bind to the NF-κB binding site in the DNA, and is supershifted by the antibodies.NF-κB activation in HuT-78 cells was not only refractile to TNF, the constitutive DNA binding activity in these cells remained unchanged by a host of other NF-κB activators, including lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, ceramide, IL-1, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Western blot analysis indicated that besides a nuclear pool there is a cytoplasmic pool of p50-p65 in HuT-78 cells. Coprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis results indicated that the cytoplasmic pool of p50-p65 subunits in HuT-78 cells exists in complex with IκB-α. The absence of further activation by various stimuli suggest the lack of nuclear translocation of p50-p65 from the cytoplasm, perhaps because of decreased proteolytic activity of the enzyme required to degrade IκB-α, as noted earlier.Our results indicate that NF-κB activation and apoptosis are linked, but how constitutive activation of NF-κB prevents apoptosis of HuT-78 cells is not clear. Several genes that are known to down-regulate apoptosis are regulated by NF-κB activation, including the zinc finger protein A20 (32Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), manganese superoxide dismutase (33Perera C.S. St. Clair D.K. Mc Clain C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor for apoptosis) (34Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentery J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). It is possible that these genes are constitutively expressed in HuT-78 cells, thus leading to inhibition of apoptosis. Our results are consistent with reports that mice that lack the NF-κB p65 gene die early in embryonic development from massive cellular death of hepatic parenchyma (35Beg A. Sha W. Bronson R. Ghosh S. Nature. 1995; 37: 167-170Crossref Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic role of NF-κB was also demonstrated from the observation that embryonic fibroblast from IκB knockout mice are resistance to TNF (6Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). Similarly, transfection of a dominant negative form of IκB-α cDNA prevented the TNF-induced apoptosis of cells (7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 8Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar).Our results show that pretreatment of HuT-78 cells with PDTC inhibited constitutive NF-κB activation and sensitized the cells to TNF-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting a critical role of ROS. PDTC is a potent inhibitor of inducible NF-κB activation (28Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 36Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohardsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Baboir B.M. Cerutti P.A. Fridovich I. McCord J.M. Oxy-radicals in Molecular Biology and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 39-48Google Scholar). Generation of ROS has been proposed as an important mechanism to mediate the apoptotic and gene regulatory effects of TNF (39Schulze-Oshoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 40Goossens V. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 192-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results, however, indicate ROS is also involved in protection of cells from apoptosis by activating NF-κB.Besides PDTC, treatment of cells with anti-TNF antibodies also down-regulated NF-κB and inhibited cell growth. These results, which are consistent with previous report (41O'Connell A.M. Cleere R. Long A. O'Neill L.A.J. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggest an autocrine role for TNF in induction of resistance. In addition, studies employing a TNF expression vector and an antisense TNF mRNA expression vector transfected into TNF-sensitive and -insensitive cells clearly demonstrated that endogenously made TNF is protective against TNF-induced cytotoxicity (42Himeno T. Watanabe N. Yamauchi N. Maeda M. Tsuji Y. Okamoto T. Neda H. Niitsu Y. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4941-4945PubMed Google Scholar). These observations further confirm the inhibitory role of NF-κB in apoptosis. Additionally, our study demonstrates the autocrine growth-promoting role of TNF through the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. Inhibitors of both nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1 activation have been shown to block the neoplastic transformation response (43Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar).

The cap is recognized by eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which consists of three polypeptides, including eIF4E, the cap-binding protein subunit. The interaction of the cap with eIF4E facilitates the binding of the ribosome to the mRNA. eIF4E activity is regulated in part by two translational repressors, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, which bind to it and prevent its assembly into eIF4F. We report here the isolation of 4E-BP3, a new member of the 4E-BP family. 4E-BP3 is homologous to 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, exhibiting 57 and 59% identity, respectively. The homology is most striking in the middle region of the protein, which contains the eIF4E binding motif and residues that are phosphorylated in 4E-BP1. 4E-BP3 is a heat stable protein that binds to eIF4E in vitro as well as in vivo. Further, 4E-BP3 overexpression specifically reduces eIF4E-dependent translation. The overlapping function and expression of the different 4E-BP family members imply that there is redundancy in this translational control mechanism, underscoring its importance.

The key role of eIF4E regulation in protein synthesis is underscored by the presence of two related eIF4E-binding proteins, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A.

Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) by competing with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E (11Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Consequently, 4E-BPs prevent eIF4E association with eIF4G to form the eIF4F complex, resulting in the subsequent inhibition of the 43 S preinitiation complex binding to the mRNA. The competition between 4E-BPs and eIF4G is explained by the presence of a common eIF4E binding site in 4E-BPs and eIF4G (12Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 to eIF4E is controlled by their phosphorylation state. The underphosphorylated forms of 4E-BPs interact with eIF4E, whereas the hyperphosphorylated forms do not (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N.

Upon cell stimulation with serum, growth factors, or hormones, 4E-BP1 becomes hyperphosphorylated and dissociates from eIF4E to relieve the translational inhibition (9Pause A. Belsham G.J.

The regulation of eIF4E activity by 4E-BPs is of particular significance considering the transforming potential of eIF4E (15Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Indeed, the overexpression of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 in cells transformed by eIF4E or v-src resulted in a significant reversion of the transformed phenotype (16Rousseau D. Gingras A.-C. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2415-2420PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present the molecular cloning and the characterization of 4E-BP3, a new member of the 4E-BP family of translational inhibitors. The cDNA clone no. 87895 (Human Genome Sciences Inc.) was obtained from a prostate carcinoma cell line (LNCaP) EST cDNA library as described previously (17Adams, M. D., Kerlavage, A. R., Fleischmann, R. D., Fuldner, R. A., Bult, C. J., Lee, N. H., Kirkness, E. F., Weinstock, K. G., Gocayne, J. D., White, O.,et al. (1995) Nature377, (suppl.) 3–174Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of 4E-BPs was performed using CLUSTAL W multiple sequence alignment program (version 1.7) (18Thompson J. Higgins D. Gibson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Human 4E-BP3 mRNA distribution was analyzed by Northern hybridization using commercial blots (multiple tissue Northern blot 1 and 2,CLONTECH), with nucleotides 1–597 of the cDNA clone used as a probe, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-4E-BP3 antibody no. 1791 was raised in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide (CVTTPPTAPLSKLEE) comprising amino acids 67–80 of 4E-BP3. The peptide (2 mg) was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using a commercial kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-4E-BP3 antibody no. 1862 was raised in a rabbit against a GST-4E-BP3 fusion. Anti-eIF4E antibody no. 5853 was described previously (19Frederickson R.M. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 900-2896Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-4E-BP3 was generated by cloning the coding sequence of 4E-BP3 into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using a polymerase chain reaction. Mutants of 4E-BP3 (Y40A or L45A) were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and subcloned into pcDNA3. For N-terminally HA-tagged constructs, the coding sequence of 4E-BP3, 4E-BP3-Y40A, or 4E-BP3-L45A was subcloned into pcDNA3-HA (20Imataka H. Olsen H.S. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-FLAG-eIF4E was constructed by cloning the entire coding sequence of mouse eIF4E into pcDNA3-FLAG using a polymerase chain reaction. The bicistronic reporter plasmid pcDNA3-RLUC-POLIRES-FLUC was generated by subcloning the coding sequence for firefly luciferase (FLUC) from pGEM-LUC (Promega Biotech Inc.), the coding sequence for Renilla reniformis luciferase (RLUC) from pRL-CMV (Promega) and the complete poliovirus type II Lansing 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (poliovirus internal ribosome entry site, POLIRES) (nucleotides 1–737) (21La Monica N. Meriam C. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 515-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pcDNA3. Polypeptides were resolved on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 16 h at 4 °C with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST). The membrane was incubated for 2 h with primary antibody 1862 (1:1000 in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin) or 1791 (1:750 in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin). Incubation with secondary antibody was performed with peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Corp.) (1:5000 in TBST). Detection was performed with ECL (Amersham Corp.). For adsorption experiments, antiserum (10 μl) was preincubated on ice for 20 min with GST-heart muscle kinase tag (20 μg) or GST-4E-BP3 (20 μg) for antiserum 1862 or with the cognate peptide (20 μg) for antiserum 1791. Capped RNA was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the cap analog m7GpppG (22Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Wheat germ extract (Promega) (25 μl) was programmed with mRNA in the presence of [35S]cysteine or methionine (25 μCi) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following translation, extracts programmed with FLAG-eIF4E or 4E-BP3 mRNA were mixed and incubated on ice for 1 h to allow for protein interaction. Protein complexes were recovered at 4 °C for 60 min with 20 μl of m7GDP-agarose resin (23Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 74: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) previously washed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, resuspended in Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) sample buffer, and boiled, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were processed for fluorography with En3Hance (DuPont). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were infected for 1 h in serum-free medium with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 (25Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 26Belsham G.J. Brangwyn J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then transiently transfected with pcDNA3-RLUC-POLIRES-FLUC (0.75 μg) and either pcDNA3, pcDNA3-4E-BP3, pcDNA3-4E-BP3-Y40A, or pcDNA3-4E-BP3-L45A (2 μg) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (3.5 μl) as described previously (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared in Passive lysis buffer (Promega) 17 h after infection and assayed for RLUC and FLUC activity in a luminometer (BIOORBIT) using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). HeLa cells (6-cm dish) were transiently transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-4E-BP3 (6 μg), or with pcDNA3-FLAG-eIF4E (3 μg) and pcDNA3-HA-La, pcDNA3-HA-4E-BP3, pcDNA3-HA-4E-BP3-Y40A, or pcDNA3-HA-4E-BP3-L45A (3 μg) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) (10 μl) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were prepared after 24 h by scraping cells in cold buffer A and subjecting the suspension to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bio-Rad assay. LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared in buffer A as described above. LNCaP cell extract (5 mg/ml) was boiled for 8 min and then incubated on ice for 10 min. The precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and Laemmli sample buffer was added to the supernatant before boiling for 5 min. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HeLa cells (6-cm dish) were lysed 24 h after transfection in 500 μl of cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and debris was spun down. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody HA.11 (BAbCO) (1.25 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (10 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer, immunoprecipitates were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For m7GDP-agarose precipitation, 1.5 mg of LNCaP cell extract, prepared in buffer A as described above, was incubated with 30 μl of m7GDP-agarose resin for 90 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. LNCaP cells or transfected (pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-4E-BP3) HeLa cells (10-cm dish) were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products; 3000 mCi/mmol). The medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 2 mm trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by scraping, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The extract was precleared at 4 °C for 1 h by incubation with preimmune serum (7 μl) bound to protein A beads (15 μl). The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube together with 1862 antiserum (10 μl) bound to protein A beads (25 μl). Incubation end-over-end was carried out for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were spun down and washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and three times with LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5)). Immunoprecipitated material was subjected to SDS-PAGE, 15% gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was dried and autoradiographed. A cDNA for 4E-BP3 (Fig.1 A) was isolated from a LNCaP cDNA library. The cDNA is 698 bp long and consists of a 5′-UTR of 72 bp, an open reading frame of 300 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 326 bp. We do not know if the 5′-UTR of the cDNA is full-length. It is most probably close to full-length, as the size of the mRNA observed in Fig. 3 (800 bp) is close to the size of the cDNA (698 bp), taking into consideration the presence of a poly(A) tail on the mRNA. The 3′-UTR of the cDNA contains a polyadenylation signal (AGUAAA,underlined in Fig. 1 A) located 9 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail. The sequence, although not identical to the consensus polyadenylation sequence (AAUAAA), has been demonstrated to function in some viral cDNAs (27Guntaka R.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 511-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has not been excluded as a putative polyadenylation signal in eukaryotic mRNAs (28Birnstiel M.L. Busslinger M. Strub K. Cell. 1985; 41: 349-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encodes a predicted 100-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 10,873. This putative polypeptide is highly homologous to the previously cloned 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 proteins, sharing 57 and 59% identity, respectively (Fig. 1 B) (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The homology between the 4E-BPs is highest in the middle portion, which contains the eIF4E binding region (12Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B, boxed residues). It is also of interest that all of the phosphorylation sites reported for rat 4E-BP1 (29Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) are conserved in 4E-BP2 and 4E-BP3 (Fig. 1 B, denoted by asterisks), with the exception of a conservative change, serine 83 (in 4E-BP1) to a threonine in 4E-BP3. All of the phosphorylation sites contain a (Ser/Thr)-Pro motif.Figure 3Identification of 4E-BP3 in cells. A, an extract (100 μg) from LNCaP cells was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with the following antisera: antiserum 1862 preadsorbed with GST-4E-BP3 (lane 1), antiserum 1862 preadsorbed with GST-HMK (lane 2), antiserum 1791 (lane 3), and antiserum 1791 preadsorbed with its cognate peptide (lane 4). B, an extract (20 μg) from HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3 (lane 1) or with pcDNA3-4E-BP3 (lane 2) and total (lane 3) or heat-treated (lane 4) extract (250 μg) from LNCaP cells was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with antiserum 1791 (1:750).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data base searches in GenBankTM identified several mouse ESTs that are predicted to encode for a protein highly homologous to the human 4E-BP3. The longest EST (GenBankTM accession no.W18851) is 623 bp long and could encode a protein of 101 amino acids with 86% identity to the human 4E-BP3 (Fig. 1 C). It is therefore most probably the mouse homolog of human 4E-BP3. The tissue distribution of 4E-BP3 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig.2). Two transcripts were detected, a major transcript of approximately 800 bp and a minor transcript of approximately 8.6 kilobase pairs. The smaller transcript most probably corresponds to the cDNA we have cloned here. Although 4E-BP3 RNA is expressed in almost every tissue, the levels of expression vary dramatically among tissues. 4E-BP3 expression is highest in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and pancreas, whereas there is very little expression in brain and thymus. The origin of the 8.6-kilobase pair transcript is not clear at present; it could represent a product of alternative splicing or a stable nuclear RNA containing intron sequences. A similar pattern of expression with two different transcripts was also observed for 4E-BP2 (30Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Vidal S.M. Gingras A.-C. Glover T.W. Hanash S.M. Heng H. Sonenberg N. Genomics. 1996; 38: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), possibly pointing to an alternative splicing pattern conserved in 4E-BP3. To determine whether 4E-BP3 protein is expressed in cells, we used two different antisera raised in rabbits. The first (no. 1862) was raised against a GST-4E-BP3 fusion. The second (no. 1791) was raised against a peptide sequence derived from amino acids 67–80 in the C-terminal half of 4E-BP3 (Fig.1 A, bold characters), which is not conserved in the other 4E-BPs (Fig. 1 B). Since 4E-BP3 cDNA was cloned from a cDNA library constructed from an LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cell line (31Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), an extract from this cell line was used to perform Western blotting. Each of the anti-4E-BP3 antisera detected a single polypeptide of 14.6 kDa (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and3). Moreover, the band corresponding to the 14.6-kDa polypeptide disappeared when the two antibodies were preincubated with their respective antigens (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and4). To further substantiate the authenticity of the 14.6-kDa polypeptide, we expressed 4E-BP3 cDNA in HeLa cells, which do not express 4E-BP3 at detectable levels (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). A polypeptide which co-migrates with 4E-BP3 from LNCaP cells was observed in cells transfected with pcDNA3-4E-BP3 (Fig.3 B, compare lane 2 to lane 3). Since 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 are heat stable proteins (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 10Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether 4E-BP3 is also heat stable. An LNCaP cell extract was boiled, the soluble fraction subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Probing with antisera 1791 demonstrated that 4E-BP3 is heat stable (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). Since the eIF4E binding region in 4E-BPs is highly conserved in 4E-BP3 (Fig. 1 B, boxed residues), it is most likely that 4E-BP3 would also interact with eIF4E. Mutants in the predicted eIF4E binding site were generated to further characterize this interaction. The design of the mutants was based on the results of Mader et al. (12Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from analysis of the conserved residues of the eIF4E binding motif found in all of the eIF4E-binding proteins reported so far (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 32Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the first construct, Tyr-40 of 4E-BP3 was mutated to an alanine. An identical mutation in the eIF4E binding motif of eIF4G abolished its binding to eIF4E (12Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second construct was a mutant in which Leu-45 was changed to an alanine. Such a mutation was not analyzed by Maderet al., in which only the two consecutive leucines of the motif were mutated to alanines, resulting in the loss of interaction with eIF4E (12Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate an interaction between eIF4E and 4E-BP3, the proteins were synthesized by in vitro translation and analyzed for complex formation. Presence of the in vitro translated proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography (Fig.4 A). Very little wild type 4E-BP3 bound to the resin (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). However, a significant amount of 4E-BP3 was retained on the resin in the presence of FLAG-eIF4E (4-fold increase as determined by PhosphorImager analysis, compare lane 2 to lane 1). This demonstrates that, as with 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), association of 4E-BP3 with eIF4E does not affect the binding of eIF4E to the cap structure. Analysis of the binding was also performed using 4E-BP3 containing mutations in the eIF4E binding region. The mutants showed no binding to FLAG-eIF4E (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3and 4). As expected, FLAG-eIF4E bound to the resin (Fig.4 B, lane 5). To confirm the interaction of 4E-BP3 and eIF4E in vivo, co-immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts from HeLa cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged 4E-BP3. The light chain of the anti-HA antibody co-migrates with the endogenous eIF4E on SDS-PAGE, rendering detection of co-immunoprecipitated endogenous eIF4E difficult. To circumvent this problem, FLAG-tagged eIF4E, which migrates more slowly than does endogenous eIF4E, was co-expressed with HA-tagged 4E-BP3, 4E-BP3-Y40A, 4E-BP3-L45A, or La, an unrelated RNA-binding protein (35Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with αHA and αeIF4E (Fig. 4 C). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed by Western blotting for the presence of eIF4E and HA-tagged protein. FLAG-eIF4E was not co-immunoprecipitated when cells were co-transfected with the pcDNA3-HA vector (Fig. 4 D, lane 1), nor in the presence of HA-La (Fig. 4 D, lane 2). However, FLAG-eIF4E was co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of HA-4E-BP3 (Fig.4 D, lane 3). 4E-BP3 mutants Y40A and L45A failed to co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-eIF4E (Fig. 4 D, lanes 4 and 5). The expression of the Y40A and L45A constructs was approximately 2–4-fold less efficient as compared with that of the wild type construct (Fig. 4 C, comparelanes 4 and 5 to lane 3), which is expected to affect the amount of FLAG-eIF4E brought down in the assay. However, this cannot explain the complete absence of FLAG-eIF4E. Association of endogenous eIF4E with 4E-BP3 was also examined in LNCaP cells. The presence of eIF4E and 4E-BP3 in LNCaP cell extract was demonstrated by Western blotting with αeIF4E and α4E-BP3 (Fig.4 E, lane 1). eIF4E was precipitated from the extract using m7GDP-agarose resin, and the presence of endogenous eIF4E and 4E-BP3 in the precipitate was observed by Western blotting (Fig. 4 E, lane 2). To determine whether 4E-BP3 inhibits cap-dependent translation, a transient expression assay was used in which HeLa cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 (25Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 26Belsham G.J. Brangwyn J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and co-transfected with 4E-BP3 wild type or mutant constructs and a reporter plasmid. The reporter construct consisted of two cistrons separated by the POLIRES (Fig.5 A). Translation of the RLUC cistron is cap-dependent, whereas that of the FLUC cistron is directed by the poliovirus IRES and is therefore cap-independent (36Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Expression of the 4E-BP3 proteins was assayed by Western blotting, and the results show a similar expression level for all the constructs (Fig. 5 B). The level of expression of RLUC and FLUC was set at 100% when the reporter plasmid was co-transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3) (Fig. 5, C and D,column 1). When co-transfected with a vector containing the coding sequence for 4E-BP3, the expression of RLUC was decreased by 72% (Fig. 5 C, column 2), whereas the expression of FLUC showed a 2-fold increase (Fig. 5 D, column 2). The Y40A mutant 4E-BP3 as well as the L45A mutant lost their capacity to inhibit cap-dependent translation (Fig.5 C, column 3, 110% of the control; column 4, 90% of the control, respectively). The two mutants did not affect cap-independent translation (Fig. 5 D, columns 3 and 4), in contrast to wild type 4E-BP3. To demonstrate that 4E-BP3 is a phosphoprotein, metabolic labeling of transfected HeLa cells or LNCaP cells was performed using [32P]orthophosphate. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated material shows that 4E-BP3 was labeled with32P in HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-4E-BP3 (Fig.6, lane 2), but not in HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3 (Fig. 6, lane 1). Moreover, the endogenous 4E-BP3 was also found to be labeled in LNCaP cells (Fig. 6, lane 3). Taken together the data indicate that, as with 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C.

Virology. 1997; 237: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), 4E-BP3 is also a phosphoprotein. We have isolated a new cDNA encoding for a protein that shares a high degree of identity with the translational inhibitors 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and was thus termed 4E-BP3. Data base searches (NCBI data base and Human Genome Sciences data base) have not revealed any homologies other than to 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and to ESTs encoding for the three 4E-BPs. 4E-BP3 was identified by Western blotting as a polypeptide having an apparent molecular mass of 14.6 kDa, which differs from the predicted molecular mass of 10.9 kDa. However, overexpression of 4E-BP3 in HeLa cells and in vitro translation of 4E-BP3 also yielded a polypeptide having an apparent molecular mass of 14.6 kDa, suggesting that the cDNA indeed encodes for a full-length protein. This type of aberrant migration is also observed for 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N.

Jakowski G. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 1-21Google Scholar). Since the 14.6-kDa polypeptide is recognized by two different antibodies and shares the characteristic heat stability of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to conclude that it is the third member of the 4E-BP family. Interaction of 4E-BP3 with eIF4E was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and by m7GDP-affinity chromatography, both in cell extracts and with in vitrotranslated proteins. The interaction was also analyzed by generating mutants in the eIF4E binding motif of 4E-BP3. The two mutants (Y40A and L45A) did not show any detectable interaction with eIF4E in the assays performed. This result was expected for the Y40A mutant, as it was previously shown that such a mutation in eIF4G abolishes binding to eIF4E (12Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inability to detect an interaction of the L45A mutant with eIF4E demonstrates that the first of the two consecutive leucine residues in the eIF4E binding motif, alone dramatically affects the interaction. This result is not surprising as the first leucine is absolutely conserved in all of the eIF4E-binding proteins from yeast to human (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A.

Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the Y40A and L45A mutants on translation was also assessed in a transient expression assay in which 4E-BP3 was shown to inhibit eIF4E-dependent translation by 72%. As expected from mutants with an impaired ability to bind to eIF4E, no effect was observed on eIF4E-dependent translation. The mutants also abolished the stimulation (2-fold) of IRES-mediated translation by 4E-BP3. Such a stimulation has not been observed in earlier reports with 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 41Ohlmann T. Rau M. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The stimulation is specific as the mutants that are defective in binding to eIF4E, although expressed at a level similar to that of wild type 4E-BP3 (Fig. 5 B, comparelanes 3 and 4 to lane 2), lost the ability to stimulate IRES-dependent translation. Since 4E-BPs and eIF4G compete for a limiting amount of eIF4E, it is possible that the high level of overexpression of 4E-BP3 in this system (Fig.5 B, lane 2) releases more of eIF4G that can participate in IRES-mediated translation and thus increase the expression of FLUC. 4E-BP3 mRNA tissue expression differs from that of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (30Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Vidal S.M. Gingras A.-C. Glover T.W. Hanash S.M. Heng H. Sonenberg N. Genomics. 1996; 38: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This may suggest that the regulation of eIF4E function by the 4E-BPs is modulated in a tissue-specific manner and is dependent upon the relative abundance of each 4E-BP. Since the 4E-BPs share biochemical and functional characteristics, it is likely that their relative activity in a given tissue or cell type is regulated post-translationally. It is well established that 4E-BP1 activity is regulated via phosphorylation (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 14Fleurent M. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Meloche S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Since 4E-BP3 is a phosphoprotein, it is highly likely that its activity is also regulated by its phosphorylation state. A differential regulation of the phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs could explain the redundancy of their function. However, recent reports show that 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 behave similarly in response to insulin and cAMP treatment (38Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or to adenovirus infection (13Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N.

Therefore, the overlapping expression of the 4E-BPs may also reflect a safeguard mechanism. In support of such a hypothesis, a mouse knock-out of 4E-BP1 failed to show any phenotype 2K. Tsukiyama-Kohara and N. Sonenberg, unpublished data. (45Blackshear P.J. Stumpo D.J. Carballo E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31510-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that the overlapping expression of other 4E-BPs may compensate for the disrupted 4E-BP1. This underscores the importance of 4E-BPs in regulating eIF4E-dependent translation initiation. In conclusion, the data presented show that 4E-BP3 shares biochemical and functional characteristics with 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. To examine whether the 4E-BPs are differentially regulated, it will be important to determine if 4E-BP3 behaves in a manner similar to 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 in response to extracellular stimuli. Specifically, analysis of the phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs under various conditions will be required to ascertain if differences among the 4E-BPs exist.

Relative to aspirin, APHS was 60 times as reactive against COX-2 and 100 times as selective for its inhibition; it also inhibited COX-2 in cultured macrophages and colon cancer cells and in the rat air pouch in vivo.

Neuronal exocytosis is strictly regulated by Ca2+ ions (1Katz B. The Release of Neurotransmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). Ca2+ triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane on the submillisecond time scale, indicating that a limited number of conformational changes couple Ca2+ to exocytotic membrane fusion (2Llinas R.

Thus, synaptotagmin is has been proposed to function as the major Ca2+ sensor of regulated exocytosis. Synaptotagmin is represented by a growing gene family, which currently contains 11 members (14Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

The members of this family span the vesicle membrane once and have a short carboxyl-terminal intravesicular domain and a large cytoplasmic region that contains two C2-domains, designated C2A and C2B. C2A is the membrane proximal domain and mediates the interaction of synaptotagmin with anionic phospholipids (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction has been proposed to contribute to the lipid rearrangements that underlie membrane fusion (13Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The membrane distal C2B-domain mediates Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of synaptotagmin, potentially clustering the release machinery into a collar or ring-like structure (19Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Damer C.K. Creutz C.E. J.

Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The synaptotagmin-syntaxin interaction is regulated by Ca2+concentrations similar to those required for neuronal exocytosis (22Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In addition, syntaxin is an essential component of the putative membrane fusion machinery (23Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 24So¨llner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

The C2-domains of synaptotagmin mediate a variety of Ca2+-dependent effector interactions. More generally, C2-domains are found in more than 50 distinct proteins, including lipid and serine/threonine kinases, phospholipases, GTPase-activating proteins, and a number of proteins involved in membrane traffic (26Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Despite the growing number of proteins that possess C2-domains, relatively little is known concerning the structural elements that mediate C2-domain-effector interactions.

Because the interaction of the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin with membranes is likely to serve as an important step in excitation-secretion coupling, we have probed for conformational changes in synaptotagmin, induced by Ca2+ and lipids, and have sought the region of C2A that engages lipid bilayers. To address these issues we employed fluorescence spectroscopy to probe the environment of tryptophan (Trp) “sensors” placed in different locations within C2A. The sensitivity of indole side chain fluorescence to local environment was exploited to monitor local conformational changes as a consequence of binding Ca2+ and lipids. Using membrane-imbedded nitroxide quenchers, we provide direct evidence for the partial insertion of a Ca2+-binding “jaw” of C2A into the lipid bilayer. These findings are discussed in the context of the mechanism of regulated membrane fusion. cDNA encoding rat synaptotagmin 1 was kindly provided by T. C. Südhof (Dallas, TX) (12Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). C2A-W259 encodes residues 96–265 and contains a single naturally occurring Trp residue at position 259. All other constructs encode residues 96–258 and therefore lack native Trp residues. Phe-234, Phe-231, Phe-193, and Phe-153 were individually changed to Trp residues using site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (18Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All C2A-domains were subcloned into pGEX-2T and expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; C2A, first C2-domain of synaptotagmin; C2B, second C2-domain of synaptotagmin; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PL, phospholipids. proteins using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (35Chapman E.R.

Soluble domains, for fluorescence studies, were generated by thrombin cleavage of fusion protein coated beads (19Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Brain-derived phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and synthetic 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl (n-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (doxyl-PC), with the spin labels at the 5-, 7-, or 12-position of thesn-2 acyl chain, were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids.l-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl- 3H]choline-1,2-dipalmitoyl ([3H]PC) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]Phospholipid binding assays were carried out as described (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chapman E.R.

For fluorescence studies, large (~100 nm) unilamellar liposomes (37MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) were prepared using an Avanti Polar Lipids extruder according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all experiments, the actual lipid concentration was determined by measuring total phosphate as described (38Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made at 24 °C using a PTI QM-1 fluorometer and Felix software. Protein samples were adjusted to 5 μm in Tris-saline (TS; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and excited at 288 nm with 2-nm resolution. Emission spectra were collected from 300 to 450 nm and were corrected for blank and dilution due to the addition of EGTA, Ca2+, or liposomes. Tryptophan fluorescence is strongly influenced by the environment of the indole side chain and has thus proved to be a useful tool to study conformational changes in proteins, protein-protein interactions, and protein-membrane interactions. For example, in hydrophobic environments, Trp fluorescence generally shifts to shorter wavelengths and often exhibits increases in intensity. The goal of the present study was to place Trp reporters at different surfaces of C2A to assay for local Ca2+- and lipid-induced conformational changes and to delineate the C2A-lipid binding interface. We relied on the crystal structure of C2A reported by Sutton et al. (39Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) to place Trp reporters in distinct regions of C2A (Figs. 2 and 3). Phe to Trp substitution mutations, as opposed to labeling engineered cysteine residues with exogenous fluorescent tags, was carried out in order to minimize the effects of the reporter group on the structure of C2A. This approach was facilitated by the paucity of Trp residues in C2A; the only naturally occurring Trp residue is at position 259. The fluorescence of this residue is included in the analysis described below. In addition, a series of recombinant C2A-domains were prepared that lacked residue 259 and contained either no Trp residues or single Phe to Trp substitution mutations at position 234, 231, 193, or 153. It should be noted that the C2-domain of protein kinase C-β, which exhibits Ca2+-dependent lipid binding properties identical to C2A (31Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), has a Trp residue in a position analogous to residue 231 in C2A (26Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can expect that this mutation will be tolerated.Figure 3Trp residues within a Ca2+-binding jaw of C2A insert into the lipid bilayer in the presence of Ca2+. Liposomes composed of 50% PS, 50% PC or 50% PS, 40% PC, 10% doxyl-PC labeled at either the 5-, 7-, or 12-position of the sn-2 acyl chain were prepared and mixed with wild type and mutant C2A-domains (5 μm) in Tris-saline in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. Spectra were obtained as described in Fig. 2. Note: doxyl-labeled liposomes had no effect on the Trp fluorescence of any of the reporters in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Right panel, the structure of C2A was rendered as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the Phe to Trp mutations affected Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity, wild type and mutant recombinant C2A-domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins and immobilized using glutathione-Sepharose. The ability of immobilized C2A-domains to bind radiolabeled liposomes was analyzed as described (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, Ca2+ promoted the binding of similar levels of radiolabeled liposomes to each of the immobilized GST-C2A fusion proteins, confirming that the activity of the Trp substitution mutants remained intact. For fluorescence studies, the C2A-domains were cleaved from GST using thrombin. Soluble C2A-domains were adjusted to 5 μm, and the Trp residues were excited at 288 nm. Emission spectra were monitored from 300 to 450 nm in the presence of 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm free Ca2+, or 1 mm free Ca2+ plus liposomes composed of PS/PC. As shown in Fig.2, a C2A-domain without a Trp residue exhibited low levels of short wavelength residual fluorescence resulting from the emission of Tyr and Phe side chains. Greater than 90% of the fluorescence of each Trp-containing C2A-domain was due to the emission of the indicated Trp residue. In EGTA, the emission intensity of Trp residues in different positions of C2A varied by more than a factor of three, while the emission maximum of each Trp was essentially the same (339–340 nm). Addition of Ca2+affected the emission intensity of each Trp reporter with the exception of Trp-259. Trp residues 234, 231, and 153 exhibited slight quenching, while the emission of Trp-193 was increased by Ca2+. In addition, Ca2+ induced slight changes in the emission maximum of each of the Trp reporter groups (TableI). It is notable that Trp-153 lies at the opposite end of C2A relative to the Ca2+-binding jaws (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that Ca2+ induces conformational changes that are transmitted throughout the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin. It cannot be ruled out, however, that the effect of Ca2+ on the fluorescence of Trp-153 may be influenced by additional low affinity Ca2+-binding sites within C2A.Table IEffects of Ca2+ and liposomes on the tryptophanyl emission spectra of C2A-Trp substitution mutantsC2A-constructEmission λmaxF/F (EGTA)EGTACa2+Ca2+ + PLCa2+Ca2+ + PLTrp2593403393390.980.98F234W3403423320.941.2F231W3403373360.901.0F193W3393373381.21.4F153W3393373390.930.91The emission maximum of each of the spectra shown in Fig. 2 are listed in the left panels of the table.

The relative changes in fluorescence intensity from the integrated spectra are listed in the right panels of the table. These values are normalized to the integral of the spectra obtained in EGTA. PL, liposomes composed of 50% PS/50% PC. Interestingly, in the presence of Ca2+, liposomes had significant effects on the emission spectra of Trp-193, Trp-231, and Trp-234 (Fig. 2). Liposomes did not affect the fluorescence of Trp-259 or Trp-153 (Fig. 2). Most notably, residues 234 and 231 exhibited increases in fluorescence intensity and also exhibited blue-shifted emission maxima. The Ca2+-induced increase in the emission of Trp-193 was also enhanced by artificial membranes. However, no shift in the emission maximum of Trp-193 was observed. These findings indicate that the region surrounding Trp-193 undergoes a considerable conformational change due to the binding of Ca2+. This finding, coupled to the lower affinity of synaptotagmin for Ca2+ in the absence of lipids (13Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), suggests that the lipid effects may be due to an enhancement of Ca2+ binding to F193W. The effects of Ca2+ and liposomes on the emission maximum and fluorescence intensity of each Trp reporter are tabulated in Table I. The liposome-induced blue shifts and increases in fluorescence intensity of Trp-234 and Trp-231 suggest that upon formation of the C2A-Ca2+-lipid complex, these residues shifted to a more hydrophobic environment. This relatively hydrophobic environment could lie either within the protein or within the lipid bilayer. To discriminate between these possibilities, we examined the ability of lipid embedded nitroxide spin labels to quench the fluorescence of each of the Trp reporter groups. Only Trp residues that can interact directly with the lipid bilayer will make contact with the nitroxide spin groups and become quenched. For these experiments, liposomes were prepared that contained doxyl-PC labeled at either the 5-, 7-, or 12-positions of the sn-2 acyl chain. These lipid-embedded quenchers, and their distances from the center of the lipid bilayer, are illustrated in Fig. 4. Recombinant C2A-domains were mixed with constant amounts of either control liposomes or liposomes containing 10% doxyl-PC, in the presence of Ca2+. The spectra from these experiments are shown in Fig. 3, and the degree of quenching by the nitroxide groups are tabulated in Table II. From these spectra, it is apparent that the doxyl spin labels efficiently quenched Trp residues placed in positions 231 and 234 and failed to quench Trp-153 or Trp-259. In addition, the fluorescence of Trp-193, which was enhanced by liposomes in the presence of Ca2+, was not quenched. We conclude that the changes in the local environment of Trp-193 are associated with interactions within the protein structure of C2A and not with the lipid bilayer. This finding supports the interpretation that the increase in fluorescence induced by liposomes is due to increased binding of Ca2+ to the F193W-C2A-domain.Table IIQuenching of tryptophanyl fluorescence of C2A-Trp substitution mutants by membrane-imbedded doxyl spin labelsC2A-construct12-Doxyl7-Doxyl5-DoxylTrp2593.22.53.5F234W354037F231W122222F193W5.25.15.7F153W3.24.33.5All spectra from Fig. 3 were integrated and normalized relative to the fluorescence obtained using liposomes lacking the doxyl spin label. The percent quenching, relative to the total integrated fluorescence in the absence of the nitroxide spin labels, is listed. Open table in a new tab All spectra from Fig. 3 were integrated and normalized relative to the fluorescence obtained using liposomes lacking the doxyl spin label. The percent quenching, relative to the total integrated fluorescence in the absence of the nitroxide spin labels, is listed. The most striking finding was the efficient nitroxide quenching of both Trp reporters, Trp-234 and Trp-231, that are localized to Ca2+-binding loop 3 (31Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) of C2A (Fig. 3). These findings clearly establish a direct association with, and partial penetration into, lipid bilayers by this region of C2A. These data are summarized in the model shown in Fig. 4. Trp-234 penetrates more deeply into membranes, reaching doxyl groups that lie only 0.6 nm from the center of the bilayer. By contrast, Trp-231 is more readily quenched by doxyl labels that lie 1–1.2 nm from the bilayer center (Fig. 4). It should be noted that these are qualitative penetration measurements, with a high degree of uncertainty regarding the precise depth of penetration of loop 3 into membranes. However, these findings are consistent with the location of these residues; Trp-234 lies at the outermost edge of the Ca2+-binding loop, while Trp-231 lies at the base of the loop, close to the body of the C2A-domain. In contrast to our data, lipid-embedded bromine quenchers failed to quench the Trp fluorescence of intact protein kinase C-βII (40Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because protein kinase C-βII contains nine Trp residues, quenching of a small number of indole side chains may be difficult to detect. This problem was circumvented by the single Trp substitution mutants prepared and analyzed in the present study. Future studies on isolated C2-domains, derived from different parent proteins, will reveal whether these motifs interact with membranes in a manner consistent with their conserved primary sequence. Crystallography studies indicate that portions of the C2 jaws of synaptotagmin and phospholipase C are highly mobile in both the free and Ca2+-bound states (39Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 41Grobler J.A. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This mobility may account for the similar degrees of fluorescence quenching of Trp-234 by doxyl labels bound at different depths of the lipid bilayer. In addition, the steady state measurements shown in Fig. 3 are likely to reflect populations of C2A that penetrate the bilayer to varying extents. In any case, it is striking that of the five Trp substitution mutants characterized in the present study, only the Trp residues that lie within a Ca2+-binding loop of C2A exhibited liposome-induced blue shifts in their emission spectra and were quenched by membrane-imbedded nitroxide groups. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that this loop directly interacts with, and becomes partially inserted into, the lipid bilayer. The insertion of Trp-234, and presumably the native Phe-234, into membranes suggested that C2A-membrane interactions may be mediated by hydrophobic forces. However, loop 3 contains numerous polar and charged side chains. In addition, structural studies prompted the proposal that the Ca2+-dependent interaction of C2-domains with effectors may be primarily mediated by electrostatic interactions (31Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 41Grobler J.A. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 42Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction of synaptotagmin with membranes, we analyzed the sensitivity of Ca2+-dependent synaptotagmin-lipid binding to ionic strength. For these studies we examined the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of native synaptotagmin with synaptic vesicle membranes, as well as the interaction of C2A-F193W with artificial membranes, as a function of increasing [NaCl]. As shown in Fig.5, the interaction of both native synaptotagmin and recombinant C2A with native and artificial membranes, respectively, was highly sensitive to ionic strength. Three-hundred mm NaCl was sufficient to inhibit greater than 75% of the binding. These data indicate that synaptotagmin-membrane interactions possess a high degree of ionic character. The molecular basis for these findings are discussed in greater detail below. Genetic studies have provided compelling evidence that synaptotagmin 1 functions as the major Ca2+ sensor in neuronal exocytosis (7Nonet M.L. Grundahl K. Meyer B.J. Rand J.B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1291-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 8Littleton J.T. Stern M. Perin M. Bellen H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10888-10892Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9DiAntonio A. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 1994; 12: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The ability of the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin to bind Ca2+ ions and thus trigger exocytosis is strongly potentiated by anionic phospholipids (13Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The interaction of C2A with membranes may directly participate in the Ca2+-triggered lipid rearrangements that result in membrane fusion. However, this role would also involve interactions with components of the exocytotic fusion complex (discussed in detail below), because synaptotagmin itself does not function as a fusogen (13Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), and spontaneous membrane fusion events do not require synaptotagmin (8Littleton J.T.

Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). While little is known concerning the structure of C2-domain-Ca2+-effector complexes, the crystal structures of two C2-domain-Ca2+ complexes, the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin (39Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and the C2-domain of phospholipase C-δ1 (43Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), have been determined. These domains formed β-sandwich structures with three loops that protrude from one end of the domain (indicated byarrows in Figs. 2 and 3). Initially, only a single Ca2+-binding site was identified in the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin (39Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). This site is formed by Ca2+ ligands that lie within loops 1 (Asp-172 and Asp-178) and 3 (Asp-230, Asp-232, and Asp-238). However, C2A crystals were destroyed by soaking in Ca2+ > 0.1 mm, presumably due to significant conformational changes, induced by the binding of additional Ca2+ ions, which disrupt the lattice. A more recent NMR study indicated that at least one additional Ca2+-binding site lies within C2A (31Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to examine Ca2+- and membrane-induced conformational changes in C2A and to determine which regions of C2A make direct contacts with membranes. The size of the C2A-Ca2+-liposome complex precludes NMR studies to solve its solution structure, and co-crystallization of proteins with membranes has proven difficult. Therefore, we probed the structure of the C2A-Ca2+-lipid complex using fluorescence spectroscopy. Trp reporters were placed throughout C2A, and the sensitivity of indole side chain fluorescence to environment was exploited to monitor local conformational changes and to delineate the lipid binding interface of this domain. Of the five Trp substitution mutants characterized, only the Trp residues that were placed within Ca2+-binding loop 3 of C2A (in positions 231 and 234) exhibited liposome-induced blue shifts in their emission spectra. Membrane-imbedded quenchers provided direct evidence that this loop significantly penetrated into the lipid bilayer. These findings demonstrate that the Ca2+- and lipid-binding sites overlap within C2A and support a Ca2+-bridge model for the assembly of the C2A-Ca2+-membrane complex (44Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 29: 7624-7630Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this model, Ca2+ makes direct contacts with both anionic headgroups and with C2A. This model accounts for the lower affinity of specific C2-domains for Ca2+ in the absence of lipids (13Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 31Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 29: 7624-7630Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), since the Ca2+-binding site may not be completely formed. This model is also consistent with molecular modeling studies of membrane-bound phospholipase C-δ1 (43Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 45Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and with kinetic studies of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (34Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12028Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Structural studies of phospholipase C-δ1 also indicate that the binding of metal ions results in the extrusion of positively charged side chains. This conformational change results in the widening of the gap between the metal binding jaws such that it becomes large enough to accommodate a phospholipid head group (41Grobler J.A. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar movement of positively charged residues in the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin may also occur (46Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The extruded positively charged residues may mediate interactions with nearby anionic lipid head groups. This hypothesis is further supported by the high sensitivity of the C2A-domain-membrane interaction to increasing ionic strength (Fig. 5) and the presence of conserved basic residues in C2-domains that bind phosphatidylserine (42Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, an NMR study of C2A demonstrated that Arg-233 and Lys-236 in loop 3, along with Arg-199 in loop 2, made contacts with a recombinant fragment of syntaxin 1A corresponding to residues 1–177 (46Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Arg-233 and Lys-236 flank the Trp residue (234) that we have established inserts into membranes. These findings raise the question of whether C2A can bind to syntaxin and to membranes simultaneously. However, issues regarding the interaction between C2A and 1–177 of syntaxin remain to be clarified since domain mapping studies, using GST-syntaxin fusion proteins, demonstrated that residues 194–288 of syntaxin, but not residues 1–193, mediated interactions with synaptotagmin (36Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 47Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both C2-domains of synaptotagmin are required to form high affinity stable complexes with syntaxin at low micromolar concentrations (19Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

How might the Ca2+-driven insertion of a Ca2+-binding loop of C2A, into membranes, participate in excitation-secretion coupling? Synaptotagmin is associated with an assembly composed of syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin that is thought to serve as the “core complex” of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery (24So¨llner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Association of synaptotagmin with the core complex is potentially mediated via its high affinity Ca2+-independent interaction with SNAP-25 (48Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. So¨llner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The SNAP-25-synaptobrevin-syntaxin complex appears to zipper together into parallel (49Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) coiled coils (35Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N.J. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), resulting in the very close apposition of the vesicle and target membranes. It is tempting to speculate that the Ca2+-triggered oligomerization of synaptotagmin could result in the clustering of the core complex, thereby forming a collar or spiral-like structure at the vesicle-plasma membrane interface. The Ca2+-triggered penetration of C2A-loop 3 into membranes may function to destabilize the lipid bilayer by inducing lateral phase separations that facilitate bilayer fusion (51Leckband D.E. Helm C.A. Israelachvili J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1127-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the lipid binding properties of C2A may serve to bring the cytoplasmic domain of the core complex into direct contact with the lipid bilayer. As Ca2+ levels rise, the conformational changes associated with the Ca2+-dependent synaptotagmin-syntaxin interaction may generate the final force or movement that results in bilayer fusion. Interestingly, perforin, a protein secreted from activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, is able to bind to membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner via its C2-domain. Once bound, perforin inserts into membranes where it polymerizes to form large pores. Future studies will determine whether synaptotagmin and the core complex operate by a similar mechanism. While such models are highly speculative, future studies on the conformational changes in the core complex, induced by binding Ca2+-synaptotagmin, coupled to kinetic studies of Ca2+-synaptotagmin-effector interactions, will help to refine models for the late Ca2+-triggered steps in exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2094900302,"Stimulation of T lymphocytes results in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) that parallels the activation of Ca 2+ -calmodulin–dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), a nuclear enzyme that can phosphorylate and activate the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB). However, inactivation of CaMKIV occurs despite the sustained increase in [Ca 2+ ] i that is required for T cell activation. A stable and stoichiometric complex of CaMKIV with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was identified in which PP2A dephosphorylates CaMKIV and functions as a negative regulator of CaMKIV signaling. In Jurkat T cells, inhibition of PP2A activity by small t antigen enhanced activation of CREB-mediated transcription by CaMKIV. These findings reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism whereby a protein serine-threonine kinase (CaMKIV) is regulated by a tightly associated protein serine-threonine phosphatase (PP2A)."

Impedance measurements obtained on Mg 1.8 Fe 0.2 SiO 4 olivine, wadsleyite, and ringwoodite at up to 20 gigapascals and 1400°C show that the electrical conductivities of wadsleyite and ringwoodite are similar and are almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of olivine. A conductivity-depth profile to 660 kilometers, based on these laboratory data, shows a conductivity increase of almost two orders of magnitude across the 410-kilometer discontinuity; such a profile favors a two-layer model for the upper mantle. Activation enthalpies of 1.2 to 1.7 electron volts permit appreciable lateral variations of conductivity with lateral temperature variations."
https://openalex.org/W1986777748,"The phase velocities of Rayleigh waves increase more rapidly with distance from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis than is predicted by models of conductive cooling of the lithosphere. Low velocities near the axis are probably caused by partial melt at depths of 20 to 70 kilometers in a zone several hundred kilometers wide. The lowest velocities are offset to the west of the EPR. Wave propagation is anisotropic; the fast direction is approximately perpendicular to the ridge, parallel to the spreading direction. Anisotropy increases from a minimum near the axis to 3 percent or more on the flanks."

Additionally, the antigen-bound C3d fragment interacts with complement receptor 2 (CR2; also known as CD21) on B cells and thereby contributes to the initiation of an acquired humoral response. The x-ray crystal structure of human C3d solved at 2.0 angstroms resolution reveals an α-α barrel with the residues responsible for thioester formation and covalent attachment at one end and an acidic pocket at the other. The structure supports a model whereby the transition of native C3 to its functionally active state involves the disruption of a complementary domain interface and provides insight into the basis for the interaction between C3d and CR2."

The ETS transcription factor PU.1, which is expressed exclusively in myeloid and B-cells, regulates the expression of a number of genes common to both of these lineages, including the genes encoding CD18 (2Rosmarin A.G.

Also, PU.1 has been implicated in transcription of the B-cell-specific genes encoding the immunoglobulin κ light chain (8Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchinson M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), J chain (9Shin M.K. Kosland M.E.

Therefore, myeloid versusB-cell-specific regulation of genes by PU.1 must involve additional mechanisms such as lineage-specific partners and/or lineage-specific protein modification. The IRF proteins have been postulated to be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the immune response. Post-translational modification and partnering have been postulated as mechanisms involved in regulation by IRF proteins (12Sharf R. Azriel A. Lejbkowicz F. Winograd S.S. Ehrlich R. Levi B.-Z. J.

However, the significance of this interaction in lineage-specific gene expression is hypothetical, since no target genes have been described. In these investigations, we explored the involvement of ETS and IRF proteins in transcription of the myeloid-specific CYBB gene, which encodes gp91phox, the heavy chain of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase (14Segal A.W.

Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5215-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CYBBtranscription is therefore both lineage- and differentiation state-specific. In mature phagocytes, the expression of gp91phox is further augmented by the inflammatory mediators, including interferon gamma (IFNγ) (17Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Whitney C. Wright J.

Investigation of two kindreds with CGD revealed a cis element in the proximal CYBB promoter that was necessary for lineage-specific, IFNγ-induced gp91phox expression (20Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J.

By EMSA, either of these mutations disrupted binding of a specific protein complex to the CYBB 5′-flank (20Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

Linked CYBB promoter-reporter constructs containing the proximal 450 bp of the CYBB 5′-flank were transfected into myeloid cell lines, and the transfectants were differentiated with IFNγ. Wild type promoter constructs, but not CGD mutant promoter constructs, had IFNγ-inducible reporter gene expression (20Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

The κE3′ is a positive cis element that binds PU.1 as a heterodimer with a lymphoid-specific, IRF protein referred to as PU.1-interacting protein (PIP) (8Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J.

The cells were harvested and resuspended in HN buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF) and sonicated on ice. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysate was incubated 30 min at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed extensively with HN buffer. The beads were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 5 μl of control rabbit reticulocyte lysate and then for 1 h with 20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeledin vitro translated protein and washed extensively in HN buffer.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed by the extraction method using [3H]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (38Seed B. Sheen J.-Y.

In vitro translated PU.1 generated a complex not found with control lysate (Fig.1). Binding of this complex was competed for by unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide and oligonucleotides containing the PU.1 binding sites from two other genes (8Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S.

The complex generated by in vitrotranslated PU.1 was recognized by PU.1 antiserum but not by rabbit preimmune serum or antiserum to the ETS protein FLI-1 (Fig.1 B). EMSA with in vitro translated FLI-1 and the −32 to −69 bp CYBB promoter sequence probe demonstrated no binding, although in vitro translated FLI-1 bound a high affinity FLI-1 binding site (E74; Ref. 22Zhang L. Lemarchandel V. Romeo D.-H. Ben-David Y. Greer P. Bernstein A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of PU.1 in nuclear proteins of myeloid cells to bind to the −32 to −69 bp CYBB promoter sequence was investigated. In previously published experiments (20Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synthetic oligonucleotide probes containing the −32 to −69 bp sequence of the CYBBpromoter were generated by labeling annealed, single-stranded oligonucleotides. EMSA with those probes had significant nonspecific binding of high mobility protein complexes, perhaps due to protein binding to single-stranded oligonucleotides in the probe. In these experiments, double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were subcloned into a plasmid vector, and probes were generated by liberating theCYBB sequence from the vector and labeling the restriction product. EMSA performed with these probes had fewer nonspecific bands in comparison with previous experiments (20Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

It has been hypothesized that CFTR exhibits an ATP release function that controls the airway surface ATP concentrations.

Thus, ATP may function as an autocrine signaling factor promoting Cl− secretion in normal but not CF epithelia if ATP release is defective. We have tested for CFTR-dependent ATP release using four independent detection systems. First, a luciferase assay detected no differences in ATP concentrations in the medium from control versus cyclic AMP-stimulated primary normal human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells. A marked accumulation of extracellular ATP resulted from mechanical stimulation effected by a medium displacement. Second, high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of3H-labeled species released from [3H]adenine-loaded HNE cells revealed no differences between basal and cyclic AMP-stimulated cells. Mechanical stimulation of HNE cells again resulted in enhanced accumulation of extracellular [3H]ATP and [3H]ADP. Third, when measuring ATP concentrations via nucleoside diphosphokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of [α-33P]dADP, equivalent formation of [33P]dATP was observed in the media of control and cyclic AMP-stimulated HNE cells and nasal epithelial cells from wild-type and CF mice. Mechanically stimulated [33P]dATP formation was similar in both cell types. Fourth, 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor were used as a reporter system for detection of ATP via P2Y2 receptor-promoted formation of [3H]inositol phosphates. Basal [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was of the same magnitude in control and CFTR-transduced cells, and no change was observed following addition of forskolin and isoproterenol. In both cell types, mechanical stimulation resulted in hexokinase-attenuable [3H]inositol phosphate formation.

However, in most tissues where significant ATP concentrations in the extracellular space have been detected, the mechanism(s) of ATP release have not been identified. In the airways, the volume and composition of the liquid secretions may be regulated by extracellular nucleotides (11Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J.

In cystic fibrosis (CF) 1The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator; Cla, alternative chloride channel; HNE, human nasal epithelial; DMEM-H, Dulbecco's modified high glucose Eagle's medium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphokinase. airway epithelia, the P2Y2 receptor is linked to a Ca2+-dependent chloride channel that provides an alternative Cl− secretory pathway to the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel (11Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This alternative chloride channel (Cla) has been identified as a potential target for therapy of CF lung disease. The localization of P2Y2 receptors on the apical surface of airway epithelia suggests the possibility that these receptors are regulated endogenously by the release of ATP onto the lumen. It has been recently proposed that CFTR itself modulates the composition of airway surface liquids by acting as a channel for ATP, regulating Cla pathways via activation of P2Y2receptors (15Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In CF with defective CFTR, an implication of this hypothesis is that resting levels of ATP would be reduced, resulting in reduced Cla as well as CFTR activation. The notion that CFTR mediates the release of ATP evolved from studies showing that protein kinase A stimulated a single channel (CFTR) current in CFTR-expressing cells when 100 mm ATP was present in the intracellular compartment (15Schwiebert E.M.

In addition, CFTR was shown to regulate the activity of a second chloride channel in excised patches, an activity thought to reflect ATP release and activation of outwardly rectifying Cl− channels by P2Y2 receptors (15Schwiebert E.M.

HP2U-1321N1 cells, a clonal cell line derived from human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor (32Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C.

HNE cells were preincubated for 1 h in a Krebs-Ringer solution (2.4 mmK2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 115 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaH2CO3, and 5 mmglucose) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were exposed for the indicated times to the designated drug. The mucosal medium (0.3 ml) was collected, centrifuged to remove potentially detached cells, and boiled for 1 min. A 100-μl sample aliquot was diluted with 200 μl of H2O prior to measurements. The luciferin/luciferase mixture (300 μm luciferin, 5 μg/ml luciferase, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.63 mm EDTA, 75 μm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to samples via an LB953 AutoLumat luminometer (Berthold GmbH, Wildbad, Germany), and the sample luminescence was compared with an ATP standard curve performed for each individual experiment. To assess intracellular ATP content, cells were lysed with 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by ethyl ether extraction and neutralization. The cells were labeled for 3 h with 10 μCi/ml [3H]adenine as described previously (33Grubb B. Lazarowski E. Knowles M. Boucher R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were exposed to the indicated drug without washing away the label to avoid unnecessary agitation of the cells. The mucosal medium was collected, and 3H-labeled species were resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). NDPK catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates utilizing ATP as the γ-phosphate donor molecule (34Ratliff R.L. Weaver R.H. Lardy H.A. Kuby S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used [α-33P]dADP, obtained as described previously (29Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HNE cells and nasal epithelial cells from either wild-type or CF mice were preincubated for 1 h in 0.3 ml of (mucosal) HEPES (pH 7.4)-buffered DMEM-H (HEPES/DMEM). Incubations were in the presence of 0.5 units/ml NDPK and 10 nm[α-33P]dADP (0.2 μCi) added to the mucosal bath.33P-Labeled species were resolved by HPLC. Nucleotides were separated by HPLC (Shimadzu) via a strong anion-exchange column (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc.) with a mobile phase developed from 0.45m NH4COOH (pH 4.8) to 0.5 mNa2H2PO4 (pH 2.7) over a 30-min period (9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured on line with a Radiomatic 500TR analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). Species were identified and quantified as described previously (9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Confluent polarized HNE cells were incubated for 3 h in HEPES/DMEM containing 10 μCi of [51Cr]Na2CrO3 added to the mucosal bath. The cells were washed (four times) and preincubated for 1 h in HEPES/DMEM. The mucosal solution (0.5 ml) was removed at the times indicated, and the radioactivity was quantified with a Cobra Autogamma counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Subconfluent HP2U-1321N1 cells grown on 12-well plastic plates were infected with adenoviral vector (5 × 109particles/well) containing DNA encoding either the CFTR gene (AdCFTR) or LacZ gene (AdLacZ) as described (31Stutts M.J.

Cells were assayed for CFTR expression 48 h after infection. For Western blot analysis, CFTR was localized with an antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of CFTR (35Sarkadi B. Bauzon D.

[36Cl]Chloride efflux was quantified as described previously (31Stutts M.J. Gabriel S.E. Olsen J.C. Gatzy J.T. O'Connell T.L. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20653-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HP2U-1321N1 cells were labeled overnight in 0.5 ml of inositol-free DMEM-H containing 4 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol. At the time of assay, 10 mm LiCl was added to the cells for 15 min, followed by a further 15-min incubation in the presence of the indicated drugs. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the resulting [3H]inositol phosphates were separated and quantified by chromatography on Dowex columns as described previously (9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ATP and dATP were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Hexokinase, NDPK, forskolin, and dADP were from Boehringer Mannheim. Luciferin, luciferase, and isoproterenol were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Adenine (17 Ci/mmol) andmyo-[3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). [α-33P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [51Cr]Na2CrO3 (300–500 mCi/mg cromium), and [36Cl]NaCl (3 mCi/g chloride) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Except where stated otherwise, pooled data are expressed as means ± S.E. and are representative of at least three independent experiments performed with duplicate or triplicate samples. For statistical comparisons, unpaired ttest was used, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. ATP was quantified in the mucosal medium bathing HNE cells utilizing the luciferin/luciferase method. Under resting conditions, i.e. the cells were kept undisturbed for 1 h prior to the assay, accumulation of ATP was 18.5 ± 3.4 pmol/106 cells (3.3 ± 0.6 nm in 0.3 ml of medium; n = 9). Cell monolayers incubated with forskolin and isoproterenol (20 μm each, 10 min), a drug combination that is maximally effective in initiating cyclic AMP-dependent Cl− secretion via CFTR (33Grubb B. Lazarowski E. Knowles M. Boucher R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), exhibited a concentration of (mucosal) ATP of 4.2 ± 0.7 nm (25.1 ± 4.1 pmol/106 cells; n = 9), a value not significantly different from control incubations. In contrast, perturbing the cell surface by a medium change (data not shown) or by gently pipetting the mucosal medium up and down twice resulted in a marked accumulation of mucosal ATP (49.5 ± 8 nm, 297 ± 61 pmol/106 cells). Mechanically released ATP by a medium displacement represented 0.9–1.6% of the cellular ATP content, and it was unaffected by exposing the cells to the cyclic AMP mixture (51 ± 12 nm, 306 ± 79 pmol/106 cells). The possibility that cell lysis occurred during mechanical stimulation was investigated with51Cr-loaded HNE cells. No changes in 51Cr base-line levels were observed during a 10-min period following a medium displacement (Table I). Moreover, base-line radioactivity remained unchanged after five repetitive medium displacements (data not shown). Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of damaged cells contributed to51Cr base-line levels, our results suggest that ATP was released from intact (not damaged) cells. Consistent with this, we have recently shown that no cell lysis occurred during mechanically promoted ATP release from 1321N1 cells (36Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).Table IRelease of 51Cr from HNE cellsControlMechanical stimulationcpmcpm0 min775 ± 52752 ± 301 min806 ± 124850 ± 1725 min772 ± 209730 ± 18210 min780 ± 234722 ± 75SDS17,043 ± 399519,117 ± 2556Mechanical stimulation was applied to [51Cr]Na2CrO3-labeled HNE cells by gently pipetting up and down 0.25 ml of the mucosal medium twice.

The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from triplicate samples, and they are representative of two independent experiments performed under similar conditions. Open table in a new tab Mechanical stimulation was applied to [51Cr]Na2CrO3-labeled HNE cells by gently pipetting up and down 0.25 ml of the mucosal medium twice. Undisturbed and stimulated cells were incubated for the times indicated, and the radioactivity released into the mucosal medium was quantified. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from triplicate samples, and they are representative of two independent experiments performed under similar conditions. We loaded the intracellular pool of ATP with [3H]adenine, and the release of 3H-labeled species was quantified by HPLC. Because the relatively large release of [3H]ATP during medium changes (data not shown and Ref. 9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) could mask a potential contribution by CFTR, a protocol was utilized that avoided cell washes. HPLC analysis of (mucosal) medium bathing resting [3H]adenine-labeled HNE cells demonstrated a small peak of [3H]ADP, barely distinguishable from background levels (Fig. 1 A) (non-incorporated [3H]adenine eluted at 5–8 min). No increase in [3H]ATP or [3H]ADP accumulation was observed in forskolin/isoproterenol-stimulated HNE cells (Fig.1 B). Incubation of cells with ionomycin to induce elevation of intracellular Ca2+ resulted in a small accumulation of extracellular [3H]ATP and greater accumulation of [3H]ADP (Fig. 1 C). A marked accumulation of [3H]ATP and [3H]ADP was observed after a medium displacement (Fig. 1 D). This protocol was repeated with T84 cells and with NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing either normal CFTR or the α-subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor as a control (31Stutts M.J. Gabriel S.E. Olsen J.C. Gatzy J.T. O'Connell T.L. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20653-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, addition of forskolin/isoproterenol (2–10 min) promoted no release of [3H]adenine-labeled species, but a large accumulation of 3H-labeled nucleotides was observed after a medium displacement irrespective of the presence of CFTR (data not shown). The possibility that CFTR mediates the release of ATP from a nucleotide pool not accessed by [3H]adenine (37de Korte D. Gouwerok C.W. Fijnheer R. Pietersz R.N. Roos D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 63: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was investigated by trapping released ATP with NDPK and [α-33P]dADP. The NDPK-catalyzed conversion of [α-33P]dADP to [α-33P]dATP was measured by HPLC as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 2). Moreover, since exogenous NDPK activity greatly exceeds endogenous ecto-ATPase activity, the assay resulted in a system that effectively locks the γ-phosphate of ATP onto the [α-33P]dADP molecule upon release. Fig. 3 illustrates the conversion of [α-33P]dADP to [α-33P]dATP in the mucosal HNE cell baths under various conditions. A basal conversion (16 ± 3%) of [α-33P]dADP to [α-33P]dATP was observed with cells that had not been treated with agonists (Fig.2 A). Addition of forskolin and isoproterenol (20 μm each) did not result in increased conversion (14 ± 4%) of [α-33P]dADP to [α-33P]dATP, indicating that elevation of cellular cyclic AMP did not promote the release of ATP (Fig. 2 B). However, an ~2-fold greater conversion (26 ± 3%) of [α-33P]dADP to [α-33P]dATP was observed following addition of 1 μm ionomycin, consistent with a Ca2+-promoted ATP release (Fig. 2 C). A 4-fold increased formation (71 ± 6%) of [α-33P]dATP occurred following mechanical stimulation of the cells (Fig. 2 D). The calculated ATP concentrations were 6 ± 1, 5 ± 1, 17 ± 3, and 97 ± 11 nm for control cells, cAMP-stimulated cells, ionomycin-treated cells, and mechanically stimulated cells, respectively.Figure 3Conversion of [α-33P]dADP to [α-33P]dATP in the medium bathing HNE cells. The cells were incubated with vehicle (A), forskolin and isoproterenol (B), or ionomycin (C), or they were subjected to a medium displacement (D) as detailed in the legend of Fig. 1. Incubations were for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 units/ml NDPK and 10 nm [α-33P]dADP, and the resulting α-33P-labeled species were quantified by HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” All additions were to the mucosal medium. The results are representative of three experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This protocol was repeated with immortalized nasal epithelial cells derived from either normal or CF mice. The results, summarized in Fig.4, showed no differences between normal and CF cells under basal or forskolin/isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. The increased [33P]dATP formation observed after mechanical stimulation was also similar in control and CF mouse cells. The muscarinic-cholinergic agonist carbachol promoted a small increase in [33P]dATP formation, although this was not statistically significant. Finally, in an attempt to assay for CFTR-dependent ATP release in the relevant physiological environment, i.e. the liquid layer associated with the cell surface, we used the P2Y2receptor as a biosensor for ATP to investigate the role of CFTR in the activation of P2Y2 receptors in intact cells. As such, we took advantage of a cell line (1321N1 human astrocytoma cells) that is null for expression of P2 receptors (32Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). First, we achieved a high expression level of P2Y2 receptors by retroviral infection of 1321N1 cells with the cDNA encoding the human P2Y2receptor (32Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor (HP2U-1321N1 cells) exhibit a marked ATP-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates, whereas control cells are unresponsive (9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the P2Y2 receptor in 1321N1 cells resulted in large receptor reserve, and consequently, ATP potency in HP2U-1321N1 cells (EC50 = 180 nm(9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)) is increased 30-fold relative to ATP potency observed with the P2Y2 receptor natively expressed in airway epithelial cells (38Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). More important, significant accumulation of inositol phosphates in HP2U-1321N1 cells was detectable at concentrations of ATP as low as 10 nm (see Fig. 6 and Ref. 9Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Second, we infected the HP2U-1321N1 cells with an adenoviral vector containing the CFTR cDNA (AdCFTR) or with adenoviral vectors encoding theLacZ gene (AdLacZ) as a control and assayed for the effect of CFTR expression"
https://openalex.org/W2089453598,"We have previously described an inverse relationship between Cdx1 and Cdx2 mRNA levels and the extent of dysplasia and severity of clinical outcome in colorectal carcinoma, suggesting that altered expression of these genes was associated with colorectal carcinogenesis or tumor progression. To investigate further their involvement in the physiopathology of colorectal cancer, HT29 colon carcinoma cells that show very lowCdx expression were transfected with Cdx1and/or Cdx2 cDNA to elicit their overexpression. Growth rate, tumorigenicity, resistance to apoptosis, and migration potential of the corresponding cells were analyzed. Growth rate of cells overexpressing Cdx2 decreased by half, whereas overexpression of Cdx1 had no effect. However, cells overexpressing both Cdxs had a growth rate reduced to 20% of control. In cells overexpressing Cdx1 orCdx2, tumorigenicity and resistance to apoptosis induced by serum starvation, ceramide, or staurosporine were not changed compared with control cells; yet phorbol ester-stimulated cell migration was decreased by 50%. In cells overexpressing both Cdx1 andCdx2, tumorigenicity was decreased by 50%, resistance to apoptosis was significantly lowered, and stimulated cell migration was further decreased to 15% of control compared with cells expressingCdx1 or Cdx2. Finally, cells overexpressing both Cdxs showed strongly decreased Bcl-2 expression, which could account for their increased sensitivity to apoptosis. These findings show that, in HT29 cells, both Cdx1 andCdx2 genes must be expressed to reduce tumorigenic potential, to increase sensitivity to apoptosis, and to reduce cell migration, suggesting that the two genes control the normal phenotype by independent pathways. This may explain why loss of Cdx1or Cdx2 expression is associated with tumor development and invasiveness in colorectal tumors.

This may explain why loss of Cdx1or Cdx2 expression is associated with tumor development and invasiveness in colorectal tumors. In an effort to characterize the mechanisms involved in colorectal cancer initiation and progression, we have developed a strategy based on the constitution of a large repertoire of transcripts from a colorectal tumor, all characterized by partial sequencing (1Frigerio J.M. Berthezene P. Garrido P. Ortiz E. Barthellemy S. Vasseur S. Sastre B. Seleznieff I. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of these expressed sequence tags in normal and cancerous colon was compared, and those most differentially expressed were selected. Genes detected by these means may be causative or instrumental in tumor induction or/and progression. Looking for such genes, we found that the Cdx1 and Cdx2 homeotic genes were concomitantly down-regulated in about 85% of colorectal cancers (2Mallo G.V. Rechreche H. Frigerio J.M. Rocha D. Zweibaum A. Lacasa M. Jordan B. Dusetti N. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Such low expression of Cdx1 or Cdx2in colon carcinoma was verified by immunohistochemistry (3Ee H.C. Erler T. Bhathal P.S. Young G.P. James R.J. Am. J.

(6Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Ko¨ntgen F. Beck F. Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) recently reported the occurrence of multiple intestinal adenomatous polyps in the proximal colon ofCdx2 +/− mice, suggesting that loweringCdx2 levels in intestinal cells would suffice to induce intestinal tumors. Also, Suh and Traber showed that expression of theCdx2 in an intestinal cell line could stimulate cell differentiation and growth arrest (7Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A corrolary of these findings might be that the down-regulation of Cdx2 would account for the loss of differentiation and exaggerated cellular growth observed in intestinal tumors. In the present paper we have used HT29, a cell line derived from a colon tumor that shows very low Cdx1 and Cdx2expression, to investigate the role of these homeotic genes in the physiopathology of colorectal cancer. To this end, HT29 cells were transfected with Cdx1 and Cdx2 expression plasmids, alone or in combination. The impact of Cdxoverexpression on important events involved in tumor progression and invasion such as tumorigenicity, resistance to apoptosis, and cell migration was analyzed. It was found that Cdx1 andCdx2 cooperate to reduce the malignancy of HT29 cells. The human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 was obtained from Dr. A. Zweibaum (INSERM U.178). Cells were routinely cultivated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Upon reaching 80–90% confluency, cells were dissociated with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Puck's saline A and replated into 100-mm Petri dishes. All cDNA inserts were generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using RNA from human small intestine as template, and primers were selected from the cDNA sequence of Cdx1 and Cdx2 (2Mallo G.V. Rechreche H. Frigerio J.M. Rocha D. Zweibaum A. Lacasa M. Jordan B. Dusetti N. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To synthesize the Cdx1 cDNA insert, the forward primer was 5′-GGGAATTCAGGTGAGCAGTCGCTGGTCGTC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GGGAATTCACAGGAGCCACACTCCCAGCACC-3′, which yielded a 942-base pair product (nucleotides 1–942 of humanCdx1). To synthesize the Cdx2 cDNA insert, the forward primer was 5′-GGGAATTCAGGCAGCATGGTGAGGTCTG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GGGAATTCCTGAGGAGTCTAGCAGAGTCC-3′, which yielded a 1048-base pair product (nucleotides 32–1080 of human Cdx2). The coding sequences of Cdx1 and Cdx2 were amplified with oligonucleotides that incorporated EcoRI restriction sites (underlined). The Cdx1 and Cdx2polymerase chain reaction products were EcoRI-digested and subcloned into the EcoRI restriction site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter. That plasmid also contained the aminoglucoside phosphotransferase 3′ gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic geneticin (G418 sulfate). Using this approach we obtained expression vectors for Cdx1 (pcDNA3Cdx1S) andCdx2 (pcDNA3Cdx2S). Sequences were verified by the chain termination method using the T7 Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As control, we have used the pcDNA3CAT plasmid in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was also under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. We also constructed the pCEP4Cdx2S vector. The Cdx2 DNA insert was recovered from the pcDNA3Cdx2S plasmid by endonuclease restriction and directionally subcloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen), in whichCdx2 expression is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter but confers resistance to hygromycin. This construction was checked by restriction pattern. Plasmid DNA was purified with the Qiagen plasmid kit (Diagen, Hilden, Germany), and DNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometry. The pcDNA3Cdx1S, pcDNA3Cdx2S, and pcDNA3CAT plasmids were stably transfected into HT29 cells using the Lipofectin reagent (8Felgner P.L. Gadet T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P.

To select for stable transfectants, the cells were cultivated over 3–4 weeks in media containing G418 (600 μg/ml) starting 48 h after transfection. Surviving colonies were pooled and maintained in standard culture medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml). To obtain cells expressing both Cdx1 and Cdx2, the HT29 pcDNA3Cdx1S-transfected cells were transfected with the pCEP4Cdx2S plasmid and selected with G418 (400 μg/ml) and hygromycin (300 μg/ml) concomitantly. Surviving clones were pooled and maintained in standard culture medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml) and hygromycin (300 μg/ml). To avoid clonal variations, after transfection and selection with antibiotics, more than 100 independent colonies of each transfection were pooled, replated, grown to confluence, dissociated, aliquoted, and stored at −140 °C. After replating, cells were used for less than six passages. Transfected cells were grown with appropriate selection antibiotic, except during experiments. We used Northern blot assay to test whether HT29 cells expressed the transfected genes. RNA was purified from HT29-transfected cells, and 20 μg of each RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose containing 2.2m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran Plus) as described (9Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For RNA probes, the membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 4 h in 5× SSC, 50 mmHepes (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt, 2 mm EDTA, 50% formamide, and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (200 μg/ml). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C during 16–20 h in the above solution containing [32P]UTP cRNA probe (1 × 106cpm/ml). The Cdx1 and Cdx2 cRNA probes were respectively transcribed from the linearized 6G2 and 32D6 plasmids (2Mallo G.V. Rechreche H. Frigerio J.M. Rocha D. Zweibaum A. Lacasa M. Jordan B. Dusetti N. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using Promega Transcription Riboprobe System (Promega). After hybridization, filters were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS twice, 30 min at 75 °C. A 28 S ribosomal [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe was used as a control to evaluate RNA loading and transfer. Specific hybridization of probes was analyzed by exposure to a Kodak X-Omat AR film. Expression ofCdx1 was estimated by monitoring the activity of theCdx1-inducible Hoxa-7 promoter in HT/Cdx1S and HT/Cdx1S2S cells. These cells express Cdx1 (see above). The Hoxa-7 LacZ (AX470 construct) and TK LacZ (control) plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. P. Gruss, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Go¨ttingen) have been previously described (10Knittel T. Kessel M. Kim M.H. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 1077-1088PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transfected using the Lipofectin reagent as described above. At 48 h post-transfection cell extracts were prepared, and β-galactosidase assay was performed essentially as described previously (9Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Expression of Cdx2 was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in HT/Cdx2S and HT/Cdx1S2S cells. Nuclear extracts from HT/CAT, HT/Cdx2S, and HT/Cdx1S2S cells were prepared essentially as described by Dignam et al. (11Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) except that the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of 1 mm protease inhibitors (aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin, all from Boehringer Mannheim). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). The extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used for the gel shift assays: 5′-GTGCAATAAAACTTTATGAGTA-3′ and 5′-TACTCATAAAGTTTTATTGCAC-3′ (13Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). 10 pmol of 5′ ends were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase using the Ready-to-Go kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with [γ-32P]ATP before annealing. The annealing was performed as follows: 10 μg of each strand was mixed in a 50-μl solution containing 10 mmTris (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm KCl. The mixture was boiled for 5 min and then incubated at 65 °C for 1 h. The water bath was turned off, and the hybridization mixture was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The binding reactions were performed in a mixture of 25 μl containing 6 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μl of MgCl2 (100 mm), 4 μl of glycerol (50%), 1 μl of Nonidet P-40 (1%), 1.5 μg of sonicated calf thymus DNA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 ng of single-stranded DNA. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, 250 pg of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (about 100 cps) was added before a final 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Samples were loaded on a prerun nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE, 5% glycerol gel and run at 10 V/cm for 3 h at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed (overnight at −80 °C). HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx2S, HT/Cdx1S2S, and HT/CAT cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates at 5 × 103 cells/well. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days, cell number was estimated by MTT 1The abbreviations used are: MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.assay (Sigma) and/or counted on a hemacytometer. Two sets of experiments were done, each one in triplicate. Tumorigenicity was assayed by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx2S, HT/Cdx1S2S, HT/CAT, or HT29 parental cells resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline into the flanks of 4-week-old nude mice. They were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and fed with sterile commercial chow (U.A.R., Villemoisson-Sur-Orge, France) and water ad libitum. Tumors were measured in two dimensions with linear calipers at the indicated days. To assess differences in resistance to apoptosis, the HT29-transfected cells were submitted to three apoptotic stimuli,i.e. serum starvation, ceramide, and staurosporine. For serum starvation-induced apoptosis, 5 × 105 cells were plated on 50-mm Petri dishes, and after 48 h, the cells were serum starved for 4 days. Surviving cells were quantified by MTT following the instructions of the supplier (Sigma), and DNA fragmentation was measured by gel electrophoresis and by flow cytometry. Gel electrophoresis was performed using standard protocols (9Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and flow cytometry as follows. Cells were harvested from culture and permeabilized in 500 μl of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 4000 units/ml RNase in phosphate-buffered saline. Reagents were obtained as a kit from Coultronics France (Margency, France) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After vortexing, samples were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature in the dark for at least 1 h before analysis. Propidium iodide fluorescence analysis was performed in a flow cytometer (EPICS, Coulter Corporation). Drug-induced apoptosis was elicited by treating cells with 20 μm ceramide (Euromedex) or 100 nmstaurosporine (Sigma) for the indicated times. In preliminary studies, apoptosis induced by ceramide and staurosporine was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation on gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. The number of surviving cells was estimated by MTT assay. Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate, and the percentage of surviving cells was defined as the number of ceramide- or staurosporine-treated cells relative to untreated cells. Expression of Bcl-2 was analyzed by Western blotting. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar), and 100-μg samples were mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer. Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and incubated with the primary antibody diluted 1:2500 in NaCl/Pi (pH 7.4) containing 3% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. The primary anti-human Bcl-2 antibody was a monoclonal antibody purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France; reference number 1 624 989). After incubation, the filters were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab)2fragment anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:4000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were washed again and developed using enhanced chemiluminiscence imaging system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Migration of HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx2S, HT/Cdx1S2S, HT/CAT, or HT29 parental cells was studied by a modification of the wound closure assay described by Bürk (14Bürk R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 35-mm culture wells and grown to 95% confluence. Then the monolayer was denuded of cells using a sterile razor blade to make a wound showing a sharp boundary. The cells were then washed with serum-free medium and returned to the incubator in serum-free medium containing 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma). In order to distinguish between the contributions of migration and proliferation to the wound closure process, migration assays were also carried out in the presence of mitomycin C (5 μg/ml). After wounding, cells were incubated for 24 h. After fixation with 2.5% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, the number of cells having crossed the wound margin was counted in eight different areas chosen randomly. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Data presented under results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of two independent sets of experiments. The transfection efficiency was evaluated by measuring chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cell extracts for cells transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (data not shown) andCdx mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis for cells transfected with the Cdx1 and Cdx2 expression plasmids. Results shown in Fig. 1indicate that Cdx1 and Cdx2 genes were expressed at very low levels in HT29 parental and HT/CAT-transfected cells because the corresponding signals were barely detectable after a 10 days exposure of the blots. By contrast, the transfected cell line expressed high levels of the corresponding transcript or of both transcripts in the case of Cdx1 and Cdx2 double transfectants. To demonstrate that Cdx1 was functional in HT29Cdx1-transfected cells, we performed transactivation experiments with constructs involving the Hoxa-7 promoter in HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx1S2S, and HT/CAT control cells. The Hoxa-7 promoter is regulated by Cdx1 (15Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Cell. 1995; 83: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Compared with HT/CAT, transfection of the Hoxa-7 LacZ (AX470) construct led to an average induction of Lac Z expression reaching 5-fold in HT/Cdx1S and 7-fold in HT/Cdx1S2S, (Fig.1), strongly suggesting that Cdx1 is indeed expressed in these cells. The control construct carrying the TK promoter instead of Hoxa-7 did not show induction. The presence of Cdx2 was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the Cdx2-responsive element of the sucrase isomaltase gene (13Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the DNA-protein complexes could form with nuclear extracts from HT/Cdx2S and HT/Cdx1S2S but not from HT/CAT control cells. In each case, competition with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled specific oligonucleotide abolished the formation of the shifted complexes, whereas competition with 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled nonspecific oligonucleotide failed to compete with the formation of the retarded band (data not shown). The rate of growth of each transfected cell line is shown on Fig. 2. Direct counting of the cells and indirect estimation of cell number by MTT assay led to similar results. Growth of HT/CAT cells was taken as reference because these cells have been transfected and selected under the same conditions as the Cdxs-transfected cells while expressing a nonrelevant protein. In fact, HT/CAT cells and the parental HT29 cells grew very similarly, suggesting little influence of transfection and selection, if any, on cell proliferation (data not shown). The doubling time of HT29 cells was about 24 h under our experimental conditions (Fig.2). Growth of HT/Cdx1S cells, which overexpress Cdx1, was similar to that of control cells. By contrast, growth of HT/Cdx2S cells, which overexpress Cdx2, was slower. Surprisingly, HT/Cdx1S2S cells, which overexpress concomitantly Cdx1 andCdx2, grew significantly slower than cells overexpressingCdx2 alone (Fig. 2). These results confirmed a previous report (7Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) that Cdx2 expression inhibited the growth of intestine-derived cells. In addition, they demonstrated thatCdx1, although not a growth inhibitor by itself, could enhance the inhibitory activity of Cdx2. The tumorigenic potential was assessed by measuring the size of the tumors that develop after subcutaneous injection of a same number of the transfected cells into athymic nude (nu/nu) mice. Tumor formation occurred with all cell lines. The growth of the tumors obtained after grafting with HT29 parental, HT/CAT control cells, and Cdx1or Cdx2 transfected cells was not significantly different. By contrast, a 50% reduction in tumor growth rate was observed when HT29 cells expressed concomitantly the Cdx1 andCdx2 homeotic genes (Fig.3). Because tumor growth and progression could be associated with a resistance to apoptosis of the transformed cells, we looked into whether overexpression of Cdx1 or/and Cdx2 would change the sensitivity of HT29 cells to apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantified by measuring DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry and gel or by evaluating cell survival by MTT assay. When HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx2S, HT/Cdx1S2S, HT/CAT control, or HT29 parental cells were grown in the presence of serum, subdiploidy was observed in less than 1% of cells (data not shown), indicating that Cdx expression did not interfere with spontaneous apoptosis. When cells were starved from serum for 4 days, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 5–7% in HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx2S, HT/CAT, and HT29 cells. It was significantly higher (16%) in HT/Cdx1S2S cells (Fig. 4). Confirmation of these data was sought by measuring the apoptosis rate induced by ceramide and staurosporine, which are known to stimulate apoptosis. The optimal drug concentration that triggered apoptosis in HT29 parental cells was determined by DNA fragmentation and cell survival assays (data not shown). Then the survival of HT/Cdx1S, HT/Cdx2S, HT/Cdx1S2S, HT/CAT control, or HT29 parental cells treated by these amounts of staurosporine and ceramide was measured over a period of 18 h. Under these conditions, cells cotransfected withCdx1 and Cdx2 but not the cells overexpressing either Cdx1 or Cdx2 showed increased apoptosis rate, compared with parental or control HT29 cells (Fig. 4). These results confirm that sensitivity to stimulated apoptosis was increased only when Cdx1 and Cdx2 were concomitantly overexpressed. We investigated whether sensitivity to stimulants of apoptosis was associated with modulation of Bcl-2 expression. Bcl-2 expression was monitored by Western blot analysis of HT29-transfected cells, using a specific monoclonal antibody. In cells expressing either Cdx1 orCdx2, no change could be evidenced (Fig.5). However, in cells in whichCdx1 and Cdx2 were concomitantly expressed, the Bcl-2 signal was significantly decreased. Cancer aggressivity depends mostly on tumor invasiveness, and cell migration is a determining step in this process. This is why we studied the modulations of cell migration consecutive toCdx1 or/and Cdx2 overexpression. Cell migration was measured by counting the number of cells having crossed the margin of a wound made in a monolayer at a given time after wounding (14Bürk R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). HT29 cell migration was spontaneously very slow, but it was stimulated very significantly after cell treatment by PMA. As shown in Fig.6, HT29 and HT/CAT migrated at a similar rate after stimulation by PMA. Under these conditions, the migration of HT/Cdx1S and HT/Cdx2S cells was profoundly impaired because it was only 40 and 37% of HT/CAT cells, respectively. Interestingly, the migration of HT/Cdx1S2S was only 16% that of HT/CAT cells, indicating that overexpression of both Cdx1 and Cdx2 resulted in a more profound inhibition of PMA-stimulated cell migration than overexpression of Cdx1 or Cdx2. Quite similar results were obtained upon treatment with mitomycin C (5 μg/ml), which inhibits cell proliferation, indicating that it was indeed cell migration that contributed dominantly to the wound closure process. Several authors have proposed that altered expression of homeotic genes could be associated with cell transformation and cancer progression (16Barba P. Magli M.C. Tiberio C. Cillo C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 348: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Lichty B.D. Ackland-Snow J. Noble L. Kamel-Reid S. Dube I.D. Leuk.

Furthermore, an inverse correlation was found between the severity of dysplasia and expression of Cdx1 andCdx2. In order to get further insight into the role of these homeotic genes in colon carcinogenesis, particularly in tumor progression, we choose to analyze the consequences of re-establishing their expression in HT29 cells. These cells derive from a colon carcinoma, and they express extremely low levels of Cdx1 andCdx2 mRNA (Fig. 1). By appropriate transfections we obtained HT29-derived cell lines overexpressing Cdx1,Cdx2, or both and compared their capacity for tumor formation, their sensitivity to apoptosis, and their ability for migration. The first parameter expected to be altered by Cdx expression was cell growth. Because Cdx mRNA expression is down-regulated in colon carcinoma (2Mallo G.V. Rechreche H. Frigerio J.M. Rocha D.

Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1977; 232: 742-748Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we looked into whether inducing Cdx overexpression would decrease the growth rate of HT29 cells. With respect to parental cells, the growth rate of HT/Cdx2S cells was indeed decreased by 50%, whereas that of HT/Cdx1S cells was not affected. This is consistent with previous reports showing a decreased growth rate in nontumoral intestine-derived cells overexpressing the Cdx2 (7Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and a normal growth rate in epithelial intestinal cells of Cdx1 −/− mice (15Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Cell. 1995; 83: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that overexpression of Cdx1strongly potentiated the effect of Cdx2 overexpression, the growth rate of HT/Cdx1S2S being only 20% of control. Thus,Cdx2 seems to be directly involved in the control of cell growth, whereas Cdx1 would only enhance Cdx2action. Then we studied the relationship between Cdx expression and tumorigenicity. All cell lines, including controls, induced tumors when injected into nude mice. Cells overexpressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, Cdx1, or Cdx2 generated tumors that grew at the same rate as parental cells. However, the growth rate of tumors generated by cells overexpressing Cdx1 andCdx2 was decreased by half. These results demonstrate that concomitant expression of Cdx1 and Cdx2 is required to reduce the tumorigenicity of HT29 cells but not sufficient to prevent tumor formation; conversely, they indicate that decreased expression of one of the two Cdxs may result in increased tumorigenicity. However, analyzing our findings in view of results obtained in vivo revealed some discrepancies. InCdx1 −/− mice, the growth rate of epithelial intestinal cells was unchanged, and the animals did not develop intestinal tumors (15Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Cell. 1995; 83: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cdx2 −/− mice could not be analyzed because they died early after conception but 90% ofCdx2 +/− mice developed intestinal tumors within the first three months of life (6Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Ko¨ntgen F. Beck F. Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Hence, adequate expression ofCdx2 is also mandatory in vivo to prevent uncontrolled cell growth, but contrary to what was obtained in vitro with HT29, concomitant preservation of Cdx1expression is apparently not essential. Partial complementation by another Cdx in Cdx1 −/− mice might account for that discrepancy. Nevertheless, these findings support the hypothesis that situations leading to decreased Cdxexpression in colon cells would likely be associated with increased tumorigenicity. The third aspect that we investigated was whether Cdxexpression altered cell response to apoptotic agents, because decreased susceptibility of most tumoral cells to apoptosis favors tumor growth and increases cell resistance to cytotoxic agents (21Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). In normal culture conditions, the apoptosis rate was less than 1% in HT/CAT control or HT29 parental cells and did not change upon overexpression of Cdx1 and/or Cdx2, suggesting thatCdx overexpression did not induce apoptosis. When cells were exposed to serum starvation, ceramide, or staurosporine, apoptosis was induced to the same extent in control cells and cells overexpressingCdx1 or Cdx2. By contrast, cells expressing bothCdx genes showed markedly increased sensitivity to induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). Thus, as reported above for tumorigenicity, underexpression of either Cdx1 or Cdx2 would confer a more severe phenotype to colon cells by increasing their resistance to apoptosis. We found evidence that sensitivity to stimulated apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of the Bcl-2 protein in HT/Cdx1S2S cells (Fig. 5). Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein, obtained by transfection of the Bcl-2 gene into human colonic cells, renders these cells resistant to butyrate-induced apoptosis (22Hague A. Diaz G.D. Hicks D.J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Paraskeva C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 is involved in the pathway by which theCdx control apoptosis in colon cells. The ability of cells to migrate is the last parameter that we analyzed in conjunction with Cdx expression. This is an important aspect because cell migration is required for invasivity and metastasis (23Stracke, M. L., Aznavoorian, S. A., Beckner, M. E., Liotta, L. A., and Schiffmann, E. (1991) Cell Motility Factors (Goldberg, I. D., ed) Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Migration is a complex function that depends on a dynamic regulation of the interaction of cell surface adhesion receptors with their ligands on the ouside of the cell and with the cytoskeleton on the inside, the whole process being controlled by growth factors. In this study, it was found that overexpression of either Cdx1or Cdx2 was sufficient to reduce the PMA-stimulated migration by 60%. Yet, here again, co-operation of Cdx1 andCdx2 led to a much stronger effect, cell migration being inhibited by 85%. It is therefore very likely that loss ofCdx1 or Cdx2 expression from normal colon cells would significantly increase their migration potential. It was concluded from these studies that concomitantly increasing the expression of Cdx1 and Cdx2 conferred to HT29 colon cancer cells a much less aggressive phenotype. Their rate of growth and tumorigenicity were decreased, their sensitivity to apoptosis was increased, and their migration upon stimulation by PMA was strongly reduced. Overexpressing only one of the Cdxs produced a weaker effect or was ineffective. Hence, reduced expression of one of the two Cdxs would suffice to maintain an aggressive phenotype, in agreement with previous findings that decreased expression of Cdx1 or Cdx2 was associated with colon cancer (2Mallo G.V. Rechreche H. Frigerio J.M. Rocha D. Zweibaum A. Lacasa M. Jordan B. Dusetti N. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results suggest that restoration of Cdx expression in colon cancer cells would be a promising therapeutic strategy, provided that Cdx1 andCdx2 are concomitantly induced. The present findings could also be analyzed in terms of carcinogenesis because, if increasing the expression of the Cdxs in colon cancer cells decreases the aggressivity of their phenotype, one can assume that in normal colon cells any event leading to decreased expression of Cdx1 or Cdx2 would participate in carcinogenesis.

The mechanisms by which Cdx gene products influence the phenotype of the cells are presently unknown, but they could be part of the control of cell cycle and differentiation as reported for the retinoblastoma gene (RB1), because overexpression of that gene also reduced tumorigenicity and cell migration in many cancer-derived cell lines (Ref. 24Valente P.

The enhancement began ∼1 My before and ended ∼1.5 My after the major impact events that produced the large Popigai and Chesapeake Bay craters ∼36 million years ago. The correlation between increased concentrations of helium-3, a tracer of fine-grained interplanetary dust, and large impacts indicates that the abundance of Earth-crossing objects and dustiness in the inner solar system were simultaneously but only briefly enhanced. These observations provide evidence for a comet shower triggered by an impulsive perturbation of the Oort cloud."

Paired δ 15 N-δ 13 C-N variations in 40 eclogitic diamonds from the Jwaneng kimberlite in Botswana show that neither the influence of recycled biogenic carbon nor the global and primordial heterogeneity of mantle carbon are likely for the origin of the large δ 13 C range; the data instead support a fractionation process. It is proposed that carbonatitic mantle melts from which diamonds crystallize undergo different evolutions before diamond precipitation, when percolating through either a peridotite or an eclogite. These different evolutions, reflecting the presence or absence of olivine, can account for their respective δ 13 C distributions."

Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also suggested that there was only a single CCT isoform in mammalian cells. A single genetic locus for CCTα was identified on mouse chromosome 16 (5Rutherford M.S. Rock C.O. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Tessner T.G. Copeland N.G. Jackowski S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the murine CCTα gene has been cloned (30Tang W. Keesler G.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13146-13151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this work, we identify a unique, second human CCT isoform, called CCTβ. CCTβ catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction as CCTα and requires the presence of lipids for full activity. However, CCTβ lacks the nuclear targeting sequence and the phosphorylation domain of CCTα, suggesting that CCTβ is distinct from CCTα with regard to its subcellular localization and regulation.DISCUSSIONThe existence of a second isoform of CCT opens the door to a series of experiments to determine the physiological function of CCTβ. Our data indicate that the biochemical properties of the two CCT isoforms are similar and the overexpression of either isoform is capable of perturbing PtdCho biosynthesis and metabolism. However, the distinct differences between the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains of CCTα and CCTβ indicate that the two isoforms likely have unique regulatory properties. The two isoforms are clearly the products of different genes and are differentially expressed in tissues and perhaps also during development. Because CCTα is the only isoform detected in the large volume of work in this area (1Tronchére H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), it is possible that CCTβ is expressed at lower levels or in a specific developmental settings compared with than the more widely distributed CCTα.Previous data may have to be reinterpreted in light of the existence of CCTβ. For example, data on whole tissue CCT activity and distribution will need to be reevaluated. The Northern blots cannot be used to predict the relative levels of CCTα and CCTβ proteins in particular tissues. Total CCT specific activity is relatively low in most tissues, illustrating that neither isoform is expressed at high levels. The properties of CCTβ when expressed in vivo and assayedin vitro suggest that there are no significant differences in biochemical characteristics that could distinguish between the two isozymes in crude extracts. The general impression is that CCTβ may be more restrictive in its expression compared with CCTα because CCTα has been the only mammalian isoform cloned to date. Nonetheless, we think that these data will be important to gather because some of the controversial issues in the CCT field may be explained by the presence of two isoforms.The CCTα anti-peptide antibody used previously to identify its nuclear localization (7Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) does not cross-react with CCTβ (Figs. 5and 6). Houweling et al. (24Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiére M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar) report that CCT is both a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein in primary hepatocytes using a peptide antibody raised against amino acids 164–176 of CCTα. This sequence in the 164–176 region (DFVAHDDIPYSSA) is identical in human CCTα and CCTβ; therefore, antisera raised against this peptide would be predicted to react with both CCT isoforms. We detect both CCTα and CCTβ transcripts in rodent liver, 2A. Lykidis and S. Jackowski, unpublished observations. and it will be very interesting to determine whether the cytoplasmic CCT detected in primary rodent hepatocytes can be attributed to the presence of CCTβ in this tissue.The co-migration of CCTα and CCTβM on denaturing gels and their similar reliance on lipid activators for biochemical activity makes it difficult to determine whether CCTβ is a component of purified CCT preparations from mammalian sources. The regulation of CCTα is governed by phosphorylation of its carboxyl terminus at multiple sites, resulting in at least two species that migrate more slowly on denaturing gels (Figs. 5 and 6 and Ref. 40Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation interferes with the stimulatory action of lipids on CCTα activity (23Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and there is some correlation with membrane dissociation of CCTα in vivo (20Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17843-17849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but the regulation by this mechanism is not an absolute on/off switch (23Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activity of CCTβM, a protein with approximately the same molecular weight as CCTα, is lower (Fig. 7) due to posttranslational modification that is dependent on the amino terminus. The nature of the modification of CCTβ protein and its role in the regulation of PtdCho biosynthesis is currently under investigation.

There is only one isoform of CCT expressed in yeast (28Tsukagoski Y. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and only one isoform of CCT (CCTα) has been identified, purified, or cloned from mammalian sources (2Kent C. Annu. Rev.

The existence of a conditionally lethal Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant with a temperature-sensitive defect in CCTα activity (29Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also suggested that there was only a single CCT isoform in mammalian cells. A single genetic locus for CCTα was identified on mouse chromosome 16 (5Rutherford M.S. Rock C.O. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Tessner T.G. Copeland N.G. Jackowski S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the murine CCTα gene has been cloned (30Tang W. Keesler G.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13146-13151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this work, we identify a unique, second human CCT isoform, called CCTβ. CCTβ catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction as CCTα and requires the presence of lipids for full activity. However, CCTβ lacks the nuclear targeting sequence and the phosphorylation domain of CCTα, suggesting that CCTβ is distinct from CCTα with regard to its subcellular localization and regulation. DISCUSSIONThe existence of a second isoform of CCT opens the door to a series of experiments to determine the physiological function of CCTβ. Our data indicate that the biochemical properties of the two CCT isoforms are similar and the overexpression of either isoform is capable of perturbing PtdCho biosynthesis and metabolism. However, the distinct differences between the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains of CCTα and CCTβ indicate that the two isoforms likely have unique regulatory properties. The two isoforms are clearly the products of different genes and are differentially expressed in tissues and perhaps also during development. Because CCTα is the only isoform detected in the large volume of work in this area (1Tronchére H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), it is possible that CCTβ is expressed at lower levels or in a specific developmental settings compared with than the more widely distributed CCTα.Previous data may have to be reinterpreted in light of the existence of CCTβ. For example, data on whole tissue CCT activity and distribution will need to be reevaluated. The Northern blots cannot be used to predict the relative levels of CCTα and CCTβ proteins in particular tissues. Total CCT specific activity is relatively low in most tissues, illustrating that neither isoform is expressed at high levels. The properties of CCTβ when expressed in vivo and assayedin vitro suggest that there are no significant differences in biochemical characteristics that could distinguish between the two isozymes in crude extracts. The general impression is that CCTβ may be more restrictive in its expression compared with CCTα because CCTα has been the only mammalian isoform cloned to date. Nonetheless, we think that these data will be important to gather because some of the controversial issues in the CCT field may be explained by the presence of two isoforms.The CCTα anti-peptide antibody used previously to identify its nuclear localization (7Wang Y.

Bussiére M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar) report that CCT is both a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein in primary hepatocytes using a peptide antibody raised against amino acids 164–176 of CCTα. This sequence in the 164–176 region (DFVAHDDIPYSSA) is identical in human CCTα and CCTβ; therefore, antisera raised against this peptide would be predicted to react with both CCT isoforms. We detect both CCTα and CCTβ transcripts in rodent liver, 2A. Lykidis and S. Jackowski, unpublished observations. and it will be very interesting to determine whether the cytoplasmic CCT detected in primary rodent hepatocytes can be attributed to the presence of CCTβ in this tissue.The co-migration of CCTα and CCTβM on denaturing gels and their similar reliance on lipid activators for biochemical activity makes it difficult to determine whether CCTβ is a component of purified CCT preparations from mammalian sources. The regulation of CCTα is governed by phosphorylation of its carboxyl terminus at multiple sites, resulting in at least two species that migrate more slowly on denaturing gels (Figs. 5 and 6 and Ref. 40Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation interferes with the stimulatory action of lipids on CCTα activity (23Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and there is some correlation with membrane dissociation of CCTα in vivo (20Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the activity of CCTβM, a protein with approximately the same molecular weight as CCTα, is lower (Fig. 7) due to posttranslational modification that is dependent on the amino terminus.

Both isoforms present identical amino acid sequences up to amino acid 993.

Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1410-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we cloned the human SERCA3 cDNA, isolated and partially characterized a genomic clone encoding all but the 5′-end of the gene, and localized the SERCA3 gene (ATP2A3) on human chromosome 17p13.3 (31Dode L. Wuytack F. Kools P.F.J. Baba-Aissa F. Raeymaekers L. Briké F. Van De Ven W.J.M. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Until very recently, there were no indications that the SERCA3 pre-mRNA was subject to alternative splicing. Two mouse nucleotide sequences coding for SERCA3a and SERCA3b have been deposited in the EMBL/GenBankTM data bank. 2Deposited in the EMBL/GenBankTM data bank under the accession numbers U49394 and U49393, respectively, by Y. Tokuyama, X. Chen, M. W. Roe, and G. I. Bell.2Deposited in the EMBL/GenBankTM data bank under the accession numbers U49394 and U49393, respectively, by Y. Tokuyama, X. Chen, M. W. Roe, and G. I. Bell. So far, no indications regarding the alternative splicing mechanism were published. We now document the complete exon/intron organization of the human SERCA3 gene. The transcription initiation site and several upstream putative cis-regulatory elements were identified. The functional promoter analysis delineates the minimal promoter region responsible for efficient transcriptional activity and suggests the involvement of the Sp1 transcription factor. We also provide evidence that the human and mouse SERCA3 gene primary transcripts are alternatively spliced, thereby generating not two but three distinct isoforms with altered C termini as follows: SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c. Furthermore, the three mouse SERCA3 isoforms were overexpressed in COS cells and shown to be functionally active but with different apparent affinities for Ca2+. To isolate the entire gene, a human chromosome 17-specific library from Reference Library Data Base, ICRF (32Lehrach H. Drmanac R. Hoheisel J. Larin Z. Lennon G. Manaco A.P. Nizetic D. Zehetner G.

The EcoRI fragment comprised 6 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and the first 1476 bp of the coding region. Six new positive clones (Fig. 1) were isolated and further characterized according to standard restriction mapping and sequencing protocols. Analysis of repetitive sequences was carried out using the CENSOR server. 3Available at the following on-line address: . The computer-assisted analysis of the putative transcription factor binding sites was performed using the Wisconsin Package Version 9.0 program from Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI.

The extension primer used (5′-GAGGCCATGTCCGTGCTGGGAC-3′) corresponds to the inverse complement of nucleotides 25–46 (numbering relative to the determined transcription site; see Fig. 5 b). The 35S-labeled sequencing products (used as size markers) of a 5′ genomic fragment primed with the same extension primer and the extension products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel.Figure 5Structural and functional analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human SERCA3 gene. a, CG (%) content analysis of an 11-kb nucleotide sequence surrounding the first exon.

The resulting plasmid, p6.6BK, was used as a template for further generation of controlled deletions by making use of restriction sites present within the genomic insert and the luciferase cloning vector (Fig. 5 c). The 5′-end of each of the deletion constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The human SERCA3 promoter-luciferase constructs and the unmodified, promoterless pGL3 basic reporter vector were used for transient transfection of the human cell line Jurkat E6.1 cells by electroporation as described (34Berwaer M. Martial J.A. Davis J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To evaluate transfection efficiencies, the cells were co-transfected with 150 or 500 ng of a pEL1-βgal vector, containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the elongation factor 1 promoter (pEL1-βgal vector is a gift from Dr. F. Bulens). 4F. Bulens, I. Van Nerum, P. Merchiers, A. Belayew, and D.

The measurements were performed with the MicroLumat LB 96P luminometer (EG & G, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and corrected for protein concentration, as determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Luciferase activities are expressed relative to the β-galactosidase activities and normalized to the value obtained with the promoterless pGL3 basic vector which is set at 1. The human RNA Master Blot™ (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), to which high quality poly(A)+ RNAs from 50 different adult and fetal tissues have been immobilized along with several controls (Fig.6), was hybridized following the manufacturer's protocol. The synthesis of a 3′-end probe by PCR was described earlier (31Dode L. Wuytack F. Kools P.F.J. Baba-Aissa F. Raeymaekers L. Briké F. Van De Ven W.J.M. Casteels R. Biochem.

The blot was analyzed by means of a PhosphorImager model STORM 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A common SERCA3b/SERCA3c probe (90-bp long) was PCR-synthesized using a 5′ primer N+ (5′-GCACGGCCTTCTCAGGACAGTCT-3′) and the 3′ primer P1 (5′-GGCTCATTTCTTCCGGTGTGGTCTGG-3′) and the GHS3 clone as template DNA; these primers (Fig. 8 a) span the exon/intron junctions involved in the alternative splicing. PCR amplification was carried out for 20 cycles, each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C.Figure 8Alternative splicing of the SERCA3 pre-mRNA in human and mouse. a, the genomic nucleotide sequence of the 3′-end of the human SERCA3 gene is compared with its mouse counterpart. The exon sequences are shown in uppercase letters and the introns in lowercase letters. For mouse, only the exons and the ends of the introns are aligned; thedashes in the mouse sequences denote the nucleotides that are identical with the human ones. To maintain the partial alignment, a single gap (depicted by a thin vertical arrow) was introduced in the mouse sequence downstream from a putative branch point sequence, 5′-ctctgac-3′ (shown in a rectangle withround corners). The 5′ donor sites D1 and D2 are indicatedabove their boxed sequences. If D1 is used, then the sequence of the exon 21 indicated in bold is joined to exon 22. When D2 is used, then the sequence in italics is included in exon 21 and then joined to exon 22. The human (hA) and mouse (mA) 3′ acceptor sites used are also indicated. The boxes Sa and Sb denote the overlapping human and mouse stop codons used in SERCA3a and SERCA3b, respectively. The human and mouse stop codons for SERCA3c (initalics) are shifted and shown in small boxes. The nucleotide numbering is shown relative to the human ATG codon inbold and italics for SERCA3b and SERCA3c, respectively. The determined or estimated (~) sizes of the human and mouse introns and of the last human exon are also indicated.

The mouse SERCA3 primers used are as follows: a 5′ primer M + 1 (5′-GGGGTGGTGCTTCAGATGTCTCTGC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 2948–2972 in mouse SERCA3a and SERCA3b nucleotide sequences (accession numbers U49394 and U49393, respectively) and a 3′ primer M − 1 (5′-GGACAAATGCCTGGATGCTCTCAGT-3′) corresponding to the inverse complement of nucleotide stretches 3086–3110 and 3159–3183 in mouse SERCA3a and SERCA3b cDNA nucleotide sequences, respectively. A specific 3′ primer for the mouse SERCA3c isoform P3 (5′-CTTCAGGTCCTTTTTTTCCAAGAAGCCAAC-3′) spans the splice boundary between the last exon and an optional exon. PCR amplifications were carried out for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 68 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for both M + 1/M − 1, and M + 1/P3 pairs.

Two additional 3′ primers specific for the human SERCA3b and SERCA3c isoforms were designed as follows: the above mentioned primer P1 and the primer P2 (5′-GGCTCATTTCTTCAAAGAGGCCAAC-3′), respectively. The PCR conditions were the same for the 3 pairs of primers (22+/1−, 22+/P1, and 22+/P2): 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. All PCR amplifications were performed using a mixture of Pwo(proofreading activity) and Taq polymerases from Boehringer Mannheim, Brussels, Belgium. M + 1, M − 1, P2, and P3 primers are also represented in Fig. 8 a. PCR fragments were gel-purified and subcloned, and for each fragment several individual clones were sequenced. Amplification of the genetic marker D17S1828 (accession number, 602622) from human genomic DNA, ICRFc105-G1035 and -F10124 cosmid clones was performed using the 5′ primer L+ (5′-TGCACTCACAGATTTGCC-3′) and the 3′ primer L− (5′-TTAAGCCAAGTTCGGATTTG-3′) for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C.

 There has been considerable controversy in the biotechnology community regarding the patenting of DNA sequence. In this Policy Forum, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office presents its view that, as in other fields of technology, DNA-related inventions may be patentable if they meet all the conditions for patentability, including, for example, utility, novelty, nonobviousness, written description and enablement. Issuing of a patent on a fragment of a gene does not preclude the future patenting of the full-length gene but the patent to the gene fragment may dominate a later patent to the full-length gene. The granting of comprehensive claims to downstream DNA products such as full-length genes or to ultimate proteins is unlikely in the absence of a significant amount of information about the gene and protein being disclosed in the patent application."

More seamounts, slower subsidence, and less dense mantle on the western flank suggest transport of hotter mantle toward the axis from the west. Variations in axial ridge shape, axial magma chamber continuity, off-axis volcanism, and apparent mantle density indicate that upwelling is probably faster and more melt is produced beneath 17°15′S than beneath 15°55′S.

This study examined the glutamatergic regulation of APP in the human neuronal Ntera 2 (NT2N) cell line.Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes 1α/β and 5α were identified in the NT2N neurons by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The glutamate-induced APP-S secretion was maximal at 30 min and at a concentration of 1 mm glutamate. Glutamate-induced APP-S secretion required activation of phospholipase C, which resulted in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, as shown by the rapid glutamate-induced accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

This supports the idea of a primary role for APP and Aβ in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Many populations of neurons are affected in Alzheimer's disease, in particular the cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, therefore it is important to examine these receptor signaling pathways. The m1 and m3 muscarinic receptors have been shown previously to stimulate the secretion of APP, and recently the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors was shown to cause an increase in APP secretion (19Wolf B.A. Wertkin A.M. Jolly Y.C. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Konrad R.J. Manning D. Ravi S. Williamson J.R. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

The mGluR1 and R5 subtypes are linked to phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, whereas the other six subtypes are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The degeneration and loss of neurons seen in Alzheimer's disease and a recent study demonstrating the involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the regulation of APP secretion suggest that a defect in the receptors or in their signaling pathways might lead to abnormal processing of APP and subsequent Aβ deposition. The regulatory mechanism of APP processing and secretion is unknown; however, recent findings suggest that the control is through neurotransmitter receptor coupling to signal transduction pathways (21Nitsch R.M. Slack B.E. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In order to examine the glutamatergic signaling pathway, the human teratocarcinoma cell line NTera 2/cl.D1 (NT2N) was used. NT2N cells are post-mitotic, terminally differentiated neurons that possess cell surface markers consistent with neurons of the central nervous system. Pure cultures of neurons are obtained through differentiation of the stem cell population with retinoic acid and treatment of the replated neuronal population with mitotic inhibitors to clear any contaminating nonneuronal cells. NT2N neurons provide a strong model for examining APP secretion because they endogenously express APP and secrete both APP and Aβ in response to physiological stimuli. In contrast to non-neuronal cells, NT2N neurons express APP695, the major APP isoform expressed in the brain, and NT2N neurons process APP differently (6Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J.

For this study, NT2N neurons were used to determine if glutamate is involved in the regulation of APP secretion. The media and serum used to maintain the NT2N culture were from Life Technologies, Inc., and all of the mitotic inhibitors and antibiotics used in the cell culture were purchased from Sigma. Matrigel was from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). The DAG kinase and lipase inhibitors were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Ballwin, MO). The phorbol ester PMA was from Sigma and the calcium ionophore A23187 was from Boehringer Mannheim. [35S]Methionine (1000–1500 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA) andmyo-[3H]inositol (84 Ci/mmol), [3H]inositol 1-phosphate (10 Ci/mmol), [3H]inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (10 Ci/mmol), [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (21 Ci/mmol), and [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (21 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Trichloroacetic acid, trichlorotrifluorethane, and trioctylamine used in the inositol extraction procedure were also from Sigma. SAX Amprep minicolumns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNA isolation kit was fromCLONTECH, RT-PCR reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI), and the mGluR1 primers were from the Wistar Institute (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), and mGluR5 primers were from National Biosciences Inc. (Beverly, MA). The human teratocarcinoma NTera2/c1.D1 (NT2) cells were maintained in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (23Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2.3 × 106 cells were seeded into a 75-cm2 flask and treated with 10 μm retinoic acid (in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) twice a week for 5 weeks. Cells were then trypsinized and replated (Replate 2) onto poly-d-lysine/Matrigel (Collaborative Research)-coated 10-cm dishes or six-well plates. Cells were fed once a week with DMEM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and mitotic inhibitors (1 mmcytosine arabinoside, 10 mm fluorodeoxyuridine, 10 mm uridine) for 4 weeks. This yielded a >95% pure culture of differentiated human neurons (NT2N) that could be maintained in culture for 7–8 weeks. NT2N 10-cm dishes or six-well plates (240–480 ng of DNA) were washed three times in Krebs-Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 115 mmNaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mmd-glucose), preincubated 30 min under an atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2 at 37 °C, and then incubated for the appropriate time with agonists (glutamate, ACPD, quisqualate, CCG-I, PMA, A23187, OAG). To examine the effect of the glutamate receptor antagonists (CNQX, AP5, AIDA, MPPG, MSOPPE) and DAG lipase and kinase inhibitors (RG80267, R59949), the cells were pretreated with the agents for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated for an additional 30 min alone or in presence of glutamate. In order to metabolically label APP, NT2N cells were serum-starved for 20 min in DMEM methionine-free medium and then labeled with 100–400 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in DMEM methionine-free medium (1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5% fetal bovine serum) for 3 h. The cells were then treated as described above. After treatment, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g to remove any remaining cells. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and then immunoprecipitated overnight with 10–20 μg of an anti-APP-S polyclonal antibody (Karen) and protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously (6Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE mini-gels, and the radioactivity quantitated using Image Quant software on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For data analysis, the control was designated as 100% within each experiment due the differences in radioactive counts between the controls in separate experiments. The glutamate-induced APP-S secretion was determined to be specific for APP after demonstrating that glutamate did not have an effect on the amount of total secreted proteins (data not shown). 60–90 μg of total RNA was isolated from NT2N cells as described previously (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was then performed as follows. For reverse transcription, RNA was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then placed on ice for 10 min. For each reaction of 31 μl, less than 30 μg of total RNA was added to the reaction mixture of: RNase inhibitor (40 units/ml), first strand cDNA 5 × buffer, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 0.1m dithiothreitol, and oligo(dT) (1.5 μg). The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a thermal cycler for 60 min at 42 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The cDNA generated was then amplified in a 50-μl PCR using 8.5 μl of the cDNA, 10 × PCR buffer, 1 μl of dNTP mix (10 mmeach of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), 0.25 μl of Taq polymerase (5 units/μl), and 2.5 μl of each specific primer (20 μm each) (designed from the published sequence of human mGluR1 (5′ CTGCATGTTCACTCCCAAGATGTACAT, 3′ CACGCGCCTGTGCACCACCATGGAAG) and mGluR5 (5′ TGTGCCCAGCTAGTGATTGC, 3′ TGCTCTTCTCATTCTGGGC) (25Desai M.A. Burnett J.P.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were layered with mineral oil, placed in the thermal cycler, and programmed for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and then a final 7 min at 72 °C. The tubes were placed at 4 °C until the PCR products were analyzed for purity and size on a 1.5% agarose gels. The products were excised from the gels and purified with the Geneclean II kit and the purified products subjected to a restriction enzyme digest with EcoRI for the identification of mGluR1α/β and BglI for mGluR5α. NT2N cells were labeled for 48 h with 10 μCi/dish ofmyo-[3H]inositol, washed three times with Krebs-Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 115 mmNaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mmd-glucose, 10 mm LiCl), preincubated 30 min under an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and then incubated for 2 min with fresh Krebs-Hepes buffer ± 1 mm glutamate. Inositol phosphates were extracted with 0.5 ml of a 1:5 trichloroacetic acid solution and then neutralized with 1 ml of a 3:1 solution of trichlorotrifluoroethane/trioctylamine. The aqueous layers, as well as commercially available inositol phosphates for standardization of the columns, were loaded onto pre-equilibrated Amprep SAX minicolumns and the inositol phosphate adducts (inositol 1-phosphate (IP), inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP2), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4)) eluted with a step gradient of 5 ml each of 0.05, 0.10, 0.16, and 0.17 m potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3). The fractions were collected and counted in a Wallac scintillation counter. Cells were loaded with fura-2 during a 40-min incubation at 37 °C in 2 ml of Krebs-Hepes buffer (115 mm NaCl, 24 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.40) supplemented with 2.5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 0.2 mg/ml pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes), which was used to increase the loading. The coverslip with the loaded cells was then mounted in a perifusion chamber placed on the homeothermic platform of an inverted Zeiss microscope. The cells were superfused with Krebs-Hepes buffer at 37 °C at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The microscope was used with a × 40 oil objective. Fura-2 was successively excited at 334 and 380 nm by means of two narrow band-pass filters. The emitted fluorescence was filtered through a 520-nm filter, captured with an Attofluor CCD video camera at a resolution of 512 × 480 pixels, digitized into 256 gray levels, and analyzed with version 6.00 of the Attofluor RatioVision software (Atto Instrument, Rockville, MD). The concentration of Ca2+was calculated by comparing the ratio of fluorescence at each pixel to an in vitro 2-point calibration curve. The Ca2+concentration is presented by averaging the values of all pixels in the body of a differentiated NT2N cell (neuron soma), excluding the Ca2+ data of neurites. Data points were collected at an interval of 4.5 s. Student's t test was performed when two groups were compared. Analysis of variance was used, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls method when multiple groups were compared. In cases where the data did not have a normal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks was used, followed by Dunn's method of multiple comparison. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. NT2N neurons were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and then stimulated with 1 mm glutamate for 0–90 min or various concentrations of glutamate for 30 min. APP-S was immunoprecipitated from the medium and the proteins separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Fig.1 (top panel) shows the resulting APP-S bands. The lower APP-S band is the 695 form, while the higher APP-S band is the 751 and/or 770 form, the result of any remaining non-neuronal cells within the culture. Glutamate treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in APP-s secretion between 5 and 30 min, with maximal secretion at 30 min (p < 0.05versus control) (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Between 30 and 90 min, glutamate-induced secretion decreased to the control level of secretion. Glutamate-induced APP-S secretion was dose-dependent (Fig. 2,bottom panel). Fig. 2 (top panel) shows a representative gel depicting an increase in APP-S695secretion with increasing concentrations of glutamate. Glutamate also caused a rapid and sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+(Fig. 3, top panel). Likewise, the glutamate-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was also dose-dependent (Fig. 3, bottom panel).Figure 2Effect of glutamate concentration on APP-S secretion in NT2N neurons.

Sci. 1997; 18: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ionotropic receptors are selectively permeable ion channels and are subdivided into three groups according to agonist selectivity, NMDA, kainate, and AMPA receptors. The metabotropic receptors are seven transmembrane-spanning proteins coupled to intracellular second messengers. The metabotropic receptor family consists of at least eight different subtypes that are subdivided into three groups according to sequence similarities, agonist selectivity, and intracellular signaling machinery. Therefore, the effects of both metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists were examined in NT2N cells. The effects of both metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists on APP-S secretion are shown in TableI. The ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist NMDA (10 μm) did not have any effect on APP-S secretion; however, the non-NMDA glutamate receptor agonists AMPA (100 μm) and kainate (100 μm) caused a 1.5-fold and a 2-fold increase, respectively, in APP-S secretion. AMPA and kainate also caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig.4). The nonspecific glutamate receptor agonist quisqualate (100 μm) had a slight effect on APP-S secretion; however, the specific metabotropic glutamate receptor group I and II agonists, ACPD (100 μm) and CCG-I (100 μm) both resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in APP-S secretion, suggesting the glutamate-induced APP-S secretion is mediated in part by metabotropic glutamate receptors.Table IEffect of glutamate receptor agonists on APP-S secretion in NT2N cellsAgonistAPP-S secretion% controlControl100.0Glutamate (1 mm)186.2 ± 9.91-ap < 0.05 versus control.NMDA (10 μm)101.5 ± 6.9AMPA (100 μm)159.3 ± 16.01-ap < 0.05 versus control.Kainate (100 μm)211.5 ± 9.81-ap < 0.05 versus control.ACPD (100 μm)148.7 ± 8.01-ap < 0.05 versus control.CCG-I (100 μm)164.0 ± 22.51-ap < 0.05 versus control.Quisqualate (100 μm)131.4 ± 6.4Cells were labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine as in Fig. 1 and then treated with various of glutamate receptor agonists for 30 min.

Here, we determined the important steps for the modulation by ET and ANP of G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. ET-3 stimulated an increased number of fetal rat diencephalic astrocytes to progress through G1/S, and this was blocked significantly by ANP. ET augmented the gene expression and/or protein production of D-type, A and E cyclins, whereas ANP inhibited these events significantly. ET also stimulated the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6, directed against the retinoblastoma protein pRb, and this was inhibited by as much as 80% by ANP. As an additional mechanism of cell cycle restraint, ANP stimulated the production of multiple cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory (CKI) proteins, including p16, p27, and p57. This was critical because antisense oligonucleotides to each CKI reversed ANP-induced inhibition of ET-stimulated DNA synthesis by as much as 85%. CKI antisense oligonucleotides also reversed the ANP inhibition of Cdk phosphorylation of pRb. In turn, ET inhibited ANP-stimulated production of the CKIs, thereby promoting cell cycle progression. Specific and changing associations of the CKI with Cdk2 and Cdk4 were stimulated by ANP and inhibited by ET. Our findings identify several mechanisms by which endogenous modulators of astrocyte proliferation can control the G1-S progression and indicate that multiple CKIs are necessary to restrain cell cycle progression in these cells.

As an additional mechanism of cell cycle restraint, ANP stimulated the production of multiple cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory (CKI) proteins, including p16, p27, and p57. This was critical because antisense oligonucleotides to each CKI reversed ANP-induced inhibition of ET-stimulated DNA synthesis by as much as 85%. CKI antisense oligonucleotides also reversed the ANP inhibition of Cdk phosphorylation of pRb. In turn, ET inhibited ANP-stimulated production of the CKIs, thereby promoting cell cycle progression. Specific and changing associations of the CKI with Cdk2 and Cdk4 were stimulated by ANP and inhibited by ET. Our findings identify several mechanisms by which endogenous modulators of astrocyte proliferation can control the G1-S progression and indicate that multiple CKIs are necessary to restrain cell cycle progression in these cells. Astrocytes are important cells in the central (and peripheral) nervous system where they guide the development and migration of neurons during brain development, produce growth factors, maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and participate in the immune and repair responses to disease and brain injury. Astrocytes within the central nervous system mainly proliferate only during embryogenesis, but these cells divide in the adult human after brain insult. For instance, intense migration, hypertrophy, and division of astroglia characterize the typical gliotic response to inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Transformation of astrocytes into the most prevalent primary tumor of the brain, the glioma, results from undefined steps that lead to relatively unregulated cell proliferation. Similarly, the key events that lead to astrocyte proliferation are not well understood. In general, the regulation of cellular proliferation involves the production and action of a variety of proteins that modulate progression through the cell cycle (1Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1989; 246: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The transition through G1 to S phase and the commitment of the cell to divide are modulated importantly by the activity of phase-specific threonine/serine kinases, the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase(s); CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; TGF, transforming growth factor; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; ET, endothelin; ASO, antisense oligonucleotide(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MSO, scrambled, missense oligonucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase(s); CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; TGF, transforming growth factor; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; ET, endothelin; ASO, antisense oligonucleotide(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MSO, scrambled, missense oligonucleotide(s).

The activity of these kinases is regulated in part by the actions of the cyclin proteins (3Hunt T. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar) and is restrained by the actions of a separate family of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKI). These latter proteins include p15 and p16 (4Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 5Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The CKI can be induced by growth-inhibitory proteins such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (for review, see Ref. 9Peter M. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1994; 79: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and p53 (10El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levby D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). The coordinated production and activation of the cyclin-Cdk protein complexes induced in response to a growth stimulus occur through several mechanisms. These include the stimulation of cyclin or kinase protein production and association (11Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar), the activating phosphorylation of the Cdks by cyclin-activating kinases (12Wu L. Yee A. Liu L. Carbonaro-Hall D. Venkatesan N. Tolo V.T. Hall F.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2089-2096PubMed Google Scholar), or activating dephosphorylation of the Cdks by the cdc25A phosphatase (13Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Growth factors have also been reported in a few studies to inhibit the production and association of the CKI proteins with the Cdks (14Coats S. Flannagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Modulation of each of these events is a theoretical target by which anti-growth proteins could inhibit cell proliferation. One such family of anti-growth proteins, the natriuretic peptides, inhibits the proliferation of a wide variety of cells, including kidney mesangial, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle, and astrocytic cells (15Appel R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F911-F918PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-growth effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have been studied most completely in astrocytes, where this peptide inhibits endothelin (ET) and other growth factor signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase to nuclear events that are critical for glial proliferation (16Hu R.-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The nuclear events mediating anti-growth include the inhibition of ET-stimulated production of the immediate-early gene/protein egr-1 and the autologous growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (17Biesiada E. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18576-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that ANP affects actions to restrain G1 to S phase progression, in some situations by modulating the actions of ET which lead to cell cycle progression. One important potential target is the stimulation of the production of the CKI proteins and their association with cyclin-Cdk complexes to inhibit kinase activity. We report here that ANP can stimulate the production of several CKI proteins and that this is crucial for the anti-growth actions of these peptides in the astrocyte. We further found that ET-ANP interactions modulate cyclin production, Cdk activity, and cyclin-Cdk protein association, as additional mechanisms regulating G1-S progression in these important neural cells. Fetal rat hypothalamic astrocytes were prepared as described previously (17Biesiada E. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18576-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Prins B. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol.

The cells were serum deprived for 48 h before experimentation to synchronize the cells into G1 phase. For Northern analysis, total RNA was extracted after the cells were then incubated with ET-3 or ANP, 100 nm, or in combination, for up to 16 h, and 20 μg from each experimental condition was separated on a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and prehybridized as we described previously (16Hu R.-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized for 12–18 h at 42 °C with 32P-labeled, antisense cRNAs, or end-labeled cDNAs for the CKI, by methods described previously (16Hu R.-M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Nazario B. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Prins B. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The probes for p27 (6Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), p16 (5Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar), and p57 (8Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. J. Massague, D. Beach, and W. Harper and have been described as referenced. Cyclin D1 and E gene expression was determined experimentally in a similar manner (19Nazario B. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Prins B. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes used were constructed as described previously (20Xiong Y. Menninger J. Beach D. Ward D.C. Genomics. 1992; 13: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and were the kind gifts of Dr. D. Beach and S. Reed, respectively. Hybridization bands were quantified by laser densitometry after autoradiography. Sense probes produced no hybridization. Astrocytes were synchronized for 48 h in the absence of serum, then incubated in the absence of serum but in the presence or absence of ET, ANP, or both peptides for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h. Ethanol (70%) was added in cold phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, removed, and then 1 ml of propidium iodide/RNase solution was added for 20 min. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by a flow cytometer. To assess the effects of ET and ANP on CKI protein, metabolic labeling studies for protein synthesis were performed. Astrocytes were synchronized by serum deprivation for 48 h, then incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h before experimentation, as described previously (19Nazario B. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Prins B. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each dish of cells was then incubated in the absence of serum or unlabeled methionine but with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of 100 nm ET-3, ANP, or both for up to 24 h. In additional studies, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) or missense constructs were added for 1 h before the addition of growth or anti-growth factor. The cells were then lysed, precleared, and specific labeled CKI protein was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibody for p27, p57, and p16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitated protein was solubilized and denatured in SDS-reducing buffer and electrophoretically resolved by PAGE using a glycine buffer system. For comparison, molecular weight markers were resolved under the same circumstances. The gel was then stained and destained and subjected to flurography and then autoradiography for 1 day. Each translation experiment was performed at least three times. The effects of ANP or ET on cyclin D1, D3, and E protein expression were determined similarly. To understand whether ANP or ET influenced the amount of Cdk protein that complexed with the various cyclins, SDS-PAGE-resolved Cdk proteins were then immunoblotted with antibody specific to each of the cyclins, as described previously (18Prins B. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14156-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For determination of the effects of ANP or ET on Cdk activity, the cells were cultured with 100 nm ET-3, with or without equimolar natriuretic peptides for up to 16 h, or they were treated with no added substance (control kinase expression). Cells were lysed, and the supernatant was frozen. Cell lysate (200 μl) was then added to Cdk antiserum (10 μl) conjugated to prewashed protein A-Sepharose; the mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in microcentrifuge tubes. After washing, each bead-antibody-antigen complex was then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 40 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 40 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol), 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and either glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pRb (Santa Cruz) or histone, as substrate for kinase activity. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS reducing buffer, samples were boiled, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After autoradiography, the bands were compared by laser densitometry. The regulation of the production of cyclin D1, D3, A, and E proteins was determined in response to ET, ANP, or both peptides over a 24-h time course, as described above. Subconfluent astrocytes were synchronized for 24 h in serum-free medium and then incubated for 20 h in the absence or presence of ET-3, with and without ANP, each at 100 nm, all conditions without serum. ASO or missense oligonucleotides (scrambled but the same base composition) to p16, p27, or p57 were also added for 1 h before the addition of ET or ANP. The ASO were 18–20-mer in length and were directed at the initiation codon and the following sequences for the proteins: p16, 5′-GCTCCATGCTGCCTCGTGCC-3′; p27, 5′-CACTCGCACGTTTGACAT-3′; and p57, 5′-ATGGAACGCTTGGCCTCCAG-3′. The ability of the various ASO to inhibit CKI protein synthesis specifically was validated by protein translation studies (see above). After the addition of 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 4 h, cells were washed, incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate nuclear thymidine, and lysed with 0.2 n NaOH and neutralized with 0.2 n HCl; the lysates were counted in a β-counter. Data were interpreted by analysis of variance plus Schefe's test. To determine whether ET increased and ANP inhibited the phosphorylation of endogenous pRb, cells were incubated with the peptides in the presence or absence of the CKI ASO for 16 h. After cell lysis, endogenous pRb was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, then blotted with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of pRb (Santa Cruz). The study was repeated three times. We determined the effects of ET and ANP on cell cycle progression in the astrocytes. The percentages of cells in all phases of the cell cycle were comparably unchanged over 24 h in both the control (serum-deprived) and ANP alone states, indicating that at least 90% of cells did not progress under these conditions. Under control or ANP alone conditions, the percentage of cells in G1 (90%) or S (5%) at 4 h was very similar to the ET alone (Fig. 1) or ET + ANP-treated cells (data not shown). ET then stimulated the progression of the astrocytes from G1 to S phase, commencing at 12–16 h, with 5-fold more cells reaching S phase between 16 and 24 h (Fig. 1) compared with control cells. ANP inhibited this progression, causing a 40% reduction in the number of cells reaching S phase at 24 h. This was very comparable to the overall extent of anti-proliferation induced by ANP (see below) and corresponds to the 45% reduction in cell number caused by ANP + ET-3, compared with ET-3 alone, which we described previously (22Levin E.R. Frank H.J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R453-R457PubMed Google Scholar). We then determined the effects of the neuropeptides on cyclin production. The expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E mRNA, as representative of two important G1 phase cyclins, was seen at low levels in both the basal state and in ANP-treated cells (Fig.2 A). ET-3 stimulated cyclin D1 mRNA by 8 h of incubation and maximally at 12 h, returning toward basal levels by 16 h. Cyclin E message was induced at 12–16 h (lanes 4 versus 12), coincident with this protein playing an important role in the later stages of G1. ANP significantly reversed the ET stimulation of either cyclin mRNA, indicating one mechanism by which ANP could exert anti-growth effects. At the protein level, the production of cyclins D1, D3, E, and A was stimulated by ET-3 compared with basal cell expression of these proteins (Fig. 2 B). For cyclin D1 and E, this occurred as early as 8 h, peaked at 12–16 h, and returned toward control levels by 24 h. The stimulation of cyclin E protein, earlier than mRNA, may indicate that the regulation of this protein occurs partly at a post-transcriptional level. Interestingly, cyclin D3production was somewhat delayed, relative to D1, and cyclin E protein was expressed earlier than cyclin A (the latter is felt to be more important for late G1-S or early S phase events). ANP significantly inhibited the ability of ET to stimulate production of each of these proteins under coincubation conditions. Therefore, at both the mRNA and protein synthesis levels, ET stimulated and ANP inhibited G1 cyclins, indicating mechanisms of growth promotion or restraint, respectively. Knowing the kinetics of cell cycle progression in this setting, we determined the time-dependent effects of ANP and ET on CKI mRNA and protein synthesis. Examining the mRNA for p16, p27, and p57, we found that ANP stimulated but ET inhibited this stimulation for each CKI, seen during the period of G1 and especially at 4–12 h (Fig. 3 A). ANP also induced an increase in the production of p16, p27, and p57 proteins (Fig.3 B). This was first seen at 12 h of incubation, corresponding to the mid-late G1 phase in the astrocytes, and was maximal at this time but persisted at 16 h. Consistent with the passage of cells through G1 to S at 16–24 h, the production of the three CKI proteins then waned, returning to basal levels by 24 h. Interestingly, the growth factor, ET-3, inhibitedbasal CKI production at 12 and 16 h (compared with control) and also inhibited ANP-stimulated CKI substantially over this same time course. Thus, the anti-proliferation factor ANP stimulates CKI production as a potential mechanism to restrain passage through G1 to S phase. The mitogen ET could overcome these growth-inhibitory actions of ANP by inhibiting CKI synthesis. We then determined the effects of ET, ANP, or coincubation with both peptides on Cdk activity, directed against pRb (Fig. 4, upper panel). Over the 16-h period of mainly G1, basal Cdk activity was fairly stable (control). ANP caused a reduction in the basal activity of Cdk4 and Cdk6 by 8 h, persisting throughout the experiment. Cdk2 activity was inhibited, but at a later time (between 12 and 16 h). In contrast, ET stimulated all three kinase activities, beginning as early as 4 h and persisting throughout the G1 phase. ANP potently inhibited by as much as 80% the ability of ET to stimulate all three kinase activities against pRb, indicating a potential anti-growth effect of this peptide. Similar results were found in determining the regulation of kinase activity as directed against histone (data not shown). The protein levels of the kinases at 16 h, determined by [35S]methionine labeling, were not affected by any peptide treatment of the astrocytes (Fig. 4,lower panel). We next examined the alterations by ANP or ET of the interactions of the CKI proteins with the various Cdks (Fig. 5). This was done to support the idea that modulation of CKI·Cdk complexing is a potential mechanism to restrain astrocyte cell cycle progression. Individual CKI proteins were immunoprecipitated, followed by blotting of Cdk proteins. For Cdk4, we found that ANP increased the amount of p15 and p16 proteins specifically associated with this kinase, whereas ET inhibited these associations. We also found that ANP stimulated, but ET inhibited, total p15 protein synthesis, with time kinetics similar to the other CKI proteins (data not shown). Similarly, the association of p27 with Cdk2 was promoted by ANP and inhibited by ET. These effects of ANP could reflect the general ability of this peptide to stimulate CKI production, but this is also seen specifically in the relevant Cdk-associated faction. In fact, the amount of the CKI protein associated with the Cdks in the setting of ANP was only approximately 10% the total CKI protein produced during incubation of astrocytes with the anti-mitogen, determined by protein quantification. We speculate that the augmented CKI notassociated with the Cdk proteins has additional functions in restraining growth. We also found that ANP does not increase the amount of p57 that associates with Cdk2 (Fig. 5). We then sought to understand whether ANP stimulation of any or all of the CKI is critical to growth restraint induced by this peptide. We incubated the glia with ET or ANP peptides plus antisense, or missense oligonucleotides for the p16, p27, and p57 proteins. We first validated the ability of each of the ASO constructs to inhibit only its specific corresponding CKI (Fig.6). We found that a specific CKI ASO caused a 60–80% reduction in the ability of ANP to stimulate the protein synthesis of only that CKI. A particular CKI ASO, for instance to p16, had no effect on the stimulation of other CKI proteins by ANP, indicating the specificity of action. Scrambled, missense ASO (MSO) had no effects on ANP-stimulated CKI protein synthesis (data not shown). We then carried out DNA synthesis studies. Nuclear thymidine incorporation in the glia was stimulated significantly by ET, whereas ANP inhibited this proliferation/S phase response by 47% (TableI). Incubation of the astrocytes with the two peptides plus an antisense oligonucleotide to p16 reversed the ANP inhibition of ET-stimulated DNA synthesis by 63 and 38%, at two concentrations. Independently, ASO to p27 or p57 also prevented the anti-growth effects of ANP, by 53 and 85%, respectively, again in dose-related fashion. MSO for the three CKI had no effect on the anti-growth properties of ANP. We also incubated the astrocytes with ET and ANP plus all combinations of two CKI ASO and found little additional effect compared with the maximal effect of the dominant CKI ASO. These data indicate that the progression of astrocytes into S phase, as stimulated by ET, is inhibited by ANP and that several CKI are crucial to this inhibitory effect.Table IDNA synthesis in astrocytes is stimulated by ET and the inhibition by ANP is dependent upon the synthesis of CKI proteinsNuclear thymidinecpm × 10−3Control4.4 ± 0.12ANP 100 nm4.1 ± 0.14ET-3 100 nm17.3 ± 0.861-ap < 0.05 for ET versuscontrol by analysis of variance and Schefe's test.ANP + ET-311.3 ± 0.751-bp < 0.05 for ET versus ET plus ANP (±MSO).ANP + ET-3 + p16ASO 0.5 μm15.1 ± 0.751-cp < 0.05 for ET + ANPversus ET + ANP + ASO.

We proposed that an important effect of ANP-stimulated CKI production would be to inhibit Cdk activity against pRb. We found that the ability of ANP to inhibit Cdk 4 activity at 16 h of incubation was reversed significantly by the ASO to p16, but not to p27 or p57 (Fig.7, upper panel, Cdk4,lanes 3–7). ET stimulated Cdk4 activity 3.5-fold, and this was inhibited 52% by ANP. This inhibition was reversed 80% by the ASO to p16 but not by the ASO for p27 and p57. This indicates the importance and selectivity of p16 to this restraining action on cell cycle progression induced by ANP. Missense constructs for these proteins had no reversal effects (lanes 11–13), and the Cdk proteins were unaffected by the experimental treatments (Fig. 7,lower panel). Similarly, the restraint of Cdk2 activity by ANP (55%) was reversed 85% by the ASO to p27 and not by the ASO to p57 or to p16 (Fig. 7, upper panel, Cdk2, lanes 3–7). These latter data identify p27 as being crucial to the inhibition of Cdk2 activity against pRb and support this as a mechanism by which ANP restrains G1-S progression. To support this mechanism further, we examined the effects of ET and ANP on the phosphorylation of the endogenous pRb via CKI. Compared with control, ET strongly stimulated the increased amount and phosphorylation of pRb (hence inactivated), whereas ANP inhibited this stimulation almost completely (Fig. 8). The ASO to p16 and p27, but not p57, reversed this inhibition of pRb phosphorylation by 78 and 63%, respectively. These results affirm the targeting of endogenous pRb phosphorylation by ET and ANP as a mechanism for the promotion or restraint of G1-S progression in these cells, mediated significantly through CKI. A diagram of these interactions is shown in Fig. 9.Figure 9Model of ANP-induced inhibition of G1-S progression in astrocytes.

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the fragment consisting of amino acids (aa) 1–281 of MAP1a did not bind while the fragment consisting of aa 1–630 did, indicating that the region of MAP1a between aa 281 and 630 contains a microtubule-binding domain. Deletion of the basic repeats from aa 336–540 did not result in loss of microtubule binding, suggesting that the regions flanking the basic repeats can bind MAP1a to microtubules. These observations were confirmed using an in vitro microtubule binding assay. The levels of acetylation and detyrosination of polymerized microtubules were assessed by quantitative dot blotting in cells expressing MAP1a fragments or MAP2c. Compared with untransfected cells, the polymerized tubulin in cells expressing full-length MAP1a was more acetylated and detyrosinated, but these increases were smaller than those seen in cells expressing MAP2c. Consistent with this, the microtubules in MAP2c expressing cells were more resistant to colchicine than those in cells overexpressing MAP1a. These data implicate aa 281–336 and/or 540–630 of MAP1a in microtubule binding and suggest that MAP1a is less able to stabilize microtubules than MAP2c.

In neurons, microtubules become increasingly resistant to microtubule depolymerizing drugs (1Black M.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and less dynamic (2Lim S. Sammak P.J. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with time of differentiation. This increasing stability of microtubules is believed to be necessary for neuronal morphogenesis. One of the mechanisms for increasing microtubule stability is the interaction of microtubules with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; aa, amino acid; EC, embryonal carcinoma; MAB, microtubule assembly buffer; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; BES, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 6myc, six repeats of 9-amino acid epitope from human c-MYC. MAP1a and MAP1b are structurally related MAPs which may play complementary roles in regulating microtubule dynamics during neuronal development (3Garner C.C. Garner A. Huner G. Kozak C. Matus A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of MAP1b expression in cultured neurons using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides leads to the loss of neurite outgrowth (5Brugg B. Reddy D. Matus A. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analyses of MAP1b knockout transgenic mice have demonstrated that MAP1b is involved in normal neuronal development (6Edelmann W. Zervas M. Costello P. Roback L. Fischer I. Hammarback J.A. Cowan N. Davies P. Wainer B. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,7Takei Y. Kondo S. Harada A. Inomata S. Noda T. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In adult brain, MAP1b remains only in regions where growth and plasticity still occur (8Sato-Yoshitake R. Shiomura Y. Miyasaka H. Hirokawa N. Neuron. 1989; 3: 229-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Viereck C. Tucker R.P. Matus A. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3547-3557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting it also plays a role in neuronal growth in the adult. The function of MAP1a is less clear. The pattern of MAP1a expression in developing brain suggests that it plays a role in regulating the stability of the neuronal cytoskeleton and, consequently, in the transition of growing neurons to the mature, static state (3Garner C.C. Garner A. Huner G. Kozak C. Matus A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of MAP1b contains a domain consisting of 21 repeats of a KKE motif that has been shown to bind microtubules in vitro (10Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). MAP1b which has the basic repeat domain removed still binds microtubules, but when the regions flanking both sides of the basic repeat domain are also removed, microtubule binding is lost (10Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the microtubule-binding domain of MAP1b consists of two separate regions. The amino terminus of MAP1a also contains a domain consisting of 11 repeats of the KKE motif. The regions flanking this domain are very similar to those in MAP1b (4Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting these regions are involved in microtubule binding. In this study, we have characterized a microtubule-binding domain of MAP1a by expressing several different 6-myc-tagged fragments of MAP1a in undifferentiated P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and in HeLa cells. The effects of MAP1a and MAP2c on microtubule dynamics were assessed by measuring the acetylation, detyrosination, and resistance to colchicine-induced depolymerization. Our results show that MAP1a contains a microtubule-binding domain similar to that of MAP1b and that MAP1a increases microtubule stability, but to a lesser extent than MAP2c. Three overlapping cDNA clones spanning the entire mRNA for MAP1a (4Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to make all expression constructs (see Fig.1). pKJ1ΔF-6myc and pPOP (a gift from Dr. M. McBurney, University of Ottawa) are pUC19-based vectors containing the constitutively active mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. PKJ1ΔF-6myc drives the expression of 6 repeats of a 9-amino acid (aa) epitope from the human c-MYC protein. These vectors were used to express MAP1a fragments epitope tagged at the N terminus. When necessary sequencing was performed to ensure that all MAP1a fragments were expressed in-frame with the 6myc tag, confirm ligations, and determine the location of in-frame stop codons in the cDNA. All sequencing reactions were performed using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (with Amplitaq DNA polymerase, FS) (Perkin-Elmer). All reactions were run on a ABI model 373A automated sequencer. PGK-MAP2cmyc was constructed by C. Addison in our laboratory. This is the unmodified pKJ1ΔF-6myc vector. It expresses the 6myc tag followed by a 25-aa tail (NSCSPGDPLVL-ERPPPRYSSDPCRN). A NcoI-HindIII fragment from clone p19a was blunt-end ligated intoSmaI-SacI cut pKJ1ΔF-6myc. This vector expresses the 6myc tag followed by 5-aa (NSCSP), followed by aa 1–281 from MAP1a terminating with a 6-aa tail (TDPCRN). A NcoI-ApaI fragment from clone p19a was blunt-end ligated intoSmaI-SacI cut pKJ1ΔF-6myc. This vector expresses the 6myc tag, the NSCSP linker, aa 1–630 of MAP1a followed by a 6-aa tail (ADPCRN). A partial NcoI-BamHI fragment (7800 bp) from PGK-6mycN1a-4 (see below) was blunt-ended and religated. The expressed protein contains the 6myc tag, a 7-aa linker (NSREFLH), aa 1–1310 of MAP1a, and a 2-aa tail (IL). A ClaI-BamHI fragment from PGK-6myc1a (see below) was blunt-end ligated intoSmaI cut pPOP. The expressed protein contains the 6myc tag, a 7-aa linker (NSREFLH), aa 1–2016 of MAP1a, and a 14-aa tail (RGSSRVDLQLFMIY). A NcoI-EcoRI fragment from clone p19a was blunt-end ligated intoSmaI-HindIII cut pKJ1ΔF-6myc. A partialApaI fragment (1959 bp) from clone p14 was then ligated into this vector at the ApaI site. Into this vector a 6070-bpEcoRI-EcoRV fragment from clone p19 was blunt-end ligated into the Eco site. Finally a short oligonucleotide containing a SmaI site (5′-AATTCCCGGG-3′, New England Biolabs) was inserted into theEcoRI site between the 6myc tag and the MAP1a cDNA to bring the cDNA for MAP1a in-frame with the 6myc tag. The expressed protein contains the 6myc tag, a 7-aa linker (NSREFLH), and the full-length cDNA for MAP1a. The predicted molecular weight for the tagged protein is based on the predicted molecular weight for the MAP1a heavy chain as reported in Ref. 4Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. PGK-6myc1a was digested withXhoI and HaeII to yield two fragments (1514 and 1223 bp). A 1357-bp fragment was PCR amplified from the 1514-bp fragment using primers PCR1 (5′-CGACGGTATCGATAAGCTATG-3′) and PCR2 (5′-GGCCAGCTTGCTCACTGCTGT-3′). A 279-bp fragment was PCR amplified from the 1223-bp fragment using primers PCR3 (5′-GAGAGAGGTTTGCTGGCTGAA-3′) and PCR4 (5′-GTCGGGCCCAGCTCTGCTTCTCTC-3′). The 1357- and 279-bp PCR products were ligated and then further cut with ClaI andApaI. This fragment was ligated intoClaI-ApaI cut pKJ1ΔF-6myc. Both strands of the entire PCR product were then completely sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the PCR reaction and to check the joint between the two PCR products. The expressed protein contains the 6myc tag, a 7-aa linker (NSREFLH), aa 1–335 and 541–631 of MAP1a followed by a 29-aa tail (GGSTSSRAAATAVENLIPYRENMYLGRLR). P19 EC cells (11McBurney M.W. Rogers B.J. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and HeLa CCL-2 cells (ATCC) were kept semiconfluent in α-modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Flow Labs), and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and passed every 2 days. Taxol (obtained from the National Cancer Institute) was kept as a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide at −20 °C. This stock was then diluted to 10−6m in medium to treat cell cultures for 24 h. Colchicine (Sigma) was kept as a 1 mg/ml stock in dH2O and diluted to 1 μg/ml to treat cells. Expression vectors were introduced into P19 EC and HeLa cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (12Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). For protein extraction, cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes (Corning) at 1.25 × 105 cells/dish (P19 EC) or 2 × 105cells/dish (HeLa) in 5 ml of medium (see above). For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were plated onto 18-mm round coverslips (Corning) at 1.25 × 104 cells/coverslip (P19 EC) or 2 × 104 cells/coverslip (HeLa) in 1 ml of medium. Cells were allowed to settle for 24 h. 40 μg of DNA in 500 μl of 0.25m CaCl2 was then gently mixed with 500 μl of 2 × BES buffer (50 mm BES, pH 6.86, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4) to a final volume of 1 ml and allowed to sit for 20 min. The solution of calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate was then gently added to the cells (1 ml for dishes, 200 μl for coverslips) without removing the medium and allowed to sit for 8 h in the incubator. The DNA/media solution was then aspirated and replaced with fresh medium. Cells were incubated a further 48 h before processing. Anti-MAP1a mouse monoclonal IgG (clone 1A-1, a gift from Dr. R. Vallee, Ref. 13Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:1000 for Western blotting and 1:500 for immunofluorescence microscopy. Anti-α-tubulin rat monoclonal IgG (clone YOL 1/34, from Serotech) was diluted 1:15 for immunofluorescence microscopy. Anti-c-MYC mouse monoclonal IgG (clone 9E10, a gift from Dr. C. Garner) was used at 1:2 for Western blotting and quantitative dot blotting and undiluted for immunofluorescence microscopy. Anti-acetylated α-tubulin monoclonal IgG (clone 6–11B-1 (Sigma)) was diluted 1:1000 for quantitative dot blotting. Polyclonal anti-detyrosinated α-tubulin (anti-E, Ref. 14Xiang H. MacRae T.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 71: 673-685Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. T. MacRae and diluted 1:250 for quantitative dot blotting. Cells plated on glass coverslips were briefly rinsed in PEM (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, all from Sigma) and fixed at room temperature by two different protocols. 1 h incubation in Zamboni's fixative (14% picric acid (Fisher), 4% paraformaldehyde (J. B. EM Services Inc.) in 0.5 m Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.1) followed by a 3 × 5-min phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 130 mmNaCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) wash and 5-min extraction with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Pierce) in PBS. 2-min pre-extraction with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PEM (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 10 mmEGTA, 5 mm MgSO4) followed by a 10-min fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde (BDH), 0.25% glutaraldehyde (J. B. EM Services Inc.), and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PEM, followed by a 3 × 5-min PEM wash and quenching 3 × 5 min with 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride (BDH) in PBS. Cells prepared by either fixation procedure were again rinsed 3 × 5 min in PBS. All antibody incubations were for 1 h in PBS at room temperature with 3 × 5-min PBS washes after each incubation. Secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rat IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate, cross-adsorbed to mouse, diluted 1:150 (Sigma) and donkey anti-mouse IgG carboindocyanine, cross-adsorbed to rat, diluted 1:500 (Jackson). For all labeling, sequential primary and secondary incubations were used. Samples were visualized using either a Leica Upright Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope or a Zeiss Universal epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Hammatsu integrating CCD and Metamorph v2.75 (Universal Imaging). Data was recorded electronically using the tagged image file format with a resolution of 512 lines × 512 columns × 256 gray levels. Confocal image stacks were processed using the simulated fluorescence algorithm which projects highlights and shadows on the image stack, emphasizing depth cues. All images were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop v4.01 (Adobe) and Powerpoint 97 (Microsoft). Whole cell protein for Western blotting was extracted from 100-mm dishes according to Ref. 17Drubin D.G. Feintstein S.C. Shooter E.M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1799-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, but using higher concentrations of protease inhibitors in the extraction buffer: 40 μmbenzamidine HCl (Sigma), 4 mm p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride (Centrichem Inc.), 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma), 40 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin (all from Sigma). To obtain extracts for the in vitro assembly assay, cells were rinsed briefly in cold MAB1 (0.1 m MES, pH 6.4, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, Ref. 18Pedrotti B. Soffientini A. Islam K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and then 250–500 μl of extraction buffer (MAB1 + 4 mm PEFA, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 40 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) was added. Cells were immediately scraped into an Eppendorf and sonicated 15 s at 94 watts with a Braun sonicator, then immediately spun for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored at −80 °C. To prepare extracts for analysis of α-tubulin modifications, cells were processed according to Ref. 19Laferriére N.B. Brown D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using BSA (Pierce) as a standard. Parts of this procedure (see Fig.2) were derived from the taxol-dependent purification of MAPs described in Ref. 20Vallee R.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in MAB2 (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4m glycerol, and 0.1 mm GTP) was brought to 1.8 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol, assembled for 30 min and 37 °C, and then spun 15 min at 36,000 × g and 37 °C (18,000 rpm using a Sorval SS-20 rotor). The pellet was gently resuspended using a 1-ml pipetter in the same volume of MAB2 (+400 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm GTP, and 20 μmtaxol). The suspension was then spun for 15 min at 36,000 ×g and 37 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in the same buffer and spun through a 15% sucrose cushion in MAB2 (+ 1.8 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol) for 15 min at 36,000 × g and 37 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in MAB1 + 1.8 mm GTP and 20 μmtaxol, and spun for 15 min at 36,000 × g and 37 °C. The pellet was then gently resuspended in MAB1 as above and to this suspension an equal volume of protein from transfected P19 EC cells was added, brought to 1.8 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol, and incubated for 15 min and 37 °C. The suspension was then spun 15 min at 36,000 × g and 37 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in MAB1 (+1.8 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol) and spun through a 15% sucrose cushion in MAB1 (+1.8 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol) for 15 min at 36,000 × g and 37 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in MAB1 (+1.8 mm GTP and 20 μmtaxol). Samples were taken throughout the procedure to determine the presence or absence of MAP1a and tubulin by Western blotting. Volumes used to resuspend pellets were adjusted throughout the procedure to account for loss of volume due to sampling. Samples were processed for negative staining transmission electron microscopy from the first assembly step and after each spin through sucrose to ensure that microtubules remained polymerized. Samples were fixed 1 min at 37 °C in a equal volume of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in MAB1 or MAB2, depending when the sample was taken). 5 μl of the sample was allowed to settle onto parlodion-coated 400 mesh copper grids (J. B. EM Services Inc.) for 1 min. Grids were then washed with 5 drops of Photoflo solution (2 drops of Photoflo (Kodak) in 100 ml of ddH2O), followed by 5 drops of ddH2O and then stained with 4 drops of 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were then examined using a Philips 201 transmission electron microscope. Images were recorded on KODAK Electron Image Film SO-163 and printed on Ilford multigrade III paper. Equal amounts of protein in sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) were placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels and separated using the Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose in 20% methanol and the blots were rinsed in PBS. Immunodetection of Western blots was performed as follows: block for 1 h in 5% skim milk in PBS, 1 h incubation in primary antibody diluted in 2% skim milk in PBS, 1 h incubation in biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector) diluted 1:1000 in 2% skim milk in PBS, and 1 h of incubation in biotinylated streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) diluted 1:5000 in PBS. A 3 × 5-min PBS wash was done between all antibody incubations (with 2% milk added between the primary and secondary). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham) using Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham). All steps were performed at room temperature. Protein samples were diluted in PBS and 200 μl/well was passed through nitrocellulose in a 96-well Minifold apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) which had been pre-wetted with 200 μl/well of PBS. After the entire sample had been passed through the nitrocellulose by a gentle vacuum, an additional 400 μl of PBS/well was passed through the nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was then removed from the apparatus, rinsed briefly in PBS, and then fixed for 10 min in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) MeOH). The blot was then re-equilibrated in PBS and processed as for Western blotting. The resulting films were scanned at 200 dpi with an 8 bit dynamic range using a Hewlett-Packard 4c scanner. The chemiluminescent signal from each dot in the digitized image was quantified using SigmaGel v1.0 (Jandel Scientific). These values were then imported into Excel 97 (Microsoft) and Sigmaplot v4.0 (Jandel Scientific) for analysis. Standard curves for all antibodies were established with bovine brain extract to ensure that signals fell within the linear response of the antibody used. All MAP1a fragments used in this study are presented in Fig. 1. To ensure that all fragments were being expressed correctly, they were analyzed by Western blotting using mAb 9E10 to detect 6myc-tagged proteins. In P19 EC (Fig. 3 a, arrows) and HeLa (Fig. 3 b, arrows) cells all of the fragments displayed mobilities within 5–10 kDa of their predicted molecular masses, except for PGK-6myc1a, which had an apparent mobility of ~360 kDa (compared with(its predicted size of 312 kDa). However, this is not unexpected since endogenous MAP1a migrates at ~350 kDa and has a predicted molecular mass of 299 kDa (4Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of individual fragments decreased as the size of the fragments increased. The bands seen in all lanes (P19 and HeLa cells) at 118 and 70 kDa are nonspecific gel artifacts that we have observed with a variety of monoclonal antibodies. In HeLa cell extracts the endogenous human c-MYC was detected by the 9E10 antibody (see Fig. 3 b, *). Additional bands present between 60 and 30 kDa are degradation products from exogenously expressed MAP1a fragments. To see if any of the expressed fragments could be detected with mAb 1A-1, Western blots from transfected P19 EC were probed with mAb 9E10 (Fig.4 a) and mAb 1A-1 (Fig.4 b). In all lanes probed with mAb 1A-1, the endogenous MAP1a could be detected. A second band detected in the extract from PGK-6mycN1a-4 transfected cells displayed mobility identical to the MAP1a fragment present. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect MAP1a in P19 EC and HeLa cells expressing 6myc1a. In all P19 EC cells, a weak diffuse staining was seen (Fig.5 a′) which represents the normal staining pattern of endogenous MAP1a in undifferentiated cells. In P19 EC cells expressing 6myc1a, there was an increase in the signal compared with untransfected cells and microtubule colocalization was easily seen (Fig. 5 a′). In HeLa cells no MAP1a was detected, except in 6myc1a-transfected cells in which MAP1a colocalized with microtubules (Fig. 5 b′). This shows that the full-length MAP1a was expressed in-frame. To determine which fragments of MAP1a bound to microtubules, transfected P19 EC and HeLa cells were observed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed by precipitation so that expression of 6myc-tagged MAP1a fragments could be monitored even if they did not bind microtubules. The extraction/fixation method was used to determine if a particular fragment was bound to microtubules. Cells expressing 6myc prepared by precipitation fixation showed a diffuse 6myc staining in the cytoplasm (Fig.6, a′ and e′). The microtubules in transfected cells showed a normal cytoplasmic interphase organization that appeared identical to that of the untransfected cells in the population (Fig. 6, a ande). Extraction/fixation of cells expressing 6myc showed no 6myc labeling (Fig. 6, b′ and f′). Similar results were obtained for cells expressing 6mycN1a-1 (data not shown) showing that the tagged protein did not remain bound to microtubules. Microtubule organization was unaffected in cells expressing 6mycN1a-2 (Fig. 6, c and g) prepared by precipitation fixation and this fragment showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining, similar to 6myc and 6mycN1a-1 (Fig. 6, c′ and g′). However, extraction/fixation of 6mycN1a-2 expressing cells showed the 6myc tag colocalized with microtubules (Fig. 6, d,d′, h, and h′). Similar results were obtained for cells expressing 6mycN1a-3, 6mycN1a-4, 6myc1a, and 6mycN1a-2ΔBR (data not shown) showing that all of these fragments bound to microtubules and that the microtubule distribution was unchanged compared with untransfected cells. These results are summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of MAP1a fragment transfection experimentsMAP1a fragmentP19 EC cellsHeLa cellsBinds in vitroPresent in cytoplasmMicrotubule colocalizationPresent in cytoplasmMicrotubule colocalization6mycYesNoYesNoNo6mycN1a-1YesNoYesNoNo6mycN1a-2YesYesYesYesYes6mycN1a-3YesYesYesYesYes6mycN1a-4YesYesYesYesND1-aND, not determined.6myc1aYesYesYesYesND6mycN1a-2ΔBRYesYesYesYesYes1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In a few P19 EC cells expressing high levels of the 6myc1a, as judged by the intensity of 6myc labeling, process outgrowth was observed (Fig.7). No process outgrowth was observed in transfected HeLa cells with any of the fragments of MAP1a. We have previously shown that taxol treatment enhances the detection of low levels of microtubule-bound MAP1a in undifferentiated P19 EC cells by concentrating the microtubule-bound protein (24Vaillant A.R. Brown D.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To see if the lack of detection of the 6myc tag and 6mycN1a-1 was due to low levels of fragments present after extraction/fixation, transfected P19 EC cells were treated with taxol to induce microtubule bundles. The microtubules in taxol-treated cells were arrayed in thick bundles running through the cytoplasm (Fig. 8,a and b). Microtubule association of 6myc (Fig.8 a′) or 6mycN1a-1 (data not shown) after extraction/fixation of taxol-treated, transfected cells was never observed. As expected, extraction/fixation of cells expressing 6mycN1a-2 showed MYC labeling which colocalized with the microtubule bundles present (Fig. 8,b and b′). Similar results were obtained for 6mycN1a-3, 6mycN1a-4, 6myc1a, and 6mycN1a-2ΔBR (data not shown). To confirm the microscopic analysis of MAP fragment binding, an assay was devised to test the binding of MAP fragments to assembled microtubules in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). Immunoblot analysis indicated that tubulin was present throughout the procedure (Fig. 9 a) and electron microscopy showed this tubulin was assembled into microtubules (Fig. 9,c, d, and e). MAP1a, although at very high levels after the first assembly step (Fig. 9 b, lane 1), was mostly removed by the salt washes (Fig. 9 b, lanes 2–7). Some MAP1a still remained bound to microtubules at the end of the procedure. 6myc and 6mycN1a-1 were absent from microtubules following the final sucrose wash while 6mycN1a-2, 6mycN1a-3, and 6mycN1a-2ΔBR were bound (Fig. 10, lane 14in all gels). To control for the effects of any cellular proteins normally present, equal volumes of P19 extract were loaded, regardless of the level of exogenous MAP1a fragments present. As 6mycN1a-2ΔBR was expressed at a much higher level than any of the other fragments, a much higher amount of 6mycN1a-2ΔBR was added to the microtubules. The 6mycN1a-2ΔBR in the supernatant (fraction 11) reflects excess 6mycN1a-2ΔBR left over after saturation of available binding sites on microtubules. 6mycN1a-4 and 6mycN1a were not analyzed due to the very low levels of tagged protein available from culture extracts. As stated above, bands seen at 118 and 70 kDa result from nonspecific gel artifacts. These results are summarized in Table I. Transfected P19 EC cells were treated with colchicine to ensure that the pattern of 6myc labeling in cells prepared by extraction/fixation was really due to microtubule association and also to see if the colchicine resistance of microtubules was altered by any of the MAP1a fragments. As a positive control, MAP2c was expressed in P19 EC cells (using PGK-MAP2cmyc, provided by C. Addison). MAP2c is a juvenile form of MAP2 and, like high molecular weight MAP2, can bundle microtubules and render them resistant to drug-induced depolymerization (25Weissharr B. Doll T. Matus A. Development. 1992; 161: 1151-1161Google Scholar). MAP2cmyc expressing cells showed the presence of thick bund"

The graphite has large D and 15 N excesses (δD ∼ 1500 per mil and δ 15 N ∼ 1300 per mil) with two isotopically distinct signatures: N rich with a high D/H ratio and N poor with a high 15 N/ 14 N ratio. These excesses are the largest D and 15 N excesses observed in situ in a well-characterized phase in a meteorite. The isotopic characteristics are suggestive of an interstellar origin, probably by ion-molecule reactions at low temperature in the interstellar molecular cloud from which the solar system formed. The structure and nonchondritic composition of the metal particles suggest they did not form under equilibrium conditions in the solar nebula."
https://openalex.org/W2045629142,"Motor activity blocks the extrasynaptic expression of many genes in skeletal muscle, including those encoding ion channels, receptors, and adhesion molecules. Denervation reinduces transcription throughout the multinucleated myofiber, restoring the developmental pattern of expression, especially of the genes coding for the acetylcholine receptor. A screen for trans-acting factors binding to the enhancer region of the α-subunit gene of the acetylcholine receptor identified CTF4, a ubiquitously expressed and alternatively spliced chicken homologue of the human E protein transcription factor HTF4/HEB. Expression of the CTF4 locus closely parallels that of myogenin and acetylcholine receptor during development and maturation of skeletal muscle, but transcription is not similarly regulated by neuronal cues.

Direct injection of a myogenin, but not a MyoD, antisense expression vector into denervated skeletal muscle caused a significant decrease in the transcriptional activation of a depolarization-sensitive reporter gene.

Vertebrate skeletal muscle development proceeds by fusion of undifferentiated mononucleated myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers, with a concomitant activation of muscle-specific genes. Although much is known about the cis-elements and thetrans-acting factors that confer muscle-specific gene expression in an in vitro cell culture system, the mechanisms responsible for the modulation of the more complex patterns of gene expression present within the myofibers found in muscle have remained elusive. Many of the activated muscle genes, especially those coding for the contractile apparatus and metabolic pathways, are expressed in all nuclei of every myofiber, whereas others are activated in only a subset of fibers or even a fraction of the nuclei within a single cell, or are restricted to a particular developmental period. Upon innervation and maturation of the myofiber, expression of proteins required for the formation of the neuromuscular junction and the myotendinous junction becomes restricted; thus, subsynaptic nuclei are stimulated by a trophic factor released from the nerve terminal to express acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HLH, helix-loop-helix; LH, loop-helix; MDF, myogenic determination factor; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). genes, counteracting the ongoing electromechanical activity which eliminates the AChR from extrajunctional regions (1Jennings C.G.B. Burden S.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 75-81Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Duclert A. Changeux J.-P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Like many skeletal muscle-specific genes, the genes coding for the subunits of the AChR contain E boxes in their regulatory regions that myogenic factors recognize and activate in heterologous expression systems. E boxes are cis-regulatory elements that contain the sequence CANNTG and are found in the enhancers of many developmentally regulated genes from a diverse array of tissues (3Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). E boxes have been implicated in the dramatic stimulation of receptor gene transcription that is seen during myogenesis in vivo andin vitro and may also play a role in denervation supersensitivity, i.e. receptor gene activation resulting from denervation of the adult muscle fiber (4Dutton E.K.

Similarly, they have been found in the promoters of human (8Salminen A. Braun T. Buchberger A. Jürs S. Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), mouse (9Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.-C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and chicken (10Malik S. Huang C.-F. Schmidt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) myogenin which are likewise responsive to electrical membrane activity. Denervation does not trigger up-regulation of other genes such as the muscle creatine kinase and myosin light chain 1f/3f genes, both of which clearly contain E boxes as crucial control elements in their regulatory regions (11Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Wentworth B.M. Donoghue M. Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The context of an E box, i.e.its flanking regions and the trans-acting factors bound to them, may govern whether a particular E box-containing gene will respond to denervation. The helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif in the eponymous super-family of transcription factors is a conserved structure that mediates homo- and hetero-dimerization (13Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar); members of this protein family play an important role in differentiation. In basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins the HLH motif is immediately preceded by a region rich in basic amino acids that is responsible for site-specific DNA binding to E boxes. The E proteins form one important family of bHLH transcription factors that bind such cis-regulatory elements. Three vertebrate loci have been reported: E2A/PAN/SEF2 (13Murre C. McCaw P.S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). E proteins are widely expressed throughout the organism and are involved in the differentiation of many tissues, including the central nervous system, skin, heart, and skeletal muscle; their dimerization with members of another bHLH family, the myogenic determination factors (MDFs), results in the transactivation of a wide array of muscle-specific genes. Each of the primary transcripts arising from the three E protein loci is alternatively spliced to give rise to multiple isoforms with distinct differences in DNA binding and dimerization domains, nuclear localization signals, and consensus sites for phosphorylation. This also holds for CTF4. As in the case of its rat homologue REB (20Klein E.S. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)/SCBP (21Lin H.H. Li W.-Y. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10214-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alternative splicing of the primary transcript produces two gene products, one with 24 amino acids inserted in the middle of the LH domain, a well conserved transcription-activation motif unique to E proteins (22Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The transcripts encoding the two proteins exhibit characteristic spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as subtle differences in their gene activation capabilities. CTF4 was originally identified by its ability to recognize a potent enhancer in the AChR α-subunit promoter, prompting us to investigate its potential role in AChR gene regulation, both during muscle cell differentiation and the subsequent innervation-induced restriction of receptor expression to the neuromuscular junction. Myogenin, one of the four MDFs, is itself regulated by innervation and the innervation-dependent electrical activity of the sarcolemma (reviewed in Ref. 23Neville C. Rosenthal N. Goodbourne S. Eukaryotic Gene Transcription. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 192-233Google Scholar), and therefore a potential participant in the regulation of AChR subunit genes. Whether myogenin exclusively or preferentially interacts with a specific E protein partner when activating AChR gene expression is not known. The differences in depolarization sensitivity of E boxes in muscle-specific promoters may be a result of specific target preferences among bHLH proteins; individual factors and factor combinations have been shown to select specific sequences (3Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 25Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible participation of CTF4 in the up-regulation of AChR genes in denervated muscle, we combined an antisense strategy with the technique of intramuscular plasmid injection. Here we presentin vivo antisense suppression results, and show that myogenin and to a lesser extent CTF4 contribute to the denervation-triggered activation of AChR expression in skeletal muscle. White Leghorn cockerels (Hall's Brothers Hatchery, North Brookfield, MA), were anesthetized 3–4 days after hatching with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50–100 mg/kg), and section of the sciatic nerve was performed unilaterally as described previously (26Shieh B.-H. Ballivet M. Schmidt J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At the desired time after denervation, animals were sacrificed; the shank muscles of the operated and control legs were isolated and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, then processed for the preparation of muscle extracts; nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The effects of electrical stimulation were measured 6–7 days after denervation; the denervated leg musculature was stimulated in 100-Hz trains, 2-s duration, applied once every min. Plasmid injection was carried out as described by Wolff et al. (28Wolff J.A. Malone R.W. Williams P. Chong W. Acsadi G. Jani A. Felgner P.L. Science. 1990; 247: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3289) Google Scholar). The AChR α-subunit regulatory region drives expression of reporter enzymes following AChR induction by nerve section; thus, the denervation-induced expression of pα2kbLuc resembles that of the endogenous AChR subunit genes. Reporter plasmids were injected 24 h prior to denervation. Three days after denervation, when luciferase is maximally expressed, animals were sacrificed, and muscle tissue frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and pulverized with pestle and mortar. Powdered specimens were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 1 h with frequent vortexing. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was assayed for enzyme activity. All animal experimentation followed protocols approved by the Stony Brook Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For chicken embryos, fertilized White Leghorn eggs were obtained from local hatcheries and incubated at 38 °C in a humidified incubator. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure of Chirgwin et al. (29Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and checked for integrity by electrophoresis. Messenger RNA levels were measured by ribonuclease protection assays essentially as described previously (30Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase assays followed established procedures (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 9.7.1Google Scholar). Expression vectors were constructed by cloning cDNAs for chicken MyoD (32Lin Z.-Y. Dechesne C.A. Eldridge J. Paterson B.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 986-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), myogenin (33Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the two isoforms of CTF4 into the plasmid pEMSVscribe (34Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding E12 was inserted into the vector pBKCMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To assess tissue and stage specificity of the expression of CTF4, a riboprobe synthesized from a 198-base template corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region was used for mRNA analysis. In order to determine the relative abundance of the two CTF4 transcripts in the same assay, another riboprobe template, covering the proximal α-β splice junction, was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primer was located 5′ to the splice donor site; the downstream primer was in the alternatively spliced region (Fig. 1). The resulting fragment is 203 bp in length, of which 171 are common to both forms. pSK+/α50, the plasmid used for generating the electrophoretic mobility assay probe, was constructed by cloning 50 bp of annealed synthetic oligonucleotides, containing the 36-bp α-subunit enhancer with its 2 E boxes (GGCGGCCCTCAGCTGTCATGCCTGGAACAGGTGGTG) (35Wang Y. Xu H.-P. Wang X.-M. Ballivet M. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and flanking BamHI linkers, into the SmaI site of Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Labeled probes, either 49 or 97 bp long, were generated by excision with BamHI or a combination ofHindIII and XbaI, respectively, followed by Klenow fill-in. An 83-bp fragment of the chick AChR δ upstream sequence (−207 to −125) which contains a single E box was cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pBR322. pα2kbCAT and pα2kbLuc contain ~2 kb of AChR α-subunit upstream region inserted into the pCAT-Basic and pGL2-Basic vectors (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. Plasmids for in vitro expression: pChMyoG/SK− contains 1.1 kb of full-length chicken myogenin cDNA, and pCTF4#10/SK−, 4.2 kb of CTF4 cDNA (clone no. 10), both inserted into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK− (Stratagene). pCMV-E12 encoding the chick E12 protein was obtained from Bruce Paterson. The crural musculature from an animal that had been denervated 3 days previously was removed from both ipsi- and contralateral limbs and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded sections, which were incubated with the CTF4-specific antibody 251, a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin, and finally the enzyme substrate Fast Red (Sigma). NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% supplemented calf serum) before transfection. Cells (1.5–3.0×105) were plated 2 days prior to transfection on 100-mm dishes and refed with growth medium 2 h prior to transfection. Transient transfections (10 μg of reporter plasmids, pα2kbCAT or pα2kbLuc, 10 μg of effector plasmids, and 2 μg of internal control plasmids, pRSVCAT or pRSVLuc) were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (35Wang Y. Xu H.-P. Wang X.-M. Ballivet M. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) except that medium was changed 12 h after introduction of DNA without glycerol shock. Twenty-four h after transfection, the medium was changed to serum-deficient medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% heat-inactivated horse serum). Three days after transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 7 s at 14,000 rpm, and the pellet resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the cell lysis mixture was spun again, and the supernatant assayed or stored at −70 °C. In vitrotranslation was performed using the TnT™ reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in 50 μl of buffer mixture containing 1 μg of DNA template, 25 μg of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 1 mm amino acid mixture minus methionine, 4 μl of [35S]methionine at 10 mCi/ml, 5 units of RNA polymerase, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) at 30° for 1 h. The 35S-labeled proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Chicken myogenin and CTF4 cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEX vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) encoding glutathione S-transferase. The induced fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads and used in binding studies and for the generation of polyclonal antibodies. Appropriate amounts of bacterial fusion proteins, in vitro translated factors, or tissue extracts were incubated with typically 10,000 cpm of the32P-labeled α-subunit enhancer probe in a total volume of 20 μl. The binding reactions contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 mmethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of yeast tRNA, and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 3.5–5% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 100 V for 1.5 h at room temperature. The gel and electrophoresis buffer contained 106 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For supershifts, 0.3 μl of anti-CTF4 or preimmune serum was added to these mixtures. The core enhancer sequence of the chicken AChR α-subunit gene contains two E boxes that are the primary elements responsible for mediating transcriptional control both during development and upon denervation (2Duclert A. Changeux J.-P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing four copies of the enhancer was used as a probe in an affinity screening protocol to isolate factors involved in neuron-regulated muscle gene transcription. Of the four DNAs isolated from an E10 whole chicken embryo λgt11 cDNA library, three encoded the E protein CTF4 (18Tsay H.-J. Choe Y.-H. Neville C.M. Schmidt J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20 (; Correction (1992) Nucleic Acids Res.20, 2624): 1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), a homologue of the human gene HTF4 (17Zhang Y. Babin J. Feldhaus A.J. Singh H. Sharp P.A. Bina M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)/HEB (19Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). All three CTF4 cDNAs contained a 72-bp region encoding a 24-residue peptide which is absent from the human protein. A search for additional chicken E protein isoforms was performed with degenerate oligonucleotide primers targeting regions conserved in all known vertebrate E proteins, in a polymerase chain reaction with muscle cDNA as template. Gel electrophoresis of the polymerase chain reaction product indicated two fragments which were subsequently cloned and sequenced. The longer fragment corresponds to the cDNA isolated by the affinity screening protocol above, while the shorter fragment is derived from an alternatively spliced mRNA encoding an otherwise identical polypeptide except for lacking the 24 amino acids found in the original CTF4 clones, but absent in HTF4/HEB (Fig. 1). As a similar splicing pattern has been seen in rat (see above), we have adopted the nomenclature proposed for REB (20Klein E.S. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and designated cDNAs encoding the shorter and longer proteins CTF4α and CTF4β, respectively. The 24-residue insertion interrupts the loop-helix (LH) motif transactivation domain contained by all other E proteins (22Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of theCTF4 gene was examined by ribonuclease protection assay, utilizing a probe that partly spans the alternatively spliced exon located within the transactivation domain (Fig. 1). During the development of the chicken embryo, CTF4 is continuously transcribed at high levels, but steady-state transcript levels drop considerably after embryonic day 12 (Fig. 2). The two splice variants are present at significant levels in the early developing embryo from the first time point examined, E5.5, with little overall change in the ratio of the two mature transcripts throughout development. The expression of the two CTF4 transcripts was then examined in several different tissues of E10 embryos. Both transcripts were found in all tissues assayed, but their concentration ratios vary by over an order of magnitude. Absolute levels of the CTF4 transcripts vary widely also, with high expressing tissues such as brain and muscle containing about ten times more than liver. The processed transcript lacking the alternatively spliced exon predominates in the majority of tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, bone marrow, gizzard, and in particular lung. Only in the brain is the long form more abundant; expression levels in the developing brain are higher than in any other embryonic tissue examined and remain moderately high, though fluctuating, throughout development. CTF4 transcripts are most abundant in the telencephalon and cerebellum of the neonate animal, but rare in the brain stem and optic lobe. The CNS also contains a minor band of about 180 nucleotides; this size is consistent with a CTF4 isoform containing the the three amino-terminal residues encoded by the alternatively spliced exon. Although this region contains a splice-donor consensus sequence, we were unable to demonstrate the existence of such a cDNA utilizing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). The AChR is expressed along the entire length of the muscle fiber surface during early stages of development. As the muscle matures, transcription of the genes encoding the AChR receptor becomes restricted to the newly formed neuromuscular junctions as a result of repression of gene activity in extrajunctional muscle nuclei (reviewed in Ref. 36Sanes, J., and Hall, Z. W. (1992) Cell/Neuron72/10, (suppl.) 99–121Google Scholar). In the crural muscles, restricted expression occurs during early fetal development (E13–15), resulting in significantly fewer receptor transcripts. Temporal expression patterns of the myogenic factors and CTF4 were measured in developing muscle. The down-regulation of the myogenic factors MyoD, myogenin, and myf5 (but not of herculin/MRF4) shortly after the shift to the fetal stage (E13) is accompanied by a drop in mRNAs encoding AChR α and δ subunits, 2H.-J. Tsay and Y.-S. Lee, unpublished results. and a decline in CTF4 transcripts (Fig. 3 A). Both the short and long CTF4 transcripts were present throughout the embryonic and early fetal period of muscle development. To determine if changes in transcript levels are accompanied by changes in protein concentrations, we performed supershift analysis. As is shown in Fig.3 C, CTF4-like immunoreactivity is abundant in the early embryo leg, but disappears toward the second week in ovo, accompanying a general decline in E box binding activity as measured with a probe derived from the AChR δ-subunit enhancer (Fig.3 B). These changes parallel, and possibly precede, the long known and pronounced reductions in AChR protein levels in the embryonic hind limb musculature (36Sanes, J., and Hall, Z. W. (1992) Cell/Neuron72/10, (suppl.) 99–121Google Scholar). AsCTF4 is developmentally expressed in the hind limb muscle in a pattern similar to the AChR α-subunit and the myogenic factors MyoD, myogenin, and myf5, we investigated whether these genes are all under similar mechanistic control. The myogenin gene in particular responds to the establishment and disruption of neuromuscular transmission (33Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Witzemann V. Sakmann B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 39Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. NeuroReport. 1991; 2: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The response of the CTF4 gene to denervation was therefore determined in the crural muscles of neonate chickens (Fig. 4, top panel). Whereas AChR α-subunit message levels increase 80-fold by day 3 postdenervation (37Wang G. Schmidt J. Brain Res. 1976; 114: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and myogenin mRNA rises by more than 200-fold (33Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), CTF4 transcript levels remain fairly constant (~2-fold increase), and CTF4 protein, as measured by supershift analysis, also increases only modestly over a 3-day period (data not shown), indicating that the motor neuron affects CTF4 gene expression relatively little. Similarly, whereas electrical stimulation of chronically denervated skeletal muscle causes an immediate decline in transcript levels for AChR α subunit and myogenin (33Neville C.M. Schmidt M. Schmidt J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), theCTF4 gene does not respond to the depolarization signal under these conditions (Fig. 4, bottom panel). This could result from an mRNA half-life that significantly exceeds the duration of the experiment or may indicate independence from neuronal signals. We next tested the ability of the two CTF4 isoforms to bind to the α50 probe which encompasses the α-subunit enhancer and its two E boxes (35Wang Y. Xu H.-P. Wang X.-M. Ballivet M. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both CTF4α and CTF4β are capable of binding the probe; for the longer isoform this result was expected, as it had originally been identified by a protocol selecting for single gene products. Two other E proteins, the E2A products E12 and E47, and the MDF myogenin were also examined for their binding activity. While E47 alone displayed binding activity, E12 failed to efficiently bind to α50 as a homodimer, presumably because of the inhibitory domain at the N-terminal which is absent in other E proteins (41Wolff J.A.
