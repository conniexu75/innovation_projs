https://openalex.org/W2083935149,"Rheological properties of the upper mantle of the Earth play an important role in the dynamics of the lithosphere and asthenosphere. However, such fundamental issues as the dominant mechanisms of flow have not been well resolved. A synthesis of laboratory studies and geophysical and geological observations shows that transitions between diffusion and dislocation creep likely occur in the Earth's upper mantle. The hot and shallow upper mantle flows by dislocation creep, whereas cold and shallow or deep upper mantle may flow by diffusion creep. When the stress increases, grain size is reduced and the upper mantle near the transition between these two regimes is weakened. Consequently, deformation is localized and the upper mantle is decoupled mechanically near these depths."
https://openalex.org/W2017250743,"40Ar/39Ar dating of sanidine from a bentonite interbedded in the Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina yielded a plateau age of 227.8 ± 0.3 million years ago. This middle Carnian age is a direct calibration of the Ischigualasto tetrapod assemblage, which includes some of the best known early dinosaurs. This age shifts last appearances of Ischigualasto taxa back into the middle Carnian, diminishing the magnitude of the proposed late Carnian tetrapod extinction event. By 228 million years ago, the major dinosaurian lineages were established, and theropods were already important constituents of the carnivorous tetrapod guild in the Ischigualasto—Villa Unión Basin. Dinosaurs as a whole remained minor components of tetrapod faunas for at least another 10 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2077411882,"Laser vaporization of graphite generates C(60)(+) cluster ions that are fullerenes and a mixture of roughly planar polycyclic polyyne ring isomers. Experimental studies of the annealing of the non-fullerene C(60)(+) ions indicate that they can be converted (in the gas phase) into the fullerene and an isomer that appears to be a large monocyclic ring. Some fragmentation is associated with conversion to the fullerene geometry, but the majority of the non-fullerene C(60)(+) isomers are cleanly converted into an intact fullerene. The emergence of the monocyclic ring (as the clusters are annealed) suggests that this is a relatively stable non-spheroidal form of these all carbon molecules. The estimated activation energies for the observed structural interconversions are relatively low, suggesting that these processes may play an important role in the synthesis of spheroidal fullerenes."
https://openalex.org/W2052207179,"The fabrication of improved ceramic-matrix composites will require a better understanding of processing variables and how they control the development of the composite microstructure. Noninvasive, high-resolution methods of x-ray tomography have been used to measure the growth of silicon carbide in a woven Nicalon-fiber composite during chemical vapor infiltration. The high spatial resolution allows one to measure the densification within individual fiber tows and to follow the closure of macroscopic pores in situ. The experiments provide a direct test of a recently proposed model that describes how the surface area available for matrix deposition changes during infiltration. The measurements indicate that this surface area is independent of the fiber architecture and location within the preform and is dominated by large-scale macroporosity during the final stages of composite consolidation. The measured surface areas are in good agreement with the theoretical model."
https://openalex.org/W2038495765,"A cantilever resonant microbeam, laser diodes, and a photodiode have been fabricated on the surface of a gallium arsenide substrate. The microbeam is excited photothermally by light from a laser diode. The vibration is detected with a photodiode as the variation in light output caused by the difference in optical length between the microbeam and another laser diode. A high carrier-to-noise ratio (45 decibels) is achieved with a short (3 micrometers) external cavity length. Such a small distance allows a lensless system, which increases the ease of fabrication. This work could lead to applications in which photomicrodynamic systems are monolithically integrated on a gallium arsenide substrate with surface micromachining technology."

https://openalex.org/W1995730797,Earth-based telescopic spectral imaging techniques were used to document the spatial distribution of crater materials within the large lunar crater Copernicus at the subkilometer scale on the basis of spectral ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared characteristics. The proposed spectral mixing analysis leads to a first-order mapping of the impact melt material within the crater. Olivine was detected not only within the three central peaks but also along a significant portion of the crater rim. Consideration of an olivine-bearing end-member in the mixing model emphasizes the overall morphological pattern of the rim and wall terraces in the associated fraction image. The identification of widely exposed olivine units supports the idea that the lower crust and possibly the lunar mantle itself are regionally at shallow depth.

https://openalex.org/W1989649034,"Swiss researchers have discovered a new superconducting material made of two distinct new compounds. The compounds are related to a previously reported compound of mercury, barium, copper, and oxygen, which superconducts at 94 K. Each unit of the multilayered crystal structure contained only one copper oxide layer. The new compounds have two and three layers, respectively, of copper oxide. The new material from these two compounds starts to superconduct at 133 K."

https://openalex.org/W2054397861,"Electric Doublet Theory of Gravitation.---It is suggested that gravitation may be an effect arising from fluctuations of the electric charges associated with the electrons and positive nuclei of atoms. It is assumed (1) that the ether contains an enormous number of electric doublets moving in all directions with the speed of light; (2) that each charged particle is continually both absorbing and emitting doublets at a rate proportional to its mass; and (3) that during the absorption and emission of each doublet the charge on the particle fluctuates. If these fluctuations exist, it is shown that the mean value of the force exerted by one charged particle on another includes, in addition to the ordinary electrostatic force, an attraction proportional to the product of the masses.Electric Doublet Theory of Radiation.---If we suppose that the doublets emitted by a particle possess available energy only when the energy of the particle changes, and that the effect of changing the energy is to produce periodic gaps in the emission of doublets with a frequency proportional to the amount of energy lost, we have a theory of radiation which is said to be compatible with the theories of Bohr, Planck and Einstein."
