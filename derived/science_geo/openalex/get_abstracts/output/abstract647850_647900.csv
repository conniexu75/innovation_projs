https://openalex.org/W3006033724,"Dysregulation of the immune response to bacterial infection can lead to sepsis, a condition with high mortality. Multiple whole-blood gene-expression studies have defined sepsis-associated molecular signatures, but have not resolved changes in transcriptional states of specific cell types. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile the blood of people with sepsis (n = 29) across three clinical cohorts with corresponding controls (n = 36). We profiled total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, 106,545 cells) and dendritic cells (19,806 cells) across all subjects and, on the basis of clustering of their gene-expression profiles, defined 16 immune-cell states. We identified a unique CD14+ monocyte state that is expanded in people with sepsis and validated its power in distinguishing these individuals from controls using public transcriptomic data from subjects with different disease etiologies and from multiple geographic locations (18 cohorts, n = 1,467 subjects). We identified a panel of surface markers for isolation and quantification of the monocyte state and characterized its epigenomic and functional phenotypes, and propose a model for its induction from human bone marrow. This study demonstrates the utility of single-cell genomics in discovering disease-associated cytologic signatures and provides insight into the cellular basis of immune dysregulation in bacterial sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3006261429,"Parkinson's disease is a synucleinopathy that is characterized by motor dysfunction, death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates. Evidence suggests that α-Syn aggregation can originate in peripheral tissues and progress to the brain via autonomic fibers. We tested this by inoculating the duodenal wall of mice with α-Syn preformed fibrils. Following inoculation, we observed gastrointestinal deficits and physiological changes to the enteric nervous system. Using the AAV-PHP.S capsid to target the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase for peripheral gene transfer, we found that α-Syn pathology is reduced due to the increased expression of this protein. Lastly, inoculation of α-Syn fibrils in aged mice, but not younger mice, resulted in progression of α-Syn histopathology to the midbrain and subsequent motor defects. Our results characterize peripheral synucleinopathy in prodromal Parkinson's disease and explore cellular mechanisms for the gut-to-brain progression of α-Syn pathology."

https://openalex.org/W3006474680,"The presence of active neurogenic niches in adult humans is controversial. We focused attention to the human olfactory neuroepithelium, an extracranial site supplying input to the olfactory bulbs of the brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analyzing 28,726 cells, we identified neural stem cell and neural progenitor cell pools and neurons. Additionally, we detailed the expression of 140 olfactory receptors. These data from the olfactory neuroepithelium niche provide evidence that neuron production may continue for decades in humans. Durante et al. report the presence of active neurogenic niches in adult humans using single-cell RNA sequencing of the human olfactory neuroepithelium. Data from the olfactory neuroepithelium niche provide evidence that neuron production may continue for decades in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3005609359,"Adjuvants are central to the efficacy of subunit vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, yet its adjuvanticity is often weak and mechanisms of triggering antibody responses remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that site-specific modification of immunogens with short peptides composed of repeating phosphoserine (pSer) residues enhances binding to alum and prolongs immunogen bioavailability. The pSer-modified immunogens formulated in alum elicited greatly increased germinal center, antibody, neutralizing antibody, memory and long-lived plasma cell responses compared to conventional alum-adsorbed immunogens. Mechanistically, pSer-immunogen:alum complexes form nanoparticles that traffic to lymph nodes and trigger B cell activation through multivalent and oriented antigen display. Direct uptake of antigen-decorated alum particles by B cells upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, further enhancing B cell activation. These data provide insights into mechanisms of action of alum and introduce a readily translatable approach to significantly improve humoral immunity to subunit vaccines using a clinical adjuvant."
https://openalex.org/W3006081887,"Recent reports have revealed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are heterogeneous. It remains unclear whether such heterogeneity reflects different subtypes of cells with distinct functions or instead reflects transiently acquired states of cells with the same function. By integrating lineage formation of individual OPC clones, single-cell transcriptomics, calcium imaging and neural activity manipulation, we show that OPCs in the zebrafish spinal cord can be divided into two functionally distinct groups. One subgroup forms elaborate networks of processes and exhibits a high degree of calcium signaling, but infrequently differentiates despite contact with permissive axons. Instead, these OPCs divide in an activity- and calcium-dependent manner to produce another subgroup, with higher process motility and less calcium signaling and that readily differentiates. Our data show that OPC subgroups are functionally diverse in their response to neurons and that activity regulates the proliferation of a subset of OPCs that is distinct from the cells that generate differentiated oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3006266099,"The involvement of host immunity in the gut microbiota-mediated colonization resistance to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is incompletely understood. Here, we show that interleukin (IL)-22, induced by colonization of the gut microbiota, is crucial for the prevention of CDI in human microbiota-associated (HMA) mice. IL-22 signaling in HMA mice regulated host glycosylation, which enabled the growth of succinate-consuming bacteria Phascolarctobacterium spp. within the gut microbiome. Phascolarctobacterium reduced the availability of luminal succinate, a crucial metabolite for the growth of C. difficile, and therefore prevented the growth of C. difficile. IL-22-mediated host N-glycosylation is likely impaired in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and renders UC-HMA mice more susceptible to CDI. Transplantation of healthy human-derived microbiota or Phascolarctobacterium reduced luminal succinate levels and restored colonization resistance in UC-HMA mice. IL-22-mediated host glycosylation thus fosters the growth of commensal bacteria that compete with C. difficile for the nutritional niche."
https://openalex.org/W3006079519,"Replacement of regular salt with potassium-enriched substitutes reduces blood pressure in controlled situations, mainly among people with hypertension. We report on a population-wide implementation of this strategy in a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (NCT01960972). The regular salt in enrolled households was retrieved and replaced, free of charge, with a combination of 75% NaCl and 25% KCl. A total of 2,376 participants were enrolled in 6 villages in Tumbes, Peru. The fully adjusted intention-to-treat analysis showed an average reduction of 1.29 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (95% CI) (-2.17, -0.41)) in systolic and 0.76 mm Hg (95% CI (-1.39, -0.13)) in diastolic blood pressure. Among participants without hypertension at baseline, in the time- and cluster-adjusted model, the use of the salt substitute was associated with a 51% (95% CI (29%, 66%)) reduced risk of developing hypertension compared with the control group. In 24-h urine samples, there was no evidence of differences in sodium levels (mean difference 0.01; 95% CI (0.25, -0.23)), but potassium levels were higher at the end of the study than at baseline (mean difference 0.63; 95% CI (0.78, 0.47)). Our results support a case for implementing a pragmatic, population-wide, salt-substitution strategy for reducing blood pressure and hypertension incidence."

https://openalex.org/W3006998660,"Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, and it has extensive beneficial effects on various tissue and organs; however, whether melatonin has any effect on cardiac fibrosis in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is still unknown. Herein, we found that melatonin administration significantly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and reduced collagen production by inhibiting TGF-β1/Smads signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as manifested by downregulating the expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, mature IL-1β, and IL-18 in the heart of melatonin-treated mice with diabetes mellitus (DM). Similar beneficial effects of melatonin were consistently observed in high glucose (HG)-treated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Moreover, we also found that lncRNA MALAT1 (lncR-MALAT1) was increased along with concomitant decrease in microRNA-141 (miR-141) in DM mice and HG-treated CFs. Furthermore, we established NLRP3 and TGF-β1 as target genes of miR-141 and lncR-MALAT1 as an endogenous sponge or ceRNA to limit the functional availability of miR-141. Finally, we observed that knockdown of miR-141 abrogated anti-fibrosis action of melatonin in HG-treated CFs. Our findings indicate that melatonin produces an antifibrotic effect via inhibiting lncR-MALAT1/miR-141-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and TGF-β1/Smads signaling, and it might be considered a potential agent for the treatment of DCM."
https://openalex.org/W3005562312,"Schistosomiasis treatment relies on the use of a single drug, praziquantel, which is insufficient to control transmission in highly endemic areas1. Novel medicines and vaccines are urgently needed2,3. An experimental human model for schistosomiasis could accelerate the development of these products. We performed a dose-escalating clinical safety trial in 17 volunteers with male Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, which do not produce eggs (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02755324 ), at the Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands. The primary endpoints were adverse events and infectivity. We found a dose-related increase in adverse events related to acute schistosomiasis syndrome, which occurred in 9 of 17 volunteers. Overall, 5 volunteers (all 3 of the high dose group and 2 of 11 of the medium dose group) reported severe adverse events. Worm-derived circulating anodic antigen, the biomarker of the primary infection endpoint, peaked in 82% of volunteers at 3–10 weeks following exposure. All volunteers showed IgM and IgG1 seroconversion and worm-specific cytokine production by CD4+ T cells. All volunteers were cured with praziquantel provided at 12 weeks after exposure. Infection with 20 Schistosoma mansoni cercariae led to severe adverse events in 18% of volunteers and high infection rates. This infection model paves the way for fast-track product development for treatment and prevention of schistosomiasis. A new human challenge model of schistosomiasis, which affects more than 290 million people globally, will aid development of novel therapies and vaccines for this neglected tropical disease."
https://openalex.org/W3006348816,"Communication plays an integral role in human social dynamics and is impaired in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Mice are used to study the neurobiology of social behavior; however, the extent to which mouse vocalizations influence social dynamics has remained elusive because it is difficult to identify the vocalizing animal among mice involved in a group interaction. By tracking the ultrasonic vocal behavior of individual mice and using an algorithm developed to group phonically similar signals, we showed that distinct patterns of vocalization emerge as male mice perform specific social actions. Mice dominating other mice were more likely to emit different vocal signals than mice avoiding social interactions. Furthermore, we showed that the patterns of vocal expression influence the behavior of the socially engaged partner but do not influence the behavior of other animals in the cage. These findings clarify the function of mouse communication by revealing a communicative ultrasonic signaling repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W3006072134,"Repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated translation of expanded CGG repeats (CGG RAN) from the FMR1 5′-leader produces toxic proteins that contribute to neurodegeneration in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. Here we describe how unexpanded CGG repeats and their translation play conserved roles in regulating fragile X protein (FMRP) synthesis. In neurons, CGG RAN acts as an inhibitory upstream open reading frame to suppress basal FMRP production. Activation of mGluR5 receptors enhances FMRP synthesis. This enhancement requires both the CGG repeat and CGG RAN initiation sites. Using non-cleaving antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), we selectively blocked CGG RAN. This ASO blockade enhanced endogenous FMRP expression in human neurons. In human and rodent neurons, CGG RAN-blocking ASOs suppressed repeat toxicity and prolonged survival. These findings delineate a native function for CGG repeats and RAN translation in regulating basal and activity-dependent FMRP synthesis, and they demonstrate the therapeutic potential of modulating CGG RAN translation in fragile X-associated disorders. Rodriguez et al. define a native role for RAN translation and CGG repeats in regulating mGluR-dependent fragile X protein (FMRP) synthesis. RAN-blocking antisense oligonucleotides increase FMRP and improve survival of neurons from patients with repeat expansions."
https://openalex.org/W3007793303,"The opioid epidemic is a major public health crisis in the U.S. Contemporary data on opioid use disorder (OUD) related hospitalizations are needed. Our objective was to assess whether OUD hospitalizations and associated mortality are increasing over time and examine the factors associated healthcare utilization and mortality.We examined the rates of OUD hospitalizations and associated mortality using the U.S. National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 1998-2016. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression assessed the association of demographic, clinical and hospital characteristics with inpatient mortality and healthcare utilization (total hospital charges, discharge to a rehabilitation facility, length of hospital stay) during the index hospitalization for opioid use disorder. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We estimated 781,767 OUD hospitalizations. The rate of OUD hospitalization and associated mortality (/100,000 overall NIS hospitalizations) increased from 59.8 and 1.2 in 1998-2000 to 190.7 and 5.9 in 2015-16, respectively. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, the following factors were associated with worse outcomes; compared to age <34 years, older age was associated with higher risk of hospital charges above the median and length of stay >3 days, slightly higher risk of discharge to a rehabilitation facility. Higher Deyo-Charlson score was associated with higher hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and inpatient mortality. Women had lower odds of inpatient mortality than men and blacks had lower odds of mortality than whites.Rising OUD hospitalizations from 1998 to 2016 and increasing associated inpatient mortality are concerning. Certain groups are at higher risk of poor utilization outcomes and inpatient mortality. Resources and healthcare policies need to focus on the high-risk group to reduce mortality and associated utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3006495527,"Telomere maintenance by telomerase is essential for continuous proliferation of human cells and is vital for the survival of stem cells and 90% of cancer cells. To compensate for telomeric DNA lost during DNA replication, telomerase processively adds GGTTAG repeats to chromosome ends by copying the template region within its RNA subunit. Between repeat additions, the RNA template must be recycled. How telomerase remains associated with substrate DNA during this critical translocation step remains unknown. Using a single-molecule telomerase activity assay utilizing high-resolution optical tweezers, we demonstrate that stable substrate DNA binding at an anchor site within telomerase facilitates the processive synthesis of telomeric repeats. The product DNA synthesized by telomerase can be recaptured by the anchor site or fold into G-quadruplex structures. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into telomerase catalysis, a process of critical importance in aging and cancer. Patrick et al. used single-molecule optical tweezers to study the enzymatic activity and dynamics of product release of telomerase and provide direct evidence for the presence of an anchor site in elongating telomerase."
https://openalex.org/W3008667790,"Pathogenic fibrotic diseases, including Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), have some of the worst prognoses and affect millions of people worldwide. With unclear etiology and minimally effective therapies, two-thirds of IPF patients die within 2-5 years from this progressive interstitial lung disease. Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) are known to promote fibrosis; however, myofibroblast specific upregulation of IGF-1 in the initiation and progression of TGFβ-induced fibrogenesis and IPF have remained unexplored. To address this, the current study (1) documents the upregulation of IGF-1 via TGFβ in myofibroblasts and fibrotic lung tissue, as well as its correlation with decreased pulmonary function in advanced IPF; (2) identifies IGF-1’s C1 promoter as mediating the increase in IGF-1 transcription by TGFβ in pulmonary fibroblasts; (3) determines that SMAD2 and mTOR signaling are required for TGFβ-dependent Igf-1 expression in myofibroblasts; (4) demonstrates IGF-1R activation is essential to support TGFβ-driven profibrotic myofibroblast functions and excessive wound-healing; and (5) establishes the effectiveness of slowing the progression of murine lung fibrosis with the IGF-1R inhibitor OSI-906. These findings expand our knowledge of IGF-1’s role as a novel fibrotic-switch, bringing us one step closer to understanding the complex biological mechanisms responsible for fibrotic diseases and developing effective therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3007967724,"ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) is a homodimeric ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that not only has a key role in helping cancer cells to evade the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, but also in protecting organisms from multiple xeno- and endobiotics. Structural studies indicate that substrate and inhibitor (ligands) binding to ABCG2 can be differentiated quantitatively by the number of amino acid contacts, with inhibitors displaying more contacts. Although binding is the obligate initial step in the transport cycle, there is no empirical evidence for one amino acid being primarily responsible for ligand binding. By mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we demonstrated that the phylogenetically conserved amino acid residue, F439, was critical for both transport and the binding of multiple substrates and inhibitors. Structural modeling implied that the π-π interactions from each F439 monomer mediated the binding of a surprisingly diverse array of structurally unrelated substrates and inhibitors and that this symmetrical π-π interaction clamps the ligand into the binding pocket. Key molecular features of diverse ABCG2 ligands using the π-π clamp along with structural studies created a pharmacophore model. These novel findings have important therapeutic implications because key properties of ligands interacting with ABCG2 have been disovered. Furthermore, mechanistic insights have been revealed by demonstrating that for ABCG2 a single amino acid is essential for engaging and initiating transport of multiple drugs and xenobiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3005789657,"Nonribosomal depsipeptides are natural products composed of amino and hydroxy acid residues. The hydroxy acid residues often derive from α-keto acids, reduced by ketoreductase domains in the depsipeptide synthetases. Biochemistry and structures reveal the mechanism of discrimination for α-keto acids and a remarkable architecture: flanking intact adenylation and ketoreductase domains are sequences separated by >1,100 residues that form a split ‘pseudoAsub’ domain, structurally important for the depsipeptide module’s synthetic cycle. In depsipeptide synthetases, intact adenylation and ketoreductase domains responsible for selecting and reducing α-keto acids are flanked by two halves of a split pseudo-Asub domain whose physical interaction is critical for the module's activity."
https://openalex.org/W3008359012,"Environmental stresses influence the growth and development of plants by influencing patterns of gene expression. Different regulators control gene expression, including transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs: ~21 nucleotides long) are encoded by miRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNP-II) and play key roles in plant development and physiology. There is little knowledge currently available on miRNAs and their function in response to environmental stresses in safflower. To obtain more information on safflower miRNAs, we initially used a comparative genomics approach and succeeded in identifying 126 miRNAs belonging to 29 conserved families, along with their target genes. In this study, we investigated the expression profiles of seven conserved miRNAs related to drought, salinity, heat, and Cd stress in the leaf and root organs using qRT-PCR, for the first time. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis found that target genes of miRNAs are often TFs such as AP2/ERF and HD-ZIP as well as NAC domain-containing proteins. Expression analyses confirmed that miRNAs can play a vital role in keeping safflower stress-tolerant. Differential expression of miR156, miR162, miR164, miR166, miR172, miR398, and miR408 regulate the expression of their respective target genes. These genes activate several pathways leading to physiological and biochemical responses to abiotic stresses. Some conserved miRNAs were regulated by abiotic stresses. Our finding provides valuable information to understand miRNAs in relation to different abiotic stresses in safflower."
https://openalex.org/W3007708972,"Evaluation of brainstem pathways with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography may provide insights into pathophysiologies associated with dysfunction of key brainstem circuits. However, identification of these tracts has been elusive, with relatively few in vivo human studies to date. In this paper we proposed an automated approach for reconstructing nine brainstem fiber trajectories of pathways that might be involved in pain modulation. We first performed native-space manual tractography of these fiber tracts in a small normative cohort of participants and confirmed the anatomical precision of the results using existing anatomical literature. Second, region-of-interest pairs were manually defined at each extracted fiber’s termini and nonlinearly warped to a standard anatomical brain template to create an atlas of the region-of-interest pairs. The resulting atlas was then transformed non-linearly into the native space of 17 veteran patients’ brains for automated brainstem tractography. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the integrity levels of the obtained fiber bundles and pain severity levels. Fractional anisotropy (FA) measures derived using automated tractography reflected the respective tracts’ FA levels obtained via manual tractography. A significant inverse relationship between FA and pain levels was detected within the automatically derived dorsal and medial longitudinal fasciculi of the brainstem. This study demonstrates the feasibility of DTI in exploring brainstem circuitries involved in pain processing. In this context, the described automated approach is a viable alternative to the time-consuming manual tractography. The physiological and functional relevance of the measures derived from automated tractography is evidenced by their relationships with individual pain severities."
https://openalex.org/W3008671145,"The embryonic epicardium generates a population of epicardial-derived mesenchymal cells (EPDC) whose contribution to the coronary endothelium is minor or, according to some reports, negligible. We have compared four murine cell-tracing models related to the EPDC in order to elucidate this contribution. Cre recombinase was expressed under control of the promoters of the Wilms' tumor suppressor (Wt1), the cardiac troponin (cTnT), and the GATA5 genes, activating expression of the R26REYFP reporter. We have also used the G2 enhancer of the GATA4 gene as a driver due to its activation in the proepicardium. Recombination was found in most of the epicardium/EPDC in all cases. The contribution of these lineages to the cardiac endothelium was analyzed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. G2-GATA4 lineage cells are the most frequent in the endothelium, probably due to the recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitors. The contribution of the WT1 cell lineage increases along gestation due to further endothelial expression of WT1. GATA5 and cTnT lineages represent 4% of the cardiac endothelial cells throughout the gestation, probably standing for the actual EPDC contribution to the coronary endothelium. These results suggest caution when using a sole cell-tracing model to study the fate of the EPDC."
https://openalex.org/W3006859312,"Background The use of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders has increased but many are placed late in the dying process. This study is to determine the association between the timing of DNR order placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and nurses’ perceptions of patients’ distress and quality of death. Methods 200 ICU patients and the nurses (n = 83) who took care of them during their last week of life were enrolled from the medical ICU and cardiac care unit of New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan and the surgical ICU at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Nurses were interviewed about their perceptions of the patients’ quality of death using validated measures. Patients were divided into 3 groups—no DNR, early DNR, late DNR placement during the patient’s final ICU stay. Logistic regression analyses modeled perceived patient quality of life as a function of timing of DNR order placement. Patient’s comorbidities, length of ICU stay, and procedures were also included in the model. Results 59 patients (29.5%) had a DNR placed within 48 hours of ICU admission (early DNR), 110 (55%) placed after 48 hours of ICU admission (late DNR), and 31 (15.5%) had no DNR order placed. Compared to patients without DNR orders, those with an early but not late DNR order placement had significantly fewer non-beneficial procedures and lower odds of being rated by nurses as not being at peace (Adjusted Odds Ratio namely AOR = 0.30; [CI = 0.09–0.94]), and experiencing worst possible death (AOR = 0.31; [CI = 0.1–0.94]) before controlling for procedures; and consistent significance in severe suffering (AOR = 0.34; [CI = 0.12–0.96]), and experiencing a severe loss of dignity (AOR = 0.33; [CI = 0.12–0.94]), controlling for non-beneficial procedures. Conclusions Placement of DNR orders within the first 48 hours of the terminal ICU admission was associated with fewer non-beneficial procedures and less perceived suffering and loss of dignity, lower odds of being not at peace and of having the worst possible death."
https://openalex.org/W3007711710,"Diabetic foot ulcers can become chronic and non-healing despite systemic antibiotic treatment. The penetration of systematically-administered antibiotics to the site of infection is uncertain, as is the effectiveness of such levels against polymicrobial biofilms. We have developed an in vitro model to study the effectiveness of different treatments for infected diabetic foot ulcers in a wound-like environment and compared the activity of systemic levels of antibiotics with that for topically applied antibiotics released from calcium sulfate beads. This is the first study that has harvested bacteria from diabetic foot infections and recreated similar polymicrobial biofilms to those present in vivo for individual subjects. After treatment with levels of gentamicin attained in serum after systemic administration (higher than corresponding tissues concentrations) we measured a 0–2 log reduction in bacterial viability of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or a polymicrobial biofilm. Conversely, addition of gentamicin loaded calcium sulfate beads resulted in 5–9 log reductions in P. aeruginosa, S aureus and polymicrobial biofilms derived from three subjects. We conclude that systemically administered antibiotics are likely to be inadequate for successfully treating these infections, especially given the vastly increased concentrations required to inhibit cells in a biofilm, and that topical antibiotics provide a more effective alternative."
https://openalex.org/W3006996886,"Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a unique embryonic cell population that initially reside at the dorsal neural tube but later migrate in the embryo and differentiate into multiple types of derivatives. To acquire motility, NCCs undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are a large family of proteases which regulate migration of various embryonic and adult cells via ECM remodeling. The gelatinase's subgroup of MMPs is the most studied one due to its key role in metastasis. As it is composed of only two proteases, MMP2 and MMP9, it is important to understand whether each is indispensable or redundant in its biological function. Here we explored the role of the gelatinases in executing NCC migration, by determining whether MMP2 and/or MMP9 regulate migration across species in singular, combined, or redundant manners. Chick and mouse embryos were utilized to compare expression and activity of both MMPs using genetic and pharmacological approaches in multiple in vivo and ex vivo assays. Both MMPs were found to be expressed and active in mouse and chick NCCs. Inhibition of each MMP was sufficient to prevent NCC migration in both species. Yet, NCC migration was maintained in MMP2-/- or MMP9-/- mouse mutants due to compensation between the gelatinases, but reciprocal pharmacological inhibition in each mutant prevented NCC migration. This study reveals for the first time that both gelatinases are expressed in avian and mammalian NCCs, and demonstrates their fundamental and conserved role in promoting embryonic cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W3008934604,"Excessive proliferation and apoptosis-resistance are hallmarks of cancer. Increased dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission is one of the mediators of this phenotype. Mitochondrial fission that accompanies the nuclear division is called mitotic fission and occurs when activated Drp1 binds partner proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane. We examine the role of Drp1-binding partners, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51), as drivers of cell proliferation and apoptosis-resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and invasive breast carcinoma (IBC). We also evaluate whether inhibiting MiDs can be therapeutically exploited to regress cancer. We show that MiD levels are pathologically elevated in NSCLC and IBC by an epigenetic mechanism (decreased microRNA-34a-3p expression). MiDs silencing causes cell cycle arrest through (a) increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors, p27Kip1 and p21Waf1 , (b) inhibition of Drp1, and (c) inhibition of the Akt-mTOR-p70S6K pathway. Silencing MiDs leads to mitochondrial fusion, cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and tumor regression in a xenotransplant NSCLC model. There are positive correlations between MiD expression and tumor size and grade in breast cancer patients and inverse correlations with survival in NSCLC patients. The microRNA-34a-3p-MiDs axis is important to cancer pathogenesis and constitutes a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3006827017,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a pro-tumorigenic receptor tyrosine kinase that facilitates growth for cancer cells that overexpress the receptor. Monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody Cetuximab (CTX) provides significant clinical benefit in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Missense mutations in the ectodomain (ECD) of EGFR can be acquired under CTX treatment and mimic the effect of large deletions on spontaneous untethering and activation of the receptor. Little is known about the contribution of EGFR ECD mutations to EGFR activation and CTX resistance in HNSCC. We identified two concurrent non-synonymous missense mutations (G33S and N56K) mapping to domain I in or near the EGF binding pocket of the EGFR ECD in patient-derived HNSCC cells that were selected for CTX resistance through repeated exposure to the agent in an effort to mimic what may occur clinically. Structural modeling predicted that the G33S and N56K mutants would restrict adoption of a fully closed (tethered) and inactive EGFR conformation while not permitting association of EGFR with the EGF ligand or CTX. Binding studies confirmed that the mutant, untethered receptor displayed reduced affinity for both EGF and CTX but demonstrated sustained activation and presence at the cell surface with diminished internalization and sorting for endosomal degradation, leading to persistent downstream AKT signaling. Our results demonstrate that HNSCC cells can select for EGFR ECD mutations under CTX exposure that converge to trap the receptor in an open, ligand-independent, constitutively activated state. These mutants impede the receptor's competence to bind CTX possibly explaining certain cases of CTX treatment-induced or de novo resistance to CTX."
https://openalex.org/W3008609042,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with synaptic dysfunction, pathological accumulation of β-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Aβ1-42 ), and neuronal loss. The self-association of Aβ1-42 monomers (Aβ-M) into soluble oligomers seems to be crucial for the development of neurotoxicity. Previous publications have shown that Aβ oligomers and dimers might play key roles in inducing AD. The role of Aβ-M was rarely investigated and still unclear in AD. To understand the effects of Aβ-M on neurons and other cell types in the brain could be the key to understand its function. In our study, we found that Aβ-M expression slowly induced cell apoptosis within 48 hours after transfection, β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) interacted with Aβ-M in the pull-down and the yeast two-hybrid assays, and Aβ-M played a major role in inducing phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-214, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) at Thr-183/Tyr-185, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) at Thr-389. We also discovered that β2AR, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and protein kinase A (PKA) mediated the phosphorylation of Tau and JNK. Aβ-M induced phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-214 through both β2AR-cAMP/PKA-JNK and β2AR-GRK signaling pathways. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) mediated the phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by Aβ-M."

Materials and methods 
Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for the patients who were diagnosed with histopathologically proven MPM between 2009 and 2018 at Samsung Medical Center. For each patient, SUVmax was calculated for the primary lesion on PET/CT. To determine optimal cutoff values for predicting mortality, receiver operating characteristic curves were used.


Results 
Among the 54 study patients, 34 (63.0%) had epithelioid subtype, 13 (24.1%) had sarcomatoid or biphasic subtype, and 7 (13.0%) had mesothelioma, not otherwise specified (NOS). The median overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months, and the median SUVmax was 9.9. The median values of SUVmax were 5.5 in patients with epithelioid subtype, 11.7 in those with sarcomatoid/biphasic subtype, and 13.3 in those with NOS subtype (P = 0.003). The optimal cutoff values of SUVmax to predict mortality were 10.1 in all patients, and 8.5 in patients with epithelioid subtype. In multivariate analysis, SUVmax was significantly associated with overall survival in all patients (P = 0.003) and in patients with epithelioid subtype (P = 0.012), but not in those with non-epithelioid subtype.


Conclusions 
SUVmax in PET/CT is an independent prognostic factor in patients with MPM, especially those with epithelioid subtype. The histologic subtype of MPM should be considered when evaluating the prognostic significance of SUVmax."
https://openalex.org/W3008041152,"The United States has experienced prolonged severe shortages of vital medications over the past two decades. The causes underlying the severity and prolongation of these shortages are complex, in part due to the complexity of the underlying supply chain networks, which involve supplier-buyer interactions across multiple entities with competitive and cooperative goals. This leads to interesting challenges in maintaining consistent interactions and trust among the entities. Furthermore, disruptions in supply chains influence trust by inducing over-reactive behaviors across the network, thereby impacting the ability to consistently meet the resulting fluctuating demand. To explore these issues, we model a pharmaceutical supply chain with boundedly rational artificial decision makers capable of reasoning about the motivations and behaviors of others. We use multiagent simulations where each agent represents a key decision maker in a pharmaceutical supply chain. The agents possess a Theory-of-Mind capability to reason about the beliefs, and past and future behaviors of other agents, which allows them to assess other agents’ trustworthiness. Further, each agent has beliefs about others’ perceptions of its own trustworthiness that, in turn, impact its behavior. Our experiments reveal several counter-intuitive results showing how small, local disruptions can have cascading global consequences that persist over time. For example, a buyer, to protect itself from disruptions, may dynamically shift to ordering from suppliers with a higher perceived trustworthiness, while the supplier may prefer buyers with more stable ordering behavior. This asymmetry can put the trust-sensitive buyer at a disadvantage during shortages. Further, we demonstrate how the timing and scale of disruptions interact with a buyer’s sensitivity to trustworthiness. This interaction can engender different behaviors and impact the overall supply chain performance, either prolonging and exacerbating even small local disruptions, or mitigating a disruption’s effects. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these results for supply chain operations."
https://openalex.org/W3008531780,"In June 2017, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) announced a requirement that authors reporting the results of clinical trials to journals that follow ICMJE recommendations must include an individual participant data (IPD) sharing statement with manuscripts submitted after 01 July 2018. Additionally, all new clinical trials for which enrollment began on or after 01 January 2019 must include a data sharing statement in the trial's publicly posted registration. This study sought to understand whether IPD sharing statements of clinical trials first registered on ClinicalTrials.gov before 01 January 2019 reflected comprehension of the expectations and a willingness to share. To establish baseline characteristics for the prevalence and quality of IPD sharing statements, we examined IPD sharing statements among 2,040 clinical trials first posted on ClinicalTrials.gov between 01 January 2018 and 06 June 2018. Two independent coders further analyzed the quality of the IPD sharing statements of trials whose registration records indicated the intent to share IPD. The vast majority of trials included in this study did not indicate an intent to share IPD (n = 1,928; 94.5%). Among the trials that did commit to sharing IPD (n = 112, 5.5%), significant variability existed in the content and structure of IPD sharing statements. The results of this study suggest that successful compliance with the IPD sharing statement requirements of the ICMJE will require further clarification, enhanced education, and outreach to investigators."
https://openalex.org/W3008619244,"One of the critical regulatory mechanisms for cell cycle progression is the timely degradation of CDK inhibitors, including p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 . VCP/p97, an AAA-ATPase, is reported to be overexpressed in many types of cancers. Here, we found that treatment of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with DBeQ, a VCP inhibitor, or VCP knockdown in MCF-7 cells arrested cells at G1 phase, accompanied with the blockage of both p21 and p27 degradation. Whereas, double knockdown of p21 and p27 in MCF-7 cells rendered cells refractory to DBeQ-induced G1 arrest. Moreover, inhibition or knockdown of VCP or UFD1, one of VCP's co-factors, in MCF-7, NIH3T3, or HEK293T cells blocked the nuclear export of p27 during earlier G1 phase after mitogen stimulation. We also identified the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of VCP, and found that adding back wild-type VCP, not the NLS-deleted VCP mutant, restored the nuclear export and degradation of p27 in VCP knockout MCF-7 cells. Importantly, we found that VCP inhibition sensitized breast cancer cells to the treatment of several anticancer therapeutics both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study not only uncovers the mechanisms underlying VCP-mediated cell proliferation control but also provides potential therapeutic option for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3006787724,"The relationship between serum hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and atrial fibrillation (AF) or postoperative AF (POAF) in coronary artery bypass (CABG) patients is still under debate. It is also unclear whether there is a dose-response relationship between circulating HbA1c and the risk of AF or POAF.The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched. A robust-error meta-regression method was used to summarize the shape of the dose-response relationship. The RR and 95%CI were using a random-effects model. In total, 14 studies were included, totaling 17,914 AF cases among 352,325 participants. The summary RR per 1% increase in HbA1c was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.07-1.27). In the subgroup analysis, the summary RR was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.08-1.19) or 1.12 (95% CI: 1.05-1.20) for patients with diabetes or without known diabetes, respectively. The nonlinear analysis showed a nonlinear (Pnonlinear = 0.04) relationship between HbA1c and AF, with a significantly increased risk of AF if HbA1c was over 6.3%. However, HbA1c (per 1% increase) was not associated with POAF in patients with diabetes (RR: 1.13, P = 0.34) or without known diabetes (RR: 0.91, P = 0.37) among patients undergoing CABG.Our results suggest that higher HbA1c was associated with an increased risk of AF, both in diabetes and in without diabetes or with unknown diabetes. However, no association was found between HbA1c and POAF in patients undergoing CABG. Further prospective studies with larger population sizes are needed to explore the association between serum HbA1c level and the risk of POAF."
https://openalex.org/W3006857379,"Warmer winters may lead to changes in the hibernation behaviour of bats, such as the barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus, which prefers to hibernate at low temperatures. The species is also known for its large annual fluctuations in the number of wintering individuals, so inference about population trends should be based on long-term data. Prior to 2005, analyses indicated stable or even increasing barbastelle population in Poland. We analysed the results of 13 winter bat counts (2005–2017) of the species from 15 of the largest hibernacula, and additional site of 47 small bunkers, in Poland. The total number of wintering individuals remained stable during the study period, because the barbastelle is not a long-distance migrant, this likely reflects the national population trend. On the basis of mean winter air temperatures we divided the country into four thermal regions. Analyses of barbastelle abundance in hibernacula in the four regions revealed a 4.8% annual mean increase in numbers in the coldest region, where mean winter temperatures were below -2°C, annual mean declines of 3.3% and 3.1% in two warmer regions of western Poland, but no trend in the region of intermediate mean winter temperatures of between -1°C and -2°C. Overall, there was a significant, but weak, negative correlation between the abundance of hibernating individuals and the mean winter temperature. On the other hand, the number of individuals hibernating in small bunkers increased, even though the site was located in one of the warm regions. The results indicate a warming climate will likely reduce the use of large, well-insulated winter roosts by species that prefer colder conditions–and that this is already happening. For forest-dwelling bats, such as the barbastelle, for which monitoring schemes are primarily based on winter surveys of large hibernacula, estimations of population trends may consequently become less reliable."
https://openalex.org/W3007660703,"Background Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) is a highly effective and reversible modern contraceptive, which is still significantly underutilized in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to identify factors affecting the use of IUCDs among women of reproductive age group in Addis Ababa. Methods Facility-based, unmatched case-control study was employed among randomly selected cases and controls in selected health centers in Addis Ababa from August to October 2017. The cases (n = 128) were women of reproductive age group who were IUCD users and controls (n = 256) were women of reproductive age group who were users of oral or injectable contraceptives during the study period. After randomly selecting two health center from each sub-city the number of cases and controls were equally allocated to each of the selected health centers. In each selected health center, all eligible cases were enrolled consecutively until the sample size was achieved. Two consecutive controls were selected for each case. Data was collected face-to-face by trained nurses by using structured questionnaire. Factors associated with IUCD use were identified by multi-variable binary logistic regression models using the backward conditional stepwise method. Results In the multi-variable analysis, IUCD use was strongly associated with husbands/partners being supportive of IUCD use (Adjusted OR = 13.24, 95% CI; 5.30–33.02), being literate women (Adjusted OR = 5.31, 95% CI; 1.05–26.93), women having a perception of IUCD does not cause infection (Adjusted OR = 4.38, 95% CI; 1.45–13.26) and the source of information about IUCD being mass-media (Adjusted OR = 3.81, 95% CI; 1.49–9.74). Conclusions The findings of the study reinforce the need of husbands/partners involvement in the interventions to enhance utilization of IUCD. Moreover, due attention should also be provided for delivering IUCD-related messages in the public mass-media."
https://openalex.org/W3006982190,"Over the past decade, increasing researches have demonstrated the implication of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in tumorigenicity of glioma stem cells (GSCs). The regulatory functions of miRNAs in GSCs have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates for glioma treatment. Herein, we aim to investigate the role of miR-30a in the proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs and the possible mechanism in relation to ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E)-dependent Akt signaling pathway. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the expression of miR-30a and NT5E in glioma tissues and cell lines. GSCs were isolated from glioma cells and identified using flow cytometry. The relationship between miR-30a and NT5E was determined by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to examine the effects of miR-30a and NT5E on sphere formation, colony formation, and proliferation of GSCs in vitro, as well as orthotopic tumor growth of GSCs in nude mice. Additionally, the Akt signaling pathway was blocked with an Akt inhibitor, LY294002, to investigate its involvement in the regulatory effect of miR30a. miR-30a was poorly expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines as well as GSCs. NT5E, highly expressed in GSCs, was identified as a target of miR-30a. In addition, miR-30a upregulation or NT5E silencing could reduce GSC sphere formation, clone formation, proliferation, and orthotopic tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, miR-30a inhibited the activation of the Akt signaling pathway by targeting NT5E, and ultimately suppressing the self-renewal and orthotopic tumor growth of GSCs. Our results demonstrate that miR-30a targets NT5E to inhibit the Akt signaling pathway, by which could suppress the self-renewal and orthotopic tumor growth of GSCs. Those findings may provide theoretical basis of miR-30a as a therapeutic target to suppress the glioma progression."
https://openalex.org/W3007503238,"We previously showed that postmortem serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were significantly higher in cases of hypothermia (cold exposure) than other causes of death. This study examined how the human hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and specifically cortisol, responds to hypothermia. Human samples: Autopsies on 205 subjects (147 men and 58 women; age 15–98 years, median 60 years) were performed within 3 days of death. Cause of death was classified as either hypothermia (cold exposure, n = 14) or non-cold exposure (controls; n = 191). Cortisol levels were determined in blood samples obtained from the left and right cardiac chambers and common iliac veins using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Adrenal gland tissues samples were stained for cortisol using a rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody. Cell culture: AtT20, a mouse ACTH secretory cell line, and Y-1, a corticosterone secretory cell line derived from a mouse adrenal tumor, were analyzed in mono-and co-culture, and times courses of ACTH (in AtT20) and corticosterone (in Y-1) secretion were assessed after low temperature exposure mimicking hypothermia and compared with data for samples collected postmortem for other cases of death. However, no correlation between ACTH concentration and cortisol levels was observed in hypothermia cases. Immunohistologic analyses of samples from hypothermia cases showed that cortisol staining was localized primarily to the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm of cells in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. During both mono-culture and co-culture, AtT20 cells secreted high levels of ACTH after 10–15 minutes of cold exposure, whereas corticosterone secretion by Y-1 cells increased slowly during the first 15–20 minutes of cold exposure. Similar to autopsy results, no correlation was detected between ACTH levels and corticosterone secretion, either in mono-culture or co-culture experiments. These results suggested that ACTH-independent cortisol secretion may function as a stress response during cold exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3007749038,"Switching between tasks requires individuals to inhibit mental representations of the previous task demands and to activate representations of the new task demands. The inhibition of the executed task remains active for a while so that when the inhibited task set must be re-activated shortly after, the need to overcome residual task set inhibition leads to behavioral costs. In a sham-controlled balanced-order within-subjects experimental design we investigated whether applying right anodal/left cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal or parietal cortex modulated the ability to overcome persistent task inhibition during task switching. Results showed that right anodal/left cathodal tDCS over the parietal cortex improves performance selectively when switching back to a recently inhibited task that requires previous inhibition to be overcome. Right Anodal/left cathodal tDCS over the prefrontal cortex improves performance during task switching in general, either when re-engaging in a inhibited task or when engaging in a non-inhibited task. Results suggest a different contribution of prefrontal and parietal regions to task switching, with parietal cortex being selectively involved in overcoming persistent task inhibition and prefrontal cortex being more generally involved in the control of task set during task switching."
https://openalex.org/W3008623645,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome leading to chronic intermittent hypoxia, and the up-regulation of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 6 on peripheral blood cells has been reported. We hypothesized that DNA methylation in TLR2 and TLR6 genes may play a role in the development of OSA and its excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) phenotype. DNA methylation over 28 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of the TLR2 promoter region and 3 CpG sites of the TLR6 gene body, and their protein expressions were measured by using pyrosequencing and ELISA methods in 18 heathy subjects (HS) and 58 patients with severe OSA (divided into 18 non-EDS and 40 EDS group). Patients with severe OSA had higher DNA methylation levels over five CpG sites (#1, #2, #3, #25 and #28) and lower DNA methylation levels over CpG site #18 of the TLR2 promoter region, higher DNA methylation levels over two CpG sites (#1 and #3) of the TLR6 gene body, and higher protein expressions of TLR6 than HS. The CpG site #2 of the TLR6 gene body was hypermethylated in severe OSA patients with EDS. Both DNA methylation levels over CpG site #1 of the TLR6 gene body and protein expressions of TLR6 were reduced after more than 6 months of nasal CPAP treatment in seven selected patients. Aberrant DNA methylation of the TLR2 promoter region and TLR6 gene body are associated with the consequence of severe OSA and its EDS phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3008877276,"Episodic memory is the ability to learn, store and recall new information. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a crucial area engaged in this ability. Cognitive training has been demonstrated to improve episodic memory in adults and older subjects. However, there are no studies examining the effects of cognitive training on episodic memory encoding in typically developing children and adolescents. This study investigated the behavioral effects and neural correlates of semantic categorization strategy training in children and adolescents during verbal episodic memory encoding using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants with age range: 7–18 years were scanned before and after semantic categorization training during encoding of word lists. Results showed improved memory performance in adolescents, but not in children. Deactivation of the anterior medial PFC/anterior cingulate and higher activation of the right anterior and lateral orbital gyri, right frontal pole and right middle frontal gyrus activation were found after training in adolescents when compared to children. These findings suggest different maturational paths of brain regions, especially in the PFC, and deactivation of default mode network areas, which are involved in successful memory and executive processes in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W3006721935,"Irisin concentrations are decreased in subjects with overt diabetes and upregulated in those with obesity or impaired fasting glucose. However, gender-balanced data in older populations, in whom risk factors commonly culminate in overt cardiovascular disease, are scarce. We assessed in non-diabetic Caucasian subjects with stage I-II obesity in the early aging range (50 to 70 years), the relationship between irisin, body composition and markers of metabolic derangement by gender. In 60 (31 women, 29 men) non-diabetics with a body mass index ≥30 - ≤40 kg/m2, we measured anthropometrics and body composition (Air Displacement Plethysmography). We assayed lipid and glucose profile by routine methods, plasma irisin by ELISA and measured insulin resistance by the HOMA index. Irisin levels were higher in women than in men (161 [105-198]) vs 83 [33-115] ng/ml, P<0.001), and correlated directly with HOMA index in both (rho 0.735, P<0.001 M, rho 0.452, P = 0.011 F). Sex differences were maintained across insulin resistance severity stages. In men, irisin concentrations correlated directly with body mass index (rho 0.755, P<0.001), waist circumference (rho 0.623, P<0.001), fat mass index (rho 0.762, P<0.001), glucose (rho 0.408, P = 0.028), the fatty liver index (rho 0.705, P<0.001) and FINDRISC score (rho 0.536, P = 0.003). Among non-diabetic Caucasian subjects with obesity in the early stages of aging, irisin levels reflect the amount of body fat and insulin resistance severity, independently of between-gender differences in the adipomyokine concentrations and are associated with markers of visceral adiposity in men but not in women."
https://openalex.org/W3006824469,"Geographical distribution of forest species is closely regulated by environmental conditions, particularly temperature and precipitation. Climate change predicted by general circulation models is expected to modify the distribution of many species' distribution, especially those adapted to extreme environmental conditions, leading to large-scale migrations or local extinctions. The aim of this research was to determine the potential impact of climatic change on Pinus hartwegii geographic distribution and the niche breadth of its populations. Ecological niche models were used by generated with four different algorithms based on 19 bioclimatic variables in addition to altitude. Climatic niche breadth was delimited by the dispersion of species occurrence records within the intervals of the bioclimatic variables. We modelled future distribution based on three general circulation models, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES, using two representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5, for two-time horizons 2050 and 2070. Niche breadth analysis showed narrow ranges of suitability, indicating a strong relationship between the presence of P. hartwegii with the temperature of the warmest quarter and precipitation of the coldest quarter. In addition, the suitability area of P. hartwegii is predicted to be reduced up to 70% by 2070; the populations of the extreme northern and southern latitudes will be reduced in greater proportion than those of central Mexico. This suggest that environmental suitability area of P. hartwegii are reduced by the effect of the increase in environmental temperature. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor extreme populations of this species in the long term in order to establish efficient conservation strategies and well adaptive management facing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3007244695,"Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) plays crucial role in maintaining testicular structure and function via regulation of senescence of spermatogenic cells. However, it remains unclear whether TAZ is involved in testosterone biosynthesis in testicular Leydig cells. We found that TAZ deficiency caused aberrant Leydig cell expansion and increased lipid droplet formation, which was significantly associated with increased lipogenic enzyme expression. Additionally, the expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 11A1, CYP17A1, and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, was greatly increased in TAZ-deficient testes and primary Leydig cells. Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor 4 A1 (NR4A1) was dramatically suppressed by TAZ; however, the protein expression and the subcellular localization of NR4A1 were not affected by TAZ. TAZ directly associated with the N-terminal region of NR4A1 and substantially suppressed its DNA-binding and transcriptional activities. Stable expression of TAZ in the mouse Leydig TM3 cell line decreased the expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, whereas knockdown of endogenous TAZ in TM3 cells increased transcripts of steroidogenic genes induced by NR4A1. Consistently, testosterone production was enhanced within TAZ-deficient Leydig cells. However, TAZ deficiency resulted in decreased testosterone secretion caused by dysfunctional mitochondria and lysosomes. Therefore, TAZ plays essential role in NR4A1-induced steroidogenic enzyme expression and testosterone production in Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W3008391747,"Mutations in CYP4F22 cause autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). However, less than 10% of all ARCI patients carry a mutation in CYP4F22. In order to identify the molecular basis of ARCI among our patients (a cohort of ninety-two Spanish individuals) we performed a mutational analysis using direct Sanger sequencing in combination with a multigene targeted NGS panel. From these, eight ARCI families (three of them with Moroccan origin) were found to carry five different CYP4F22 mutations, of which two were novel. Computational analysis showed that the mutations found were present in highly conserved residues of the protein and may affect its structure and function. Seven of the eight families were carriers of a highly recurrent CYP4F22 variant, c.1303C>T; p.(His435Tyr). A 12Mb haplotype was reconstructed in all c.1303C>T carriers by genotyping ten microsatellite markers flanking the CYP4F22 gene. A prevalent 2.52Mb haplotype was observed among Spanish carrier patients suggesting a recent common ancestor. A smaller core haplotype of 1.2Mb was shared by Spanish and Moroccan families. Different approaches were applied to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of carrier patients with Spanish origin. The age of the mutation was calculated by using DMLE and BDMC2. The algorithms estimated that the c.1303C>T variant arose approximately 2925 to 4925 years ago, while Spanish carrier families derived from a common ancestor who lived in the XIII century. The present study reports five CYP4F22 mutations, two of them novel, increasing the number of CYP4F22 mutations currently listed. Additionally, our results suggest that the recurrent c.1303C>T change has a founder effect in Spanish population and c.1303C>T carrier families originated from a single ancestor with probable African ancestry."
https://openalex.org/W3008285421,"Changes in the United States federal-level political landscape have been felt within immigrant communities, and the public health clinics that serve them. We sought to document how HIV prevention and care clinics are reaching and retaining their immigrant community patients during a period of retrenchment of accessible public resources and immigrant rights. From May 2018 through January 2019, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with clinicians, case workers, advocates, legal experts, and peer navigators in Northern and Central California. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Several themes emerged which can be grouped into three primary areas: changes post-election, challenges meeting the needs of patients, and best practices for maintaining access to prevention and care services. Post-election, providers reported some of their patients skipping clinic appointments due to fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and deportation while other patients had moved to locations that they felt were less policed. Challenges emerged around linguistic competency, meeting basic needs such as housing stability and employment, and treating mental health sequelae resulting from trauma experienced in home countries or during migration itself. Best practices included hiring bi-lingual and bi-cultural staff, linking to legal services to assist with immigration status, holding trainings around immigrant rights and responses to ICE raids, and building trust with immigrant patients by assuring them that their status would not be collected or reported. In light of adverse policy changes affecting immigrants, agencies have begun to institute best practices to mitigate the negative impact of those policies on their clients and patients."
https://openalex.org/W3006689436,"Disruption of the tumor-brain barrier in meningioma plays a critical role in the development of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE). We hypothesized that osteoporotic conditions may be associated with PTBE occurrence after radiation in patients with intracranial meningioma.We measured Hounsfield units (HU) of the frontal skull on simulation brain CT in patients who underwent linear accelerator (LINAC)-based radiation treatment for intracranial meningioma. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off values for several predictive factors. The cumulative hazard for PTBE was estimated and classified according to these factors. Hazard ratios were then estimated to identify independent predictive factors associated with the development of PTBE after radiation in intracranial meningioma patients.A total of 83 intracranial meningiomas in 76 patients who received LINAC-based radiation treatment in our hospital over an approximate 5-year period were included for the study. We found mean frontal skull HU ≤630.625 and gross tumor volume >7.194 cc to be independent predictors of PTBE after radiation treatment in patients with meningioma (hazard ratio, 8.41; P = 0.019; hazard ratio, 5.92; P = 0.032, respectively). In addition, patients who were ≥65 years showed a marginally significant association with PTBE.Our study suggests that possible osteoporotic conditions, large tumor volume, and older age may be associated with PTBE occurrence after LINAC-based radiation treatment for intracranial meningioma. In the future we anticipate that these findings may enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PTBE after radiation in meningioma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3007106123,"The orchestration of applications and their components over heterogeneous clouds is recognized as being critical in solving the problem of vendor lock-in with regards to distributed and cloud computing. There have been recent strides made in the area of cloud application orchestration with emergence of the TOSCA standard being a definitive one. Although orchestration by itself provides a considerable amount of benefit to consumers of cloud computing services, it remains impractical without a compelling reason to ensure its utilization by cloud computing consumers. If there is no measurable benefit in using orchestration, then it is likely that clients may opt out of using it altogether. In this paper, we present an approach to cloud orchestration that aims to combine an orchestration model with a cost and policy model in order to allow for cost-aware application orchestration across heterogeneous clouds. Our approach takes into consideration the operating cost of the application on each provider, while performing a forward projection of the operating cost over a period of time to ensure that cost constraints remain unviolated. This allows us to leverage the existing state of the art with regards to orchestration and model-driven approaches as well as tie it to the operations of cloud clients in order to improve utility. Through this study, we were able to show that our approach was capable of providing not only scaling features but also orchestration features of application components distributed across heterogeneous cloud platforms."
https://openalex.org/W3007383635,"Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) exhibits both single ribonucleotide excision activity (activity A) and RNA strand degrading activity (activity B). Val143 of human RNase H2 is located at the active site and is conserved in eukaryotic RNase H2. In this study, we explored the role of Val143 in catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Nineteen single variants at amino acid position 143 were expressed in E. coli, and all variants except for V143C and V143M were purified from the cells. When the activity of the wild-type human RNase H2 (WT) was set as 100%, the relative activities A and B of the 17 variants were in the range of 0.05-130 and 0.02-42%, respectively. When the ratio of the relative activity A to the relative activity B of WT was set as 1, the ratios of the 17 variants were in the range of 0.2-5.7. This indicates that valine is optimal for balancing the two activities. The ratios for V143Y and V143W were relatively high (5.6 and 5.5, respectively), suggesting that the bulky residues like tyrosine and tryptophan at position 143 caused steric hindrance with the 2'-OH of the sugar moiety of the ribonucleotide at the 5' side of the scissile phosphodiester bond. The ratio for V143Q was relatively low (0.2). These results suggested that Val143 is not critical for, but plays a role in determining catalytic activity and substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3008015410,"Life Cycle Assessment typically focuses on the footprint of products and services, expressed on three Areas of Protection (AoP): Human Health, Ecosystems and Resources. While the handprint is often expressed qualitatively, quantified handprints have recently been compared directly to the footprint concerning one AoP: Human Health. We propose to take this one step further by simultaneously comparing the quantified handprint and footprint on all AoPs through normalization and weighting of the results towards a single score. We discuss two example cases of a pharmaceutical treatment: mebendazole to treat soil-transmitted helminthiases and paliperidone palmitate to treat schizophrenia. Each time, treatment is compared to 'no treatment'. The footprint of health care is compared to the handprint of improved patient health. The handprint and footprint were normalized separately. To include sensitivity in the normalization step we applied four sets of external normalization factors for both handprint (Global Burden of Disease) and footprint (ReCiPe and PROSUITE). At the weighting step we applied 26 sets of panel weighting factors from three sources. We propose the Relative Sustainability Benefit Rate (RSBR) as a new metric to quantify the relative difference in combined handprint and footprint single score between two alternatives. When only considering the footprint, the first case study is associated with an increased single score burden of treatment compared to 'no treatment', while in the second case study treatment reduces the single score burden by 41.1% compared to 'no treatment'. Also including the handprint provided new insights for the first case study, now showing a decrease of 56.4% in single score burden for treatment compared to 'no treatment'. For the second case study the reduction of single score burden was confirmed as the handprint burden was also decreased because of treatment by 9.9%, reinforcing the findings."
https://openalex.org/W3007918681,"Embryonic development of the alveolar sac of the lung is dependent upon multiple signaling pathways to coordinate cell growth, migration, and the formation of the extracellular matrix. Here, we identify GORAB as a regulator of embryonic alveolar sac formation as genetically disrupting the Gorab gene in mice resulted in fatal saccular maturation defects characterized by a thickened lung mesenchyme. This abnormality is not associated with impairments in cellular proliferation and death, but aberrantly increased protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, elevated Vcan transcription, and enhanced migration of mesenchymal fibroblasts. Genetically augmenting PDGFRα, a potent activator of AKT in lung mesenchymal cells, recapitulated the alveolar phenotypes, whereas disrupting PDGFRα partially rescued alveolar phenotypes in Gorab-deficient mice. Overexpressing or suppressing Vcan in primary embryonic lung fibroblasts could, respectively, mimic or attenuate alveolar sac-like phenotypes in a co-culture model. These findings suggest a role of GORAB in negatively regulating AKT phosphorylation, the expression of Vcan, and the migration of lung mesenchyme fibroblasts, and suggest that alveolar sac formation resembles a patterning event that is orchestrated by molecular signaling and the extracellular matrix in the mesenchyme."
