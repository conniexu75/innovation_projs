https://openalex.org/W2107768418,"Mutations of human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) are found in about 20 percent of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Expression of high levels of human SOD containing a substitution of glycine to alanine at position 93--a change that has little effect on enzyme activity--caused motor neuron disease in transgenic mice. The mice became paralyzed in one or more limbs as a result of motor neuron loss from the spinal cord and died by 5 to 6 months of age. The results show that dominant, gain-of-function mutations in SOD contribute to the pathogenesis of familial ALS."
https://openalex.org/W1998300401,"A wealth of protein and DNA sequence data is being generated by genome projects and other sequencing efforts. A crucial barrier to deciphering these sequences and understanding the relations among them is the difficulty of detecting subtle local residue patterns common to multiple sequences. Such patterns frequently reflect similar molecular structures and biological properties. A mathematical definition of this ""local multiple alignment"" problem suitable for full computer automation has been used to develop a new and sensitive algorithm, based on the statistical method of iterative sampling. This algorithm finds an optimized local alignment model for N sequences in N-linear time, requiring only seconds on current workstations, and allows the simultaneous detection and optimization of multiple patterns and pattern repeats. The method is illustrated as applied to helix-turn-helix proteins, lipocalins, and prenyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2126018089,"The pathogenic human parvovirus B19 replicates only in erythroid progenitor cells. This virus was shown to bind to blood-group P antigen, as measured by hemagglutination. Erythrocytes lacking P antigen were not agglutinated with B19. Purified P antigen (globoside) blocked the binding of the virus to erythroid cells and the infectivity of the virus in a hematopoietic colony assay. Target cells were protected from infection by preincubation with monoclonal antibody to globoside. Knowledge of a parvovirus receptor has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of parvovirus infections and for the use of parvoviruses in gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2065587065,A light microscope-based technique for rapidly constructing ordered physical maps of chromosomes has been developed. Restriction enzyme digestion of elongated individual DNA molecules (about 0.2 to 1.0 megabases in size) was imaged by fluorescence microscopy after fixation in agarose gel. The size of the resulting individual restriction fragments was determined by relative fluorescence intensity and apparent molecular contour length. Ordered restriction maps were then created from genomic DNA without reliance on cloned or amplified sequences for hybridization or analytical gel electrophoresis. Initial application of optical mapping is described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes.
https://openalex.org/W2005030208,"Molecular dynamics simulations of a fluid-phase dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer in water and of neat hexadecane are reported and compared with nuclear magnetic resonance spin-lattice relaxation and quasi-elastic neutron scattering data. On the 100-picosecond time scale of the present simulations, there is effectively no difference in the reorientational dynamics of the carbons in the membrane interior and in pure hexadecane. Given that the calculated fast reorientational correlation times and the ""microscopic"" lateral diffusion of the lipids show excellent agreement with the experimental results, it is concluded that the apparently high viscosity of the membrane is more closely related to molecular interactions on the surface rather than in the interior."
https://openalex.org/W2018145486,"A new approach to protein sequencing is described. It consists of two steps: (i) ladder-generating chemistry, the controlled generation from a polypeptide chain by wet chemistry of a family of sequence-defining peptide fragments, each differing from the next by one amino acid; and (ii) data readout, a one-step readout of the resulting protein sequencing ladder by matrix-assisted laser-desorption mass spectrometry. Each amino acid was identified from the mass difference between successive peaks, and the position in the data set defined the sequence of the original peptide chain. This method was used to directly locate a phosphoserine residue in a phosphopeptide. The protein ladder sequencing method lends itself to very high sample throughput at very low per cycle cost."
https://openalex.org/W1998290936,"The liver represents a model organ for gene therapy. A method has been developed for hepatic gene transfer in vivo by the direct infusion of recombinant retroviral vectors into the portal vasculature, which results in the persistent expression of exogenous genes. To determine if these technologies are applicable for the treatment of hemophilia B patients, preclinical efficacy studies were done in a hemophilia B dog model. When the canine factor IX complementary DNA was transduced directly into the hepatocytes of affected dogs in vivo, the animals constitutively expressed low levels of canine factor IX for more than 5 months. Persistent expression of the clotting factor resulted in reductions of whole blood clotting and partial thromboplastin times of the treated animals. Thus, long-term treatment of hemophilia B patients may be feasible by direct hepatic gene therapy in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1971541955,"Progress toward achieving the first set of goals for the genome project appears to be on schedule or, in some instances, even ahead of schedule. Furthermore, technological improvements that could not have been anticipated in 1990 have in some areas changed the scope of the project and allowed more ambitious approaches. Earlier this year, it was therefore decided to update and extend the initial goals to address the scope of genome research beyond the completion of the original 5-year plan. A major purpose of revising the plan is to inform and provide a new guide to all participants in the genome project about the project's goal. To obtain the advice needed to develop the extended goals, NIH and DOE held a series of meetings with a large number of scientists and other interested scholars and representatives of the public, including many who previously had not been direct participants in the genome project. Reports of all these meetings are available from the Office of Communications of the National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) and the Human Genome Management Information System of DOE. Finally, a group of representative advisors from MIH and DOE drafted a set of new, extended goals formore » presentation to the National Advisory Council for Human Genome Research of NIH and the Health and Environmental Research Advisory Committee of DOE.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2045372653,"Gene expression can be affected by the chromosomal position of the gene. An example of this position effect is silencing of the HML and HMR mating-type loci of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An in vitro assay revealed that silencing induced a transcription-independent general occlusion of the DNA at HMR from sequence-specific interactions of proteins with DNA. The minimum boundaries of the silenced chromatin structure were determined, as were the contributions of the E and I silencers to the size of the silenced domain. Examination of endonuclease-sensitive sites provided evidence that neither the integrity of the chromosomal duplex nor covalent linkage of the silencers to HMR was important for maintenance of the silenced structure in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2040746692,"Catalytic antibodies that control the reaction pathways of the Diels-Alder cycloaddition have been generated. One antibody catalyzes the favored endo and the other the disfavored exo pathway to yield the respective cis and trans adducts in enantiomerically pure form. A comparison of the x-ray structure of the hapten with the calculated geometry of the transition structure showed that [2.2.2] bicyclic compounds are excellent mimics of the transition state of the Diels-Alder reaction. To achieve catalysis and the high degree of stereoselectivity shown here, the antibody must simultaneously control the conformation of the individual reactants and their relation to each other. In the case of the disfavored process, binding energy must be used to reroute the reaction along a higher energy pathway. The rerouting of reaction pathways has become a major focus of antibody catalysis and other disfavored reactions can be expected to be catalyzed so long as the energy barrier is not extreme. The energy requirements needed for absolute control of all of the stereoisomers of many Diels-Alder reactions fall in the energy range (approximately 20 kilocalories per mole) deliverable by antibody binding."
https://openalex.org/W2088032346,"The association of lipid molecules into spherical vesicles in solution as a result of non-specific intermolecular forces constitutes a primary self-assembly process. Such vesicles can undergo a secondary self-assembly into higher order structures in a controlled and reversible manner by means of site-specific ligand-receptor (biotin-streptavidin) coupling. Cryoelectron microscopy shows these structures to be composed of tethered, rather than adhering, vesicles in their original, unstressed state. In contrast, vesicles aggregated by nonspecific, such as van der Waals, forces are deformed and stressed, producing unstable structures. Vesicle association by site-specific binding provides a practical mechanism for the production of stable, yet controllable, microstructured biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W2082468024,"In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9."
https://openalex.org/W2016072762,"Diaphragmatic function and intrapulmonary respiratory flow in running mammals were found to differ substantially from the corresponding conditions known in resting mammals. In trotting dogs, orbital oscillations of the diaphragm were driven by inertial displacements of the viscera induced by locomotion. In turn, oscillations of the visceral mass drove pulmonary ventilation independent of diaphragmatic contractions, which primarily served to modulate visceral kinetics. Visceral displacements and loading of the anterior chest wall by the forelimbs are among the factors that contribute to an asynchronous ventilation of the lungs and interlobar gas recycling. Basic features of mammalian respiratory design, including the structure of the diaphragm and lobation of the lungs, appear to reflect the mechanical requirements of locomotor-respiratory integration."
https://openalex.org/W4236134752,"Noninfectious, cytoplasmically transmissible viral double-stranded RNAs of the genus Hypovirus cause reduced virulence (hypovirulence) in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, providing the basis for virus-mediated biological control of a fungal disease. Synthetic transcripts corresponding to a full-length hypovirus RNA coding strand are infectious when introduced into fungal spheroplasts by electroporation. Hypovirus infections were readily established in Cryphonectria parasitica and in related fungal species not previously reported to harbor viruses. These results demonstrate the use of a synthetic mycovirus transcript to expand fungal host range, thereby broadening the potential application of virus-mediated hypovirulence to control fungal pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001840896,"The murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) is induced by a defective murine leukemia virus and has many symptoms similar to those found in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The presence of both B cells and CD4+ T cells is critical for the development of the disease. Furthermore, a Th2 cytokine response dominates during the progression of the disease. When interleukin-4 (IL-4)-deficient mice that are defective in Th2 cytokine responses were infected, there was no lethality, and the development of the T cell abnormalities associated with MAIDS was delayed. These data suggest that IL-4 or a Th2 response is involved in the development of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2039213111,"The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is required for transcription by all three nuclear RNA polymerases. TBP was subjected to regional codon randomization, a codon-based mutagenesis method that generates complex yet compact protein libraries. Analysis of 186 temperature-sensitive TBP mutants yielded 65 specifically defective in transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). These mutants map to a limited TBP surface that may interact with Tds4, a component of the Pol III transcription factor TFIIIB. Strains that contain the Pol III-defective derivatives have increased amounts of messenger RNA, which suggests that competition among TBP-interacting factors for limiting quantities of TBP determines the ratio of Pol II and Pol III transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2052319720,"None of the mammalian splicing factors that have been cloned corresponds to the yeast pre-messenger RNA splicing factors, the PRP proteins. Here, a generalizable strategy was used to isolate a complementary DNA encoding the mammalian spliceosome-associated protein (SAP) SAP 62. It is demonstrated that SAP 62 is the likely functional homolog of the yeast PRP11 protein. Both PRP11 and SAP 62 associate stably with the spliceosome, contain a single zinc finger, and display significant amino acid sequence similarity. Unlike PRP11, SAP 62 contains 22 proline-rich heptapeptide repeats at the carboxyl-terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1995887851,"The affinity of a flexible ligand that adopts a specific conformation when bound to its receptor should be increased with the appropriate use of conformational restraints. By determining the structure of protein-ligand complexes, such restraints can in principle be designed into the bound ligand in a rational way. A tricyclic variant (TCsA) of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA), which inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes by forming a cyclophilin-CsA-calcineurin complex, was designed with the known three-dimensional structure of a cyclophilin-CsA complex. The conformational restraints in TCsA appear to be responsible for its greater affinity for cyclophilin and calcineurin relative to CsA."
https://openalex.org/W2064448615,"Several proteins are involved in the early steps of the spliceosome assembly pathway. Protein-protein interactions have been identified between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast splicing factors, PRP9 and SPP91. Here it is demonstrated that protein-protein interactions occur between SPP91 and PRP11. The combination of the prp9-1 mutant and a truncated prp11 mutant exhibits a synthetic lethal phenotype, suggestive of a common biochemical defect. The PRP9 and PRP11 proteins do not interact directly, but the PRP9 and PRP11 molecules can simultaneously bind SPP91 to form a three-molecule complex. Structurally and functionally related proteins are found in mammalian cells and are associated in a single biochemical fraction. This strongly suggests that the PRP9-SPP91-PRP11 complex is a key element of the splicing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2028127154,"Interferons, which induce several intracellular antiviral proteins, also induce an extracellular soluble protein that inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. This 28-kilodalton soluble protein was purified to homogeneity and identified by protein sequencing as the ligand-binding domain of the human 160-kilodalton low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The existence of an antiviral soluble LDLR was confirmed by immunoaffinity chromatography with monoclonal antibody to LDLR. This soluble receptor mediates most of the interferon-triggered antiviral activity against VSV, apparently by interfering with virus assembly or budding, and not by inhibiting virus attachment to cells."

https://openalex.org/W2015563271,"The three databases of primary importance to the Human Genome Project each store a different kind of information - DNA sequences (GenBank), chromosome mapping information (Genome Data Base), and protein sequence and structure (Protein Information Resource). Currently, these databases are independently administered and are separate physical entities, each with its own system for data collection, storage, and presentation. However, the community would be better served by the convenience of one-stop shopping, provided by a seamless integration of these primary databases into a single virtual database. This integration will necessitate adoption of a standard protocol such as SQL (Structured Query Language) for the interrogation and retrieval of related information simultaneously from several distributed databases. At present, data is accessed from databases across networks with simple document-based protocols such as GOPHER and WAIS (Wide Area Information Server). Although such protocols allow easy access to a wide variety of information (and undoubtedly will be used extensively), they do not provide the connectivity needed for a virtual database."
