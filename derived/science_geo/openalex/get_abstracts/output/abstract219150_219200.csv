https://openalex.org/W1997453137,"Previous work on the mechanisms of hunger-satiety in mammals has led to the localization of these functions in the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamic areas. The present work indicates that portions of the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus, septum, and thalamus are involved as well."

https://openalex.org/W2018945527,"A variety of viable and non-viable bacteria became mineralized with hydroxyapatite when implanted in dialysis bags in the peritoneal cavities of rats. The microscopic pattern of mineral deposition appeared analogous to that in the formation of oral calculus. Since nonviable organisms were mineralized at an accelerated rate, bacterial metabolic processes may not be essential for mineralization."

https://openalex.org/W1998409060,"The incorporation of C(14)-labeled glycine into human endometrium grown in tissue culture is accelerated by the addition of estradiol-17beta to the culture medium under certain experimental conditions. This effect is accompanied by an increased rate of disappearance of the glycine from the medium, and its demonstration is dependent upon the age of the culture and the frequency with which the medium is renewed."

https://openalex.org/W2059430689,"LITTLE attention has been paid to the intracellular Rickettsia-like micro-organisms in acarines. Perhaps the first approach to a comprehensive survey on these organisms in ticks was that of Cowdry1, although a few earlier observations were made2–4. Cowdry reported the occurrence of intracellular micro-organisms, of rickettsial nature, in the malpighian tubules and in eggs of several species of ixodid and argasid ticks. He pointed out that, being present in eggs and unfed larvae, the organisms were transmitted by inheritance, and postulated a symbiotic function. Further work on the morphological appearances of such micro-organisms and their distribution in the malpighian tubules and oocytes of some of these tick species were developed by Buchner5, Mudrow6 and Jaschke7."

Implied in genetically organized differentiation are the biological processes of maturation, growth and senescence which are collectively referred to as the ageing of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2012084654,"Heimreich and Cori1 and later R-Candela2 among others have shown that the specificity to sensitive sugars is similar both with insulin and muscular contraction. On the other hand, the great resistance of toads to insulin injections is known from the work of Rapela et al.3. We have confirmed this finding in frogs injected with up to 40 U./100 gm. without showing any signs of hypoglycaemia."

https://openalex.org/W2071444190,"THE passing of glucose through the membrane of the muscular cell can, predominantly, imply interaction between the sugar molecule and the cellular membrane. There is clear evidence that in experiments conducted in conventional conditions, the disappearance of glucose from the medium (in experiments with rat diaphragm and epididymal adipose tissue) is not absolutely proportional to the weight of the tissues incubated, and the figures corresponding to the mgm. of glucose consumed from the medium, divided by the mgm. of tissue, are generally larger for the tissue preparations of smaller weights. These differences could be attributed, at least in part, to a lack of proportionality between the surface area and the weight of the incubated tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2082506070,"Specialized cells in the epithelium react for cholinesterases when tested by the Koelle thiocholine method. Their morphology and contiguity with cholinesterase-positive nerves suggests receptor function. Impulses originating from them might relate to sensations or muscular reflexes involved in micturition and ejaculation, or both. If they are effector units, special secretory, excretory, or absorptive functions are indicated for cells of probable neural origin."
