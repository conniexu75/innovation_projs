During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together with a high degree of uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population. The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n = 6,249) about risk perception of the Influenza A(H1N1) outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 28 - May 5, 2009). We find that after an initially high level of concern, levels of anxiety waned along with the perception of the virus as an immediate threat. Overall, our data provide evidence that emotional status mediates behavioral response. Intriguingly, principal component analysis revealed strong clustering of anxiety about swine flu, bird flu and terrorism. All three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty is likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that respondents' behavior varies in predictable ways. Of particular interest, we find that affective variables, such as self-reported anxiety over the epidemic, mediate the likelihood that respondents will engage in protective behavior. Understanding how protective behavior such as social distancing varies and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of epidemic control strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2004773866,"Improvements in life expectancy and quality of life for HIV-positive women coupled with reduced vertical transmission will likely lead numerous HIV-positive women to consider becoming pregnant. In order to clarify the demand, and aid with appropriate health services planning for this population, our study aims to assess the fertility desires and intentions of HIV-positive women of reproductive age living in Ontario, Canada.A cross-sectional study with recruitment stratified to match the geographic distribution of HIV-positive women of reproductive age (18-52) living in Ontario was carried out. Women were recruited from 38 sites between October 2007 and April 2009 and invited to complete a 189-item self-administered survey entitled ""The HIV Pregnancy Planning Questionnaire"" designed to assess fertility desires, intentions and actions. Logistic regression models were fit to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of significant predictors of fertility intentions. The median age of the 490 participating HIV-positive women was 38 (IQR, 32-43) and 61%, 52%, 47% and 74% were born outside of Canada, living in Toronto, of African ethnicity and currently on antiretroviral therapy, respectively. Of total respondents, 69% (95% CI, 64%-73%) desired to give birth and 57% (95% CI, 53%-62%) intended to give birth in the future. In the multivariable model, the significant predictors of fertility intentions were: younger age (age<40) (p<0.0001), African ethnicity (p<0.0001), living in Toronto (p = 0.002), and a lower number of lifetime births (p = 0.02).The proportions of HIV-positive women of reproductive age living in Ontario desiring and intending pregnancy were higher than reported in earlier North American studies. Proportions were more similar to those reported from African populations. Healthcare providers and policy makers need to consider increasing services and support for pregnancy planning for HIV-positive women. This may be particularly significant in jurisdictions with high levels of African immigration."
https://openalex.org/W2050564597,"The genome sequence is the “blue-print of life,” but proteomics provides the link to the actual physiology of living cells. Because of their low complexity bacteria are excellent model systems to identify the entire protein assembly of a living organism. Here we show that the majority of proteins expressed in growing and non-growing cells of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus can be identified and even quantified by a metabolic labeling proteomic approach. S. aureus has been selected as model for this proteomic study, because it poses a major risk to our health care system by combining high pathogenicity with an increasing frequency of multiple antibiotic resistance, thus requiring the development of new anti-staphylococcal therapy strategies. Since such strategies will likely have to target extracellular and surface-exposed virulence factors as well as staphylococcal survival and adaptation capabilities, we decided to combine four subproteomic fractions: cytosolic proteins, membrane-bound proteins, cell surface-associated and extracellular proteins, to comprehensively cover the entire proteome of S. aureus. This quantitative proteomics approach integrating data ranging from gene expression to subcellular localization in growing and non-growing cells is a proof of principle for whole-cell physiological proteomics that can now be extended to address physiological questions in infection-relevant settings. Importantly, with more than 1700 identified proteins (and 1450 quantified proteins) corresponding to a coverage of about three-quarters of the expressed proteins, our model study represents the most comprehensive quantification of a bacterial proteome reported to date. It thus paves the way towards a new level in understanding of cell physiology and pathophysiology of S. aureus and related pathogenic bacteria, opening new avenues for infection-related research on this crucial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2058237157,"With the advent of high-throughput technologies for measuring genome-wide expression profiles, a large number of methods have been proposed for discovering diagnostic markers that can accurately discriminate between different classes of a disease. However, factors such as the small sample size of typical clinical data, the inherent noise in high-throughput measurements, and the heterogeneity across different samples, often make it difficult to find reliable gene markers. To overcome this problem, several studies have proposed the use of pathway-based markers, instead of individual gene markers, for building the classifier. Given a set of known pathways, these methods estimate the activity level of each pathway by summarizing the expression values of its member genes, and use the pathway activities for classification. It has been shown that pathway-based classifiers typically yield more reliable results compared to traditional gene-based classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new classification method based on probabilistic inference of pathway activities. For a given sample, we compute the log-likelihood ratio between different disease phenotypes based on the expression level of each gene. The activity of a given pathway is then inferred by combining the log-likelihood ratios of the constituent genes. We apply the proposed method to the classification of breast cancer metastasis, and show that it achieves higher accuracy and identifies more reproducible pathway markers compared to several existing pathway activity inference methods."
https://openalex.org/W2019120380,"In this study we have profiled the free sterol content of cerebrospinal fluid by a combination of charge tagging and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, the most abundant cholesterol metabolites were found to be C(27) and C(24) intermediates of the bile acid biosynthetic pathways with structures corresponding to 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid (7.170 +/- 2.826 ng/ml, mean +/- S.D., six subjects), 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid (0.416 +/- 0.193 ng/ml), 7alpha,x-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid (1.330 +/- 0.543 ng/ml), and 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-en-24-oic acid (0.172 +/- 0.085 ng/ml), and the C(26) sterol 7alpha-hydroxy-26-norcholest-4-ene-3,x-dione (0.204 +/- 0.083 ng/ml), where x is an oxygen atom either on the CD rings or more likely on the C-17 side chain. The ability of intermediates of the bile acid biosynthetic pathways to activate the liver X receptors (LXRs) and the farnesoid X receptor was also evaluated. The acidic cholesterol metabolites 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid and 3beta,7alpha-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid were found to activate LXR in a luciferase assay, but the major metabolite identified in this study, i.e. 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid, was not an LXR ligand. 7Alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid is formed from 3beta,7alpha-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid in a reaction catalyzed by 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7), which may thus represent a deactivation pathway of LXR ligands in brain. Significantly, LXR activation has been found to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer disease (Fan, J., Donkin, J., and Wellington C. (2009) Biofactors 35, 239-248); thus, cholesterol metabolites may play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2003716266,"Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays important regulatory roles in bile acid, lipoprotein, and glucose homeostasis. Here, we have utilized Fxr−/− mice and mice deficient in scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), together with an FXR-specific agonist and adenovirus expressing hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α or constitutively active FXR, to identify the mechanisms by which activation of FXR results in hypocholesterolemia. We identify a novel pathway linking FXR to changes in hepatic p-JNK, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, and finally SR-BI. Importantly, we demonstrate that the FXR-dependent increase in SR-BI results in both hypocholesterolemia and an increase in reverse cholesterol transport, a process involving the transport of cholesterol from peripheral macrophages to the liver for excretion into the feces. In addition, we demonstrate that FXR activation also induces an SR-BI-independent increase in reverse cholesterol transport and reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption. Together, these data indicate that FXR is a promising therapeutic target for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease.

Interestingly, the liver appears to be particularly important in the hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic responses, as delivery of constitutively active FXR to the liver recapitulates the effects seen following oral gavage of the specific FXR agonist (14Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Activation of hepatic FXR modulates the expression of many hepatic genes involved in lipid homeostasis, including SR-BI (14Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) resulting in hypocholesterolemia following FXR activation remains to be determined. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, NR2A1), another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is constitutively active (17Gonzalez F.J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. 2008; 23: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and highly expressed in the liver, with lower levels in the kidney, intestine, and pancreatic β cells (18Drewes T. Senkel S.

More recently, generation of tissue-specific Hnf4α−/− mice has revealed that hepatic HNF4α, like hepatic FXR, is crucial for maintaining bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis (21Hayhurst G.P.

In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized cross-talk between FXR and HNF4α that results in increased hepatic expression of SR-BI and a reduction in plasma HDL. In addition, we show that activation of FXR increases reverse cholesterol transport via both SR-BI-dependent and -independent pathways and impairs intestinal cholesterol absorption. Together, the current studies have identified novel pathways that regulate FXR-mediated cholesterol homeostasis. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Both Fxr−/− mice, backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for 7 generations, and SR-BI−/− mice (on a mixed C57BL/6/129 background) have been described previously (13Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M.

Studies involved male mice that were fed a standard chow diet (NIH31 modified mouse/rat diet, catalogue no. 7013, Harlan Teklad). Where indicated, 10–12-week-old mice were gavaged with either vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, Sigma) or vehicle containing GW4064 (30 mg/kg, twice a day) for 6–8 days. Liver-specific Fxr−/− (l-Fxr−/−) mice and control littermates were gavaged with either vehicle or GW4064 (100 mg/kg) every 12 h for 24 h, as described previously (26Kim I. Ahn S.H. Inagaki T. Choi M.

All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at UCLA and Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (27Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Three days after isolation, hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus for 48 h prior to RNA extraction. AML12 cells were cultured as described previously (28Hubbert M.L. Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Edwards P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or SP600125 (25 μm) for the indicated times. SP600125 was purchased from Calbiochem. Whole cell lysates were analyzed using Western blot assays. Wild-type mice were treated with either vehicle or GW4064 (30 mg/kg, twice a day) for 7 days. Livers were homogenized in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Millipore, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, the cell lysates were fixed with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1%, sonicated, and precleared with protein A beads. Aliquots of the precleared, sheared chromatin were then immunoprecipitated using mouse IgG or anti-HNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After elution, the resulting DNA was used for qRT-PCR analysis. PCR primers for quantification of DR-1A-, DR-1B-, or DR-1C-containing DNA fragments of the SR-BI gene, a known DR-1 element in the Cyp8b1 gene, or a fragment that does not contain any DR-1 element at −9.4 kb of SR-BI gene are listed in supplemental Table 1. Three putative DR-1 response elements were identified in the mouse SR-BI gene using the NUBIScan computer algorithm. Oligonucleotides containing these putative DR-1s are shown in supplemental Table 2. EMSAs and competition studies were performed as described previously (29Lee H. Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Nelson S.F.

For supershift assays, in vitro transcribed HNF4α proteins were preincubated with HNF4α antibody for 30 min, prior to addition of radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes. HEK293 cells were plated in a 48-well plate and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

Relative luciferase activities were obtained after normalization to β-galactosidase activity. Plasma cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined as described previously (27Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For FPLC analysis, plasma from 7 to 8 mice was combined and 100–200 μl was used to determine plasma cholesterol lipoprotein profile (31Navab M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Reddy S.T. Hama S. Hough G.

The generation of Ad-VP16 and Ad-Fxrα2-VP16 has been described previously (14Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A similar approach was used to generate Ad-Fxrα1-VP16, Ad-Fxrα3-VP16, Ad-Fxrα4-VP16, Ad-Hnf1α, and Ad-Hnf4α using corresponding mouse cDNAs and adenoviral vector pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP (Stratagene). All the adenoviruses were grown in Ad-293 cells (Stratagene) and purified using an Adeno-X virus purification kit (BD Biosciences). To infect primary hepatocytes, adenovirus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and cells were harvested after 48 h. To overexpress genes in mice, 108–109 plaque formation units of adenovirus was transfused into each mouse via tail vein injection. In general, 6–7 days post-infection, mice were fasted for 6 h and then euthanized. RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR using SYBR Green Supermix and a real time PCR machine from Bio-Rad or Applied Biosystems. The primer sequences for qRT-PCR are provided in supplemental Table 3. Results were normalized to 36B4 mRNA. Whole liver lysates (14Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J.

HNF4α, p-JNK, JNK, and calnexin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase antibody was kindly provided by Dr. John S. Parks (Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC). C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle (5% DMSO, 20% Cremophor EL, 75% saline) or SP600125 (30 mg/kg) (Calbiochem). After 3 h, livers were collected and total protein lysates isolated for Western blot assay. The in vivo RCT was performed essentially as described previously (33Naik S.U. Wang X. Da Silva J.S.

Briefly, J774 macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA), grown in suspension in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin, were cultured in uncoated cell culture dishes. To load cells with [3H]cholesterol and acetylated LDL (acLDL), J774 cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol, and 25 μg/ml acLDL for 48 h, followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline and equilibration for 4 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and penicillin/streptomycin. Before injection, cells were pelleted and resuspended in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All the mice were caged individually with free access to water and food. To investigate the role of FXR activation in RCT, C57BL/6 mice were treated with either vehicle or GW4064 for a total of 7 days or infected with adenovirus expressing VP16 alone or FXRα2-VP16 for a total of 7 days. On day 5 of these experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of J774 cells (typically 5 × 106 cells) in Eagle’s minimum essential medium containing 6.5–10 × 106 cpm. Blood was collected at 24 and 48 h, and plasma 3H-labeled tracers were assayed using a liquid scintillation counter (LSC). Feces were collected continuously from 0 to 48 h. At the end of the experiment, mice were perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline. A portion of the liver was removed for lipid and RNA extraction. Approximately 100 mg of liver was homogenized in methanol, and lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) as described previously (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The lipids were collected, dried, and resuspended in toluene and counted in an LSC. Fecal cholesterol and bile acids (BAs) were extracted as described previously (33Naik S.U. Wang X. Da Silva J.S. Jaye M. Macphee C.H. Reilly M.P. Billheimer J.T. Rothblat G.H. Rader D.J. Circulation. 2006; 113: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In brief, the collected feces were weighed and soaked in distilled water (100 mg of feces per 1 ml of water) at 4 °C overnight. The next day, an equal volume of ethanol was added, and feces were homogenized. A 200-μl aliquot was counted in an LSC to establish 3H-labeled total sterols. To extract fecal cholesterol and BAs, 2 ml of homogenized samples were mixed with 2 ml of ethanol, a known amount of [14C]cholic acid (internal control), and 400 μl of 10 n sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The samples were saponified at 100 °C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and extracted three times with 9 ml of hexane. The extracts were combined and solvent evaporated, and extracts were resuspended in toluene. Fecal [3H]cholesterol was then determined using an LSC. The remaining aqueous portion of feces was acidified to pH 1–2 with HCl and then extracted three times with 9 ml of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined and solvent-evaporated, and extracts were resuspended in ethyl acetate. Fecal 3H-labeled BAs were then determined using an LSC. Intestinal cholesterol absorption was performed as described previously (35Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with either vehicle or GW4064 (30 mg/kg, twice a day) for a total of 8 days. On day 5, these mice were injected with 2.5 μCi of [3H]cholesterol in Intralipid (Sigma) via tail vein injection, followed by immediate gavage with 1 μCi of [14C]cholesterol in median-chain triglycerides (MCT oil, Mead Johnson, Evansville, IN). After 72 h, blood and tissue were collected. The percent of the intestinal cholesterol absorption was calculated using the following formula: (percent of intragastric dose ([14C]cholesterol) per ml plasma) ÷ (percent of intravenous dose ([3H]cholesterol) per ml plasma) × 100. Statistical significance was analyzed using unpaired Student’s t test or one- or two-way analysis of variance (GraphPad Prism software). Two-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the effect of GW4064 treatment in wild-type mice versus SR-BI−/− mice (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. 7, A and B); the data indicate that GW4064 treatment has significantly different effects in wild-type mice versus SR-BI−/− mice (p < 0.05). All the values are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.FIGURE 7Activation of FXR induces reverse cholesterol transport via SR-BI- dependent and SR-BI-independent pathways and reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption. A and B, SR-BI−/− mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were gavaged with either vehicle or GW4064 for 7 days (n = 5 mice per group). On day 5, these mice were injected intraperitoneally with J774 macrophages preloaded with [3H]cholesterol and acLDL. Feces were collected for 48 h. Fecal 3H-labeled total sterols (A) and [3H]cholesterol (B) were extracted and quantified. C, C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with either vehicle or GW4064 for a total of 8 days (n = 5–6 mice per group). On day 5, these mice were injected intravenously with 2.5 μCi of [3H]cholesterol, followed by immediate gavage with 1 μCi of [14C]cholesterol. After 72 h, the radioactivity in the blood was determined using an LSC. *, p < 0.05 versus vehicle treatment. D, model showing how activated FXR regulates blood HDL-C levels and RCT. Activation of FXR lowers plasma cholesterol levels by increasing plasma cholesterol clearance via the FXR-pJNK-HNF4α-SR-BI-HDL pathway and by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption. Activation of FXR inhibits Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and hepatic bile acid synthesis, which may in turn cause the following: (i) reduced hepatic JNK activity (p-JNK) and subsequent induction of hepatic HNF4α expression, and (ii) reduced hydrophobicity index of the bile acid pool and subsequent reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption. In addition, activation of FXR increases RCT via SR-BI-dependent and -independent (possibly ABCG5/ABCG8) pathways.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In agreement with earlier studies (14Zhang Y.

Analysis of the plasma by FPLC demonstrated that GW4064 treatment had no effect on HDL particle size, but specifically lowered the HDL-C levels of wild-type mice with little or no effect on plasma low density lipoprotein (Fig. 1A). Importantly, a decrease in HDL levels was also seen when non-human primates were treated with GW4064. 3T. Willson, personal communication. A similar reduction in plasma total cholesterol and HDL-C was also observed in mice that had been infected 7 days earlier with adenovirus expressing constitutively active isoforms of FXR (fusion proteins of Fxrα1, -α2, -α3, or -α4 with VP16) (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). Because adenovirus infection is essentially limited to the liver, these studies identify a crucial role for hepatic FXR in reducing plasma HDL levels. Consequently, we profiled a panel of hepatic genes involved in cholesterol metabolism following a 7-day treatment of wild-type mice with GW4064. Induced genes included SR-BI, Abcg5, Abcg8 and Shp, a known FXR target gene (Fig. 1B). GW4064 treatment of Fxr−/− (supplemental Fig. 1D) or liver-specific Fxr knock-out (ΔL) mice (Fig. 1C) failed to induce hepatic SR-B1, Abcg5, Abcg8, or Shp mRNAs. In contrast, these same genes were induced following hepatic expression of FXR-VP16 (supplemental Fig. 1E and data not shown). As expected (5Lee F.Y. Lee H. Hubbert M.L. Edwards P.A. Zhang Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 572-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 mRNA levels declined significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of GW4064 or Ad-FXR-VP16 treatment (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The specificity of these effects of FXR activation was further supported by the finding that mRNAs encoding the nuclear receptors liver receptor X receptor (Lxr), or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar) α, -β, -γ, or the SR-BI interacting protein Pdzk1 and the plasma protein levels of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, all known to modulate lipid metabolism, were all unaffected by GW4064 treatment (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Based on these data, we conclude that induction of hepatic SR-BI, Abcg5, and Abcg8 is dependent upon activation of hepatic FXR and that one or all of these genes may be responsible for the observed hypocholesterolemia. Importantly, Western blot analysis of liver homogenates demonstrated that SR-BI protein levels were significantly increased (2-fold; p < 0.05) after treatment of mice with either GW4064 or adenovirus expressing FXR-VP16 (Fig. 1D). Given the known role of SR-BI in regulating plasma HDL levels (38Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we next investigate whether SR-BI is required for the FXR-dependent reduction in plasma cholesterol levels. SR-BI−/− mice and their wild-type littermates (all on a C57BL/6/129 background) were treated with either vehicle or GW4064. As expected (25Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), vehicle-treated SR-BI−/− mice have increased levels of plasma total and HDL cholesterol compared with vehicle-treated wild-type mice (Fig. 2,"

However, under conditions of obesity, prolonged activation of the UPR has been shown to have deteriorating effects on different metabolic pathways. Here we identify Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), an evolutionary conserved ER-membrane protein, as a novel modulator of the obesity-associated alteration of the UPR. BI-1 partially inhibits the UPR by interacting with IRE1α and inhibiting IRE1α endonuclease activity as seen on the splicing of the transcription factor Xbp-1. Because we observed a down-regulation of BI-1 expression in liver and muscle of genetically obese ob/ob and db/db mice as well as in mice with diet-induced obesity in vivo, we investigated the effect of restoring BI-1 expression on metabolic processes in these mice. Importantly, BI-1 overexpression by adenoviral gene transfer dramatically improved glucose metabolism in both standard diet-fed mice as well as in mice with diet-induced obesity and, critically, reversed hyperglycemia in db/db mice. This improvement in whole body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity was due to dramatically reduced gluconeogenesis as shown by reduction of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression. Taken together, these results identify BI-1 as a critical regulator of ER stress responses in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance and provide proof of concept evidence that gene transfer-mediated elevations in hepatic BI-1 may represent a promising approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The best characterized inhibitors of Hsp90 target its ATP binding pocket, causing nonselective degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. Here, we show that the small molecule celastrol inhibits the Hsp90 chaperoning machinery by inactivating the co-chaperone p23, resulting in a more selective destabilization of steroid receptors compared with kinase clients. Our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that celastrol disrupts p23 function by altering its three-dimensional structure, leading to rapid formation of amyloid-like fibrils. This study reveals a unique inhibition mechanism of p23 by a small molecule that could be exploited in the dissection of protein fibrillization processes as well as in the therapeutics of steroid receptor-dependent diseases."

Mammalian TIM is essential for ATR-dependent Chk1 activation and S-phase arrest. We report that TIM is likewise essential for ATM-dependent Chk2-mediated signaling of doxorubicin-induced DNA double strand breaks. TIM depletion attenuates doxorubicin-induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and sensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. TIM is, thereby, a potential novel anticancer drug target whose inhibition may enhance the therapeutic cytotoxicity of agents that activate DNA damage pathways as part of their mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2104784323,"Neuroblastoma, a cancer derived from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system, is a major cause of childhood cancer related deaths. The single most important prognostic indicator of poor clinical outcome in this disease is genomic amplification of MYCN, a member of a family of oncogenic transcription factors.We applied MYCN chromatin immunoprecipitation to microarrays (ChIP-chip) using MYCN amplified/non-amplified cell lines as well as a conditional knockdown cell line to determine the distribution of MYCN binding sites within all annotated promoter regions.Assessment of E-box usage within consistently positive MYCN binding sites revealed a predominance for the CATGTG motif (p<0.0016), with significant enrichment of additional motifs CATTTG, CATCTG, CAACTG in the MYCN amplified state. For cell lines over-expressing MYCN, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for the binding of MYCN at promoter regions of numerous molecular functional groups including DNA helicases and mRNA transcriptional regulation. In order to evaluate MYCN binding with respect to other genomic features, we determined the methylation status of all annotated CpG islands and promoter sequences using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). The integration of MYCN ChIP-chip and MeDIP data revealed a highly significant positive correlation between MYCN binding and DNA hypermethylation. This association was also detected in regions of hemizygous loss, indicating that the observed association occurs on the same homologue. In summary, these findings suggest that MYCN binding occurs more commonly at CATGTG as opposed to the classic CACGTG E-box motif, and that disease associated over expression of MYCN leads to aberrant binding to additional weaker affinity E-box motifs in neuroblastoma. The co-localization of MYCN binding and DNA hypermethylation further supports the dual role of MYCN, namely that of a classical transcription factor affecting the activity of individual genes, and that of a mediator of global chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2067131610,"Neurons communicate with each other through synapses. To establish the precise yet flexible connections that make up neural networks in the brain, continuous synaptic modulation is required. The ubiquitin-proteasome system of protein degradation is one of the critical mechanisms that underlie this process, playing crucial roles in the regulation of synaptic structure and function. We identified a novel ubiquitin ligase, Fbxo45, that functions at synapses. Fbxo45 is evolutionarily conserved and selectively expressed in the nervous system. We demonstrated that the knockdown of Fbxo45 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons resulted in a greater frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. We also found that Fbxo45 induces the degradation of a synaptic vesicle-priming factor, Munc13-1. We propose that Fbxo45 plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmission by modulating Munc13-1 at the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2092152854,"Scales are collections of tones that divide octaves into specific intervals used to create music. Since humans can distinguish about 240 different pitches over an octave in the mid-range of hearing, in principle a very large number of tone combinations could have been used for this purpose. Nonetheless, compositions in Western classical, folk and popular music as well as in many other musical traditions are based on a relatively small number of scales that typically comprise only five to seven tones. Why humans employ only a few of the enormous number of possible tone combinations to create music is not known. Here we show that the component intervals of the most widely used scales throughout history and across cultures are those with the greatest overall spectral similarity to a harmonic series. These findings suggest that humans prefer tone combinations that reflect the spectral characteristics of conspecific vocalizations. The analysis also highlights the spectral similarity among the scales used by different cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1990586585,"Dissociating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands hold great promise for treating inflammatory disorders since it is assumed that they exert beneficial activities mediated by transrepression but avoid adverse effects of GR action requiring transactivation. Here we challenged this paradigm by investigating 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methyl-ethylammonium chloride (CpdA), a dissociating non-steroidal GR ligand, in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).CpdA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators in myelin-specific T cells and fibroblasts in a GR-dependent manner while gene activation was abolished. However, it also induced massive apoptosis in various cell types even in the absence of the GR by engaging a Bcl-2- and caspase-dependent pathway. (1)H NMR spectroscopy corroborated these findings by revealing that CpdA dissolved in buffered solutions rapidly decomposes into aziridine intermediates known to act as alkylating pro-apoptotic agents. Importantly, the dichotomy of CpdA action also became evident in vivo. Administration of high-dose CpdA to mice was lethal while treatment of EAE with low to intermediate amounts of CpdA dissolved in water significantly ameliorated the disease. The beneficial effect of CpdA required expression of the GR in T cells and was achieved by down regulating LFA-1 and CD44 on peripheral Th cells and by repressing IL-17 production.CpdA has significant therapeutic potential although adverse effects severely compromise its application in vivo. Hence, non-steroidal GR ligands require careful analysis prior to their translation into new therapeutic concepts."
https://openalex.org/W2056116819,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a multifactorial and genetically heterogeneous disease which leads to impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. The advanced form of disease causes acute cardiovascular, renal, neurological and microvascular complications. Thus there is a constant need to discover new and efficient treatment against the disease by seeking to uncover various novel alternate signalling mechanisms that can lead to diabetes and its associated complications. The present study allows detection of molecular targets by unravelling their role in altered biological pathways during diabetes and its associated risk factors and complications. We have used an integrated functional networks concept by merging co-expression network and interaction network to detect the transcriptionally altered pathways and regulations involved in the disease. Our analysis reports four novel significant networks which could lead to the development of diabetes and other associated dysfunctions. (a) The first network illustrates the up regulation of TGFBRII facilitating oxidative stress and causing the expression of early transcription genes via MAPK pathway leading to cardiovascular and kidney related complications. (b) The second network demonstrates novel interactions between GAPDH and inflammatory and proliferation candidate genes i.e., SUMO4 and EGFR indicating a new link between obesity and diabetes. (c) The third network portrays unique interactions PTPN1 with EGFR and CAV1 which could lead to an impaired vascular function in diabetic nephropathy condition. (d) Lastly, from our fourth network we have inferred that the interaction of β-catenin with CDH5 and TGFBR1 through Smad molecules could contribute to endothelial dysfunction. A probability of emergence of kidney complication might be suggested in T2D condition. An experimental investigation on this aspect may further provide more decisive observation in drug target identification and better understanding of the pathophysiology of T2D and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W2118520852,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in brain development and synaptic plasticity. It is synthesized as a precursor (pro-BDNF), sorted into the secretory pathway, transported along dendrites and axons, and released in an activity-dependent manner. Mutant Huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) and the V66M polymorphism of BDNF reduce the dendritic distribution and axonal transport of BDNF. However, the mechanism underlying this defective transport remains unclear. Here, we report that Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) interacts with the prodomain of BDNF and that the interaction was reduced in the presence of polyQ-expanded Huntingtin and BDNF V66M. Consistently, there was reduced coimmunoprecipitation of pro-BDNF with HAP1 in the brain homogenate of Huntington disease. Pro-BDNF distribution in the neuronal processes and its accumulation in the proximal and distal segments of crushed sciatic nerve and the activity-dependent release of pro-BDNF were abolished in HAP1(-/-) mice. These results suggest that HAP1 may participate in axonal transport and activity-dependent release of pro-BDNF by interacting with the BDNF prodomain. Accordingly, the decreased interaction between HAP1 and pro-BDNF in Huntington disease may reduce the release and transport of BDNF."

In this study, we used an integrative epigenetic screening approach to identify coordinately expressed genes in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose transcription is driven by promoter demethylation.Our screening approach found 290 significant genes from the over 47,000 transcripts incorporated in the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 expression array. Of the top 55 candidates, 10 showed both differential overexpression and promoter region hypomethylation in NSCLC. Surprisingly, 6 of the 10 genes discovered by this approach were CTAs. Using a separate cohort of primary tumor and normal tissue, we validated NSCLC promoter hypomethylation and increased expression by quantitative RT-PCR for all 10 genes. We noted significant, coordinated coexpression of multiple target genes, as well as coordinated promoter demethylation, in a large set of individual tumors that was associated with the SCC subtype of NSCLC. In addition, we identified 2 novel target genes that exhibited growth-promoting effects in multiple cell lines.Coordinated promoter demethylation in NSCLC is associated with aberrant expression of CTAs and potential, novel candidate protooncogenes that can be identified using integrative discovery techniques. These findings have significant implications for discovery of novel CTAs and CT antigen directed immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2098703221,"The majority of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients are over sixty years of age. With current treatment regimens, survival rates amongst these, and also those younger patients who relapse, remain dismal and novel therapies are urgently required. In particular, therapies that have anti-leukaemic activity but that, unlike conventional chemotherapy, do not impair normal haemopoiesis.Here we demonstrate the potent anti-leukaemic activity of the combination of the lipid-regulating drug bezafibrate (BEZ) and the sex hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) against AML cell lines and primary AML cells. The combined activity of BEZ and MPA (B/M) converged upon the increased synthesis and reduced metabolism of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) resulting in elevated levels of the downstream highly bioactive, anti-neoplastic prostaglandin 15-deoxy Delta(12,14) PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)). BEZ increased PGD(2) synthesis via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the lipid peroxidation pathway. MPA directed prostaglandin synthesis towards 15d-PGJ(2) by inhibiting the PGD(2) 11beta -ketoreductase activity of the aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3, which metabolises PGD(2) to 9alpha11beta-PGF(2alpha). B/M treatment resulted in growth arrest, apoptosis and cell differentiation in both AML cell lines and primary AML cells and these actions were recapitulated by treatment with 15d-PGJ(2). Importantly, the actions of B/M had little effect on the survival of normal adult myeloid progenitors.Collectively our data demonstrate that B/M treatment of AML cells elevated ROS and delivered the anti-neoplastic actions of 15d-PGJ(2). These observations provide the mechanistic rationale for the redeployment of B/M in elderly and relapsed AML."

In brain, all four β isoforms are widely expressed, yet little is known about their specific roles in neuronal functions. Here, we investigated the expression and targeting properties of β subunits and their role in membrane expression of CaV1.2 α1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed equal expression, and immunofluorescence showed a similar distribution of all endogenous β subunits throughout dendrites and axons. High resolution microscopy of hippocampal neurons transfected with six different V5 epitope-tagged β subunits demonstrated that all β subunits were able to accumulate in synaptic terminals and to colocalize with postsynaptic CaV1.2, thus indicating a great promiscuity in α1-β interactions. In contrast, restricted axonal targeting of β1 and weak colocalization of β4b with CaV1.2 indicated isoform-specific differences in local channel complex formation.

CaVs are composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit and the auxiliary α2δ and β subunits (1.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Whereas the α1 subunits are responsible for voltage sensing and ion conduction, the auxiliary subunits have been implicated in membrane targeting and modulation of channel properties (for review see Ref. 2.Arikkath J.

Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, the guanylate kinase fold is modified so that it can bind with high affinity to the so-called α-interaction domain (AID) in the intracellular I–II linker of CaV α1 subunits (28.De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29.Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The Src homology 3 and the guanylate kinase-like domains are highly conserved among the four genes encoding β subunits (Cacnb1–b4; Fig. 1C), whereas the sequence connecting these domains as well as the N and C termini are subject to alternative splicing (30.Colecraft H.M. Alseikhan B. Takahashi S.X. Chaudhuri D. Mittman S. Yegnasubramanian V. Alvania R.S. Johns D.C. Marbán E. Yue D.T. J.

When coexpressed with α1 subunits in heterologous expression systems, such as Xenopus laevis oocytes or human embryonic kidney cells, all four β isoforms modulate the current properties and cause a strong increase in the current density (17.Perez-Reyes E.

Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether association of a β subunit is also required for the membrane expression of CaVs in neurons. In skeletal muscle of a β-null zebrafish mutant, for example, this is not the case. There the CaVs are inserted in the membrane and normally target into the triads in the absence of a β subunit (34.Schredelseker J. Di Biase V. Obermair G.J. Felder E.T. Flucher B.E. Franzini-Armstrong C. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17219-17224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Due to the expression of multiple channel isoforms in pre- and postsynaptic compartments, subcellular targeting of CaVs in neurons is highly complex. To date, the only available studies indicate that different β subunits show differential pre- and postsynaptic localization and that this correlates with differential functions in synaptic plasticity (35.Wittemann S. Mark M.D. Rettig J. Herlitze S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37807-37814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36.Xie M. Li X. Han J. Vogt D.L. Wittemann S. Mark M.D. Herlitze S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to determine whether β subunits possess independent targeting properties for neuronal compartments and whether they are involved in the pre- and postsynaptic targeting of Ca2+ channels. Here, we addressed these questions using immunocytochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, and heterologous expression of epitope-tagged CaVs in cultured hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that all β isoforms are expressed at similar levels, display similar distribution patterns, and can colocalize with pre- and postsynaptic α1 subunits. Nevertheless, differences in axonal targeting and isoform-specific effects on membrane expression of CaV1.2 suggest the existence of preferential α1-β partners in neurons. Together our data demonstrate for the first time that in neurons the subcellular localization of β subunits primarily depends on their association with an α1 subunit, suggesting that β subunits are not involved in synaptic targeting of Ca2+ channels. On the other hand, as shown previously in heterologous cells, also in neurons the association of β subunits with the AID domain is essential for membrane expression of the postsynaptic CaV1.2. Low density cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from 16.5-day-old embryonic BALB/c mice as described previously (15.Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. Eur. J.

Plasmids were introduced into neurons on day 6 using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (15.Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. Eur. J.

For single transfection experiments (pβA-β-V5 constructs), 0.5–2 μg of DNA at a molar ratio of 1:1 were used, and for cotransfection experiments (pβA-eGFP, pβA-CaV1.2-HA, and pβA-βx-V5), 1–2.5 μg of total DNA at a molar ratio of 1:1 were used. Cells were immunostained and analyzed 6–19 days after transfection. All constructs were cloned into a eukaryotic expression plasmid containing a neuronal chicken β-actin promoter (pβA; see Refs. 15.Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. Eur. J.

Brain regions were dissected in cold Hanks' buffered saline solution, and total RNA was extracted from homogenized brain tissue using the RNeasy protect mini kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). To isolate RNA from hippocampal neurons, cultures (24 DIV) were harvested by trypsin treatment; total RNA was extracted as described above, and RNA concentrations were determined photometrically. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg (hippocampi) or 5 μl (cultured neurons) of RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (Promega, Madison, WI); the RT mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The relative abundance of different β transcripts was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using a standard curve method as described elsewhere (40.Koschak A. Obermair G.J. Pivotto F.

The following specific TaqMan gene expression assays, designed to span exon-exon boundaries, were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA): β1, Mm00518940_m1; β2, Mm00659092_m1; β3, Mm00432233_m1; and β4, Mm00521623_m1. The following primers (MWG Biotec, Ebersberg, Germany) were used for PCR amplification of assay-specific fragments using whole brain cDNA as a template (where F is forward and R is reverse): β1 F, 5′-gatcctctccatggtccagaa-3′, and β1 R, 5′-ctgcctccttccttaaggcttc-3′; β2 F, 5′-gactatctggaggcatactggaag-3′, and β2 R, 5′-ctctcttgggtttcagagtcaaa-3′; β3 F, 5′-cccatgtatgacgactcctacg-3′, and β3 R, 5′-acagtagctgacattggtcctcac-3′; β4 F, 5′-gctgattaagtccagaggaaagtc-3′, and β4 R, 5′-tgtctcattcgctgactctgtaat-3′. The integrity of the obtained fragments was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotec). To calculate standard curves, fragment concentrations were determined in a TECAN Genios Microplate Reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) using the Quant-IT PicoGreen double-stranded DNA reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard curves with 10-fold serial dilutions from 107 to 10 molecules of the respective fragment were generated for each assay. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate measurements using 20 ng of total RNA equivalents of cDNA and the specific TaqMan gene expression assay in a final volume of 20 μl in TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). To compare the relative expression of CaV β subunits between hippocampus and the cultured neurons, data were normalized to Hprt1 expression (Mm00446968_m1). Hprt1 was determined to be the most stable control gene among 7 genes tested (data not shown). Analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Neurons were fixed in pF (pF: 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose) in PBS at room temperature. Fixed neurons were incubated in 5% normal goat serum in PBS/BSA/Triton (PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were applied in PBS/BSA/Triton at 4 °C overnight and detected by fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (15.Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2109-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For staining of surface-expressed HA-tagged CaV1.2 constructs, living neurons were incubated with the rat anti-HA antibody for 30 min at 37 °C (42.Di Biase V. Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Altier C.

Then the cultures were rinsed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, fixed for 10 min with pF, blocked with normal goat serum, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h (15.Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2109-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For colocalization analysis of surface-expressed CaV1.2-HA constructs and cytoplasmic β subunits, live cell-stained neurons were postfixed for 5 min in pF. Then neurons were rinsed in PBS, permeabilized, blocked again with 5% normal goat serum in PBS/BSA/Triton, and subsequently incubated with the second primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed and mounted in p-phenylenediamine glycerol to retard photobleaching (44.Flucher B.E. Andrews S.B. Fleischer S. Marks A.R. Caswell A. Powell J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Preparations were analyzed on an Axiophot or an AxioImager microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc) using ×63, 1.4 NA, ×25, 0.8 NA, and ×16, 0.5 NA objectives. Images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera (SPOT; Diagnostic Instruments, Stirling Heights, MI) and Metavue image processing software (Universal Imaging, Corp., West Chester, PA). Images were arranged in Adobe Photoshop 9 (Adobe Systems Inc.), and linear adjustments were performed to correct black level and contrast. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rat monoclonal anti-HA (clone 3F10, 1:1,000 and 1:100 for live cell labeling; Roche Diagnostics); rabbit polyclonal anti-CaV1.2 (1:4,000; Sigma); rabbit polyclonal anti-CaV2.1 (1:2,000; Synaptic Systems); rabbit polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (1:20,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (1:400; Invitrogen); mouse monoclonal anti-synapsin 1 (clone 46.1, 1:2,000; Synaptic Systems); rabbit polyclonal anti-synapsin 1 and 2 (1:20,000 and 1:2,000 in combination with Alexa 350; Synaptic Systems); rabbit polyclonal anti-NaChpan (1:250; Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-β1 (1:10,000) and anti-β4 (1:250; both from Neuromab, Davis, CA); and rabbit polyclonal anti-β2 (1:500; polyclonal antibody 425) and anti-β3 (1:500; polyclonal antibody MM_2; both generous gifts from Dr. Flockerzi). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:2,000) and Alexa 594 (1:4,000); goat anti-rabbit Alexa 350 (1:500), Alexa 488 (1:4,000), and Alexa 594 (1:4,000); and goat anti-rat Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, 1:4,000). To analyze the effects of the coexpressed β subunits on the membrane expression of CaV1.2-HA, surface fluorescence intensity was measured in 17 DIV cultured neurons as described previously (42.Di Biase V. Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Altier C. Sanguesa J. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13845-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HA intensity values were expressed separately as percent of control for each individual experiment (transfection and culture preparation). For each condition, between 4 and 16 neurons were analyzed in each of three to seven independent experiments (culture preparations and transfections; Fig. 5E). To analyze the subcellular distribution of the heterologously expressed V5-tagged β subunits, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of the V5 stain in 13 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons. To this end, 14-bit gray scale images of the red (V5) and green (eGFP) channels of the neuron soma were acquired, and the V5 image was corrected for uneven illumination and the dark current of the camera. For each cell, a second image showing a segment of the axonal main branch at 1 mm distance from the soma was acquired and corrected accordingly. The corresponding eGFP image was used to distinguish the emerging axon from dendrites. A region of interest was manually traced around the soma, and 30-μm-long lines were placed along the proximal segments of one dendrite, the axon (representing the axon hillock), and along a distal segment of the axon 1 mm from the soma. Subsequently, the region intensities were recorded, and background was subtracted.

Open table in a new tab To analyze the degree of colocalization of CaV1.2-HA and β-V5 clusters, a Z-stack of three consecutive 14-bit gray scale images (interplane distance of 0.2 μm) of the corresponding red (live cell staining of CaV1.2-HA) and green (V5) color channels were acquired using Metavue software. Next, the images were aligned and deconvolved using ImageJ software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) as described previously (45.Di Biase V. Flucher B.E. Obermair G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 176: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Images were background-subtracted, and a region of interest was drawn around a dendritic segment. Colocalization was analyzed in ImageJ using two different methods: intensity correlation analysis (46.Li Q. Lau A. Morris T.J. Guo L. Fordyce C.B. Stanley E.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and distance-based colocalization (JACoP plugin in ImageJ; Ref. 47.Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean intensity correlation quotient ±95% confidence intervals and mean percentage ± 95% confidence intervals of CaV1.2-HA or β-V5 objects colocalizing with β-V5 or CaV1.2-HA, respectively. For each condition, the indicated number of 17 DIV neurons was analyzed from two independent experiments (culture preparations and transfections; Fig. 5B). To determine the colocalization of endogenous β subunits with synapsin, 14-bit gray scale images of the corresponding red and green color channels were acquired using Metavue software. Subsequently images were two-dimensionally deconvolved (Metamorph) and analyzed in ImageJ using distance-based colocalization (JACoP plugin in ImageJ; Ref. 47.Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). To analyze the distribution of the overall HA fluorescence along the dendrites of 18 DIV hippocampal neurons transfected with CaV1.2-HA and CaV1.2-HA (W440A), 14-bit gray scale images of the red (HA) and green (eGFP) channel were acquired using the ×25, 0.8 NA objective. For each neuron, the HA fluorescence intensity of 2–5 dendrites was recorded along a single pixel line reaching from the soma to the distal tips of the dendrite. The corresponding eGFP image was used to distinguish dendrites from axons. The intensity values of one dendrite were normalized to the average intensity of the proximal 10 μm of the same dendrite and the moving average of 10-μm-long bins was calculated for the entire length of the dendrite. Finally, the normalized intensity values were averaged between the dendrites of one neuron. Numbers (n) are 23 (normal) and 25 (W440A) neurons from four separate culture preparations. Analysis of dendritic spine HA and eGFP intensities in 18- and 25-DIV neurons was performed using a custom-designed Metamorph Journal (macro). Briefly, 14-bit gray scale images of the corresponding red (permeabilized staining of CaV1.2-HA) and green (eGFP) color channels were acquired using Metavue software. Corresponding images were aligned, and one dendritic segment of 20–50 μm length was selected for analysis. The HA and eGFP images were background-flattened and thresholded to trace fluorescent clusters (HA) and dendritic spines (eGFP) as accurately as possible. The thresholded eGFP images were transformed into a binary image, and a morphological filter (circular gradient) was applied to outline the edges of the dendritic spines. The binary and gradient images were added, and regions of interest were drawn around the dendritic spines and the dendritic shaft. Using the integrated morphometric analysis option of Metamorph, the spine size was measured in the binary eGFP image, and subsequently the regions of interest were transferred onto the HA and eGFP images to record the fluorescent inten"
https://openalex.org/W2145099250,"Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which autoreactive myelin-specific T cells cause extensive tissue damage, resulting in neurological deficits. In the disease process, T cells are primed in the periphery by antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are considered to be crucial regulators of specific immune responses and molecules or proteins that regulate DC function are therefore under extensive investigation. We here investigated the potential immunomodulatory capacity of the ATP binding cassette transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp generally drives cellular efflux of a variety of compounds and is thought to be involved in excretion of inflammatory agents from immune cells, like DCs. So far, the immunomodulatory role of these ABC transporters is unknown.Here we demonstrate that P-gp acts as a key modulator of adaptive immunity during an in vivo model for neuroinflammation. The function of the DC is severely impaired in P-gp knockout mice (Mdr1a/1b-/-), since both DC maturation and T cell stimulatory capacity is significantly decreased. Consequently, Mdr1a/1b -/- mice develop decreased clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Reduced clinical signs coincided with impaired T cell responses and T cell-specific brain inflammation. We here describe the underlying molecular mechanism and demonstrate that P-gp is crucial for the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Importantly, the defect in DC function can be restored by exogenous addition of these cytokines.Our data demonstrate that P-gp downmodulates DC function through the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, resulting in an impaired immune response. Taken together, our work highlights a new physiological role for P-gp as an immunomodulatory molecule and reveals a possible new target for immunotherapy."

Recognition of oxPCCD36 by scavenger receptors plays a role in several pathophysiological processes. The structural basis for the recognition of oxPCCD36 by CD36 and SR-BI is poorly understood. A characteristic feature of oxPCCD36 is an sn-2 acyl group that incorporates a terminal γ-hydroxy (or oxo)-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. In the present study, a series of model oxidized phospholipids were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to serve as ligands for CD36 and SR-BI. We demonstrated that intact the sn-1 hydrophobic chain, the sn-3 hydrophilic phosphocholine or phosphatidic acid group, and the polar sn-2 tail are absolutely essential for high affinity binding. We further found that a terminal negatively charged carboxylate at the sn-2 position suffices to generate high binding affinity to class B scavenger receptors. In addition, factors such as polarity, rigidity, optimal chain length of sn-2, and sn-3 positions and negative charge at the sn-3 position of phospholipids further modulate the binding affinity. We conclude that all three positions of oxidized phospholipids are essential for the effective recognition by scavenger receptors class B. Furthermore, the structure of residues in these positions controls the affinity of the binding.

Recognition of oxPCCD36 on the surface of cell membranes and lipoprotein particles by scavenger receptors class B plays an important role in several pathophysiological processes, including atherosclerosis and thrombosis. oxPCCD36 phospholipids mediate uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by macrophages via CD36 and promote a pro-thrombotic state via platelet scavenger receptor CD36 (1Podrez E.A.

Furthermore, oxPCCD36 interfere with SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of cholesteryl esters in hepatocytes (4Ashraf M.Z. Kar N.S. Chen X. Choi J. Salomon R.G. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. J. Biol.

These data demonstrate that oxidative stress and accumulation of specific oxidized phospholipids may have a detrimental effect due to specific interaction with scavenger receptors class B. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the recognition of oxPCCD36 by scavenger receptors class B is poorly understood.Initial studies have demonstrated that the sn-2 acyl group of oxPCCD36 that incorporates a terminal γ-hydroxy (or oxo)-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is essential for high affinity binding to CD36 (3Podrez E.A.

We have recently demonstrated that two lysine groups in CD36 (Lys-164/166) are indispensable for the binding of oxPCCD36 to CD36 (6Kar N.S. Ashraf M.Z. Valiyaveettil M. Podrez E.A. J. Biol.

These studies suggested an electrostatic interaction mechanism of the binding, where the negative charges in the oxidized phospholipids form salt bridges with the positive lysine groups in the binding domain of CD36. Further elucidation of the structural basis for the recognition of oxidized phospholipids by scavenger receptors class B is required to better understand the contribution of oxidative stress and specifically oxidized phospholipids to cardiovascular pathology.In the present study, a series of phospholipids having various functional groups at sn-1, -2, and -3 positions was designed, synthesized, and used to elucidate the structural basis for the recognition of oxPCCD36 by scavenger receptors CD36 and SR-BI. We demonstrated that a negative carboxylate at the terminal of sn-2 position of glycerophospholipid is sufficient to generate high binding affinity to class B scavenger receptors. However, we demonstrated that structural modifications of either of three parts of oxidized phospholipids at sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 positions can significantly modulate binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsTissue culture media and additives were purchased from Invitrogen. Na[125I] was supplied by ICN Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). [3H]DPPC were from American Radiolabel Chemicals, Inc.

Synthesis of phospholipids was performed as described in the supplemental Methods. The purity of the synthetic phospholipids was routinely assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and was found to be higher than 98%.MethodsGeneral ProceduresAll buffers were passed over a column of Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) and supplemented with diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid to remove any potential transition metal ions, which might catalyze LDL and phospholipid oxidation during incubation. Protein content was determined by the Markwell-modified Lowry protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (8Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal.

Vesicle size analysis was performed using a light-scattering particle analyzer equipped with a helium-neon laser (15 milliwatts), a goniometer (BI-240), and BI-9000 digital correlator (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY). Measurements were conducted at 25 °C, and data were collected at a scattering angle of 90°. The effective hydrodynamic diameters of vesicles made of various synthetic phospholipids were very similar.

The size, amount, and purity of the fusion proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight was found to be close to the predicted value, and purity was typically >95%.Direct Binding AssaysBinding of phospholipid vesicles to GST fusion proteins was assessed by incubating [3H]DPPC-labeled phospholipids vesicles (10 μm) with the glutathione-Sepharose-bound proteins (2.5 μg of protein/tube) in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Unbound phospholipid vesicles were removed by repeated washing of the beads with phosphate-buffered saline using low speed centrifugation, and then the bound radioactivity was quantified.Cholesteryl Ester Synthesis AssayThioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated and plated in 12-well cell culture clusters in RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum (10Hoppe G.

Results were expressed as the percentage of control binding and calculated as 100 × (r/c), where c is the radioactivity count in control samples incubated without synthetic phospholipids competitor and r is the radioactivity count in samples incubated with phospholipids competitor. The percentage of control binding versus log [synthetic phospholipids] data were plotted using Prism software (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA), and the IC50 values were calculated using nonlinear regression curve fitting with one-site competition.

Byzova T.V. Febbraio M. Salomon R.G. Ma Y. Valiyaveettil M. Poliakov E. Sun M. Finton P.J. Curtis B.R. Chen J. Zhang R. Silverstein R.L. Hazen S.L. Nat.

Chem. 2008; 283: 10408-10414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the mechanism of interaction with CD36 is mostly electrostatic and involves two conserved, positively charged amino acids in the binding site of CD36 (6Kar N.S. Ashraf M.Z. Valiyaveettil M. Podrez E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8765-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using specifically designed synthetic phospholipids, the present studies systematically investigated the structural basis for the recognition of oxidized phospholipids by two class B scavenger receptors: CD36 and SR-BI. We now demonstrate that the electrostatic interaction between the negative charges at the sn-2 position of phospholipids, and the positive charges in the scavenger receptor binding domain, is the most critical element of the recognition. We also showed that the negative charge at the sn-2 position requires the cooperation of both the sn-1 and sn-3 positions to promote the recognition. Finally, we found that a conjugated rigid structure at the sn-2 position, the presence of an additional negative charge at the sn-3 position, and chain length of both the sn-2 and sn-3 positions all modulate significantly the binding affinity.Recent studies on the conformation and orientation of oxidized phospholipids in cell membranes and oxidized lipoproteins demonstrated that the truncated polar sn-2 residue protrudes into the aqueous phase, making it accessible for the receptors (5Greenberg M.E.

Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This exposed sn-2 fatty acid moiety is very likely a prerequisite for detection of oxidized phospholipids by scavenger receptors. However, the present study clearly demonstrates that all three parts of the oxidized phospholipids play a critical role in the high affinity binding to class B scavenger receptors. Deletion of functional groups at any position, as in AcSPC, LysoPC, and PSG, leads to the loss of binding affinity to scavenger receptors class B. It is possible that all three positions of the oxidized phospholipids are required to maintain the proper conformation and orientation of the oxidized phospholipid molecule in the shell of oxLDL or oxidized phospholipids in the membrane. Our findings are similar to the report of the Berliner group, who reported that all parts of the oxidized phospholipid molecules are required for activation of endothelial cells (14Subbanagounder G. Leitinger N. Schwenke D.C. Wong J.W. Lee H. Rizza C. Watson A.D. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).The negative carboxylate group at the sn-2 position of phospholipids can form both salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the positively charged amino groups of lysines in the receptor binding domain, which can explain the higher binding affinity generated by the carboxylate group. Indeed, the role of positively charged lysines was demonstrated in the direct binding assay with mutated GST-CD36164A166A, where lysines were substituted with neutral alanines. GST-CD36164A166A showed only residual binding of oxidized phospholipids with a negative carboxylate group at sn-2 position.The contribution of γ-hydroxy (or oxo)-α,β-unsaturation at sn-2 position to binding activity of oxPCCD36 was not established before. In this study, we observed that the presence of γ-oxo-α,β-unsaturation is associated with noticeable increase in the binding activity. The electrophilic reactivity of some of oxPCCD36 was previously ruled out as playing a role in high affinity CD36 binding, because the relatively unreactive oxPCCD36 with γ-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated enoic acid groups at sn-2 position are excellent ligands (3Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The common carboxylic acid missing the γ-oxo-α,β-unsaturated double bond is less acidic with a much higher pKa (∼5). However, this probably does not play a significant role, because at physiological pH of 7.4, >99% of carboxylic acids with pKa of ∼5 would dissociate and exist in the form of the negative carboxylate group. Another difference between the γ-oxo-α,β-unsaturated carboxylate group and the common carboxylate group is that the former has more rigidity, because of its conjugated structure. Our data in Fig. 5 support the conclusion that rigidity could be the mechanism contributing to the higher binding affinity generated by the γ-oxo-α,β-unsaturated carboxylate group. Furthermore, the noticeable reduction in the binding activity of γ-hydroxy-containing oxPCCD36 compared with γ-oxo-containing oxPCCD36 (3Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) can now be explained by the lesser rigidity of the former. Our data in Fig. 2 also support the conclusion that additional polarity of sn-2 position as such does not play a significant role in the binding activity.In the present studies, CD36 and SR-BI were systematically compared in their recognition of phospholipids containing different functional groups. Generally speaking, CD36 and SR-BI show comparable binding affinity to various synthetic phospholipids, show limited binding affinity to neutral phospholipids, and exhibit much higher binding affinity to negatively charged oxidized phospholipids (Fig. 2). SR-BI has a slightly lower affinity for the oxidized phospholipids. This difference is especially clear for phospholipids of relatively low binding activity. Compared with CD36, SR-BI seems more sensitive to the chain length at the sn-2 position (Fig. 4B). Although CD36 still recognizes oxPC with a 1–4 carbon chain, SR-BI rapidly loses its recognition capacity when the sn-2 chain is shortened. This phenomenon suggests that SR-BI may be more selective in the recognition of ligands containing oxidized phospholipids compared with CD36. The binding domain of SR-BI for oxidized phospholipids has not yet been identified, thus it is not clear what may explain the binding differences of the two receptors.Many of the lipids tested in the current study are model lipids, and their presence in vivo is either unknown or unlikely. Nevertheless, the information inferred by this work can be applied to lipids that are observed in vivo. Two biologically active oxidized phospholipids, glutaroyl (PGPC) and oxovaleroyl phospholipid, were previously described by Berliner and coauthors (15Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Oxovaleroyl has a group in the sn-2 position that has a polarity similar to P6HHPC and P8HOPC; correspondingly, in its free nonprotein-bound form it has a weak affinity to CD36 as we showed earlier (1Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In contrast, PGPC possesses a carboxylate group at the sn-2 position, which, according to our results, suffices for recognition by class B scavenger receptors. Indeed, PGPC was found to be a good ligand for CD36 and SR-BI (Fig. 4B).Our present study adds new information useful for the development of phospholipid or small molecule analogs capable of inhibiting the uptake of oxLDL and foam cell formation mediated by scavenger receptors and, potentially, suppressing atherogenesis in vivo. According to our study, a phosphatidic acid derivative incorporating a long hydrophobic chain at the sn-1 position and a relatively rigid (a conjugated double bond can be used to strengthen the rigidity) 6–12 carbon chain with a terminal carboxylate group at the sn-2 position would be a strong inhibitor. Because oxidized phospholipids are hydrolyzed by phospholipase 2, having an sn-2 ether bond would significantly increase the in vivo stability of such a phospholipid. However, several additional considerations should be taken into account. We have shown previously that oxPCCD36 activates platelets via the scavenger receptor CD36. We have also found that oxPCCD36 may potentially inhibit reverse cholesterol transport due to interference with high density lipoprotein binding to SR-BI. Thus, the effects of such inhibitors on atherosclerosis in vivo need further systematic studies.In summary, the present systematic studies significantly extend the understanding about the structural factors governing the recognition of oxidized phospholipids by CD36 and SR-BI receptors. Our findings clearly demonstrate that, in addition to oxPCCD36, other oxidized phospholipids observed in vivo at sites of oxidative stress may be novel ligands for scavenger receptors class B.

One of the key factors for determining synaptic strength is the number of receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, which is maintained by the balance between cell surface insertion and endocytosis of the receptors. In this study, we investigated whether phospholipase C-related but catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) is involved in insulin-induced GABAA receptor insertion. Insulin potentiated the GABA-induced Cl− current (IGABA) by about 30% in wild-type neurons, but not in PRIP1 and PRIP2 double-knock-out (DKO) neurons, suggesting that PRIP is involved in insulin-induced potentiation. The phosphorylation level of the GABAA receptor β-subunit was increased by about 30% in the wild-type neurons but not in the mutant neurons, which were similar to the changes observed in IGABA. We also revealed that PRIP recruited active Akt to the GABAA receptors by forming a ternary complex under insulin stimulation. The disruption of the binding between PRIP and the GABAA receptor β-subunit by PRIP interference peptide attenuated the insulin potentiation of IGABA. Taken together, these results suggest that PRIP is involved in insulin-induced GABAA receptor insertion by recruiting active Akt to the receptor complex.

REDD1 expression is regulated by many stresses such as hypoxia, oxidative stress, and energy depletion. However, the regulation of REDD1 expression in response to insulin remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that in murine and in human adipocytes, insulin stimulates REDD1 expression. Insulin-induced REDD1 expression occurs through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mTOR-dependent pathways. Moreover, using echinomycin, a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) inhibitor, and HIF-1alpha small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates REDD1 expression only through the transcription factor HIF-1. In conclusion, our study shows that insulin stimulates REDD1 expression in adipocytes."

In two mutant strains, bts and its allele bts2, of the silkworm Bombyx mori, the larval head cuticle and anal plates are reddish brown instead of the white color found in the wild type. Positional cloning revealed that deletions in the Bombyx homolog of the Drosophila yellow-e gene (Bmyellow-e) were responsible for the bts/bts2 phenotype. Bmyellow-e mRNA was strongly expressed in the trachea, testis, and integument, and expression markedly increased at the molting stages. This profile is quite similar to that of Bmyellow, a regulator of neonatal body color and body markings in Bombyx. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that Bmyellow-e mRNA was heavily expressed in the integument of the head and tail in which the bts phenotype is observed.

In the ch mutants, the body color of neonatal larvae and the body markings of older instar larvae are reddish brown instead of normal black. Mutations at the so locus produce smoky larvae and black pupae.

We found that it is the Bombyx homolog of the Drosophila yellow-e gene (Bmyellow-e) and that independent deletions were responsible for the bts and bts2 mutations. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that Bmyellow-e mRNA was strongly expressed in the trachea, testis, and integument and that its expression markedly increased at the molting and newly ecdysed stages. Also, Bmyellow-e mRNA was detected at a high level in the integument of the head and tail in which the bts phenotype is observed.

Nohata J. Kadono-Okuda K. Narukawa J. Sasanuma M. Sasanuma S.I. Minami H. Shimomura M. Suetsugu Y. Banno Y. Osoegawa K. de Jong P.J. Goldsmith M.R. Mita K. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R21Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and the Bombyx genome sequence (supplemental Table 1) (18.The International Silkworm Genome ConsortiumInsect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). First, we roughly mapped the bts mutation using 109 F2 and 464 BC1 individuals and narrowed the bts-linked region to between the T7 ends of two bacterial artificial chromosome clones, 071M04 and 627E01 (Fig. 2A). This region was estimated to be 4.3 centimorgans long according to the SNP map (17.Yamamoto K. Nohata J. Kadono-Okuda K. Narukawa J. Sasanuma M. Sasanuma S.I. Minami H. Shimomura M. Suetsugu Y. Banno Y. Osoegawa K. de Jong P.J. Goldsmith M.R. Mita K. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R21Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this region, we identified six scaffolds, Bm_scaf92, Bm_scaf533, Bm_scaf175, Bm_scaf3492_contig58702, Bm_scaf131, and Bm_scaf21, using KAIKObase (Fig. 2B). By further mapping with primers on these scaffolds, we narrowed the bts-linked region to a position between 1,490,311 bp of Bm_scaf92 and the 28,906 bp of Bm_scaf131 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). This region was covered by two bacterial artificial chromosome clones, 073H08 and 075A23 (12.Ito K. Kidokoro K. Sezutsu H. Nohata J. Yamamoto K. Kobayashi I. Uchino K. Kalyebi A. Eguchi R. Hara W. Tamura T. Katsuma S. Shimada T. Mita K. Kadono-Okuda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and was estimated to be ∼300 kb in length (Fig. 2C). We predicted 12 bts candidate genes, BGIBMGA007217, 007218, 007219, 007220, 007221, 007222, 007236, 007237, 007238, 007253, 007308, and 007309, using a Chinese gene model search within the narrowed region (Fig. 2C). First, we investigated whether these candidate genes were expressed in the whole body of the day 0 3rd instar larvae. RT-PCR analysis showed evidence for expressions of 7 of the 12 candidate genes: BGIBM007218, 007222, 007236, 007237, 007238, 007253, and 007309 (data not shown). Next, we cloned and sequenced these seven genes and compared the sequences between wild-type (p50T, C108T, and u42) and bts strains (u49, w17, and w43). These data revealed that one of the genes, BGIBMGA007253, had a deletion in the open reading frame of all of the bts strains (data not shown). On the other hand, we did not detect any mutations in the coding regions of the other genes. Below, we characterize BGIBMGA007253 in detail as the candidate for bts. We first attempted to find expressed sequence tag clones corresponding to the bts candidate gene; however, we did not find the transcripts in any cDNA library. Therefore, we cloned and determined complete cDNA sequences of the bts genes from the wild-type (p50T), bts (u49), and bts2 (No. 743) strains. The wild-type candidate gene was 3691 bp long, potentially encoding a protein of 410 amino acids, and consisted of 8 exons and 7 introns (Fig. 3A). The open reading frame of the bts strain was spliced from exon 4 to exon 6 and lacked exon 5 (Fig. 3A). This deletion resulted in a frameshift mutation and generated a premature stop codon (Fig. 3A). DNA sequencing of the corresponding genomic region showed that deletion of exon 5 was due to insertion of the retrotransposon, non-long terminal repeat Kendo (Fig. 3, A and D) (19.Abe H. Seki M. Ohbayashi F. Tanaka N. Yamashita J. Fujii T. Yokoyama T. Takahashi M. Banno Y. Sahara K. Yoshido A. Ihara J. Yasukochi Y. Mita K. Ajimura M. Suzuki M.G. Oshiki T. Shimada T. Insect Mol. Biol. 2005; 14: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We observed that the open reading frame from the bts2 strain had an abnormal exon 6, which was 385 bp longer than that from the wild-type strain, and also caused a premature stop codon (Fig. 3A). Genomic sequencing revealed that the bts2 strain had a deletion of ∼6 kb, thus resulting in a loss of exons 7 and 8 (Fig. 3, A–C, and E). MOTIF and InterProScan searches suggested that this protein had an MRJP motif and a putative signal sequence (Fig. 3F). A portion of the MRJP motif was lacking in both of the bts and bts2 mutants (Fig. 3F), suggesting that it is a critical part of this protein responsible for the normal skin color phenotype in Bombyx. Together with these results, we concluded that this candidate is the gene responsible for the bts phenotype. A BLAST search revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the candidate gene showed high homology with the product of the Drosophila yellow-e gene. Phylogenetic studies using 22 Yellow proteins from D. melanogaster and B. mori indicated that this gene is a Bombyx homolog of Drosophila yellow-e (Fig. 4A), which we termed Bmyellow-e (B. mori yellow-e). BmYellow-e clustered with Yellow-e related proteins from dipteran insects such as fruit fly, mosquito, and wasp and was most closely related to that of the parasitic wasp, Nasonia vitripennis (Fig. 4B). Although yellow-e-related genes from some insects have been deposited in public data bases, their functions are still unknown. RT-PCR analysis of expression profiles of Bmyellow-e showed that it was strongly expressed in the trachea, testis, and integument in 5th instar larvae (Fig. 5A); furthermore, its expression increased markedly at the molting and newly ecdysed stages (Fig. 5B). These expression profiles are quite similar to those of Bmyellow, a Bombyx homolog of Drosophila yellow (9.Futahashi R. Sato J. Meng Y. Okamoto S. Daimon T. Yamamoto K. Suetsugu Y. Narukawa J. Takahashi H. Banno Y. Katsuma S. Shimada T. Mita K. Fujiwara H. Genetics. 2008; 180: 1995-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two genes coordinately play crucial roles in determining body color pattern in Bombyx. To examine spatial expression of Bmyellow-e in larval integument, we performed qRT-PCR analysis using cDNA prepared from the integument of five compartments (Fig. 6A), and we found that it was heavily expressed in head and anal plates, where reddish coloration occurs in the bts strain (Fig. 6B). Expression of Bmyellow has been shown to correlate with the presumptive black markings but not with the white striped region (9.Futahashi R. Sato J. Meng Y. Okamoto S. Daimon T. Yamamoto K. Suetsugu Y. Narukawa J. Takahashi H. Banno Y. Katsuma S. Shimada T. Mita K. Fujiwara H. Genetics. 2008; 180: 1995-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, although the temporal expression patterns of these two yellow genes are similar, their spatial regulation is different.FIGURE 6Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Bmyellow-e mRNA in the integument of five compartments.Upper figure shows the positions of the five compartments (1–5). Numbers correspond to those in the lower figure. Lower figure indicates the expression profiles of Bmyellow-e in the larval integument.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the mechanisms determining body color pattern in insects, we used a Bombyx color mutant, bts, in which the larval head cuticle and anal plates are reddish brown instead of the white color found in normal strains. Positional cloning revealed mutations in the candidate gene of bts and bts2 strains, both of which resulted in the generation of a truncated gene product. Homology searches and phylogenetic analysis revealed that this gene is Bmyellow-e, a Bombyx homolog of the Drosophila yellow-e gene. Together with mRNA expression profiles of Bmyellow-e, we concluded that BmYellow-e is required for the normal pattern of larval body color in Bombyx. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a role for yellow-e. Yellow is an essential protein for normal adult pigmentation patterns in Drosophila (4.Wittkopp P.J. True J.R. Carroll S.B. Development. 2002; 129: 1849-1858PubMed Google Scholar). Futahashi et al. (9.Futahashi R. Sato J. Meng Y. Okamoto S. Daimon T. Yamamoto K. Suetsugu Y. Narukawa J. Takahashi H. Banno Y. Katsuma S. Shimada T. Mita K. Fujiwara H. Genetics. 2008; 180: 1995-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) recently reported that Bmyellow is the gene responsible for the Bombyx ch mutant, thus suggesting that Yellow plays a crucial role in lepidopteran larval color patterns and that the function of Yellow in promoting black coloration is conserved in insects. Although 13 and 6 additional yellow genes have been found in the genomes of Drosophila (3.Drapeau M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Bombyx (20.Xia A.H. Zhou Q.X. Yu L.L. Li W.G. Yi Y.Z. Zhang Y.Z. Zhang Z.F. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 195Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), respectively, there are no reports elucidating the roles of other Yellow proteins in the formation of body color. In genetic studies using Drosophila mutants, Yellow-g and Yellow-g2 were shown to play catalytic roles in cross-linking of chorion and/or underlying vitelline membrane proteins; however, no phenotypic abnormalities in body color were reported in these mutants (21.Claycomb J.M. Benasutti M. Bosco G. Fenger D.D. Orr-Weaver T.L. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, biochemical studies using recombinant proteins provided evidence that the products of Drosophila yellow-f and yellow-f2 have dopachrome-conversion enzyme activity (6.Han Q. Fang J. Ding H. Johnson J.K. Christensen B.M. Li J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but their functions have not been examined genetically using loss-of-function mutants. Therefore, Yellow-e is a second Yellow protein that is involved in body color patterns in insects. Expression of Bmyellow-e was markedly increased at the molting stages (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this gene may be regulated by the molting hormone ecdysone. Interestingly, mRNA profiles of Bmyellow-e were very similar to those of Bmyellow (9.Futahashi R. Sato J. Meng Y. Okamoto S. Daimon T. Yamamoto K. Suetsugu Y. Narukawa J. Takahashi H. Banno Y. Katsuma S. Shimada T. Mita K. Fujiwara H. Genetics. 2008; 180: 1995-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), indicating that these two genes work concomitantly during the molting process and coordinately control the larval body color in Bombyx. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Bmyellow-e was heavily expressed in the head and anal plates where reddish coloration occurs in the bts strain, thus indicating that BmYellow-e functions in the integument of the larval head and tail. Sequencing of Bmyellow-e from the bts and bts2 strains showed that the MRJP domain of the bts strain was about 130 amino acids shorter than that of the bts2 strain (Fig. 3F). Moreover, the color of head and tail spots of the bts2 strain is darker than that of the bts strain (Fig. 1) (8.Banno Y. Fujii H. Kawaguchi Y. Yamamoto K. Nishikawa K. Nishisaka A. Tamura K. Eguchi S. A Guide to the Silkworm Mutants: 2005. Kyusyu University, Fukuoka, Japan2005: 1-30Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the degree of pigmentation in the head and tail spot likely results from the length or activity of BmYellow-e protein. Although we have no idea how the wild-type BmYellow-e induces white coloration, biochemical studies using recombinant protein will clarify its enzymatic function in larval pigmentation. There are about 40 spontaneous body color mutants in Bombyx (7.Fujii H. Banno Y. Doira H. Kawaguchi Y. Genetical Stocks and Mutations of Bombyx mori: Important Genetic Resources. 2nd Ed.

Here we report that the cellular targeting and Ca2+ signaling function of TRPC4 is determined by the state of cell-cell adhesions during endothelial phenotype transitions. TRPC4 surface expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) increased with the formation of cell-cell contacts. Epidermal growth factor recruited TRPC4 into the plasma membrane of proliferating cells but initiated retrieval of TRPC4 from the plasma membrane in quiescent, barrier-forming cells. Epidermal growth factor-induced Ca2+ entry was strongly promoted by the formation of cell-cell contacts, and both siRNA and dominant negative knockdown experiments revealed that TRPC4 mediates stimulated Ca2+ entry exclusively in proliferating clusters that form immature cell-cell contacts. TRPC4 co-precipitated with the junctional proteins β-catenin and VE-cadherin. Analysis of cellular localization of fluorescent fusion proteins provided further evidence for recruitment of TRPC4 into junctional complexes. Analysis of TRPC4 function in the HEK293 expression system identified β-catenin as a signaling molecule that enables cell-cell contact-dependent promotion of TRPC4 function. Our results place TRPC4 as a Ca2+ entry channel that is regulated by cell-cell contact formation and interaction with β-catenin. TRPC4 is suggested to serve stimulated Ca2+ entry in a specific endothelial state during the transition from a proliferating to a quiescent phenotype. Thus, TRPC4 may adopt divergent, as yet unappreciated functions in endothelial Ca2+ homeostasis and emerges as a potential key player in endothelial phenotype switching and tuning of cellular growth factor signaling.

Channels formed by the canonical transient receptor potential protein 4 (TRPC4) are expressed in endothelial cells and have repeatedly been suggested as key determinants of endothelial Ca2+ signaling and of endothelial functions, such as nitric oxide release and barrier stability (1Wakabayashi I.

Nonetheless, these authors confirmed a key role of TRPC4 as a determinant of endothelial proliferation. TRPC4 is a signaling molecule that is tightly associated with the actin cytoskeleton involving a C-terminal PDZ interaction domain, which determines membrane recruitment and cellular targeting of functional channels (6Mery L. Strauss B. Dufour J.F. Krause K.H. Hoth M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, besides its controversial role as an endothelial Ca2+ channel, TRPC4 has repeatedly been demonstrated to govern integrity of cell-cell junction, barrier function, and thus endothelial phenotype (3Tiruppathi C.

Depending on cell culture conditions, endothelial cells can adopt either a fibroblastoid, proliferative phenotype or, upon formation of cell-cell adhesions, the typical quiescent, epithelioid phenotype. This quiescent endothelial cell layer displays tight and adherens junctions, the latter providing adhesive strength necessary for holding cells physically together and allowing tight junctions to form and maintain (7Corada M.

Cell Tissue Res. 2009; 335: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and has been recognized to govern the molecular organization of membrane-associated signaling complexes. Adhesion contacts between endothelial cells are mainly mediated by a vascular endothelium-specific member of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules, VE-cadherin, which, like other classical cadherins, contains a cytoplasmic domain that is linked via catenin-type adaptor molecules to the cellular actin filament cytoskeleton (10Navarro P.

Pathol. 2000; 190: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both VE cadherin as well as β-catenin represent not only key components of endothelial junctional complexes and determinants of barrier function but also essential signaling molecules involved in “outside-in” signal transfer and a key determinant of endothelial proliferation and fate (12Vestweber D.

We hypothesized that such adhesion-mediated changes in the endothelial signaling network may interfere with TRPC4 function and set out to comparatively analyze cellular localization and function of TRPC4 in the absence and presence of cell-cell adhesion contacts. We report herein that the formation of cell-cell adhesions promotes recruitment of endothelial TRPC4 into plasma membrane complexes at cell-cell junctions and enables growth factor-dependent membrane presentation and Ca2+ entry through endothelial TRPC4 channels. Our results provide evidence for association of TRPC4 with junctional proteins and phenotype-dependent contribution of this cation channel to endothelial Ca2+ homeostasis.

HMEC-1 were cultured in MCDB131 (Invitrogen) containing 15% fetal calf serum (PAA, Pasching, Austria), 10 ng/ml EGF (BD Biosciences), and 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma). HEK293 cells (wild type) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum. HEK293 cells stably transfected with mTRPC4α (T4-60) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.25 g/liter Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). Transient transfections of DNA constructs and siRNA were performed either with Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) for transfection of HMEC-1 cells or with Transfast transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 or HMEC-1 cells have been transiently transfected with mTRPC4β (in pECFP-C1), either alone or in combination with GFP-β-catenin (in pEGFP-C1), kindly provided by R. M. Kypta (University College London) (19Giannini A.L. Vivanco M. Kypta R.M. J. Biol.

As a functional dominant negative form of TRPC4β (DNTRPC4), the truncated protein mTRPC4β-(1–292) (15Schindl R. Frischauf I. Kahr H. Fritsch R. Krenn M. Derndl A. Vales E. Muik M. Derler I.

Control transfections were performed using the pEYFP-C1 vector. siRNA sequences were GGAAG AGGAU GUGGA UACC (siTRPC4, according to Ref. 5Abdullaev I.F. Bisaillon J.M. Potier M. Gonzalez J.C. Motiani R.K. Trebak M. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and AGGUA GUGUA AUCGC CUUG (scrambled). The 19-mers were synthesized 5′-FAM (carboxyfluorescein)-labeled (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). For knockdown experiments, 1.5 μg of siRNA was transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol. For control experiments, cells were transected with a similar amount of scrambled RNA. Transwell plates (Corning Glass) with 6.5-mm diameter inserts and 0.5-μm pore size were coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). HMEC-1 cells were seeded with a density of 30,000 cells/well in parallel and in similar culture conditions as for biochemical experiments. TER was measured on subsequent days using the End-Ohm apparatus (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Resistance readings from blank poly-l-lysine-coated filters were subtracted from the readings from filters seeded with cells, and the difference was multiplied by the area (0.24 cm2). TER measurements were used to define cell culture conditions in terms of the prevailing endothelial phenotype (i.e. either proliferating cells that largely lack mature cell-cell adhesions, designated as the “subconfluent” state, and/or quiescent cells with established barrier function, designated as the “confluent state”). HMEC-1 cells were grown until they reached either 70% of confluence (subconfluent contact state) or until they formed a monolayer (confluent state) and preincubated for 20 min in serum-free MCDB131 in the presence or absence of EGF (100 ng/ml). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm CaCl2 (DPBS, pH 8) and incubated on ice for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) in DPBS. Washing the cells three times with ice-cold DPBS containing 10 mm glycine terminated the biotinylation reaction. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off from the dishes in PBS, and centrifuged at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (Protein Prep Kit, Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated proteins (500 μg) were isolated by adding to cell lysates 60 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) in a total volume of 0.5 ml of PBS. The reaction tube was gently rotated end over end overnight at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the pellets were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. The biotinylated cell surface proteins were eluted from the streptavidin-agarose beads in 60 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cell lysates from HMEC-1 were obtained as described above. HEK293 and T4-60 cells were transiently transfected with β-catenin-GFP or VE-cadherin-YFP. 48 h after the transfection procedure, proteins from cell lysates (500 mg) were suspended in a total volume of 0.5 ml of PBS, preincubated with 50 μl of either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce), and gently rotated for 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecific bound proteins. Precleared supernatants were incubated with 3 μg of antibody against either β-catenin, VE-cadherin, or GFP overnight at 4 °C under rotation. Subsequently, 50 μl of either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the immune complex for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were pelleted, washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates, biotinylated samples, and immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets using the iBLOT dry blotting system (Invitrogen). Nitrocellulose membranes were treated with polyclonal antibody either against TRPC4 (1:200; Alomone Laboratories, Israel or alternatively an anti-TRPC4 antibody kindly provided by V. Flockerzi) or antibody against GFP (1:1000; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, 1 h). Membranes were detected via Chemi Glow West detection system and developed using a Herolab RH-5.2 dark room hood, equipped with an E.A.S.Y 1.3 HC camera (Herolab GmbH, Wiesloch, Germany). HMEC-1 cells were grown on coverslips in different densities. Adherent cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed for 10 min in a solution containing 6.5 g/liter Na2HPO4, 4 g/liter NaH2PO4, 7% methanol, and 37% formalin at pH 7.0. After three washing steps, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-TRPC4 antibody (Alomone) in the presence of 5% goat serum for 6 h. Cells were washed again and incubated with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. For staining of nuclei, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 5 min in methanol. HMEC-1 or HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips, transiently transfected either with pEYFP-C1 vector or pEYFP-C1-mTRPC4β-(1–292) as described above, until they reached either the subconfluent or confluent state. Cells were loaded with fura-2/AM or fluo-3 in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), washed, and constantly perfused throughout experiments with buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (nominally Ca2+-free) or supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. For some experiments, HMEC-1 cells were preincubated for 20 min in MCDB131-free serum in the presence or absence of EGF (100 ng/ml). Thrombin stimulation of HEK293 cells was performed by incubation of cells for 5 min in nominally Ca2+-free solution. Ca2+ entry was typically initiated by elevation of extracellular Ca2+ subsequently to cell stimulation. Ca2+-sensitive fura-2/AM fluorescence was measured ratiometrically at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelength, and emission was collected at 510 nm. Digital image recordings were analyzed using Axon Imaging Workbench (Indec BioSystems, Santa Clara, CA). HEK293 cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips and transiently transfected with CFP-TRPC4 (donor), GFP-β-catenin (acceptor), or VE-cadherin-YFP (acceptor). A 488-nm solid-state laser and a 445-nm diode laser (Modu-Laser LLC, West Jordan, UT) were used for excitation. Because emission spectra of CFP- and GFP-labeled proteins showed a significant overlap, special calculations were performed to correct the images for the extended channel bleed-through (linear spectral unmixing (16Zimmermann T. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2005; 95: 245-265PubMed Google Scholar)). Channel bleed-through at different image intensity (fluorophore abundance) values has been determined by analyzing cells transfected with only one of the two labeled proteins. The percentage bleed-through values were then used to calculate the normalized channel intensity on a pixel-per-pixel basis (17Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A MultiSpec imager (Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany) was used for separating FRET images and was connected to a Photometrics CoolSNAP fx-HQ monochrome camera (Roper Scientific, Ottobrunn, Germany). This system was attached to an Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) in conjunction with a VisiChrome high speed polychromator (Visitron). Used filter sets (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) included a 485-nm cyan emission filter set (MultiSpec) and a 535-nm yellow emission filter set. MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA) was used to acquire images and to control the system. Images were analyzed using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). As a measure of co-localization of the fluorescent proteins, the fraction (percentage) of pixels displaying overlap of the two fluorophores was determined for certain areas of interest (total cell, nuclear region, and contact area) using ImageJ software. FRET images have been corrected for “cross-talk.” To achieve this, the corrected FRET image (FRET index) was calculated after background subtraction using the sensitized emission correction method according to the equation, FRET (index) = rawFRET − corrD*Idonator − corrA*Iacceptor. The calibration factors were obtained from experiments where only CFP, YFP, or GFP was expressed (CFP, corrD = 0.42; YFP, corrA = 0.13; GFP, corrA = 0.54). Representative results from 14–19 FRET experiments have been selected for illustration. To investigate the impact of endothelial phenotype switching on membrane presentation of TRPC4 channels, surface biotinylation experiments were performed with human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Surface expression of TRPC4 was clearly enhanced when cells formed cell-cell adhesions along with the transition from a proliferative (“subconfluent”) to a quiescent barrier-forming (“confluent”) state (Fig. 1A), displaying a maximum level of transendothelial resistance (Fig. 1B). Although a small overlap in terms of phenotype heterogeneity of both subconfluent and confluent populations may exist, barrier function was considered to correlate reasonably well with prevalence of mature cell-cell adhesions. Interestingly, EGF stimulation affected membrane presentation of TRPC4 in subconfluent and confluent cells in an opposing manner (Fig. 1A). EGF promoted recruitment of TRPC4 into the membrane surface of subconfluent cells but initiated removal of TRPC4 immunoreactivity from the membrane of barrier-forming endothelial cells. Because alternative splicing of TRPC4 has been demonstrated, we performed a set of Western blot experiments using an antibody provided by V. Flockerzi to elucidate the expression TRPC4 splice forms (18Flockerzi V. Jung C. Aberle T. Meissner M. Freichel M. Philipp S.E. Nastainczyk W. Maurer P. Zimmermann R. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in HMEC-1 and to obtain information on the relative contribution of the variants. These experiments suggested that the TRPC4 immunoreactivity observed in HMEC-1 corresponds mainly to the short (β) variant of the channel protein (data not shown). As a next step, we tested whether different stages during phenotype transition are associated with altered endothelial EGF-induced Ca2+ signaling. Fig. 2 illustrates Ca2+ signals obtained during Ca2+ readdition protocols. Basal Ca2+ entry into non-stimulated cells and in all endothelial phenotypes tested was negligible, as illustrated for subconfluent cells (Fig. 2). Importantly, in subconfluent populations, both single cells as well as proliferating clusters were present. Peak levels of intracellular Ca2+ obtained after Ca2+ readdition to EGF-stimulated cells were minute in single cells and highest in proliferating clusters, whereas confluent cells displayed rises in intracellular Ca2+ slightly smaller than that recorded in subconfluent proliferating cell aggregates. Consistent differences were detected by calculating the rate of rise in cellular Ca2+ levels initiated by Ca2+ readdition (Fig. 2B). Thus, the most prominent effect of phenotype switching was the substantial promotion of EGF-induced Ca2+ entry by the transition from a single, contact-deficient phenotype to a state of proliferating cell clusters. Interestingly, the prominent Ca2+ entry signals observed in proliferating cell clusters were for a large part mediated by TRPC4, as indicated by siRNA silencing experiments (Fig. 2A, inset). Attempts to localize the TRPC4 protein by immunocytochemistry revealed an intracellular, rather polar distribution in single cells, whereas TRPC4 was symmetrically distributed with clearly detectable immunoreactivity within basolateral contact regions in proliferating cell aggregates as well as in confluent cell layers. Typical images are shown in Fig. 2C. Cell phenotype and cell-cell adhesions therefore determine not only membrane presentation of TRPC4 but also agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling in HMEC-1. To further test the hypothesis of a phenotype- and cell contact-dependent contribution of TRPC4 to global Ca2+ homeostasis, we investigated the role of TRPC4 in cells of different phenotype by both dominant negative knockdown experiments and an siRNA knockdown approach. Contribution of TRPC4 channels to Ca2+ entry was tested by use of previously characterized dominant negative proteins (15Schindl R. Frischauf I. Kahr H. Fritsch R. Krenn M. Derndl A. Vales E. Muik M. Derler I. Groschner K. Romanin C. Cell Calcium. 2008; 43: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the results shown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, we anticipated a contribution of TRPC4 signaling either in proliferating, contact-forming cells (subconfluent/contact) or in confluent, barrier-forming cells. Nonetheless, we started with characterization of the effect of dominant negative TRPC4 inhibition in single, contact-deficient HMEC-1 (Fig. 3A, single). Ca2+ entry measured in single EGF-stimulated HMEC-1 was minute and not affected by expression of dominant negative TRPC4. To test for a contribution of TRPC4 to stimulated Ca2+ entry into single cells at an elevated level, we used thrombin as an alternative agonist (Fig. 3A). With thrombin as an agonist, dominant negative TRPC4 again failed to inhibit Ca2+ entry into single HMEC-1, and overexpression of full-length TRPC4 also did not affect Ca2+ signals. Thus, when HMEC-1 cells reside in a cell-cell contact-deficient, migrating state, TRPC4 is barely detectable in plasma membrane regions and appears to lack Ca2+ signaling function. By contrast, the large Ca2+ entry signals measured in EGF-stimulated cells that formed immature contacts within proliferating cell clusters (Fig. 3B) were dramatically reduced by expression of a dominant negative TRPC4 protein or siRNA knockdown of TRPC4. Surprisingly, cells that adopted a barrier-forming, quiescent state exhibited Ca2+ entry that was barely sensitive to either TRPC4 knockdown strategy (Fig. 3C). Hence, suppression of TRPC4 function affected agonist-induced Ca2+ entry into HMEC-1 exclusively in proliferating cells that formed clusters and immature cell-cell adhesions. Contribution of TRPC4 to global endothelial Ca2+ signaling appears not to be simply correlated with the channel's membrane presentation but rather restricted to a specific state of endothelial cell-cell coupling and phenotype. These data indicated the existence of a membrane-targeted TRPC4 complex that is obtained by establishment of immature cell-cell adhesions in proliferating cell clusters and is capable of mediating EGF-induced Ca2+ entry. We hypothesized that promotion of TRPC4 function in proliferating cell clusters may be based on the recruitment into specific signalplexes localized within immature adhesions. Hence, we next investigated the interactions of TRPC4 with junctional proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested association of TRPC4 with both VE-cadherin and β-catenin in HMEC-1. Fig. 4 shows the detection of TRPC4 in VE-cadherin and β-catenin precipitates from subconfluent as well as confluent HMEC-1 at basal and EGF-stimulated conditions. These experiments were performed with two different TRPC4 antibodies and yielded similar results. Association of TRPC4 with VE-cadherin was promoted by contact formation but diminished by EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A). Association with β-catenin was divergently regulated by EGF in subconfluent and confluent cells, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, interaction of TRPC4 with β-catenin was promoted by EGF stimulation in subconfluent cells but reduced in barrier-forming, confluent cells. Thus, not only membrane presentation and Ca2+ entry function of TRPC4 but also its interaction with junctional proteins and signalplex composition was determined by the endothelial phenotype. Because EGF stimulation of proliferating cells induced significant TRPC4-mediated Ca2+ entry along with profound TRPC4-β-catenin association, we considered β-catenin as a potential regulatory component of endothelial TRPC4 complexes. To further investigate cellular targeting of TRPC4 as well as of junctional proteins and to test for translocations associated with cell-cell contact formation, we performed fluorescence microscopy in cells transfected to express fluorescent fusion proteins of TRPC4 as well as of β-catenin and VE-cadherin. Because several attempts to generate suitable, properly targeted fusions of β-catenin with blue- or yellow-shifted GFP variants failed, we used the available GFP fusion along with a spectral unmixing approach (16Zimmermann T. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2005; 95: 245-265PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A illustrates the cellular localization of fluorescence-tagged TRPC4 (CFP) and β-catenin (GFP) when expressed individually in HMEC-1. Both proteins were barely targeted to the plasma membrane in single cells but tended to incorporate into cell-cell contacts upon cluster formation. Intracellular localization of the proteins was different, showing fairly uniform distribution for TRPC4 and a distinct pattern for β-catenin displaying fluorescence within nucleus-associated, rodlike structures, as previously reported (19Giannini A.L. Vivanco M. Kypta R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Giannini A.L. Vivanco M.M. Kypta R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B illustrates cellular targeting of TRPC4 and β-catenin in cells co-transfected to overexpress both proteins. In single, contact-deficient cells, the two proteins were found to co-localize within the intracellular compartment without detectable recruitment of the TRPC4 channel protein into the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). In cell clusters, both CFP-TRPC4 and GFP-β-catenin were redistributed to co-localize within cell-cell contact areas. Plasma membrane recruitment of CFP-TRPC4 was observed exclusively in contact-forming cells and appeared to be enhanced by β-catenin overexpression. Acute EGF stimulation of clustered HMEC-1 failed to produce further detectable changes in membrane targeting of CFP-TRPC4 (not shown). Because transfection rates of HMEC-1 were essentially low, we complemented our analysis of cellular localization and interaction of TRPC4 with junctional proteins by employing the HEK293 system, which allows efficient expression of fluorescent fusion proteins and has previously been proven useful in analyzing cell-cell coupling-dependent signaling mechanisms (21Kamei J.

https://openalex.org/W1969118871,"The use of nonselective pharmacological inhibitors has resulted in controversy regarding the mechanism and consequences of p38 activation during myocardial infarction. Classic p38 inhibitors such as SB203580 rely on a critical ""gatekeeper"" threonine residue for binding. We addressed these controversies by using mice in which the p38alpha alleles were targeted to cause substitution of the gatekeeper residue and resistance to inhibition. In homozygous drug-resistant compared with wild-type hearts, SB203580 failed to inhibit the activating phosphorylation of p38 or to reduce the infarction caused by myocardial ischemia. However, BIRB796, a p38 inhibitor not reliant on the gatekeeper for binding, similarly reduced p38-activating phosphorylation and infarction in both wild-type and knock-in mice, thereby excluding a nonspecific inhibitor-dependent phenotype resulting from the targeting strategy. Furthermore, the activation during myocardial ischemia involved phosphorylation of both the threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop of p38 despite the phosphorylation of the threonine alone being sufficient to create the epitope for dual phosphospecific antibody binding. Finally, SB203580 failed to reduce infarction in heterozygous drug-resistant hearts, suggesting that near complete inhibition of p38alpha kinase activity is necessary to elicit protection. These results indicate that, during myocardial ischemia, p38alpha (i) is the dominant-active p38 isoform, (ii) contributes to infarction, (iii) is responsible for the cardioprotective effect of SB203580, and (iv) is activated by a mechanism consistent with autodiphosphorylation despite this necessitating the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue by an archetypal serine/threonine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2150995202,"Background Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease that leads to specific loss of motor neurons. It is caused by deletions or mutations of the survival of motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1). The remaining copy of the gene, SMN2, generates only low levels of the SMN protein due to a mutation in SMN2 exon 7 that leads to exon skipping. Methodology/Principal Findings To correct SMN2 splicing, we use Adenovirus type 5–derived vectors to express SMN2-antisense U7 snRNA oligonucleotides targeting the SMN intron 7/exon 8 junction. Infection of SMA type I–derived patient fibroblasts with these vectors resulted in increased levels of exon 7 inclusion, upregulating the expression of SMN to similar levels as in non–SMA control cells. Conclusions/Significance These results show that Adenovirus type 5–derived vectors delivering U7 antisense oligonucleotides can efficiently restore full-length SMN protein and suggest that the viral vector-mediated oligonucleotide application may be a suitable therapeutic approach to counteract SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2004325596,"Elevation of the interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) of carcinoma is an obstacle in treatment of tumors by chemotherapy and correlates with poor drug uptake. Previous studies have shown that treatment with inhibitors of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling lowers the IFP of tumors and improve chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of PDGFR and VEGFR inhibitors could further reduce the IFP of KAT-4 human carcinoma tumors. The tumor IFP was measured using the wick-in-needle technique. The combination of STI571 and PTK/ZK gave an additive effect on the lowering of the IFP of KAT-4 tumors, but the timing of the treatment was crucial. The lowering of IFP following combination therapy was accompanied by vascular remodeling and decreased vascular leakiness. The effects of the inhibitors on the therapeutic efficiency of Taxol were investigated. Whereas the anti-PDGF and anti-VEGF treatment did not significantly inhibit tumor growth, the inhibitors enhanced the effect of chemotherapy. Despite having an additive effect in decreasing tumor IFP, the combination therapy did not further enhance the effect of chemotherapy. Simultaneous targeting of VEGFR and PDGFR kinase activity may be a useful strategy to decrease tumor IFP, but the timing of the inhibitors should be carefully determined."
https://openalex.org/W2118920769,"PACSIN/Syndapin proteins are membrane-active scaffolds that participate in endocytosis. The structure of the Drosophila Syndapin N-terminal EFC domain reveals a crescent shaped antiparallel dimer with a high affinity for phosphoinositides and a unique membrane-inserting prong upon the concave surface. Combined structural, biochemical and reverse genetic approaches in zebrafish define an important role for Syndapin orthologue, Pacsin3, in the early formation of the notochord during embryonic development. In pacsin3-morphant embryos, midline convergence of notochord precursors is defective as axial mesodermal cells fail to polarize, migrate and differentiate properly. The pacsin3 morphant phenotype of a stunted body axis and contorted trunk is rescued by ectopic expression of Drosophila Syndapin, and depends critically on both the prong that protrudes from the surface of the bowed Syndapin EFC domain and the ability of the antiparallel dimer to bind tightly to phosphoinositides. Our data confirm linkage between directional migration, endocytosis and cell specification during embryonic morphogenesis and highlight a key role for Pacsin3 in this coupling in the notochord."
https://openalex.org/W1978505427,"Obtaining a certain multi-functionality of cellular immunity for the control of infectious diseases is a burning question in immunology and in vaccine design. Early events, including antigen shuttling to secondary lymphoid organs and recruitment of innate immune cells for adaptive immune response, determine host responsiveness to antigens. However, the sequence of these events and their impact on the quality of the immune response remain to be elucidated. Here, we chose to study Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) which is now replacing live Smallpox vaccines and is proposed as an attenuated vector for vaccination strategies against infectious diseases.We analyzed in vivo mechanisms triggered following intradermal (i.d.) and intramuscular (i.m.) Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) administration. We demonstrated significant differences in the antigen shuttling to lymphoid organs by macrophages (MPhis), myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), and neutrophils (PMNs). MVA i.d. administration resulted in better antigen distribution and more sustained antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recruitment into draining lymph nodes than with i.m. administration. These APCs, which comprise both DCs and MPhis, were differentially involved in T cell priming and shaped remarkably the quality of cytokine-producing virus-specific T cells according to the entry route of MVA.This study improves our understanding of the mechanisms of antigen delivery and their consequences on the quality of immune responses and provides new insights for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2127770753,"Macrophage proliferation can be stimulated by phagocytosis and by cross-linking of Fcγ receptors (FcγR). In this study, we investigated the role of FcγR and the signaling cascades that link FcγR activation to cell cycle progression. This effect was mediated by the activating FcγR, including FcγRI and III, via their Fcγ subunit. Further investigation revealed that the cell cycle machinery was activated by FcγR cross-linking through downstream signaling events. Specifically, we identified the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway as a mediator of signals from FcγR activation to cyclin D1 expression, because cyclin D1 expression associated with FcγR cross-linking was attenuated by specific inhibitors of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, PD98059 and U0126 and the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, Piceatannol. Our findings establish a link between the ERK activation and cell cycle signaling pathways, thus providing a causal mechanism by which FcγR activation produces a mitogenic effect that stimulates macrophage proliferation. Macrophage mitosis following FcγR activation could potentially affect the outcome of macrophage interactions with intracellular pathogens. In addition, our results suggest the possibility of new treatment options for certain infectious diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and leukemias based on interference with FcγR-stimulated macrophage cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2009662125,"A growing body of evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species are critical components of cell signaling pathways, in particular regulating protein phosphorylation events. Here, we show that oxidative stress in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment of human epithelial cells induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation on multiple proteins. Using an anti-phosphotyrosine purification and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach, we have identified many of these H(2)O(2)-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Importantly, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src are the primary upstream kinases mediating these events through their redox activation. The finding that many of the identified proteins have functions in cell adhesion, cell-cell junctions, and the actin cytoskeleton prompted us to examine stress-induced changes in adhesion. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that H(2)O(2) alters cell adhesion structures and the actin cytoskeleton causing loss of adhesion and apoptosis. Remarkably, these cellular changes could be attenuated by inhibition of EGFR and Src, identifying these kinases as targets to block oxidative damage. In summary, our data demonstrate that EGFR and Src together play a central role in oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation, which in turn results in loss of adhesion, morphological changes, and cell damage in epithelial cells. These data also provide a general model for redox signaling in other cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W2004659174,"This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of the newly discovered 45-kDa enzymatically inactive UGT1A spliced polypeptides, named isoform i2, upon UGT1A-mediated glucuronidation. Initially, using an inducible system that mimics the relative abundance of isoforms 1 and 2 of UGT1A1 in human tissues, the rates of formation of glucuronides were significantly reduced. We then used a heterologous system constitutively expressing both isoforms i1 and i2 for an in-depth investigation of the presence of spliced i2 on glucuronidation kinetics. UGT1A1, UGT1A7, and UGT1A8 were selected as candidates for these studies. In all cases, co-expression of i1 and i2 in HEK293 cells leads to a significant reduction of the velocity of the glucuronidation reaction without affecting the affinity (K(m) (app)) for all substrates tested and the K(m) for the co-substrate, UDP-glucuronic acid. The data are consistent with a dominant-negative model of inhibition but do not sustain with an UGT1A_i2-mediated inhibition by competitive binding for substrate or the co-substrate. In contrast, the data from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments are indicative of the existence of a mixture homo-oligomeric (i1-i1 or i2-i2) and hetero-oligomeric (i1-i2) complexes in which the i2-i2 and i1-i2 subunits would be inactive. Thus, protein-protein interactions are likely responsible for the inhibition of active UGT1A_i1 by i2 spliced polypeptides. This new regulatory mechanism may alternatively modulate cellular response to endo/xeno stimulus."

This study identified three deposition disease-associated proteins as major plasma clients for clusterin by studying CLU-client complexes formed in response to physiologically relevant stress (shear stress, ∼36 dynes/cm2 at 37 °C). Analysis of plasma samples by size exclusion chromatography indicated that (i) relative to control plasma, stressed plasma contained proportionally more soluble protein species of high molecular weight, and (ii) high molecular weight species were far more abundant when proteins purified by anti-CLU immunoaffinity chromatography from stressed plasma were compared with those purified from control plasma. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses indicated that a variety of proteins co-purified with CLU from both stressed and control plasma; however, several proteins were uniquely present or much more abundant when plasma was stressed. These proteins were identified by mass spectrometry as ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, and albumin. Immunodot blot analysis of size exclusion chromatography fractionated plasma suggested that CLU-client complexes generated in situ are very large and may reach ≥4 × 107 Da. Lastly, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detected complexes containing CLU and ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, or albumin in stressed but not control plasma. We have previously proposed that CLU-client complexes serve as vehicles to dispose of damaged misfolded extracellular proteins in vivo via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

We reported here that cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis significantly increased the production of type I collagen in the inflamed bladder leading to increases in the bladder weight and the thickness of the bladder wall. The endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) in the urinary bladder regulated type I collagen expression because the neutralizing NGF antibody attenuated cystitis-induced type I collagen up-regulation in the inflamed bladder. Neutralizing NGF antibody also subsequently reversed cystitis-induced increases in bladder weight. Further studies on the intermediate signaling pathways mediating NGF-induced type I collagen expression in the inflamed bladder during cystitis revealed that Akt, JNK, and ERK1/2 activities were increased in the inflamed bladder, whereas p38 MAPK remained unchanged. Suppression of endogenous NGF level with neutralizing NGF antibody significantly blocked the increased activity of Akt, JNK, and ERK1/2 in the inflamed bladder during cystitis.

https://openalex.org/W1981685902,"Exogenous or endogenous beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists enhance alveolar epithelial fluid transport via a cAMP-dependent mechanism that protects the lungs from alveolar flooding in acute lung injury. However, impaired alveolar fluid clearance is present in most of the patients with acute lung injury and is associated with increased mortality, although the mechanisms responsible for this inhibition of the alveolar epithelial fluid transport are not completely understood. Here, we found that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), a critical mediator of acute lung injury, inhibits beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist-stimulated vectorial fluid and Cl(-) transport across primary rat and human alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers. This inhibition is due to a reduction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity and biosynthesis mediated by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent heterologous desensitization and down-regulation of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Consistent with these in vitro results, inhibition of the PI3K pathway or pretreatment with soluble chimeric TGF-beta type II receptor restored beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist-stimulated alveolar epithelial fluid transport in an in vivo model of acute lung injury induced by hemorrhagic shock in rats. The results demonstrate a novel role for TGF-beta1 in impairing the beta- adrenergic agonist-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance in acute lung injury, an effect that could be corrected by using PI3K inhibitors that are safe to use in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1979448186,"The important roles of a nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) are widely accepted in various biological processes as well as metabolic diseases. Despite the worldwide quest for pharmaceutical manipulation of PPARgamma activity through the ligand-binding domain, very little information about the activation mechanism of the N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) domain. Here, we demonstrate the molecular and structural basis of the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of PPARgamma activity by a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1. Pin1 interacts with the phosphorylated AF-1 domain, thereby inhibiting the polyubiquitination of PPARgamma. The interaction and inhibition are dependent upon the WW domain of Pin1 but are independent of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity. Gene knockdown experiments revealed that Pin1 inhibits the PPARgamma-dependent gene expression in THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Thus, our results suggest that Pin1 regulates macrophage function through the direct binding to the phosphorylated AF-1 domain of PPARgamma."
https://openalex.org/W2088355036,"Gli transcription factors are central effectors of Hedgehog signaling in development and tumorigenesis. Using a tandem affinity purification (TAP) strategy and mass spectrometry, we have found that Gli1 interacts with 14-3-3epsilon, and that Gli2 and Gli3 also bind to 14-3-3epsilon through homologous sites. This interaction depends on their phosphorylation, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a known negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling serves as a responsible kinase. A Gli2 mutant engineered to eliminate this interaction exhibited increased transcriptional activity (2 approximately 3x). Transcriptional repression by 14-3-3 binding was also observed with Gli3, when its N-terminal repressor domain was deleted. The phosphorylation sites responsible for the binding to 14-3-3 are distinct from those required for proteolysis, the known mechanism for PKA-induced repression of Hh signaling. Our data propose a novel mechanism in which PKA down-regulates Hedgehog signaling by promoting the interaction between Gli and 14-3-3 as well as proteolysis. Given the certain neuronal or malignant disorders in human caused by the abnormality of 17p13 encompassing 14-3-3epsilon overlap with increased Hh signaling, the Gli-14-3-3 interaction may have pathological significance for those human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2034072000,"Homocitrate synthase (HCS) catalyzes aldol-type condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to synthesize homocitrate (HC), which is the first and committed step in the lysine biosynthetic pathway through alpha-aminoadipate. As known in most enzymes catalyzing the first reactions in amino acid biosynthetic pathways, HCS is regulated via feedback inhibition by the end product, lysine. Here, we determined the crystal structures of HCS from Thermus thermophilus complexed with alpha-KG, HC, or lysine. In the HC complex, the C1-carboxyl group of HC, which is derived from acetyl-CoA, is hydrogen-bonded with His-292* from another subunit (indicated by the asterisk), indicating direct involvement of this residue in the catalytic mechanism of HCS. The crystal structure of HCS complexed with lysine showed that lysine is bound to the active site with rearrangement of amino acid residues in the substrate-binding site, which accounts for the competitive inhibition by lysine with alpha-KG. Comparison between the structures suggests that His-72, which is conserved in lysine-sensitive HCSs and binds the C5-carboxyl group of alpha-KG, serves as a switch for the conformational change. Replacement of His-72 by leucine made HCS resistant to lysine inhibition, demonstrating the regulatory role of this conserved residue."
https://openalex.org/W1968494119,"Despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), AIDS related lymphoma (ARL) occurs at a significantly higher rate in patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) than in the general population. HIV-infected macrophages are a known viral reservoir and have been shown to have lymphomagenic potential in SCID mice; therefore, there is an interest in determining if a viral component to lymphomagenesis also exists. We sequenced HIV-1 envelope gp120 clones obtained post mortem from several tumor and non-tumor tissues of two patients who died with AIDS-related Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (ARL-NH). Similar results were found in both patients: 1) high-resolution phylogenetic analysis showed a significant degree of compartmentalization between lymphoma and non-lymphoma viral sub-populations while viral sub-populations from lymph nodes appeared to be intermixed within sequences from tumor and non-tumor tissues, 2) a 100-fold increase in the effective HIV population size in tumor versus non-tumor tissues was associated with the emergence of lymphadenopathy and aggressive metastatic ARL, and 3) HIV gene flow among lymph nodes, normal and metastatic tissues was non-random. The different population dynamics between the viruses found in tumors versus the non-tumor associated viruses suggest that there is a significant relationship between HIV evolution and lymphoma pathogenesis. Moreover, the study indicates that HIV could be used as an effective marker to study the origin and dissemination of lymphomas in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2011830913,"Background Asymmetric cell divisions are involved in the divergence of the first two lineages of the pre-implantation mouse embryo. They first take place after cell polarization (during compaction) at the 8-cell stage. It is thought that, in contrast to many species, spindle orientation is random, although there is no direct evidence for this. Methodology/Principal Findings Tubulin-GFP and live imaging with a spinning disk confocal microscope were used to directly study spindle orientation in whole embryos undergoing the 8- to 16-cell stage transition. This approach allowed us to determine that there is no predetermined cleavage pattern in 8-cell compacted mouse embryos and that mitotic spindle orientation in live embryo is only modulated by the extent of cell rounding up during mitosis. Conclusions These results clearly demonstrate that spindle orientation is not controlled at the 8- to 16-cell transition, but influenced by cell bulging during mitosis, thus reinforcing the idea that pre-implantation development is highly regulative and not pre-patterned."

The nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2007 estimates 65 children died per 1,000 live births. We investigated rates and causes of under-five deaths in an urban community near two large pediatric hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh and evaluated the impact of different recall periods. We conducted a survey in 2006 for 6971 households and a follow up survey in 2007 among eligible remaining households or replacement households. The initial survey collected information for all children under five years old who died in the previous year; the follow up survey on child deaths in the preceding five years. We compared mortality rates based on 1-year recall to the 4 years preceding the most recent 1 year. The initial survey identified 58 deaths among children <5 years in the preceding year. The follow up survey identified a mean 53 deaths per year in the preceding five years (SD±7.3). Under-five mortality rate was 34 and neonatal mortality was 15 per thousand live births during 2006–2007. The leading cause of under-five death was respiratory infections (22%). The mortality rates among children under 4 years old for the two time periods (most recent 1-year recall and the 4 years preceding the most recent 1 year) were similar (36 versus 32). The child mortality in urban Dhaka was substantially lower than the national rate. Mortality rates were not affected by recall periods between 1 and 5 years."

RPA4 is an intronless gene on the X chromosome, and RPA4 homologs with complete coding sequences are only found in primates and horse.4 Initial analysis indicated that at least some human tissues express RPA4 protein, though its role in these tissues was not determined (5Keshav K.F.

In addition, studies of RPA2-depleted HeLa cells expressing RPA4 demonstrated that aRPA is not able to support S-phase progression.4 These findings raise the question of whether aRPA has any physiological function commonly associated with RPA. To address this question, we determined the level of expression of the RPA4 gene in normal and transformed human tissues and examined the ability of aRPA to function in nucleotide excision repair and recombination. Nucleotide excision repair is the main mechanism in humans for the removal from DNA of helix-distorting lesions induced by agents such as ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun (7Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

This multicomponent excision repair reaction requires a core six repair factors that recognize the lesion-containing DNA and make dual incisions bracketing the base adduct to remove (excise) the damaged base(s) in 24–32-nucleotide-long oligonucleotides. The resulting gap is filled and sealed by replicative DNA polymerases and ligases. Importantly, the nucleotide excision repair activity (excision nuclease) has been reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins (10Mu D. Park C.H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J.

We show that RPA4 is expressed in all normal human tissues examined but at different levels in different tissues. RPA4 expression is reduced in cancerous tissues and is very low in human cell lines. In addition, aRPA can support the dual incision/excision reaction, albeit less efficiently and by a different mechanism than RPA. aRPA can also support the initial steps of recombination such as Rad51-dependent DNA strand exchange. These results provide the first evidence for a physiological function of aRPA in human DNA metabolism. Recombinant RPA and aRPA were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified as described previously (6Mason A.C. Haring S.J. Pryor J.M. Staloch C.A. Gan T.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

Normal human RNA was purchased from Ambion as the FirstChoice Human total RNA survey panel, and tumor RNA was purchased from Ambion as FirstChoice Human Tumor RNA. cDNA was generated using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol using oligo(dT)16 and 2 μg total RNA in a 20-μl room temperature reaction. Quantitative PCR was carried out using a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the following primers and probes: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, primers 5′-GCACCACCAACTGCTTAGCA-3′ and 5′-GTCTTCTGGGTGGCACTGATG-3′ and probe 5′-TET-TCGTGGAAGGACTCATGACCACAGTCC-Black Hole Quencher-3′; RPA2, primers TTGTTTGAAGCTCAGAGGGAGAT-3′ and 5′-GGTAGCATCCTTCCAATTCCAT-3′ and probe 5′-6-FAM-CCCACCCTGGATTGCATCCC-Black Hole Quencher-3′; and RPA4, primers 5′-CTCATCAGGAAGGGAAGAGCAT-3′ and 5′- GCCCTCAACGGTCAGATAATCA-3′ and probe 5′-JOE NHS Ester-AGCTCCGGGCTCAGCTCTGC-Black Hole Quencher-3′. Data were analyzed using SDS2.3 software by Applied Biosystems. All data were compared using the comparative CT method (40Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25586) Google Scholar). All probe pairs amplify their target with equal efficiency (data not shown). All incubations were carried out at 25 °C as described previously (37Binz S.K. Dickson A.M. Haring S.J. Wold M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 11-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Wells in microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of RPA or aRPA or 1 μg of Rad51 or Rad52 in 50 μl of water and incubated for 1 h. Plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% Tween 20 three times to remove unbound protein. Plates were blocked with 300 μl of 5% milk in PBS for 10 min and washed. The indicated amount of XPA, RPA, aRPA, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to each well, incubated for 1 h, and washed. Primary antibodies in PBS with 5% milk for XPA (1:100), RPA/aRPA (1:300) were added to the plates, incubated for 30 min, and washed. Goat α-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000) in 50 μl of PBS with 5% milk was added to the plates, incubated for 30 min, and washed. Plates were developed using 200 μl of 0.8 mg/ml ο-phenylenediamine in 0.005 m phosphate citrate buffer with 0.03% sodium perborate. A450 was then quantified after 10–60 min using a microtiter plate reader. Background was determined for by using BSA as the secondary protein, and all data shown have these values subtracted. In all assays, the background values were similar and close to zero. The assay measures the release of base lesions in the form of 24–32-nucleotide-long oligomers (41Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). An internally 32P-labeled 140-bp DNA substrate containing a single centrally located (6-4) UV photoproduct was prepared as described (38Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by ligating an annealing six oligonucleotides, one of which was radiolabeled and contained a T-T (6-4) photoproduct. The oligomer containing the (6-4) photoproduct was from the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Core at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX). Sequences of the oligomers used are available upon request. Excision assays involved incubation of 5 fmol of substrate in a 10-μl reaction containing the essential excision repair factors (XPA, XPC, XPF-ERCC1, XPG, and TFIIH) and either RPA or aRPA, using conditions described previously (38Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Excision products were separated on DNA sequencing gels and detected with a PhosphorImager. The excision repair activity was quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). A “bubble substrate” containing a 20-nt-long bubble in the center of a 70-bp-long duplex was prepared as follows. A 70-mer single-stranded DNA (B20T2) was 3′ end labeled using 3′-[α-32P]dATP and terminal transferase (New England Biolabs). This labeled oligomer was purified from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and annealed to the 70-mer single-stranded DNA (B20C2), which contains 25 nucleotides (nts) of a complementary sequence flanking a central region of 20 nt of unpaired base pairs. The sequence of the B20T2 oligomer is shown below, where the underlined region indicates the noncomplementary bases: 5′-AGCCAGATCTGCGCCAGCTGGCCACCCTGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAGCGCCAAGCTTGGGCTGC-3′. The annealed substrate was purified from a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. To examine the structure-specific endonuclease activity of XPF-ERCC1, 5 fmol of substrate was incubated in 10 μl reaction buffer containing 7.5 ng of recombinant XPF-ERCC1 and the indicated amounts of either RPA or aRPA in reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 6.5% (v/v) glycerol. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. SDS (0.34%) and proteinase K (20 μg/ml) were then added and incubation continued at 55 °C for 15–30 min. The DNA was then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The recovered DNA was resuspended in formamide-dye loading mixture and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Incision products were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Conventional immunoblotting techniques were used to detect the indicated proteins using antibodies that recognize RPA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RPA2 (Calbiochem), RPA4 (Abnova), and maltose-binding protein (MBP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MBP-tagged XPA (1 μg) was immobilized on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and then incubated with either 1 μg of RPA or aRPA in 50 μl of binding buffer at 4 °C overnight. The resin was recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with binding buffer. Proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The upper portion of the gel was removed and stained with Coomassie Blue to detect MBP-XPA. The lower portion of the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed by immunoblotting to detect the RPA and aRPA subunits. pUC19 plasmid DNA was linearized by digestion with EcoRI and then biotinylated with biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) and Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs). The DNA was purified on a Qiagen column and then treated with 300 μm N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF) or ethanol (for unmodified DNA) for 3 h at room temperature in the dark. The AAAF treatment protocol yields ∼1 AAAF-guanine adduct every 200–250 bp of DNA, resulting in 10–14 lesions per plasmid (42Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13301-13306Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After ether extraction to remove the unincorporated AAAF, the DNA was precipitated in ethanol, dried, and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). To immobilize the DNA, 300 μl of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Invitrogen) were prewashed in PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated with 15 μg of biotinylated DNA in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl. Typical yields were ∼40–50 ng of DNA per μl of Dynabeads. Immobilized DNA was washed twice in reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% Nonidet P-40) before setting up binding reactions. Reactions (25 μl) were prepared in reaction buffer with the indicated combinations of XPA (20 ng), RPA (100 ng), and/or aRPA (100 ng) and either 25, 50, or 100 ng of immobilized DNA. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were collected on a magnet and washed three times with reaction buffer. The proteins associating with the DNA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For each experiment, gels were also loaded with standard amounts of XPA, RPA, and aRPA to quantify the relative amount of each protein associating with the DNA. Experiments were repeated six-to-eight times, and the averages and standard deviations were calculated and plotted. DNA strand exchange reaction (20 μl) was performed as described previously (39Carreira A. Hilario J. Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Shivji M.K. Venkitaraman A.R. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Briefly, 15 μm ϕX174 viral (+) strand (nucleotide) DNA was incubated with 3.75 μm Rad51 in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C. After 5 min, RPA or aRPA (1 μm) was added and incubation continued for 5 min. The reaction was started by addition of XhoI-linearized 32P-labeled ϕX174 double-stranded DNA (15 μm). After 2 h at 37 °C, the samples were treated with proteinase K (Roche) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (1× TAE (40 mm Tris base, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA)) at 40 V overnight. The gels were dried and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager using ImageQuant Software. The initial characterization of RPA4 by Keshav et al. (5Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) examined three human tissues for the presence of RPA4 protein. They showed that RPA4 protein was detectable in placental and colon tissue but not in kidney. If RPA4 is playing a general physiological role in cellular DNA metabolism, it would be expected to be expressed in a variety of tissues. To determine the normal distribution of RPA4, mRNA expression in a panel of human tissues was determined by quantitative PCR. Because it was not known which tissues normally express RPA4, initial studies were carried out on HeLa cells transiently expressing a plasmid containing RPA4 under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. These cells express RPA4 protein at high levels.4 PCR amplification of cDNA from untransfected and transfected HeLa cells were compared. mRNA levels for RPA2 and RPA4 were then compared using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference. HeLa cells transfected with the RPA4 plasmid express RPA4 at levels greater than endogenous RPA2 (Fig. 1A, right two columns). In contrast, mock-transfected HeLa cells do not have an appreciable amount of RPA4 mRNA (Fig. 1A). The endogenous level of RPA4 mRNA is close to the level of detection of this assay and may not be statistically significant. We also examined other stable human cell lines (for example HEK-293 and HepG2) and did not find significant expression of RPA4 in any of the lines tested (data not shown). RNA from 20 different tissues was analyzed for RPA2 and RPA4 expression. In agreement with the protein studies by Keshav et al. (5Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), RPA4 mRNA was detected at levels above RPA2 mRNA in placental tissue (Fig. 1A). RPA4 mRNA was also detected at levels similar to or above RPA2 mRNA in a number of tissues including bladder, colon, esophagus, lung, and prostate. In other tissues (brain, kidney, ovary, and spleen), RPA4 was expressed at levels <20% of the total middle subunit mRNA (RPA2 mRNA and RPA4 mRNA; Fig. 1A). The remaining tissues expressed RPA4 at intermediate levels. These results are consistent with an initial analysis of RPA4 protein levels in placental and colon tissues (data not shown) and the analysis performed by Keshav et al. (5Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar variations were observed for RPA2 mRNA (Fig. 1A). For example, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle all have low amounts of RPA2 mRNA compared with ovary, spleen, testes, and thyroid, which have the most RPA2 mRNA in the tissues sampled. We conclude that all normal tissues examined transcribe RPA4 at significant levels, and, although there is tissue specific variation, in many tissues, RPA4 mRNA levels are comparable with RPA2 mRNA. To determine whether RPA4 was also expressed in cancerous tissues, RNA from several types of tumors was examined. RPA4 mRNA was expressed at reduced levels in tumors from cervix, colon, kidney, and liver when compared with nonmatched normal tissue (Fig. 1B). In three of the four tissues compared, the levels of RPA2 mRNA increased. This is in agreement with the literature that has found increased expression of RPA in metastatic cancers (44Givalos N. Gakiopoulou H. Skliri M. Bousboukea K. Konstantinidou A.E. Korkolopoulou P. Lelouda M. Kouraklis G. Patsouris E. Karatzas G. Mod.

Fernández-Madrid F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 752-758PubMed Google Scholar). These data, together with the finding that RPA4 is not expressed at significant levels in stable cultured cell lines, suggests that RPA4 is down-regulated in transformed cells. This supports the hypothesis that RPA4 plays a role in normal tissues but not in tissues with a large fraction of proliferating cells. We next examined the ability of aRPA to interact with Rad51 and Rad52, which are required for homologous recombination. aRPA interacted with Rad52 at a level similar to RPA, even though Rad52-RPA interactions are mediated through both RPA1 and RPA2 (Fig. 2A) (32Jackson D. Dhar K. Wahl J.K. Wold M.S. Borgstahl G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to Rad52, aRPA exhibited a decreased interaction with Rad51 when compared with RPA (Fig. 2A). Rad51 also interacts with both RPA1 and RPA2 (30G"
https://openalex.org/W2160288730,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are infectious neurological disorders of man and animals, characterised by abnormal disease-associated prion protein (PrPd) accumulations in the brain and lymphoreticular system (LRS). Prior to neuroinvasion, TSE agents often accumulate to high levels within the LRS, apparently without affecting immune function. However, our analysis of scrapie-affected sheep shows that PrPd accumulations within the LRS are associated with morphological changes to follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and tingible body macrophages (TBMs). Here we examined FDCs and TBMs in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of scrapie-affected mice by light and electron microscopy. In MLNs from uninfected mice, FDCs could be morphologically categorised into immature, mature and regressing forms. However, in scrapie-affected MLNs this maturation cycle was adversely affected. FDCs characteristically trap and retain immune complexes on their surfaces, which they display to B-lymphocytes. In scrapie-affected MLNs, some FDCs were found where areas of normal and abnormal immune complex retention occurred side by side. The latter co-localised with PrPd plasmalemmal accumulations. Our data suggest this previously unrecognised morphology represents the initial stage of an abnormal FDC maturation cycle. Alterations to the FDCs included PrPd accumulation, abnormal cell membrane ubiquitin and excess immunoglobulin accumulation. Regressing FDCs, in contrast, appeared to lose their membrane-attached PrPd. Together, these data suggest that TSE infection adversely affects the maturation and regression cycle of FDCs, and that PrPd accumulation is causally linked to the abnormal pathology observed. We therefore support the hypothesis that TSEs cause an abnormality in immune function."

The thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent E1 component (E1ec, pyruvate dehydrogenase) is an α2 homodimer and carries out consecutively pyruvate decarboxylation and reductive acetylation of the E2 component (Equation 3). E2 (E2ec, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) has a dual function. Its covalently attached lipoamide is reductively acetylated by the E1 component and pyruvate, and subsequently, the acetyl group is transferred to coenzyme A (CoA), and the principal metabolic product acetyl-CoA is released (Equation 4). E3 (E3ec, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) has tightly bound FAD and NAD+; it regenerates the lipoamide from the reduced dihydrolipoamide form (Equation 5) (Scheme 1).Pyruvate+E1−ThDp−Mg(II)→E1−hydroxyethylidene−ThDp−Mg(II)+CO2(Eq. 2) E1−hydroxyethylidene−ThDp−Mg(II)+E2−lipoamide→E1−ThDp−Mg(II)+E2−acetyldihydrolipoamide(Eq. 3) E2−acetyldihydrolipoamide+CoA→E2−dihydrolipoamide+acetyl−CoA(Eq. 4) E2−dihydrolipoamide+E3−FAD→E2−lipoamide+E3−FADH2(Eq. 5) E3−FADH2+NAD→E3−FAD+NADH(Eq. 6) Our laboratory has been studying the PDHc from E. coli (PDHc-ec) as a representative of this large class of enzymes (6Jordan F.

In this paper we explored the possibility that regions too mobile to be seen in the x-ray structure may give rise to resolvable resonances in the NMR spectrum notwithstanding the size of E1ec (2 × 886 residues for an Mr of 200,000) (3Stephens P.E. Darlison M.G. Lewis H.M. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our expectations were met; we have for the first time made sequence-specific NMR assignments for six amino acids in the N-terminal region of E1ec, which was made possible by the presence of some remarkably sharp resonances in the two-dimensional HSQC spectra. In addition, we also assigned one glycine resonance in each of the two active center loops. In fact, the total number of observable resonances corresponds well to the number expected on the basis of sequence, and the NMR observations pertain virtually exclusively to the three flexible regions. These “reporters” from the three regions were then examined in the presence of (a) a reaction intermediate analog known to affect the mobility of the active center loops, (b) an E2 component construct consisting of a lipoyl domain and peripheral subunit binding domain (PSBD), (c) a peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the PSBD, and (d) the independently expressed lipoyl domain. The results show that the PSBD is the most important domain for recognition of E1 rather than the lipoyl domain. The results also correlate the functional and structural data from our laboratories.SCHEME 1Mechanism of the E1 and E2 components of PDHc-ec.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe Wizard® Plus Miniprep DNA purification system was used for purification of DNA (Promega, Madison, WI).

The XbaI and XhoI restriction sites were created at the beginning and at the end of the E1ec gene by site-directed mutagenesis (22Kale S. Characterization of the Dynamics of the E1 Component of the Escherichia coli Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Multienzyme Complex. Rutgers University, Newark, NJ2007Google Scholar). The DNA fragment of 2307 bp encoding E1ec was subcloned into the pET-22b(+) vector pretreated with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid pET-22b-E1ec (8028 bp) with His6-tag at the C-terminal end was transformed into the BL21(DE3) pLysS-competent cells.For His6-tag E1ec expression, the overnight culture from a single colony on the plate was inoculated into 5 flasks with 800 ml of LB medium in each containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and cells were grown for 1–2 h to reach an A650 = 0.800 at 37 °C. The temperature was lowered to 20 °C, and 0.50 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to start protein expression. Cells were collected after 4–5 h, washed with 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl, and stored at −20 °C. About 20 g of cells were collected from 4.0 liters of culture.The His6-tag E1ec was purified using a Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) according to the protocol supplied. Briefly, the cells were dissolved in 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing NaCl (0.10 m), ThDP (1 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), benzamidine HCl (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Lysozyme (final concentration of 0.60 mg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated 20 min on ice. To remove the nucleic acids, DNase (1000 units) and nuclease (500–1000 units) with 5 mm MgCL2 were added, and cells were incubated for an additional 1 h on ice. Cells were destroyed by sonication, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 28,978 × g for 30 min. The clarified supernatant was applied to the Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (5–10 ml volume). The His6-tag E1ec was eluted with elution buffer containing 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), NaCl (0.5 m), MgCl2 (2 mm), ThDP (1 mm), and 150 mm imidazole. The fractions containing His6-tag E1ec were collected, concentrated, and dialyzed against the 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing ThDP (0.20 mm), MgCl2 (2.0 mm), DTT (1.0 mm), EDTA (0.50 mm), and benzamidine hydrochloride (1 mm). Alternatively, the His6-tag E1ec can be additionally purified on a DEAE column (see below under “Uniform 15N labeling of His6-tag E1ec”).To create the Q18H, Q33H, and Q38H variants of His6-tag E1ec, the following primers were used (substituted bases are underlined): Q18H, 5′-CTCGCGACTGGCTCCATGCGATCGAATCG-3′; Q33H, 5′-GGTGTTGAGCGTGCTCATTATCTGATCGACCAACT-3′; Q38H, 5′-AGTATCTGATCGACCATCTGCTTGCTGAAGCCC-3′. To create the G402A and G542A variants of His6-tag E1ec, the following primers were used (substituted bases are underlined): G402A, 5′CGACGCGGCTGAAGCTAAAAACATCGCGC3′; G542A, 5′-TTACAGCCCGAACGCTCAGCAGTACACCC-3′.Construction of Plasmid, Expression, and Purification of C-terminal-truncated 1-lip E2ec1–190The pET-22b(+)-1-lipE2ec (6946 bp) plasmid encoding 1-lip E2ec was used as the template (18Wei W. Li H. Nemeria N. Jordan F. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 28: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the amplification primer 5′-GGTGGACTTCAGCTAATTTGGTGAAATCGAAGAAGTG-3′ (the mutated codon is underlined) and its complement were used for site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the TAA stop codon in place of Lys-191, which is located at the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain of the 1-lip E2ec. The 1-lip E2ec1–190 was well expressed in BL21(DE3) cells at 37 °C with no parental 1-lip E2ec detected by SDS-PAGE. The culture was grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin supplemented with 0.30 mm lipoic acid, and protein expression was induced by 0.50 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5–6 h at 37 °C. The expressed protein was purified using consecutively a DEAE anion exchange column and a G3000SW TSK size-exclusion column with a high performance liquid chromatography system. About 7 mg of protein was obtained from 6–7 g of E. coli cells (2.4 liters of LB medium). The identity of 1-lip E2ec1–190 was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing for nine amino acids: AIEIKVPDI.Preparation of Labeled E1ec Variants for NMR StudiesUniform 15N Labeling of His6-tag E1ec (23Muchmore D.C.

After 15 h of growth at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation (2236 g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed with M9 minimal medium (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 1g/liter of [15N]NH4Cl and sodium acetate (2 mm) to remove the traces of LB medium. The cells were collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 25–30 ml of the minimal medium, and inoculated into 700 ml of the minimal medium supplemented with [15N]NH4Cl. Cells were grown to A600 = 0.60–0.80 at 37 °C, then the temperature was lowered to 20 °C, and protein expression was induced by 0.50 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2 236 × g for 7 min and washed with 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 0.25 mm EDTA and 0.10 m NaCl and stored at −20 °C. The 15N-labeled E1ec was purified using Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast flow column similarly to that presented for His6-tag E1ec above. In addition, the 15N-labeled E1ec was purified using an anion exchange DEAE column and a 0–0.50 m gradient of NaCl in 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5). The protein was dialyzed against 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 0.20 mm ThDP, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, and 0.50 mm EDTA (dialysis buffer), concentrated using a Centriprep 30 (Millipore) concentrating unit, and stored at −20 °C. Approximately100 mg of purified 15N-labeled protein was obtained from 3.5 liters of culture.Selective 15N Labeling and 13C-15N Double Labeling of His6-tag E1ecSelective 15N and 13C,15N enrichment of glycine residues in E1ec was achieved by transformation of the pET-22(b)-E1ec plasmid into the E. coli strain AT2457 glycine auxotroph. The E. coli AT2457 super-competent cells were prepared using RbCa TXN SALTS. Cells were grown on the minimal salt medium supplemented with 18 unlabeled l-amino acids and 0.35 g·liter−1 [15N]glycine for 15N-selective labeling or 0.35 g·liter −1 [15N]glycine and 0.35 g·liter −1 of [1-13C]glycine for 13C,15N double-labeling of E1ec, similarly to that presented above for uniform 15N labeling of E1ec (25Rodríguez J.C.

Approximately 46 mg of protein was purified from 1.0 liters of culture.NMR SpectroscopySample Preparation for NMR StudiesThe concentration of His6-tag E1ec in the NMR sample was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate and adjusted to 20 mg/ml (subunit concentration = 211 μm) in 0.4 ml of dialysis buffer (see above), then 0.15 m NaCl and 7% D2O were added. The pH of the NMR samples was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of 0.15 m CH3COOH or 0.15 m NaHCO3.NMR SpectroscopyAll NMR experiments were performed on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer at 20 °C.

D2O (7%) was added before the NMR spectrum was recorded. Similar conditions and concentrations were used for the experiments on His6-tag E1ec in the presence of PSBD and lipoyl domain.Two-dimensional HSQC-TROSY NMR to Identify the Region of E1ec Interacting with C2α-phosphonolactyl-ThDPTwo-dimensional HSQC-TROSY spectra were recorded for the His6-tag E1ec and its G402A and G542A variants (20 mg/ml, concentration of subunits = 211 μm) in 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 0.20 mm ThDP, 2.0 mm MgCl2 1.0 mm DTT, and 0.50 mm EDTA. To identify the region of E1ec interacting with C2α-phosphonolactyl-ThDP (PLThDP), apoE1ec (20 mg/ml) was prepared by dialysis against 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 2.0 mm MgCl2 1.0 mm DTT, and 0.50 mm EDTA, and apoenzyme was titrated by CD to saturation with 1 mm PLThDP, then 0.15 m NaCl and 7% D2O were added for NMR experiment.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFunctional Evidence for the Importance of the Entire N-terminal E1ec Region in Its Interaction with E2ecThe sequences of E1 components from Gram-negative bacteria reveal a large percentage of highly conserved acidic amino acid residues in their N-terminal 1–55 region (13Park Y.H. Wei W. Zhou L. Nemeria N. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14037-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The patch of highly conserved positively charged residues in the PSBD of E2ec led us to hypothesize that the negatively charged residues in the N-terminal region of E1ec interact with the positively charged residues on the PSBD (32Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G. Structure. 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Earlier, we reported that the negatively charged residues in the N-terminal region of E1ec Asp-7, Asp-9, Glu-12, Asp-15, and a positively charged Arg-14 are important for the overall PDHc activity and for the interaction with E2ec (13Park Y.H. Wei W. Zhou L. Nemeria N. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14037-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To extend our study to the entire N-terminal E1ec region, the E21R, E26R, E27R, E30R, D37R, and E42R variants were created and analyzed. Because the nature of the substitution of the negatively charged residues such as Glu-12 to Arg, Asp, or Gln appeared to make a modest difference in the overall PDHc activity (Table 1), we created E1ec variants with Arg substitutions, assuming that substitution of the negatively charged residue to a positive will be informative.TABLE 1Kinetics and assembly of N-terminal-substituted E1ecN-terminal substitution in E1ecaItalics indicate data from Ref. 13.Overall PDHc activitybThe kcat for E1ec in the overall PDHc reaction after reconstitution with E2ec and E3ec was 90 s−1.E1-specific activitycThe kcat for E1ec in the model reaction with DCPIP was 1.20 s−1.Kd,MAPAbility to form E1-E2 complexd+, only E1ec-E2ec complex; + −, E1ec and E1ec-E2ec subcomplex.

Open table in a new tab Negatively Charged Residues in the Entire N-terminal Region of E1ec Have No Role in Either Formation of the First Covalent Intermediate or in DecarboxylationIn addition to the negatively charged residues studied earlier (Asp-7, Asp-9, Glu-12, Asp-15), Glu-27 and Glu-30 displayed low overall activity (2.7 and 2.9%, respectively) on reconstitution with E2ec-E3ec subcomplex (Table 1), whereas the others had activities of 69–100%. However, none of the substitutions in E1ec here reported produced significant activity reduction according to the E1-specific 2,6-dichlorophenolindopenol assay, suggesting that the reactions were little affected through decarboxylation (Scheme 1, reactions k1, k2, and k3). The addition of substrate analogue methyl acetylphosphonate (MAP) to ThDP to the E27R and E30R variants revealed formation of a tetrahedral intermediate PLThDP by CD via its 1′,4′-iminopyrimidine tautomeric form, as demonstrated before (33Jordan F.

These receptors are amply expressed in human blood vessels and participate in vascular tone control; however, their signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that in smooth muscle cells of isolated human chorionic arteries, the activation of the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) induces not only its partition into membrane rafts but also its rapid internalization. Cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced the association of the agonist-activated receptor into membrane rafts but did not affect either the UTP-mediated vasoconstrictions or the vasomotor responses elicited by both serotonin and KCl.

Rev. 2007; 87: 659-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). They are activated by either purines, such as ADP/ATP, or pyrimidines, including UTP, UDP, CTP, or UDP-glucose (3Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 166-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Moreover, P2YRs are pharmacological targets in processes like platelet aggregation and treatment of cystic fibrosis (4Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 58-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 5Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Boeynaems J.M. Barnard E.A. Boyer J.L. Kennedy C. Knight G.E. Fumagalli M. Gachet C. Jacobson K.A.

Both ADP and UTP have been recently recognized as signals involved in the contractility of the human vascular wall through the activation of P2Y1/2Rs (6Buvinic S. Briones R. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Buvinic S. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Delpiano A.M. Briones R. Miranda R. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 427-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In particular, the activation of P2Y1/2Rs by ADP, ATP, or UTP stimulates smooth muscle contraction in human chorionic arteries (HCA), whereas these nucleotides relax microvessels in the placental cotyledon through the release of nitric oxide (7Buvinic S. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Delpiano A.M. Briones R. Miranda R. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 427-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding its contribution to vascular smooth muscle tone, little is known about its cellular mechanisms. Microregionalization is a common feature of cell signaling. Clathrin-coated pits, caveolae, and membrane rafts contain high concentrations of signaling molecules. An array of GPCR has also been identified in caveolae or rafts (reviewed in Ref. 8Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In many cases, the receptor microregionalization is sensitive to ligand stimulation, altering the receptor clustering in or out of membrane rafts. We recently showed that in HCA, the P2Y1R-mediated vasocontractile activity depends on its association with membrane rafts (9Norambuena A. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Espinoza C.S. González A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although membrane rafts have been involved in signal transduction mediated by UTP (10Sugawara Y. Nishii H. Takahashi T. Yamauchi J. Mizuno N. Tago K. Itoh H. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), neither the P2Y2R cell membrane distribution nor the molecular mechanisms involved have been clarified. Membrane rafts are a dynamic assembly of cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and proteins, such as caveolin, flotillins, Src family kinases, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar, 12Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is a vital and major component of membrane rafts; it is known that its extraction with MβCD causes a loss in identifiable caveolae (13Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Westermann M. Steiniger F. Richter W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 123: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton also appears to play a role. Actin network disruption by latrunculin B, a toxin isolated from the red sponge Negombata magnifica (formerly Latrunculia magnifica), results in loss of the caveolae-F actin association (15Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4327-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Filamin, an actin cross-linking protein, is one of the proteins identified as ligand of caveolin-1 (16Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of the P2Y2R induces its association with filamin and actin reorganization in aortic SMC (17Yu N. Erb L. Shivaji R. Weisman G.A. Seye C.I. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of its increasing role in signal transduction, the mechanisms that govern organization of these microdomains are a matter of intense research and debate. Interestingly, recent data show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces the coalescence of different membrane rafts (18Hofman E.G. Ruonala M.O. Bader A.N. van den Heuvel D. Voortman J. Roovers R.C. Verkleij A.J. Gerritsen H.C. van Bergen En Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), making it likely that the EGF·EGF receptor (EGFR) complex also transregulates signaling pathway(s) mediated by several other physiological inputs. Connected to the role of P2Y1/2Rs in cell proliferation, cell migration, and vascular tone control (6Buvinic S. Briones R. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Br. J.

Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2175-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), EGF is also a key regulator in a variety of cellular systems. It binds to EGFR, triggering tyrosine kinase activity that results in the activation of several signaling proteins, such Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ pathways, leading to mitogenic events (24Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The EGFR also plays a role in vascular physiology. EGF induces contractility of vascular and gastric smooth muscles (24Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Berk B.C. Brock T.A. Webb R.C.

Pharmacol. 1985; 63: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of receptors for angiotensin and catecholamines results in transactivation of the EGFR, most probably by activation of metalloproteinases and release of EGFR ligands, such as HB-EGF (28Hao L. Du M. Lopez-Campistrous A. Fernandez-Patron C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), a process associated with smooth muscle cell growth and contraction, respectively (29Zhang H. Chalothorn D. Jackson L.F. Lee D.C. Faber J.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Thomas W.G. Brandenburger Y. Autelitano D.J. Pham T. Qian H. Hannan R.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To date, the P2Y1R and P2Y2R are the only nucleotide receptors clearly demonstrated to transactivate the EGFR (19Liu J. Liao Z. Camden J. Griffin K.D. Garrad R.C. Santiago-Pérez L.I. González F.A. Seye C.I. Weisman G.A. Erb L. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, it becomes possible to hypothesize that EGFR acts downstream of the P2Y2R signaling pathway to regulate nucleotide-induced vasoconstriction. The transactivation of the EGFR activity by GPCRs is a complex molecular process that governs many aspects of the cell fate (32Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 33Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), nevertheless, the question of whether EGFR in turn transregulates GPCR activity in intact human tissues is a challenging issue that remains to be addressed (34Chen Y. Long H. Wu Z. Jiang X. Ma L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that in the SMC of HCA, the P2Y2R is not associated with membrane rafts; however, selective receptor activation with 1 μm UTP results in its rapid partition to raft domains. Stimulation with higher UTP concentrations further caused the internalization of the P2Y2R, a finding concomitant with the fading of the UTP-evoked contractions in these human vessels. Membrane raft disruption by tissue cholesterol depletion resulted in reduction of the receptor mass associated with these microdomains, a procedure that nonetheless did not modify the UTP-induced vasomotor responses. Remarkably, partition of the P2Y2R into rafts and its internalization were found to depend on the activation of the EGFR and the actin cytoskeleton, implying RhoA and Rac1 GTPase activity. The vasomotor action elicited by P2Y2R activation was also dependent on the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. These results show for the first time that membrane distribution and the vasomotor activity of the P2Y2R are processes transregulated by the EGFR, revealing an unprecedented functional interplay between the P2Y2R and the EGFR in smooth muscle cells. ATP trisodium salt, ADP disodium salt, UTP trisodium salt, UDP disodium salt, uridine, serotonin (5-HT) as the hydrochloride salt, MβCD, and antiproteases were purchased from Sigma. MRS 2365 as the trisodium salt was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). AG1478, latrunculin B, and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem. Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences. For the preparation of buffers, we only used analytical grade reagents, which were obtained from Merck. Full-term placentas from normal pregnancies delivered vaginally or by caesarean section were derived from the maternity ward associated with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the School of Medicine at the P. Catholic University Clinical Hospital, Santiago. The ethics committees from the School of Medicine and the Faculty of Biology approved the experimental protocols using human tissues; the guidelines for the handling of human materials were strictly adhered to. Appropriate informed consent was obtained as requested by the School of Medicine Ethics Committee. Concerted actions with other investigators in our Department allowed a more complete study of this organ; whereas we dissected chorionic blood vessels, other colleagues used the cord or the body of the placentas for independent protocols. The corresponding ethical regulations were strictly adhered to. At least 60 placentas were used in the experiments reported in this study. Full-term placentas were transported to the laboratory within 5–15 min of childbirth; immediately thereafter, segments of superficial HCA were carefully dissected from the main body to perform the protocols. For some experiments, segments conserved an intact endothelium, whereas in other experiments, the vessel segments were manually denuded of the endothelial cell layer by gently rubbing the internal vessel surface with a cotton swab; this procedure was described to eliminate the internal endothelial layer without damaging the adjacent smooth muscle layer (35Valdecantos P. Briones R. Moya P. Germain A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Placenta. 2003; 24: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To perform other protocols, as will be specified separately, HCA vessel segments were perfused with one of the nucleotide receptor agonists for 1, 2, or 4 min; immediately thereafter, these vessel segments were placed in liquid nitrogen until further tissue processing. Functional assays were also performed to assess the biological activity of the P2Y2R upon challenge with selective nucleotide agonists or the removal of the tissue cholesterol. Each of these protocols will be detailed below. Detergent-free purification of membrane rafts and plasma membrane-enriched fraction isolation from HCA were done according to the methods described by Song et al. (36Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) and Smart et al. (37Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), respectively, and modified as we described previously (9Norambuena A. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Espinoza C.S. González A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Antibodies for the human P2Y1R were generated and characterized previously (7Buvinic S. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Delpiano A.M. Briones R. Miranda R. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 427-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antibodies against P2Y2R, P2X1R, RhoA, Cdc42, caveolin-3, flotillin-1, Gq, phospho-ERK, and Na+/K+ ATPase (β-subunit) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against Rac were from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO), and anti-ERK antibodies (pan-ERK) from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. These membranes were incubated with the specific antibodies to detect the indicated proteins and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL detection system (SuperSignal® West Femto, Pierce). Immunoblots were digitized in a VISTA-T630 UMax scanner driven by Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA); quantitative analysis was done with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). A 3–5-cm segment from the second bifurcation of the principal superficial chorionic artery was carefully dissected from the placental body. The tissue was immediately denuded of the endothelial cell layer as described previously (9Norambuena A. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Espinoza C.S. González A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immediately thereafter, one end of the vessel was cannulated with PE 190 tubing and perfused with 95% O2, 5% CO2 gassed Krebs-Ringer buffer maintained at 37 °C at a flow of 4 ml/min; the vessels were placed inside a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, keeping humid and warm the external surface of the tissue. In this way, the buffer bathed the inside and outside of the vessel during the ex vivo perfusion procedure. After an equilibrium period of 15–20 min, the tissues were perfused with 1 μm UTP for 4 min. Upon completion of the perfusion procedure, the tissues were rapidly dismounted from the perfusion set and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen until tissue processing for fractionation and sucrose gradient application as detailed above. Control experiments performed without freezing the tissue showed that these procedures did not alter the membrane raft localization of the P2Y2R and control proteins. To test the agonist specificity of the putative receptors, we next perfused separated artery segments for 4 min with one of the following nucleotides: 10 nm MRS 2365, 100 nm ADP, 1 μm UTP, or 1 μm uridine. Each of these studies was repeated in 3–4 separate vessels obtained from independent placentas. To examine whether the receptor microregionalization was altered by agonist activation and to assess the timing required for the P2Y2R to incorporate into raft domains, additional experiments were performed by perfusing 1 μm UTP for either 1, 2, or 4 min; immediately thereafter, blood vessels were immersed into liquid nitrogen for sucrose gradient centrifugation. To test the participation of actin cytoskeleton and the involvement of the EGFR on P2Y2R raft translocation, we perfused 100 nm latrunculin B or 100 nm AG1478 during 30 min. Next, UTP was added to a final concentration of 1 μm and perfused for another 4 min. The vessels were dismounted and processed as described previously. All these experiments were performed in Krebs-Ringer solutions gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C; protocols were repeated in at least 3–4 independent placentas. Parallel bioassays determined the course of the vasocontractile activity ensued by agonist application and the viability of the tissues; these protocols will be detailed below. Extraction and quantification of tissue cholesterol were done exactly as we described previously (9Norambuena A. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Espinoza C.S. González A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Intact segments of HCA were dissected from surrounding tissues; 0.3–0.5-cm width rings were carefully prepared for bioassays as previously detailed (9Norambuena A. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Espinoza C.S. González A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Muscular contractions were evoked with 1–2-min applications of increasing UTP concentrations; once the maximal contraction was reached, the agonists were rapidly rinsed, avoiding desensitization of the motor responses. To assess whether removal of the membrane cholesterol influenced the vasomotor responses elicited by UTP, the next series of experiments examined the effect of tissue incubation with 10 mm MβCD. These experiments were performed exactly as we described previously (9Norambuena A. Poblete M.I. Donoso M.V. Espinoza C.S. González A. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Once the rings reached the maximal contraction evoked by 70 mm KCl, 1 μm UTP was added to the tissue bath for less than 2 min to avoid tissue desensitization. Next, tissues were exposed to 10 mm MβCD for 90 min, after which the challenge with UTP was repeated. Results evaluated the contractile responses evoked by each vasomotor agonist before and after treatment with MβCD. In analogy to the observation of the loss of the vasomotor response following 10–100 μm UTP applications, an additional set of experiments analyzed the PM distribution of the P2Y2R in HCA segments perfused ex vivo with either 1, 10, or 100 μm UTP. The procedure for the PM assay of the P2Y2R was described above. To test the effects of AG1478 on the receptor internalization, we perfused Krebs-Ringer solution gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C containing 100 nm AG1478 for 30 min. Then UTP was added to a final concentration of 10 μm and perfused for another 4 min. RhoA activation was studied using as substrate the RhoA binding domain of rhoketin. Rac1 and Cdc42 were studied using as substrate the Pak1 binding domain. Both were contained in a glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (GST-RhoA binding domain and GST-Pak1 binding domain) kindly provided by Dr. Keith Burridge (University of North Carolina) (38Waterman-Storer C.M. Worthylake R.A. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Briefly, HCA segments were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C and a flow rate of 4 ml min−1 containing 1 μm UTP for 4 min. HCA segments were ground in a cold slab in the presence of pull-down buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to eliminate debris. The supernatant was sequentially incubated for 1 h with 30 μg of either GST-RhoA binding domain or GST-Pak1 binding domain coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to precipitate RhoA-GTP or Rac1-GTP (38Waterman-Storer C.M. Worthylake R.A. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Total RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 present in 30 μg of whole cell lysates used for loading controls and pulled down RhoA-GTP, Rac1-GTP, and Cdc42-GTP were detected by immunoblot using the respective monoclonal antibodies. To analyze the time dependence of GTPase activation mediated by UTP, HCA segments were perfused with 1 μm UTP for 0.5 and 1 min. Agonist perfusion and pull-down assays were done as described above. Similarly, studies were performed to evaluate the UTP concentration dependence for the GTPases activation. For this purpose, HCA segments were perfused with 1, 10, and 100 μm UTP for 4 min. Finally, to test the effects of AG1478 on the GTPase activity, we perfused Krebs Ringer solution gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C containing 100 nm AG1478 for 30 min. Then UTP was added to a final concentration of 1 μm and perfused for another 4 min. The vessels were dismounted and processed as described above. Nucleotide-induced isometric vasomotor responses were quantified as the tension developed by each agonist in intact vessel rings or vessels denuded of the endothelial cell layer. The motor responses were quantified as the tension force that was expressed in g of tension developed; results were generally normalized agonist the standard of 70 mm KCl used at the beginning of each bioassay. At least 4–6 separate rings were examined per agonist examined; the rings were derived each time from separate placentas. Statistical analysis used Student’s t test when appropriate or Dunnett’s tables for multiple comparisons with a single control. In all cases, a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Membrane rafts enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol are currently isolated by flotation in sucrose gradients as low density membranes. Analysis of the gradient’s fractions by Western blot indicated that the inactive P2Y2R did not associate with membrane rafts, as evidenced by its co-migration with the β subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase (n = 10), a non-membrane raft protein. As membrane raft markers, we showed that either flotillin-1 or caveolin-3, the muscle-caveolin variant (Fig. 1A), were consistently found floating in low density fractions containing 15–25% sucrose. In addition, protein Gq, the signaling partner of the P2Y2R (39Erb L. Liao Z. Seye C.I. Weisman G.A. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), was also partially localized in low density fractions (Fig. 1A). Densitometric analysis of the bands indicated that 100% (n = 10) of the total P2Y2R mass was excluded from the raft fractions (Fig. 1B). We also examined the distribution of two other nucleotide receptors. As much as 50 and 30% of the P2X1R and P2Y1R, respectively, were also found in low density fractions (Fig. 1C) (9Norambuena A.

https://openalex.org/W2095268637,"Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder with multiple susceptibility genes. We have previously reported suggestive linkage to the chromosomal region 14q21-q23 in Finnish SLE families. Principal Findings Genetic fine mapping of this region in the same family material, together with a large collection of parent affected trios from UK and two independent case-control cohorts from Finland and Sweden, indicated that a novel uncharacterized gene, MAMDC1 (MAM domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2, also known as MDGA2, MIM 611128), represents a putative susceptibility gene for SLE. In a combined analysis of the whole dataset, significant evidence of association was detected for the MAMDC1 intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs961616 (P –value = 0.001, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.292, 95% CI 1.103–1.513) and rs2297926 (P –value = 0.003, OR = 1.349, 95% CI 1.109–1.640). By Northern blot, real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, we show that MAMDC1 is expressed in several tissues and cell types, and that the corresponding mRNA is up-regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in THP-1 monocytes. Based on its homology to known proteins with similar structure, MAMDC1 appears to be a novel member of the adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgCAM), which is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and recruitment to inflammatory sites. Remarkably, some IgCAMs have been shown to interact with ITGAM, the product of another SLE susceptibility gene recently discovered in two independent genome wide association (GWA) scans. Significance Further studies focused on MAMDC1 and other molecules involved in these pathways might thus provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SLE."
https://openalex.org/W1969696916,"In plants, phytochromobilin synthase (HY2) synthesize the open chain tetrapyrrole chromophore for light-sensing phytochromes. It catalyzes the double bond reduction of a heme-derived tetrapyrrole intermediate biliverdin IXalpha (BV) at the A-ring diene system. HY2 is a member of ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs), which require ferredoxins (Fds) as the electron donors for double bond reductions. In this study, we investigated the interaction mechanism of FDBRs and Fds by using HY2 and Fd from Arabidopsis thaliana as model proteins. We found that one of the six Arabidopsis Fds, AtFd2, was the preferred electron donor for HY2. HY2 and AtFd2 formed a heterodimeric complex that was stabilized by chemical cross-linking. Surface-charged residues on HY2 and AtFd2 were important in the protein-protein interaction as well as BV reduction activity of HY2. These surface residues are close to the iron-sulfur center of Fd and the HY2 active site, implying that the interaction promotes direct electron transfer from the Fd to HY2-bound BV. In addition, the C12 propionate group of BV is important for HY2-catalyzed BV reduction. A possible role for this functional group is to mediate the electron transfer by interacting directly with AtFd2. Together, our biochemical data suggest a docking mechanism for HY2:BV and AtFd2."
https://openalex.org/W2067560764,"Recent genome-wide transcriptome studies suggest the presence of numerous bidirectional overlapping coding gene pairs in mammalian genomes. Various antisense RNAs are reported as non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of sense RNA. However, it is still unclear whether the expression of bidirectional overlapping coding genes are regulated by the opposite strand gene transcript acting as a non-coding RNA. Bop1 and Scx are a pair of bidirectional overlapping coding genes related to cellular proliferation and differentiation, respectively. Scx gene is localized in the intron 3 region of the Bop1 gene. The expression of these genes is reciprocally regulated by estrogen (E2) in the mouse uterus. In situ hybridization indicated that both genes are expressed in the uterine endometrial epithelial cells and that the antisense RNA of Scx (Bop1 intronic RNA) accumulates as a stable RNA in these cells. The existence of Bop1 intronic RNA was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and was increased after E2 treatment, coinciding with a decrease in Scx mRNA. Murine myoblasts expressing doxycycline-inducible endogenous Bop1 gene showed an increase in Bop1 intronic RNA and a simultaneous decrease in Scx mRNA. Murine fibroblasts expressing Scx mRNA from an exogenous Scx mini-gene indicated that the accumulation of Bop1 intronic RNA impairs the Scx gene expression in a trans-acting manner, which resulted in the reduction of the Scx mRNA level.

(5Numata K. Okada Y. Saito R. Kiyosawa H. Kanai A. Tomita M. Gene. 2007; 392: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggested six structural categories as follows: category 1, one transcription unit is completely overlapped within an exon of the transcription unit on the opposite strand; category 2, exonic regions overlap in convergent orientation; category 3, exonic regions overlap in divergent orientation; category 4, one transcript unit is completely overlapped within an intron of the transcription unit on the opposite strand; category 5, transcription units overlap in convergent orientation, but exonic regions do not overlap; category 6, transcription units overlap in divergent orientation, but exonic regions do not overlap. Studies focused on the exonic overlapping gene pairs (categories 1, 2 and 3) have suggested that double strand RNA can be derived from sense-antisense mRNAs (7Werner A.

Whether the expressions of bidirectional overlapping coding genes can be regulated by an opposite strand gene transcript acting like a non-coding RNA is still unclear. Bop1 and Scx are a pair of bidirectional overlapping coding genes located on mouse chromosome 15. The Scx gene consists of two exons and is embedded in the intron 3 region of the Bop1 gene (Fig. 1); therefore, based on the categorization defined above, this gene pair falls into category 4. Bop1 is a component of the nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex, is involved in 5 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA maturation (15Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5516-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and is necessary for the biogenesis of 60 S ribosomal subunit (16Lapik Y.R. Fernandes C.J. Lau L.F. Pestov D.G. Mol.

It is also involved in cell proliferation because reports show that a dominant negative mutation of Bop1 prevents cell proliferation (17Pestov D.G. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lau L.F.

On the other hand, Scx is a basic helix-loop-helix type transcription factor that regulates the function of differentiated cells, such as osteoblastic cells (19Liu Y. Nifuji A. Tamura M. Wozney J.M.

Studies using the Scx transgenic or knock-out mice predicted that the expression of Scx and Bop1 genes may affect each other (21Murchison N.D. Price B.A. Conner D.A. Keene D.R. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J.

The XbaI fragment (1.4 kb) from pCR2.1-c-Myc plasmid was cloned into pTRE vector (Clontech) at the XbaI site. The direction of the inserted fragment was confirmed by digestion with EcoRI and EcoRV. pTRE-mBop1-cDNA plasmid was constructed as follows. pCMV-SPORT6-mouse 4193123 plasmid that contains full-length mouse Bop1 cDNA (ATCC) was cut with SacII and XbaI, and the excised fragment (2.5 kb) was cloned into pTRE vector at the SacII and XbaI site.

Perez, Center for Functional Genomics University at Albany). The DNA fragment (+1 to +2392) and DNA fragment (−250 to +2392), respectively, of Scx gene were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (NIEHS sequencing core). All animals were handled according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and in compliance with an NIEHS, National Institutes of Health-approved animal protocol. OVX C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Groups of animals (six mice per group) were treated with sesame oil vehicle (Sigma-Aldrich) or with 1 μg of E2 (Steraloids, Newport, RI), either dissolved in 100 μl of sesame oil and injected subcutaneously (6-, 12-, and 24-h groups) or dissolved in 100 μl of normal saline and injected intraperitoneally (0.5-, 1-, and 2-h groups) before necropsy. In some cases, animals (four mice per group) were treated with 45 μg of ICI 182,780 (ICI; Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, UK) that was dissolved in 50 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and injected intraperitoneally, 30 min before E2 injection. Animals were euthanized at the indicated times using CO2, and uteri were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Uterine tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin before sectioning. Probes that corresponded to the mouse Bop1 and Scx genes were amplified by PCR using the following primers: Bop1 gene (AK079627), 5′-CCA TGC CGA GTC TTA CAA CCC ACC-3′ (nucleotides 913–936) and 5′-AGC AGC AAC ACG GCA TCA TCC ATG GC-3′ (reverse complement to nucleotides 1431–1406); Scx gene (BC062161), 5′-ACA CCC AGC CCA AAC AGA TCT GCA C-3′ (nucleotides 615–639) and 5′-CCA GGT AGA GAG CCA GCA TGG AAA GTC-3′ (reverse complement to nucleotides 960–934). A 570-bp length of plant-derived sequence (57.9% of guanine-cytosine content) was used for negative control (GENOSTAFF, Tokyo Japan). Probes (cRNA) labeled with digoxigenin were hybridized to the uterus tissue sections, and this procedure was followed by treatment with anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies and visualization by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (GENOSTAFF). C2C12 mouse myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-products, West Sacramento, CA), 1000 units/ml penicillin, and 1000 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Tet-On-C2C12 was established as follows. C2C12 cells were seeded in a 60-mm diameter dish for transfection. Transfection was performed by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pTet-On vector (Clontech) was transfected into the C2C12 cells. The cells were switched to fresh medium with 400 μg/ml G418 at 24 h after transfection. The medium was changed every 4 days for 3 weeks. To establish the Tet-On-Myc-C2C12 and Tet-On-mBop1cDNA-C2C12, Tet-On-C2C12 cells were transfected with pTK-Hyg (Clontech) and pTRE-c-Myc or pTRE-mBop1-cDNA plasmids. To select for stable cell lines, the cells were cultured with 300 μg/ml G418 and 300 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 weeks. BALB/3T3 clone A31 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin. To establish the CMV-Scx-gDNA-BALB/3T3 and CMV-Scx-cDNA-BALB/3T3 cells, CMV-Scx-gDNA(+1), CMV-Scx-gDNA(−250), or CMV-Scx-cDNA plasmids, respectively, were transfected to BALB/3T3 cells. The cells were cultured with 400 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks to select the stable cell line. Tet-On-Myc-C2C12 and Tet-On-mBop1cDNA-C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, 300 μg/ml G418, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Tet-On-Myc-C2C12 cells (1.2 × 106 cells) were plated into 100-mm diameter dishes. Two days after, cells (90–95% confluent) were switched into DMEM with 1% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, G418, and hygromycin that was subsequently changed every 2 days. Five days after (time 0), the cells were switched to DMEM with 10% FBS, 1 mg/ml doxycyclin, penicillin, streptomycin, G418, and hygromycin. The cells were harvested to collect RNA at 2 or 6 h after changing the medium. Transformed BALB/3T3 cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and G418. The cells (1.7 × 105 cells/well for CMV-Scx-gDNA(+250), 1.7 × 105 cells/well for CMV-Scx-gDNA(+1), and 1.9 × 105 cells/well for CMV-Scx-cDNA) were plated in a 6-well plate. The cells were cultured in the DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum for 24 h and then switched into the DMEM with 1% horse serum (Invitrogen) for 3 days (low serum medium condition) to maintain quiescent cells. To induce the proliferation of the cells, three wells were switched to DMEM with 10% FBS (high serum medium). The other three wells were replaced with fresh low serum medium. The cells were harvested 6 h after changing the medium for RNA extraction. Frozen uterine tissue was pulverized, and total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA of the cells was extracted by using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) to remove the genomic DNA contamination. To make the cDNA samples, total RNA (1 μg) was incubated in 20-μl reaction mixes containing 2 μl of 10× RT buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 500 mm KCl) (Invitrogen), 100 ng of random hexamer, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 50 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 50 min. Real-time PCR was performed by using the primer sets as described in Table 1. To amplify the mRNA, forward and reverse primers were designed on the different exonic sequences except the primers for Bop1 introns. The primers of ScxQ-F and ScxQ-R are localized on the exons 1 and 2, respectively, of the Scx gene. The Bop1Q-F primer is localized on the junction of exons 3 and 4 of the Bop1 gene, and the Bop1Q-R primer is localized on the Bop1 exon 5. The primer mix of Classic II 18 S Standards (Ambion) was used for 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S). For cDNA amplification, 1–10 ng of cDNA were combined with 25 μl of a mixture containing Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 160 nm forward and reverse primers for Scx (ScxQ), Bop1 (Bop1Q), c-Myc, and Bop1 introns A, B, and C or 26 nm primer mix for 18 S. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Amplification was carried out as follows: 50 °C for 1 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1min. To determine the cycle time for each gene, the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) and SDS 2.1 analysis software (Applied Biosystems) were used. We used the mathematical model described by Pfaffl (31Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar) to get the relative expression levels. 18 S was used as an internal control for all reactions.TABLE 1The primer sets used for real-time PCR and conventional PCRName of primer setSequence of primer (forward)Sequence of primer (reverse)ScxQ5′-CGTCTTTCTGTCACGGTCTTTGCTC-3′5′-CTTTCTTCCACAGCGGTCGTGC-3′Bop1Q5′-CAGCTCTGATGAGGAGGACATTCGGAAC-3′5′-CAACCTGCTCATCAGTTAGCCG-3′Bop1 intron A5′-CATTTCTGGGCTGGTGTGGACAG-3′5′-GTGGGTAGTTTACAAGGCAGGAACCAT-3′Bop1 intron B5′-CGTCTTTCTGTCACGGTCTTTGCTC-3′5′-AAATACAACGGCTTTCCCCAATCC-3′Bop1 intron C5′-TCCGTCCCTCGTCACACATTTG-3′5′-CCTGCTTTTTCTGCTGAACATCCTC-3′c-Myc5′-ACCCCTCAGTGGTCTTTCCCTACCC-3′5′-GTTTGCCTCTTCTCCACAGACACCACATC-3′Scx5′-CTTCACTGCGCTGCGCACACTCATCC-3′5′-GCTCTCCGTGACTCTTCAGTGGCATCC-3′Bop15′-CAGCTCTGATGAGGAGGACATTCGGAAC-3′5′-TCACAGGGTGGATCATGATGTCACCGC-3′ Open table in a new tab PCR was performed using the primer sets as described in Table 1. The PCR of Scx was run for 26 or 32 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), the PCR of Bop1 was run for 22 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), the PCR of 18 S rRNA was run for 14 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 4 min), and the PCR of Bop1 introns (A, B, and C) was run for 28 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 50 s and 72 °C for 2 min) using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Aliquots (6 μl) of PCR products were resolved on 2% (w/v) agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and viewed using the UVP, LLC bioimaging system. Statistical analysis was performed with two-tailed paired t tests, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. OVX adult female mice were treated with E2 at time 0, and total RNA was isolated at the times indicated (Fig. 2). Relative amounts of Bop1 and Scx mRNAs were quantified by real-time PCR and normalized with the amount of 18 S as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 2 by the solid lines, E2 stimulated a 6-fold peak of increase (+0.64 as log 10 ratio) in Bop1 mRNA following a 6-h exposure, and the mRNA level was gradually reduced until 24 h. In contrast, the level of Scx mRNA was decreased ∼80% (−0.59 as log 10 ratio) at 6 h after E2 treatment and gradually recovered by 24 h. These results indicated that the expression of Bop1 and Scx mRNAs was reciprocally regulated by E2 in the OVX mouse uterus. Additionally, we determined the effect of E2-mediated transcriptional activation on the Bop1 and Scx gene expression using ICI, an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that prevents ER-E2-mediated transcription (32Hyder S.M. Chiappetta C. Murthy L. Stancel G.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2547-2549PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 by the dashed lines, ICI attenuated the Bop1 gene activation while also attenuating the down-regulation of the Scx gene expression. These results suggested that E2-activated transcription of the Bop1 gene may be coordinately related to the Scx gene down-regulation. In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using the OVX mouse uterus to localize which uterine cells express the Scx and Bop1 transcripts. The signals for the antisense probes of Scx and Bop1 transcripts were detected in the endometrial epithelial cells (Fig. 3A, panels a, b, e, and f). Interestingly, the signal for the sense probe of the Scx transcript was also detected in the endometrial epithelial cells (Fig. 3A, panels c and d). These results suggest that the antisense RNA for the Scx gene is present in the uterine cells that express Scx and Bop1 mRNAs. To confirm the existence of the antisense RNA for the Scx gene, RT-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from OVX mouse uteri. As depicted in Fig. 1, primer set A amplifies a region of intron 3 of the Bop1 gene that does not overlap with the Scx gene. Primer set B amplifies a region of intron 3 that overlaps with the Scx gene, and primer set C amplifies the intron 2 region of the Bop1 gene. We used templates that were synthesized with or without reverse transcriptase (Fig. 3B, +RT and −RT, respectively) to verify negligible amounts of genomic DNA contamination. No appreciable signal was detected in the −RT samples, demonstrating that the amplified fragments from the +RT samples were derived from RNA and not genomic DNA contamination (Fig. 3B). The size of the amplified fragment is identical to the amplicon from mouse genomic DNA, suggesting that the antisense RNA for the Scx gene, which is derived from the Bop1 intron, is present in the mouse uterus. The amount of Bop1 intron 3- and 2-derived RNA was increased at 2 h after E2 treatment, which is prior to the accumulation of Bop1 mRNA (Fig. 3, B and C). Scx mRNA was decreased at 2 h after E2 treatment, which coincides with the accumulation of Bop1 intron-derived RNA. To examine the effect of Bop1 gene activation on the Scx gene down-regulation in an estrogen-independent manner, we established an in vitro model using C2C12 myoblasts, a murine cell line reported to express endogenous Scx mRNA (33Liu Y. Watanabe H. Nifuji A. Yamada Y. Olson E.N. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29880-29885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that the Bop1 gene expression is induced by c-Myc (34Schlosser I. Hölzel M. Mürnseer M. Burtscher H. Weidle U.H. Eick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To activate endogenous Bop1 gene expression, we established a Tet-On-Myc C2C12 cell line that contains a tetracycline (Tet)-mediated transcription activator (TetR) expression vector and a TetR binding element fused to a c-Myc expression vector. Cells were stimulated by a Tet derivative compound, doxycycline, and harvested 6 h after stimulation. Fig. 4A shows that c-Myc mRNA was stimulated by the treatment (3.4-fold) and that Bop1 mRNA was also increased by 1.6-fold (+0.21 as log 10 ratio). In contrast, Scx mRNA was decreased 30% (−0.12 as log 10 ratio) 6 h after treatment. Samples were harvested 2 h after treatment to evaluate the expression level of Bop1 intron-derived RNA in this system. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, Bop1 intron-derived RNA is increased by 2 h after treatment. Additionally, a Tet-On-mBop1cDNA C2C12 cell line that expresses the mature Bop1 mRNA, which does not contain intronic sequences, was established to evaluate the involvement of Bop1 intron-derived RNA in the down-regulation of the Scx mRNA level. Fig. 4D shows that Bop1 mRNA was induced by doxycycline treatment after 6 h (1.5-fold); however, the level of Scx mRNA did not change after Bop1 mRNA accumulation, suggesting the need for Bop1 intronic RNA and not mRNA in Scx gene down-regulation. The findings above suggested that the accumulation of Bop1 intron-derived RNA is related to the reduction of the Scx mRNA level. Therefore, we examined whether the Bop1 intronic RNA leads to the down-regulation of the Scx gene in a trans-acting manner. The murine fibroblast BALB/3T3 cells were used for this experiment because these cells do not express the endogenous Scx mRNA and can be induced to express endogenous Bop1 by serum stimulation (15Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5516-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We established the BALB/3T3 cell lines that express Scx mRNA from the CMV promoter fused to the Scx genomic DNA that contains +1 to +2309 sequence of the Scx gene (CMV-Scx-gDNA(+1)), −250 to +2039 sequence of the Scx gene (CMV-Scx-gDNA(−250)), or full-length Scx cDNA (CMV-Scx-cDNA) (Fig. 5A). Initially, we examined the transcripts expressed from the Scx genomic DNA and Scx cDNA by RT-PCR. The 409-bp amplicon corresponding to mature Scx mRNA was detected as the major transcript in these cell lines. The amplicon corresponding to premature Scx mRNA (1304 bp) was undetectable in the CMV-Scx-gDNA cell lines. No amplicon was detected in the empty pcDNA3 transfected cell line or in the −RT samples, suggesting that this transcript is expressed from the transfected gene (Fig. 5B). The cells were cultured in low serum medium for 3 days to reduce the endogenous Bop1 expression level. Bop1 was induced in these cells by changing to high serum medium, and the cells were harvested 6 h after changing the medium for RNA extraction. As shown in Fig. 5C, Scx mRNA decreased 40% 6 h after treatment in the CMV-Scx-gDNA(−250) cell line, whereas the level of Scx mRNA did not change in the CMV-Scx-gDNA(+1) and CMV-Scx-cDNA cell lines. The premature Scx mRNA was not detected in these cells with or without treatment (data not shown). The levels of Bop1 mRNA and Bop1 intron-derived RNA (primer set A) increased 6 h after changing to high serum medium in this system (Fig. 5, D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that Bop1 intronic RNA impairs the Scx gene transcription and acts in a trans-acting manner. Although gene profiling studies both in vivo and in vitro show that hormones stimulate and repress gene expression, the mechanisms for estrogen-mediated gene down-regulation are not extensively studied and are poorly understood. Down-regulation of gene expression related to the arrangement of overlapping genes on opposing strands, as a potential mechanism, is thought to be due to transcriptional interference, RNA masking, and/or RNA interference (35Lavorgna G. Dahary D. Lehner B. Sorek R. Sanderson C.M. Casari G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 88-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 36Munroe S.H. Zhu J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2102-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the transcriptional interference model, because transcription by RNA polymerase II involves both large protein complexes and the unwinding of duplex DNA, it is unlikely that two overlapping transcriptional units could be transcribed concomitantly. Thus, for example, the transcript from the initiator element, which is in the first intron of the eIF2α gene on the opposing strand, decreases eIF2α transcription (37Silverman T.A. Noguchi M. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9738-9742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Noguchi M. Miyamoto S. Silverman T.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29161-29167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the RNA-masking mechanism, formation of RNA duplexes between sense and antisense transcripts occurs and then inhibits the binding of trans-acting factors to the regulatory features of the transcripts. This form of steric inhibition could affect steps involved in mRNA splicing, transport, polyadenylation, translation, and degradation. As an example of this mechanism, the TRα gene encodes TRα1 as well as an alternatively spliced product, TRα2. The RevErbAα gene, which is transcribed from the opposite direction from the same locus, overlaps the TRα2 coding region. The ratio of TRα1 and TRα2 expression level is modified by the RevErbAα gene post-transcriptionally (39Hastings M.L. Ingle H.A. Lazar M.A. Munroe S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11507-11513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the RNA interference mechanism, formation of RNA duplexes leads to gene silencing via RNA interference pathways. Double strand RNA is potentially cleaved by the Dicer enzyme into 21–23-nucleotide duplexes (small interfering RNA). These fragments may target the specific destruction of homologous RNA (40Jakymiw A. Pauley K.M. Li S. Ikeda K. Lian S. Eystathioy T. Satoh M. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or silence the gene expression epigenetically (41Matzke M.A. Birchler J.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the level of Scx mRNA expressed from the exogenous Scx genomic DNA, which contains the Scx gene promoter (CMV-Scx-gDNA(−250)), reduced as Bop1 intron-derived RNA accumulated. The Scx mRNA levels expressed from genomic DNA and cDNA without the Scx gene promoter (CMV-Scx-gDNA(+1) and CMV-Scx-cDNA) were not affected by Bop1 intronic RNA accumulation. This Scx gene promoter region, between −250 to +1, harbors two TATA boxes that are involved in Scx gene transcription initiation (supplemental Fig. S1). This result suggests that the reduction of the Scx mRNA level is due at least in part to the inhibition of Scx gene transcription. Additional detail of the antisense RNA-mediated Scx gene transcription repression will need to be assessed in future studies. We attempted to identify a negative estrogen-responsive element in the 5′-flanking region (−7 kb) of Scx. Examination by reporter analysis did not reveal negative regulatory elements in this region; however, a potential ER-E2-mediated positive regulatory element was found (supplemental Fig. S2). ER-E2-mediated enhancement of the initiation of Scx gene transcription might be inhibited by Bop1 intronic RNA, although further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Two different Scx knock-out mouse lines are reported, and both indicate the importance of intron 3 of the Bop1 gene with regard to Scx gene expression (21Murchison N.D. Price B.A. Conner D.A. Keene D.R. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Schweitzer R. Development. 2007; 134: 2697-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 23Brown D. Wagner D. Li X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both knock-out mice were targeted in a similar genomic position, namely a Neo cassette was inserted into exon 1 of the Scx gene to disrupt the expression of Scx mRNA (23Brown D. Wagner D. Li X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or an FRT-Neo cassette was inserted into the intron of the Scx gene flanking the first exon, allowing removal of the Scx exon 1 using the cre-loxP system (21Murchison N.D. Price B.A. Conner D.A. Keene D.R. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Schweitzer R. Development. 2007; 134: 2697-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Retention of the Neo cassette in this genomic region in both mice lead to embryonic lethality due to the inhibition of cell proliferation between embryonic day 6.0 and embryonic day 6.5 (23Brown D. Wagner D. Li X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 4317-4329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that this genomic region may be important for correct Bop1 expression. On the other hand, the deletion of Scx exon 1 (about 500 bp) is not embryonic lethal (21Murchison N.D. Price B.A. Conner D.A. Keene D.R. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Schweitzer R. Development. 2007; 134: 2697-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Our ISH and RT-PCR analyses showed that the Bop1 intronic RNA corresponding to this region exists stably, and our in vitro studies showed that the accumulation of Bop1 intronic RNA impairs the Scx gene expression in a trans-acting manner, causing the reduction of the mRNA level. Bop1 intronic RNA, overlapping with the Scx gene, may be a coordinate means by which a mitogenic stimulus such as estrogen invokes an increase in a proliferation gene (Bop1) while simultaneously suppressing a differentiation gene (Scx) to facilitate the biological action. Further evaluation of other gene pairs will be needed to determine the broadness of this type of regulation and possible application to the hormonal responsiveness in this and other tissues.
