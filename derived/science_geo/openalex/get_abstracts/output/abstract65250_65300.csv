https://openalex.org/W1480195325,"When incubated with the appropriate substrates, purified Escherichia coli isoleucyl ribonucleic acid synthetase can form a complex with either isoleucyl- or valyladenylate which may be isolated by Sephadex filtration. Whereas the isoleucyladenylate complex reacts with transfer RNA (tRNA) to form isoleucyl-RNA, the valyladenylate complex breaks down in the presence of tRNA. In place of transacylation, the net reaction observed is a tRNA-induced hydrolysis of valyl-AMP. Isoleucine-specific tRNA molecules are the active components. Any alteration of the tRNA which destroys the isoleucine acceptor activity also destroys the ability of the tRNA to induce the hydrolysis of the enzyme-bound valyladenylate."
https://openalex.org/W1491261111,"Abstract The isoleucyl ribonucleic acid synthetase from Escherichia coli has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The protein has a molecular weight of 112,000 and an s20,w of 5.9S. The amino acid composition has been determined. The enzyme is protected from heat inactivation and tryptic digestion by the presence of adenosine triphosphate and Mg++ plus saturating amounts of isoleucine or valine."

https://openalex.org/W86571629,"Abstract The association of the α and β2 subunits of tryptophan synthetase has been studied by means of sucrose gradient centrifugation, Sephadex gel filtration, and enzymatic activity measurements. The results indicate that the fully associated enzyme (α2β2) has a sedimentation coefficient of 6.4S and is in relatively rapid equilibrium with the free subunits. Mass law and kinetic considerations are consistent with the reversible binding of individual α subunits to two identical and independent sites on the β2 subunit, with each combined site contributing the same enzymatic activity. Pyridoxal phosphate and serine together markedly increase the association of the two subunits. Prior incubation of the two subunits with serine and pyridoxal-P apparently increases their association when they are sedimented in sucrose gradients in the absence of serine and pyridoxal-P. Apparent association constants for the subunits have been measured enzymatically under various conditions and found to range from 4 x 106 to 2.6 x 109 m-1. Under the two extreme conditions of affinity of the α and β2 subunits, apparent rate constants for association have been estimated to be 2 x 104 and 6 x 105 sec-1 m-1. Likewise, the dissociation rate constants determined were 4.8 x 10-3 and 1.8 x 10-4 sec-1. Mutations abolishing the enzymatic activity of the β2 subunit can selectively alter the stimulatory effect of pyridoxal-P and serine on the ability of mutant β2 subunit to combine with normal α subunits, without affecting its basal affinity for the α subunits."

https://openalex.org/W99574075,"SUMMARY The procedure used to purify the B subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase is described. The purified protein ap- pears nearly homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and in starch gel electrophoresis. Its sedimentation coefficient was determined to be 5.0X, and a molecular weight of 108,000 was calculated from ultracentrifuge experiments. Pyridoxal phosphate has been established as the cofactor of the enzyme; approximately 2 moles are bound to each mole of B protein. B protein was re- solved into an apoenzyme which is catalytically inactive in the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent conversion of indole to trypto- phan but which retains its capacity to aid the A protein in indolyl- glycerol phosphate cleavage. Treatment with sodium borohy- dride results in a protein which is inactive in the indole to tryptophan conversion but is more active than the native protein in assisting the A subunit in the cleavage of indolylglyc- erol phosphate. A calculation based on the specific activities and molecular weights of the purified tryptophan synthetase subunits and their complex suggests that the catalytically active AB complex consists of 2 A protein molecules and 1 B protein molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1967304669,"Analysis of the enzymatic mechanism of chain extension during protein synthesis and studies with N-formylmethionyl-sRNA suggest that chain initiation requires formylation of the amino group of the amino acid destined to start chain growth. The existence of a set of starting triplets coding for a special set of N-formylaminoacyl-sRNA's is postulated. These triplets might be ambiguous in the sense that they specify different amino acids, depending on whether they are at the beginning of or within a message. A number of starting triplets and their NH2-terminal amino acids are predicted from previously suggested ambiguities. The biochemical, regulatory, and genetic implications of a formylation step controlling chain initiation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1607897092,"Abstract 1. Acetylimidazole, an acetylating reagent of proteins reacts both with the proteolytic enzyme, pepsin, and its zymogen, pepsinogen. 2. When reacted with pepsin, the proteolytic activity decreases whereas the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate, N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanyldiiodotyrosine, increases 2.5-fold. These changes can be reversed by deacetylation with hydroxylamine. 3. Acetylation of pepsinogen leads to a reduced susceptibility to activation as reflected by its potential pepsin activity and a decreased hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate. 4. With the aid of difference spectra and hydroxamate formation, it was ascertained that 8 to 10 tyrosine residues were acetylated. 5. In contrast to pepsin, it was demonstrated that in acetylpepsinogen 4 to 5 e-amino groups of the lysine residues were acetylated in addition to tyrosines. 6. These results are correlated with some of the conformational characteristics of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1587042049,"Abstract Streptomycin-sensitive 70S ribosomes which are dissociated into 50S and 30S particles by dialysis against 1 x 10-4 m magnesium acetate, and then reassociated in 0.02 m magnesium acetate, differ from nondissociated 70S ribosomes in 14C-aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid (sRNA) binding. 1. Reassociated ribosomes bind about twice as much 14C-phenylalanyl-sRNA in the presence of polyuridylic acid as nondissociated ribosomes. 2. 14C-Phenylalanyl-sRNA binding to reassociated ribosomes in the presence of polyuridylic acid is reduced 50% by streptomycin; this binding to nondissociated ribosomes is only slightly affected by streptomycin. 3. Streptomycin can inhibit 14C-isoleucyl-sRNA binding to reassociated ribosomes in the presence of polyuridylic acid, but stimulates this binding to nondissociated ribosomes. These effects are greatly influenced by the sRNA-ribosome ratio. Shearing 70S ribosomes by passage through a micropipette also produces Reactions 2 and 3 above, but not Reaction 1. The results indicate that various treatments of the ribosomes (dissociation, shearing) and sRNA to ribosome ratios modify the effects of streptomycin on 14C-aminoacyl-sRNA binding to ribosomes. In addition, the data suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in the effects of streptomycin on inhibiting protein synthesis and on stimulating ambiguous codon recognitions."

Assays designed to determine the mechanism of action of these inhibitors indicat.e (a) that tetracycline inhibits the binding of aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid to messenger ribonucleic acid-containing ribosomes; (b) that the aminoacyl nucleoside, puromycin, releases peptide material from peptidyl soluble ribonucleic acid, messenger ribonucleic acid, ribosome complexes while the related aminoacyl nucleoside, gougerotin, blocks this release; (c) that neomycin B alters the binding of aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid onto messenger ribonucleic acid, ribosome complexes; (d) that chloramphenicol can compete with a messenger ribonucleic acid for sites on bacterial ribosomes; and (e) that cycloheximide does not influence the binding of aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid to ribosomes or the puromycin- dependent release of peptides from pept’idyl soluble ribonucleic acid, messenger ribonucleic acid, ribosome complexes.

https://openalex.org/W1575588934,"Abstract The nature of the interaction between histones and deoxyribonucleic acid, and the effects of such complexes on the synthesis in vitro of ribonucleic acid, have been studied. Polycation inhibition of the RNA polymerase reaction appeared to be proportional to the adenine plus thymine content of the DNA primer. The extent of inhibition was also influenced by both the net positive charge and the size of the inhibitor. Aggregates were formed when the polycation reacted with the DNA primer in situ. The size of the aggregates was proportional to the concentration of polycation present. The RNA polymerase product formed in the presence of histones was both smaller and of different base ratio and sequence than the normal product formed in the absence of the inhibitor. Nearest neighbor frequency patterns of RNA formed from several different DNA primers under conditions of inhibition by different polycations have been reported. These results indicated that nearest neighbor frequency changes depended on the type of DNA primer as well as the type of inhibitor. There appeared to be no exact correlation between the effects of arginine- and lysine-rich histones and those of the related polycations, protamine and polylysine. The base composition and nearest neighbor frequencies of the RNA product formed under conditions of inhibition suggest that polycations can cause unequal copying of complementary sequences of the DNA primer."

https://openalex.org/W1550472924,"Acyl-malonyl acyl carrier protein (ACP)-condensing enzyme, prepared from extracts of Escherichia coli, catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP to form acetoacetyl-ACP. It also catalyzes the condensation of various longer chain saturated acyl-ACP derivatives with malonyl-ACP to form the β-ketoacyl-ACP of the longer homologues. The enzyme is specific for the acyl-ACP derivatives and does not act on acyl coenzyme A derivatives (acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA). The enzyme has a functional —SH group and can be readily inhibited by —SH-binding reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. Acetyl-ACP protects the enzyme against thiol-binding reagents, which indicates that an acetyl—S—enzyme complex may be an intermediate in the condensation of acyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP to form β-ketoacyl-ACP."

https://openalex.org/W1483987094,"Abstract An extract of Escherichia coli was found capable of synthesizing proline from N-acetylglutamate. This synthesis was shown to proceed by transformation of the 5 carbon skeleton of acetylglutamate into ornithine by way of the familiar reactions of arginine biosynthesis. This ornithine then undergoes a transamination of its δ-amino group with α-ketoglutarate, yielding Δ'-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid. The synthesis of the latter compound from acetylglutamate requires both an adenosine triphosphate- and a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-generating system and is stimulated by l-glutamate. Evidence is presented, however, that the synthesis of proline in vivo does not proceed by this pathway. (a) Exogenous acetylglutamate is incorporated preferentially into arginine, rather than into proline, when compared with exogenous glutamate. (b) Cells grown in the presence of arginine yield extracts devoid of activity for synthesizing proline from acetylglutamate, yet such cells do not require exogenous proline for growth. (c) A proline auxotroph, strain 55–25, blocked between glutamate and Δ'-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid does not appear to be blocked either between glutamate and ornithine or between ornithine and Δ'-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid. (d) Proline does not inhibit the transamination of ornithine to yield Δ'-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1567878629,"Abstract 5-Hydroxyuridine triphosphate was synthesized and its effectiveness as substrate for deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase was determined. The analogue was incorporated into RNA to a very low extent as compared to naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates, and it replaced uridine triphosphate to a much greater extent than any of the other nucleoside triphosphates. The ability of the analogue to replace UTP in RNA synthesis was greatest at pH 7 and decreased markedly with increasing pH values. This behavior was related to the low pKa of 5-hydroxyuridine as compared to uridine. 5-Hydroxy-UTP strongly inhibited synthesis of RNA and acted as a competitive inhibitor of UTP in the polymerase reaction. This inhibitory effect was lowest at pH 7.0 and increased with increasing pH values to a maximum at pH 9.0. Thus, in contrast to the data on analogue incorporation, the inhibitory effect of the analogue is predominant when the pyrimidine exists in ionized form. The nucleoside analogue exerted its strong inhibitory effect only when it existed as the triphosphate. 5-Hydroxy-UDP and 5-hydroxy-UMP inhibited incorporation of UMP into RNA only slightly as compared to 5-hydroxy-UTP."

https://openalex.org/W2092099535,"DEMINERALIZATION of specimens for the preparation of histological sections is a time-consuming process. Mineral acids demineralize the specimens faster than chelating agents or organic acids, but the resultant distortion in cellular morphology is greater when mineral acids are used. The rate of demineralization depends mainly on the temperature and concentration of the acid, but since cellular definition and enzymes are adversely affected if the temperature is raised, or when the concentration of the acid is increased, demineralization is usually carried out below or at room temperature and a concentration of mineral acid above 5 per cent of commercial nitric acid (55 per cent) is seldom used. Under these conditions even small specimens of bone must be immersed in acid for days before they are completely demineralized. For teeth, the period of time runs into weeks."
