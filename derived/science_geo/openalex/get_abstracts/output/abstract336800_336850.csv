https://openalex.org/W2068575932,"Dense concentrations of migratory wildebeest leaving the Serengeti Plains in late May 1974 reduced green plant biomass by almost 400 grams per square meter, 85 percent of the initial standing crop. However, this grazing prevented senescence and stimulated net primary productivity of the grasslands. Thomson's gazelles leaving the plains a month later were significantly associated with areas previously grazed by wildebeest, and this association was still evident at the end of the dry season, 6 months later."

Except for the sign, the centrifugal force closely resembles the perpendicular component of gravity. Convection processes in stars and planets can therefore be modeled in laboratory experiments by using the centrifugal force with a reversed temperature gradient."

https://openalex.org/W1982874779,"The occurrence of positive and negative (26)Mg anomalies in inclusions of the Allende meteorite is explained in terms of proton bombardment of a gas of solar composition. A significant fraction of (26)Mg in the irradiated gas is stored temporarily in the form of radioactive (26)Al by the reaction (26)Mg(p,n) (26)Al. Proton fluxes of 10(17) to 10(19) protons per square centimeter per year at l million electron volts are inferred. Aluminum-rich materials condensing from the gas phase have positive (26)Mg anomalies, whereas magnesium-rich materials have negative (26)Mg anomalies. The proton flux required to account for the observed magnesium anomalies is used to investigate possible isotopic anomalies in the elements from oxygen to argon. Detectable isotopic anomalies are predicted only for neon. The anomalous neon is virtually pure (22)Ne from (22)Na decay. The predicted amount of anomalous (22)Ne is about 10(-8) cubic centimeter (at standard temperature and pressure) per milligram of sodium."

If the hypothesis is proven that this chemical compound acts only by preventing the production of prothrombin in the liver then the life of injected beef prothrombin is probably of the same duration as that of the dog's own plasma prothrombin; namely, 2 to 3 days."

https://openalex.org/W1998993361,A major new experiment in population control has been greeted in a positive manner by Pakistanis giving some hope that the governments goal of reducing the birthrate from 45 to 35 per thousand is possible. The experiment which has been underway for a year consists of 2 main elements: continuous motivation system and a contraceptive inundation program. Under the former fertile couples are visited every 3 months by a male and female worker who provide encouragement and training in birth control. Although the workers generally are poorly paid inadequately trained and badly supervised the system seems to be improving. Under the contraceptive inundation program the countryside is flooded with birth control pills which are dispensed without medical supervision and condoms. Both are popular with the Pakistanis; popularity of the pill particularly is skyrocketing. Further there is evidence of sociological change in Pakistan which would increase the attractiveness of smaller families in the eyes of the Pakistanis.

https://openalex.org/W2012396594,"Federal and state governments may be headed toward a collision over a key aspect in the development of nuclear power. Antinuclear groups in California are pressing for a law that would ban nuclear power plants unless Congress removes the present legal limitations on the damages payable in the event of a nuclear accident. But Congress, far from repealing the limitation (mandated by the Price-Anderson nuclear insurance law), recently voted to extend it. The skirmish on Capitol Hill over the Price-Anderson law is analyzed in the first of the following articles; the events that have made the California proposition possible are discussed in the second."
