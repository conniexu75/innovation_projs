https://openalex.org/W2101173516,"Arid ecosystems cover about 40% of Earth's land area and are home to over two billion people, yet they remain vulnerable to climate change and human actions. Using numerical simulations, and data from Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Morocco and Greece, Kéfi et al. show that patch-size distribution of vegetation follows a power law. As grazing pressure increases, patch size deviates from the power law close to the transition to desert conditions. So patch-size distribution may be a useful early warning of desertification. The cover shows an arid landscape (top) in the El Planerón nature reserve in Belchite, Spain, and the lower panels show degradation in this landscape. In a separate paper, Scanlon et al. use satellite imagery to show that the size distribution of tree clusters in the Kalahari basin also follows a scale-free power law. This can be explained by positive feedback associated with preferential environments near existing trees. In News & Views Ricard Solé discusses both papers. COVER IMAGE Sonia & Michaël Kéfi/ Yolanda Pueyo/ Santiago Beguería Portugués This paper describes and models the effect of grazing on vegetation patchiness in three arid Mediterranean ecosystems. The patch size distribution of the vegetation in these ecosystems follows a power law, which can be explained by invoking local positive interactions among plants. Deviations from power laws occur when grazing pressure is high, and may be a harbinger of imminent desertification. Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services1, which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions from one stable state to another2. Discontinuous transitions are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic changes of ecosystems identified1. For terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions3,4. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach. In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton model, we show that local positive interactions among plants can explain such power-law distributions. Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field data revealed consistent deviations from power laws. Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in the model. When grazing was further increased in the model, we found that these deviations always and only occurred close to transition to desert, independent of the type of transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover. Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be a warning signal for the onset of desertification."

The amyloid (or Aβ) hypothesis proposes that the continuous disruption of normal synaptic physiology by Aβ contributes to the development of Alzheimer disease. However, there is little consensus about how Aβ mediates this inhibition at the molecular level. Using mouse primary hippocampal neurons, we observed that a brief treatment with cell-derived, soluble, human Aβ disrupted the activation of three kinases (Erk/MAPK, CaMKII, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-activated protein Akt/protein kinase B) that are required for long term potentiation, whereas two other kinases (protein kinase A and protein kinase C) were stimulated normally. An antagonist of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases was found to mimic the pattern of Aβ-mediated kinase inhibition. We then found that soluble Aβ binds to the insulin receptor and interferes with its insulin-induced autophosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that physiologically relevant levels of naturally secreted Aβ interfere with insulin receptor function in hippocampal neurons and prevent the rapid activation of specific kinases required for long term potentiation.

The amyloid β-protein (Aβ), the principal constituent of amyloid plaques observed in AD and to a lesser extent during normal brain aging, is generated by sequential proteolytic cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 67-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The recognition that several forms of early onset AD are caused by mutations that alter Aβ production and that transgenic mice expressing these mutant alleles develop several features of AD, including Aβ plaques and memory deficits, have provided strong evidence that Aβ plays an important role in the disease process (2Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar). In particular, small oligomers of soluble Aβ have been shown to be potent inhibitors of memory in rodents (3Lesne S. Koh M.T.

However, how Aβ leads to a disruption in hippocampal synaptic function and deficits in memory remains unclear. There is considerable evidence that Aβ can bind to several different molecules on the neuronal surface. It has been reported that a brief treatment of cultured neurons with trypsin reduces synthetic Aβ binding (7Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). Moreover, Klein and co-workers (8Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Various laboratories have identified candidate receptors that may play a role in Aβ neurotoxicity, including theα7-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (9Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3370-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), the β-adrenergic receptor (13Huang H.M. Gibson G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the IR (14Xie L. Helmerhorst E. Taddei K. Plewright B. Van Bronswijk W. Martins R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 221Crossref Google Scholar). It is unclear whether some or all of these cell surface proteins contribute to the rapid effects of Aβ on long term potentiation (LTP). Significant progress has occurred over the last decade in elucidating the molecular basis of memory in the hippocampus (15Lynch M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 87-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In particular, the synapses in the CA1 region undergo an NMDA receptor-mediated LTP that has been well studied from the molecular to the behavioral levels. Because these synapses are vulnerable to Aβ-mediated toxicity, we examined five kinases (CaMKII, PKA, PKC, MAPK/Erk, and Akt/PKB (which is activated via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)) that are known to be necessary for early steps in the LTP cascade in order to determine how soluble Aβ affects their activation by neuronal stimulation. We observed that naturally secreted Aβ inhibited the activation of only a subset of these kinases in 14-day-old hippocampal cultures. Multiple pharmacological antagonists were then tested to determine whether any could mimic the selective pattern of kinase inhibition seen with soluble Aβ in older cultures, and only an antagonist of the IR family showed a closely similar pattern to that of soluble Aβ and disrupted LTP. Further investigation revealed that soluble Aβ co-immunoprecipitates with the IR and interferes with the autophosphorylation of the IR induced by insulin. Our results demonstrate that brief applications of physiological concentrations of soluble human Aβ selectively inhibit the IR and multiple downstream kinases that are required for hippocampal LTP. Cells—Primary neuronal hippocampal cultures were generated from embryonic day 18 wild-type Swiss Webster mouse pups. The hippocampus was dissected out in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffered with HEPES and dissociated via trypsin/EDTA treatment. Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells on 3.5-cm dishes precoated with poly-dl-lysine and laminin. After 2 days of culturing in neurobasal medium with B-27 supplement and glutamax, cytosine arabinofuranoside was added to reduce glial proliferation. Half the medium was exchanged every 3–4 days. After 13 days in vitro, the medium was replaced with neurobasal medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 5 μm AP5 (to reduce excitotoxicity). The 7PA2 cell line described previously (16Xia W. Zhang J.

Conditioned medium (CM) containing secreted Aβ was prepared by incubating the cells overnight in serum-free medium. The Aβ CM was centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove cellular debris and then concentrated in a YM-3 Centricon filter to obtain a 15× stock solution. These samples were diluted to 1× in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) just prior to stimulation. Neuronal Stimulation—After 14 days in vitro, cells were washed in ACSF containing 124 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 3.6 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm d-glucose, 0.4 mm sodium ascorbate, pH 7.4 (osmolarity 306 mm). The cells were equilibrated in ACSF for 1 h. Hippocampal neurons were treated for 20 min with 1× CM from either untransfected CHO cells (control CM) or 7PA2 cells (Aβ-rich CM) or else with specified pharmacological antagonists and then switched into the stimulating ACSF solution containing 126 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 3.6 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm d-glucose, 0.4 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mm glycine, and 5 μm picrotoxin and also containing the CM or the antagonists. Cells were chemically stimulated for 20 min and then homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.7, as well as complete protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 400 μg/ml EDTA) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (catalog numbers P285 and P5726; Sigma). Cells were scraped from the tissue culture dish and sonicated for 5 s at 4°C. Samples were stored at –20 °C until they were mixed with 2× sample buffer. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, PAGE, and Quantification—Antibodies to phospho-CREB, phospho-PKA substrate, phospho-Erk/MAPK, phospho-CaMKII, CaMKII, phospho-PKC, phospho-Akt, insulin receptor, and phosphoinsulin receptor were from Cell Signaling. Additional phospho-CaMKII antibodies were from PhosphoSolutions. Anti-Erk/MAPK and actin antibodies were from Sigma, and CaMKII antibodies were from Chemicon. For the co-immunoprecipitation studies in Fig. 4A, two hippocampi per condition were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with complete protease inhibitors. Nuclei were pelleted, and the supernatants were treated with either 10% deoxycholate or 1% SDS for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were dialyzed overnight with three solution exchanges in phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were then mixed with 16 ml of 7PA2 CM with complete protease inhibitors for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-IR antibodies with continuous rocking overnight. Beads were washed three times with 0.5 m NaCl STEN buffer (18Townsend M. Shankar G.M. Mehta T. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) without detergent. Because the interaction between the insulin receptor and Aβ appeared to be sensitive to detergent, the samples in Fig. 4B were prepared by a distinct method; synaptosomes were prepared from hippocampal brain tissue and sonicated for 5 s. Lysates were treated with Aβ CM for 2 h before immunoprecipitating with anti-insulin receptor antibodies that had been covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times with 0.5 m NaCl STEN buffer without detergent.FIGURE 4Aβ co-immunoprecipitates with the IR and inhibits insulin-induced activation of the IR. A, hippocampal lysates were solubilized in 10% deoxycholate (DC) or 1% SDS. Lysates were dialyzed prior to mixing with Aβ CM. Insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated, and blots were probed with the anti-Aβ specific antibody 6E10. Two oligomeric Aβ species showed a weak association with the insulin receptor (lane 3). B, without adding detergents, synaptosomes were sonicated prior to treatment with Aβ CM for 2 h. As in A, IRs were immunoprecipitated, and blots were probed with the anti-Aβ antibody 6E10. Under these conditions, the insulin receptor co-immunoprecipitated with a several Aβ forms found in the CM. This co-immunoprecipitation was disrupted by the addition of exogenous insulin. Thus, the interaction between the IR and Aβ was disrupted by detergents (SDS), by heat-denaturing the Aβ prior to nutating with lysates (boil), and by exogenous insulin (n = 3). C, hippocampal neurons were pretreated with Aβ CM or control CM, stimulated with varying concentrations of insulin, lysed, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IR antibodies. Treatment with Aβ-rich CM, but not control CM, inhibited IR autophosphorylation at low concentrations but not at high concentrations of insulin. D, the results of three independent experiments are quantified. Aβ-rich CM (open squares) significantly inhibited IR autophosphorylation at the 1 and 5 nm concentrations of insulin (1 nm insulin + control CM induced a 3.26 ± 0.75-fold increase in phospho-IR; 1 nm insulin + Aβ CM induced a 1.37 ± 0.19-fold increase in phospho-IR; 5 nm insulin + control CM induced a 4.01 ± 1.34-fold increase in phospho-IR; 5 nm insulin + Aβ CM induced a 1.32 ± 0.39-fold increase in phospho-IR; Studentŉs t test, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test for the effects of Aβ-rich CM on CREB phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 1), primary neuron cultures were stimulated as before for 20 min but returned to normal ACSF for an additional 20 min before homogenization. For Western blots, antibodies were used according to the manufacturerŉs recommendations. Blots were scanned using a Licor Odyssey system in two channels, enabling quantification of phosphorylated and control bands in the same gel. Electrophysiology—Field potential recordings were made from coronal sections of postnatal day 16–28 male and female Swiss Webster mice in compliance with Harvard Universityŉs animal resources and comparative medicine policies for use of laboratory animals. All recordings were made at room temperature. Electrodes were specifically placed just below the surface of the slice to maximize the exposure to circulating soluble Aβ. The intensity of the stimulus was set to 20–30% of the maximum evoked EPSP or until a population spike was elicited. Slices were perfused for 20 min in ACSF to establish a steady base line. A 1-ml aliquot of 15× concentrated CM was thawed, added to 14 ml of circulating medium, and recirculated over the slice at 2.5–3 ml/min while being continuously aerated with 95% oxygen. LTP was induced 20 min later by delivering four 100-Hz stimuli every 5 min to the Schaeffer collaterals. The recording electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum, and the slope of the EPSP was monitored for 1 h after the last high frequency stimulation. Whole cell recordings were made from hippocampal neuron cultures (13–15 days in vitro) grown on Bellco German glass coverslips. Electrodes were pulled to 3.5–5.5 megaohms and were filled with recording solution containing 110 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgATP, 0.25 mm Na3GTP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.3. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz using an Axon Instruments 200B amplifier. Healthy neurons were selected using infrared/differential interference contrast. Series resistance was 10–16 megaohms, was not compensated, and was checked periodically throughout the recording. Experiments where the series resistance deviated by more than 10% were discarded. Input resistance was between 270 and 390 megaohms. Cultures were equilibrated in ACSF for 20 min. After breaking into the neuron, 10 μm picrotoxin was added to the perfusion to inhibit GABAergic and glycinergic currents, along with the control or Aβ-rich CM. Recordings of spontaneous EPSCs were made after 5 min to obtain base-line activity. Cells were then switched into current clamp mode and stimulated by perfusing the cultures with ACSF containing 0 mm Mg2+, picrotoxin, and glycine for 20 min, as described above. Normal ACSF containing picrotoxin was then washed in, and cells were switched back to voltage clamp mode. After 30 min, EPSCs were again recorded to obtain a poststimulation base line. Chemicals—Drugs shown in Fig. 3 were from Tocris (8-bromo-cyclic AMP, KT5720, SIN-1, chlorisondamine diiodide, SIB1757, picrotoxin, methyllylcaconitine citrate, α-bungarotoxin, NF023, dl-AP5, pronethalol hydrochloride, forskolin), Calbiochem (AG1024), Cell Signaling (LY294002), or Sigma (insulin). Statistics—For multiple comparisons, analyses of variance were performed with Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests. Dual comparisons were analyzed by Studentŉs t tests. Error bars report the S.E. We have previously reported that naturally secreted, soluble Aβ disrupts the potentiation of synapses in hippocampal slices using a pharmacological stimulation protocol to increase NMDA receptor activation (18Townsend M. Shankar G.M. Mehta T. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Similar pharmacological methods have been widely used to potentiate and synchronize synaptic activity for biochemical and electrophysiologic studies (18Townsend M. Shankar G.M. Mehta T. Walsh D.M.

To confirm that soluble Aβ has a similar effect in neuron cultures as in brain slices, primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from wild-type mice, cultured for 14 days in vitro, and studied using whole-cell recording or biochemical techniques. The stimulation protocol induced an approximate doubling of the amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs in control conditions, as expected (supplemental Fig. 1B). In contrast, Aβ CM strongly inhibited this enhancement, such that the mean EPSC amplitude was not significantly different from base line (supplemental Fig. 1B). The transcription factor CREB has been shown to be integral to the expression of the late stages of LTP. Consistent with previous findings (25Gong B. Cao Z. Zheng P. Vitolo O.V. Liu S.

Brain Res. 1999; 824: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Aβ-rich CM interfered with the phosphorylation of CREB induced by pharmacological stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1C) (analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post hoc; stimulated and stimulated + control CM are significantly different from unstimulated, stimulated + AP5, and stimulated + Aβ CM; p < 0.05, n = 5). Thus, Aβ-rich CM, but not control CM, inhibited the potentiation of EPSCs and the phosphorylation of CREB in primary hippocampal cultures, as expected. Since CREB can be activated by several upstream kinase cascades, including CaMKII, PKA, and Erk/MAPK, we used this pharmacological stimulation paradigm to test whether soluble Aβ caused a universal inhibition of kinases or whether it was more selective. Among the potential kinases to examine, we chose PKA, PKC, CaMKII, Erk/MAPK, and Akt/PKB (which is downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), all of which play a principal role in LTP and have been widely studied (reviewed in Ref. 29Lisman J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Src family of tyrosine kinases is also of interest but was beyond the scope of the present study. PKC, CaMKII, and Erk/MAPK all require phosphorylation for proper activation. Ser-660 is conserved on most PKC isoforms and is the last autophosphorylation step that enables PKC to become cytosolic and interact with membrane lipids (30Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Thr-286 is an auto-phosphorylation site on CaMKII that is required for the enzyme to become Ca2+/CaM-independent (31Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Activation of Erk/MAPK is achieved by phosphorylation at Thr-202/Tyr-204 by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) (32Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8205-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-bisphosphate by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase allows for activation of Akt/PKB, which can be detected by its phosphorylation at Ser-473 (33Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Although PKA itself is activated by cAMP, not by phosphorylation, we used phospho-specific antibodies that recognize the consensus PKA phosphorylation motif (RXXT* or RRXS*) on its substrates. Additional controls were run to demonstrate that this antibody is a reliable indicator of activated PKA (supplemental Fig. 2A). Homogenates of 14-day-old hippocampal neuron cultures were collected 20 min after initiating the pharmacological stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, all five kinases were activated in the control conditions (lane 2, positive control), whereas all were inhibited from activation by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (lane 3, negative control). None of the kinases was significantly activated by the addition of either control or Aβ-rich CM alone (i.e. without stimulation) (lanes 4 and 5), and all five kinases were activated by stimulation in the presence of control CM (lane 6). Intriguingly, Aβ CM had no effect on the stimulation-induced activation of PKA and PKC, yet Erk/MAPK, Akt, and CaMKII were significantly inhibited (lanes 7 and 8). Importantly, the inhibition could be attributed to Aβ species larger than monomer, as the inhibition of Erk/MAPK phosphorylation was reproduced using size exclusion chromatography fractions containing Aβ dimers and trimers that migrate at 8–12 kDa (34Walsh D.M.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) but not with size exclusion chromatography fractions from the same run that contain only 4-kDa Aβ monomers (supplemental Fig. 2B). Compared with controls, the neurons treated with Aβ-rich CM showed significant impairment in the stimulus-induced activation of Erk/MAPK, Akt, and CaMKII (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there was no significant difference between control and Aβ-treated neurons in levels of phospho-PKC or phospho-PKA substrates (Fig. 1B). Thus, soluble human Aβ specifically prevents the activity-dependent phosphorylation of Erk/MAPK, CaMKII, and Akt while sparing the activation of PKA and PKC. Previous results have shown that mGluR5 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase antagonists could rescue high frequency stimulation-induced LTP from the inhibitory effects of synthetic Aβ peptide (12Wang Q. Walsh D.M. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Anwyl R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3370-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We tested whether these inhibitors would also rescue the effects of soluble, secreted Aβ on Erk/MAPK, Akt, and CaMKII. Under our conditions, c-Jun N-terminal kinase I/II antagonists did not rescue the activation of these three kinases that are inhibited by the soluble Aβ-rich CM (data not shown). However, it is likely that c-Jun N-terminal kinase I/II function in parallel to the signal transduction cascades described above and could have beneficial effects downstream of these signaling events. In contrast, an mGluR5 antagonist (SIB1757) did partially restore the activation of these three kinases in the presence of the Aβ CM (stimulated + Aβ CM + SIB1757 was no longer significantly different from stimulated + control CM, p > 0.05) (data not shown), a result that is consistent with an mGluR5 antagonist ameliorating the effects of synthetic Aβ on LTP. However, because the mGluR5 antagonist also elevated base-line PKA activity (i.e. without pharmacological stimulation), we concluded that our assay was not amenable to further study of the interaction between mGluR5 and the Aβ-mediated interference with synaptic plasticity. Because several candidate receptor proteins have been suggested to mediate the toxic effects of synthetic Aβ, we surveyed multiple pharmacologic agents that inhibit these transmembrane receptors to determine if they would replicate the selective pattern of kinase inhibition observed above with Aβ-rich CM (Fig. 2A). Some compounds, such as KT5720, forskolin, SIN-1, and LY294002, were chosen to confirm the specificity of our phospho-specific antibodies. Others, such as α-bungarotoxin (11Wang H.Y. Lee D.H.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and AG1024 (14Xie L. Helmerhorst E. Taddei K. Plewright B. Van Bronswijk W. Martins R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 221Crossref Google Scholar), were selected to test specific hypotheses about potential Aβ receptor targets. Our initial screen of 12 different pharmacological agents focused on the response of Erk/MAPK and PKA, since these kinases had shown a differential response to soluble Aβ (above) and since the relevant antibodies proved to be highly specific. Among all 12 compounds tested, only AG1024, a tyrophostin that is selective for the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases, inhibited Erk/MAPK phosphorylation to a similar extent as the Aβ-rich CM while preserving normal PKA activation (Fig. 2B). We did not find evidence that α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists reproduced the same selective kinase inhibition pattern as soluble Aβ under these experimental conditions. The results in Fig. 2B led us to determine whether Akt, CaMKII, and PKC were similarly affected by both soluble Aβ and the insulin receptor antagonist (AG1024). An additional set of experiments was therefore performed to test the effects of modulating insulin receptor activity on all five kinases. As shown in Fig. 2C and quantified in Fig. 2D, 1 μm insulin alone had a minimal effect on the ac"

Here, we show that phenoloxidase activity and melanization are important for the immune defense toward a highly pathogenic bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila, in the freshwater crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. RNA interference-mediated depletion of crayfish prophenoloxidase leads to increased bacterial growth, lower phagocytosis, lower phenoloxidase activity, lower nodule formation, and higher mortality when infected with this bacterium. In contrast, if RNA interference of pacifastin, an inhibitor of the crayfish prophenoloxidase activation cascade, is performed, it results in lower bacterial growth, increased phagocytosis, increased nodule formation, higher phenoloxidase activity, and delayed mortality. Our data therefore suggest that phenoloxidase is required in crayfish defense against an infection by A. hydrophila, a highly virulent and pathogenic bacterium to crayfish.

Genetic studies show that melanization and anti-microbial defense share common components and mechanisms in which a positive correlation between the melanization of injected beads and antibacterial responses seems to be due to shared genes and pathways that regulate these two effector mechanisms (4Lambrechts L.

In Drosophila melanogaster, melanization plays a key role against infection by parasitoid wasps (5Vass E. Nappi A.J. J. Parasitol. 2000; 86: 1259-1270PubMed Google Scholar), and it acts in augmenting the effectiveness of other immune reactions promoting resistance of Drosophila to microbial infection (6Tang H.

Studies with mutants with impaired melanization capacity suggest that if the melanization reaction is inhibited a higher susceptibility to microbial infection occurs (8Braun A. Hoffmann J.A.

In mosquitoes, several transcripts encoding enzymes involved in melanization are induced by a Plasmodium parasite in the midgut of Anopheles gambiae (11Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E.

In some cases melanization, or rather the activity of the enzyme PO, was found to have no or little impact on the killing/clearance of parasites (24Michel K. Suwanchaichinda C. Morlais I.

However, several studies have shown that the melanization of bacteria is a critical defensive process in invertebrates that appears to be facilitated by or is associated with phagocytosis (20Hillyer J.F.

In the freshwater crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, the expression of PO has been shown to be associated with an increased resistance to the crayfish pathogen Aphanomyces astaci (32Cerenius L. Bangyeekhun E. Keyser P. Söderhäll I. Söderhäll K. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In our preliminary studies we observed that the mRNA transcripts of crayfish proPO gene and pacifastin gene (a proteinase inhibitor specific against the PO-activating enzyme of crayfish) (33Liang Z. Sottrup-Jensen L. Aspán A. Hall M. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were up-regulated upon a challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila, a highly pathogenic bacterium isolated from freshwater crayfish, suggesting that proPO and pacifastin genes may be involved in defense. We, therefore, performed gene silencing of the proPO or the pacifastin gene separately using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). Consequently, knock down of the proPO gene should result in lower PO activity and an enhanced PO activity can be reached by silencing the pacifastin gene. The RNAi experiments were then designed to study the correlation between PO activity and the effect of A. hydrophila infection in crayfish. In addition, we assayed to what extent in vivo phagocytosis of this pathogen was affected by manipulating PO activity levels. Animals and Bacterial Strain—Freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus, purchased from Lake Vättern, Sweden, were kept in aquaria in aerated tap water at 10 °C. Only intermolt and healthy animals were used for experiments. The crayfish-pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, A. hydrophila, was prepared as previously described (34Jiravanichpaisal P. Lee S.Y. Kim Y.A. Andren T. Söderhäll I. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2007; 31: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The dose of A. hydrophila (200 μl of 4 × 106 CFU/ml) resulting in 80% mortality of control crayfish (15 ± 2 g) within 50 h at 20 ± 2 °C was determined and used throughout this study. ProPO and Pacifastin mRNA Expression after A. hydrophila Infection in Crayfish—To determine whether the proPO system was involved in the immune responses toward a bacterial infection, the animals were challenged with A. hydrophila. For bacterial challenge, 200 μl of A. hydrophila (4 × 106 CFU/ml) in crayfish saline buffer (CFS) (0.2 m NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2.6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, pH 6.8) was injected via the base of the fourth walking leg, and the crayfish were kept at room temperature for 3 h followed by total RNA isolation for cDNA preparation from the total hemocytes. CFS injection was done as a control treatment. Hemocyte total RNA was extracted using GenElute™ Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) followed by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) treatment. The presence of proPO or pacifastin gene transcripts was determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Complementary DNA was synthesized with ThermoScript (Invitrogen), and PCRs were performed with crayfish proPO (GenBank™ accession code X83493)-specific primers (1488+, 5′-TGCGCATTACCCATCTCGAC-3′; 2051-, 5′-ACTTCAGCATCTTGCAGGCG-3′) and pacifastin gene light chain (GenBank™ accession code U81825)-specific primers (433+, 5′-TGCACCAAGAGGCTTTGTCG-3′; 968-, 5′-TTGGAGCCATCAGTACACACAGC-3′). Crayfish 40S ribosomal protein 16S gene (GenBank™ accession code CF542417) primers (5+, 5′-CCAGGACCCCCAAACTTCTTAG-3′; 364-, 5′-GAAAACTGCCACAGCCGTTG-3′) was employed in all PCR experiments as internal controls. The PCR program was as follows: 94 °C, 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s for proPO and pacifastin genes, and 29 cycles for the 40S ribosomal protein 16S gene, respectively. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Generation of dsRNA—Oligonucleotide primers with T7 promoter sequences (italic) at the 5′-ends were synthesized to amplify a 692-bp and 550-bp region of the P. leniusculus proPO gene and pacifastin light chain, the inhibitory subunit, gene (33Liang Z. Sottrup-Jensen L. Aspán A. Hall M. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), respectively, from the crayfish hemocyte cDNA. The primer sequences were: 871+, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAGCTCACCGCTAACAACTCCG-3′ and 1563-, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGACTTCGGCTTCCTGTGCT-3′ for proPO gene; 477+, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGCCAGTCAGACAGAGGAAACG-3′ and 1026-, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTCAGTGCAAGAAGCGGAGC-3′ for pacifastin gene inhibitory domain, respectively. Control 657-bp templates were produced by PCR using primers specific to one part of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from the pd2EGFP-1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and the primers containing the T7 promoter sequences (italic) were as follows: 63+, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACGTAAACGGCCACAAGT-3′; 719-, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′. To generate dsRNA, PCR products purified by gel extraction (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used as templates for in vitro transcription using the MegaScript kit (Ambion), and dsRNA was purified with the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) method. dsRNAi in Vivo—Small intermolt crayfish (15 ± 2 g, fresh weight) were used for in vivo RNAi experiments. Shortly, four drops of hemolymph were withdrawn from the crayfish for isolation of hemocyte total RNA 1 day before the dsRNA injection. Then, 150 μg of proPO, pacifastin, or GFP dsRNA dissolved in CFS (200 μl) was injected via the base of the fourth walking leg. The injection was repeated after 24 h, and isolation of total RNA from hemocytes for quantitative RT-PCR was performed 48 h after the first dsRNA injection. The PCR templates were prepared as mentioned above. The detection and comparative quantification of proPO or pacifastin gene transcripts after dsRNA injection were done by quantitative RT-PCR to determine gene-silencing efficiency using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The expression of the proPO or pacifastin gene was normalized to the expression of the mRNA encoding the crayfish 40S ribosomal protein 16S gene for each sample. The primers used were as follows: proPO 1496+, 5′-ACCCATCTCGACCATGCAC-3′, and 1637-, 5′-AGACGCTGCTCCATGAAGC-3′; pacifastin 378+, 5′-CAGGTGGAAGGCAGATGATTG-3′, and 518-, 5′-TCAGGATCTCCATAGCACTCCG-3′; crayfish 40S ribosomal protein 16S gene, 156+, 5′-CTCTTTCTTGGAGGCTTCATCC-3′ and 280-, 5′-CAATTCGCGTTCGTGTGAAG-3′. SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR amplification was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Robotic). The hemocyte cDNA was prepared using oligo(dT) as described above. The cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 with RNase-free sterilized water. The amplification was carried out in a 25-μl reaction volume that contained 12.5 μl of 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix, 0.4-μm concentrations of each primer, and 5 μl of diluted cDNA template. RNase-free distilled water was filled to reach a total volume of 25 μl/reaction. All runs employed a negative control without target DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. All PCRs were performed in triplicates. Hemolymph PO Activity in Crayfish after Injection of proPO dsRNA or Pacifastin dsRNA—Crayfish hemolymph was collected both pre-dsRNA injection (1 day before the dsRNA injection) and 48 h after the first proPO dsRNA, pacifastin dsRNA, or GFP dsRNA injection. The detection of PO activity in hemolymph sample was performed by measurement of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) conversion to dopachrome at 490 nm. Hemolymph (150 μl) was taken and distributed into 24-well plates (Sarstedt) followed by adding 65 μl of L-dopa (3 g/liter in water) (Sigma) and 285 μl of Tris·HCl (10 mm, pH 8.0). Control samples were prepared using double-distilled water instead of crayfish hemolymph. Then, the mixed samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the 500 μl of distilled water was added, followed by monitoring the absorbance at 490 nm. Protein content was determined using a Bradford assay, and PO activity was recorded as ΔA490/mg total protein. Data gathered from at least three experiments were used for statistical analysis. Bacteria Count in proPO or Pacifastin Down-regulated Crayfish—The proPO dsRNA, pacifastin dsRNA, or GFP dsRNA injections were performed as described above, followed by A. hydrophila challenge at 48 h after the first dsRNA injection. The bacteria count was carried out in hemolymph collected 3 h after bacterial inoculation. The serial diluted hemolymph was dotted onto the Luria Bertani-agar plate (10 μl/dot) and then incubated at 30 °C overnight followed by counting of bacterial CFUs. Cumulative Mortality Assay of A. hydrophila Challenge in proPO or Pacifastin Knocked-down Crayfish—ProPO dsRNA, pacifastin dsRNA, or GFP dsRNA injections were performed as described above. The bacterial strain used was A. hydrophila. Bacterial challenges were performed at 48 h after the first dsRNA injection as described above. The cumulative mortality was recorded per hour, and the data were analyzed by Studentŉs t test. Phagocytosis Assay—Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated heat-killed A. hydrophila was prepared using a modified method previously described by Hed (35Hed J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, heat-killed A. hydrophila was washed six times in 0.9% NaCl at 1200 × g for 10 min. The bacteria were then incubated at a concentration of 109 particles/ml in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.5, containing 0.1 mg/ml FITC (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The bacteria were washed five times in 0.9% NaCl at 1200 × g for 10 min, resuspended at a concentration of 108 particles/ml in CFS, and stored at -20 °C until use. The dsRNA injections were performed as described above, and 200 μl of FITC-conjugated heat-killed A. hydrophila (4 × 106 particles/ml in CFS) was injected into the animals via the base of the fourth walking leg 48 h after the first dsRNA injection. Hemocytes were withdrawn for phagocytosis detection at 3 h after the injection of FITC-conjugated bacteria. The total hemocytes were separated by centrifugation and attached onto glass slides as previously described (36Smith V.J. Söderhäll K. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1983; 164: 299-314Crossref Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the adhering FITC-conjugated bacteria was quenched by adding a few drops of 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) for several minutes and then replaced with 0.15 m NaCl. The ingested bacteria were easily detected under the UV light microscope. The percentage of phagocytosing cells was determined by counting at least 500 live cells on each slide and dividing the number of cells with ingested fluorescent bacteria with the total number of counted cells. Our results show that the proPO and pacifastin mRNA transcripts were up-regulated 3 h after challenge with A. hydrophila in crayfish (Fig. 1), whereas mRNA for the proPO-activating enzyme (37Aspán A. Huang T.S. Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or the lipopolysaccharide- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein (38Lee S.Y. Wang R. Söderhäll K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (data not shown), two other important components involved in the crayfish proPO-system (1Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), were unaffected. To elucidate the role of phenoloxidase in the host defense against A. hydrophila, dsRNA was employed to target the proPO gene in crayfish. The efficiency of RNAi-mediated transcript depletion was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and this showed that the proPO mRNA transcript was reduced to ∼57%. No obvious difference in the amount of proPO transcript was observed between pre- and post-GFP dsRNA-treated animals (Fig. 2A). Because PO is produced by the hemocytes and is released into the hemolymph (1Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), we also determined whether silencing of the proPO gene would result in reduced PO activity in crayfish hemolymph. The level of PO activity was decreased by 33% in proPO-silenced animals, and in contrast, there was no apparent change of PO activity in the GFP dsRNA-treated animals (Fig. 3). The PO-silenced animals were then challenged with A. hydrophila to test the effect on crayfish survival. Knock down of PO decreased the time 4.8-fold from 48 to 10 h to reach 80% of cumulative mortality, and this decrease was significant (Studentŉs t test, p < 0.01, Fig. 5). In contrast, no significant difference of mortality was observed between GFP dsRNA and CFS-injected animals followed by an infection with A. hydrophila (data not shown). This result suggests that the effect of dsRNA injection on crayfish mortality is gene-specific, and hence the reduction of PO activity could result in a faster and higher mortality following a bacterial challenge than that in control animals. We also performed gene silencing of proPO to determine whether PO activity influences the growth of A. hydrophila, and therefore crayfish were injected with proPO dsRNA followed 48 h later by challenging with A. hydrophila.In parallel to measure PO activity in all proPO-silenced animals, we also determined the presence and quantity of A. hydrophila in the hemolymph of the same infected animals. Knock down of proPO strongly increased the number of growing bacteria, 2.3-fold, in proPO-depleted animals (Fig. 4), indicating that proPO may act in a bacterium-killing pathway. In summary, pretreating animals with proPO dsRNA resulted in lower proPO transcription, decreased PO activity, significantly faster cumulative mortality, and higher number of bacteria in hemolymph following a challenge with A. hydrophila.FIGURE 2RNA interference-mediated silencing of proPO gene and pacifastin gene in vivo. Total hemocyte RNA was isolated 1 day before the dsRNA injection. RNAi experiments were then carried out with injection of proPO dsRNA, pacifastin dsRNA, or GFP dsRNA. The animals were injected twice with dsRNA before the second isolation of hemocyte total RNA at 48 h after the first dsRNA injection. The results show that proPO or pacifastin gene expression is suppressed by prior injection of proPO dsRNA (A) or pacifastin dsRNA (B), respectively. In contrast, the GFP control dsRNA injection has no effect on proPO or pacifastin gene transcription. The crayfish 40S ribosomal protein 16S gene was used as an internal control for relative proPO or pacifastin gene quantification by quantitative RT-PCR.

A more detailed study showed that after silencing the inhibitory domain of the pacifastin gene (44% reduction in mRNA transcription level, Fig. 2B) the PO activity was enhanced 1.4-fold above levels of the control animals (Fig. 3). We then tested whether this knock down had any effect on host resistance toward A. hydrophila. In the microbial challenge experiments there was a significant increase in the mean survival time (p < 0.01, Studentŉs t test) by this treatment. The accumulated mortality reached 80% within 48 h in the control group, whereas the same mortality was reached 64 h after infection in the animals with an enhanced PO activity (Fig. 5). Further, the higher PO activity was accompanied by a strong decrease of bacterial CFUs (40% reduction, Fig. 4), indicating that the enhanced PO activity was correlated with both an increased survival time and enhanced bacterial clearance. We also tried to elucidate the correlation between PO activity and phagocytosis by monitoring the change of the phagocytic rate if the PO activity were decreased or increased by dsRNA silencing. Because the PO-silenced animals always died earlier (from 5 h after infection) after they were challenged with A. hydrophila, we determined the phagocytic rate of the total hemocytes in RNAi-treated animals and compared it with that of control RNAi-treated crayfish. Compared with GFP dsRNA-treated animals (2.1%), decreased PO activity in the hemolymph gave a significant 57% decrease of the phagocytic activity (0.9% of phagocytic bacteria, Studentŉs t test, p < 0.01, Fig. 6), whereas an increase in phagocytosis was observed in the pacifastin gene-silenced animals (3.7%, Studentŉs t test, p < 0.05, Fig. 6). Pretreatment of animals with GFP dsRNA, on the other hand, resulted in a rate of uptake of 2.1%, which is similar to CFS-treated animals (2.0%), suggesting that no obvious effect on phagocytosis was produced by nonspecific dsRNA treatment (data not shown). Moreover, nodule formation was quite often seen in PO activity-enhanced, but to a lesser extent in proPO-silenced, animals during our experiments (Fig. 7). Thus, it is likely that the phagocytic and nodule-forming activities in freshwater crayfish are associated with PO activity. Taken together, we assume that PO participates not only in the melanization of the parasites but also somehow enhances other cellular activities such as phagocytosis and/or nodule formation.FIGURE 7Phagocytosis and nodule formation of FITC-conjugated heat-killed A. hydrophila by crayfish hemocytes.

It is probably important while evaluating these results to keep in mind that A. hydrophila is a highly pathogenic bacterium to this crayfish. In contrast to other bacteria, the injection of a small number (100-500-fold less than Escherichia coli, for example) will suffice to kill the crayfish. One may speculate that when dealing with a pathogen capable of quickly establishing itself in the host, an immediate response by the cellular defense augmented by the melanization reaction is crucial. Other defense responses, e.g. AMPs, may be of greater significance when dealing with large numbers of less pathogenic bacteria capable of overcrowding the cellular defense. This conclusion is also strengthened by our previous results of repression of the crayfish plague Aphanomyces astaci growth in vivo in freshwater crayfish Astacus astacus (32Cerenius L.

Microbiol. 2003; 5: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), retardation of mycelial growth in vitro, and inhibition of extracellular proteinases from this special crayfish parasite by melanin and several intermediates involved in the proPO system (39Söderhäll K. Ajaxon R. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1982; 39: 105-109Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In line with these results, a recent study demonstrates that PO inhibition leads to increased host susceptibility (40Eleftherianos I. Boundy S. Joyce S.A. Aslam S. Marshall J.W. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Clarke D.J. ffrench-Constant R.H. Reynolds S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similar results, that the predominant lytic loss of parasites may result from overproduction and circulation of toxic byproducts during melanin synthesis (18Michel K. Budd A. Pinto S. Gibson T.J. Kafatos F.C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), are described in mosquitos lacking the serpin SRPN2. So far, all invertebrate POs identified in detail are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by a limited proteolysis. One should bear in mind that the activation of such serine protease cascades must be tightly controlled. Serine proteinase inhibitors are, henceforth, employed to regulate this activation process by preventing excessive activation that is often fatal to hosts (33Liang Z. Sottrup-Jensen L. Aspán A.

This mutant is more susceptible to infection by Beauveria bassiana (43De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The Spn27Aex32, another protein null mutant for Spn27A homozygous or hemizygous progeny that developed spontaneous melanization, results in a higher rate of lethality at mid-pupal stages (44Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Ji C. Leclerc V. Duvic B. Belvin M. Jiang H. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6330-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that a tight control of melanization is required for a proper antifungal response or development in flies. In crayfish, we speculate that endogenous proteinase inhibitors could, perhaps, be employed to protect certain tissues or cells by inhibiting unnecessary production of highly toxic and reactive compounds as well. If pacifastin is silenced, such protective roles could be affected, which may explain that the mortality always reaches 100% after some time in pacifastin-silenced animals. Proteins associated with the proPO-activating system such as, for example, peroxinectin are known to mediate cell communication, opsonization, and cell adhesion (1Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion is the first step in many cellular responses, including hemocyte spreading, phagocytosis, nodule formation, encapsulation, and hemocyte aggregation. Peroxinectin, an active adhesion molecule from crayfish, is an efficient mediator or promoter of adhesion of semigranular and granular hemocytes (45Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), encapsulation (46Kobayashi M. Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 13-18Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and phagocytosis (47Thörnqvist P.O. Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1994; 18: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, the extracellular processing of properoxinectin into active peroxinectin was shown to involve proteolytic steps shared with the proPO-activating system to generate the catalytically active PO (48Lin X. Cerenius L. Lee B.L. Söderhäll K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, elevated activity of proPO-activating enzyme caused by silencing of pacifastin will probably increase the activation of peroxinectin, leading to higher hemocyte cell adhesion activity and thus a higher phagocytic rate in crayfish. However, the detailed correlations between peroxinectin activity and the proPO system in the activation of phagocytosis still remain to be elucidated. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that RNAi of proPO leads to increased bacterial growth and a significantly increased mortality rate following a bacterial challenge. In contrast, RNAi of pacifastin results in increased survival time and enhanced bacterial clearance. These data together strongly suggest that phenoloxidase is necessary for crayfish immune defense against a pathogenic bacterial infection."

https://openalex.org/W2000103717,"Neurons are thought to use diverse families of cell-surface molecules for cell recognition during circuit assembly. In Drosophila, alternative splicing of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene potentially generates 38,016 closely related transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, each comprising one of 19,008 alternative ectodomains linked to one of two alternative transmembrane segments. These ectodomains show isoform-specific homophilic binding, leading to speculation that Dscam proteins mediate cell recognition. Genetic studies have established that Dscam is required for neural circuit assembly, but the extent to which isoform diversity contributes to this process is not known. Here we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam diversity is essential for circuit assembly. Using homologous recombination, we reduced the entire repertoire of Dscam ectodomains to just a single isoform. Neural circuits in these mutants are severely disorganized. Furthermore, we show that it is crucial for neighbouring neurons to express distinct isoforms, but that the specific identity of the isoforms expressed in an individual neuron is unimportant. We conclude that Dscam diversity provides each neuron with a unique identity by which it can distinguish its own processes from those of other neurons, and that this self-recognition is essential for wiring the Drosophila brain."
https://openalex.org/W2157736050,"NAD kinases (NADKs) are vital, as they generate the cellular NADP pool. As opposed to three compartment-specific isoforms in plants and yeast, only a single NADK has been identified in mammals whose cytoplasmic localization we established by immunocytochemistry. To understand the physiological roles of the human enzyme, we generated and analyzed cell lines stably deficient in or overexpressing NADK. Short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation led to similar (about 70%) decrease of both NADK expression, activity, and the NADPH concentration and was accompanied by increased sensitivity toward H2O2. Overexpression of NADK resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in the NADPH, but not NADP+, concentration, although the recombinant enzyme phosphorylated preferentially NAD+. Surprisingly, NADK overexpression and the ensuing increase of the NADPH level only moderately enhanced protection against oxidant treatment. Apparently, to maintain the NADPH level for the regeneration of oxidative defense systems human cells depend primarily on NADP-dependent dehydrogenases (which re-reduce NADP+), rather than on a net increase of NADP. The stable shifts of the NADPH level in the generated cell lines were also accompanied by alterations in the expression of peroxiredoxin 5 and Nrf2. Because the basal oxygen radical level in the cell lines was only slightly changed, the redox state of NADP may be a major transmitter of oxidative stress.

Because the basal oxygen radical level in the cell lines was only slightly changed, the redox state of NADP may be a major transmitter of oxidative stress. Recent investigations have established the pyridine nucleotides not only as key molecules for metabolic conversions, but also as critical regulators of major cellular events. In particular, NAD+ appears to act as a versatile molecule with both messenger and bioenergetic functions (1Berger F. Ramirez-Hernandez M.H. Ziegler M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Whereas NAD is largely present in its oxidized state (NAD+), its phosphorylated counterpart, NADP, is predominantly found in its reduced form, as NADPH (2Burch H.B. Bradley M.E. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4546-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Indeed, the most prominent function of NADP appears to be the maintenance of a pool of reducing equivalents for metabolic systems that in one way or another protect the cell from damage. Most prominently, NADPH is essential to the regeneration of all known oxidative defense systems, such as glutathione, thioredoxin, and peroxiredoxins. Moreover, detoxifying pathways (for example, cytochromes P450 and catalase) as well as the NADPH oxidase, which catalyzes the “oxidative burst” as part of the immune response, depend on NADPH. Interestingly, the redox properties of the NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH couples are similar, but their functions are largely divergent. Apparently, a major reason for this separation is the possibility to maintain one pool, namely NADP, in its reduced form to assure an immediate regeneration of the defense systems following oxidative assaults. In this role, NADPH is of vital importance, because survival following oxidative stress, which accompanies a multitude of pathological states such as inflammatory processes or ischemia/reperfusion injury, depends primarily on the capacity of the defense systems. Nevertheless, surprisingly little is known regarding the generation and maintenance of the cellular NADP pool, especially in mammalian cells. The only reaction known to yield NADP is the phosphorylation of NAD by NAD kinase (NADK). 2The abbreviations used are: NADK, NAD kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: NADK, NAD kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.

Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of a chloroplast-specific isoform in Arabidopsis dramatically affected chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis (16Chai M.F.

Uchimiya H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It would appear, therefore, that the presence of NADK within the cytosol and certain subcellular organelles is physiologically important. However, unlike in yeast and plants, only a single gene encoding NADK has been found in mammals (18Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As the only animal NADK so far, the molecular identity of the human enzyme was established, and its activity kinetically characterized (18Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Its counterpart in mouse has so far only been referred to as unpublished work, which indicated that its deletion is lethal (9Shianna K.V. Marchuk D.A. Strand M.K. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The subcellular location of NADK in animals has not been determined, although earlier work suggested these enzymes to be cytosolic (19McGuinness E.T. Butler J.R. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In any case, the existence of only a single NADK isoform in humans would raise the problem as to how at least two separate pools, the nuclear/cytosolic and the mitochondrial, might be established. That is, both pools contain a substantial amount of the cellular NADP, but there is no evidence for a physiological exchange of NADP across the inner mitochondrial membrane, except in plants (20Bykova N.V. Moller I.M. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 111: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several NAD kinases from lower organisms exhibit specificity toward either NAD+ or NADH as substrate. The direct conversion of the reduced form to NADPH might be advantageous, as no further reduction of NADP+ by specific dehydrogenases would be required. On the other hand, the necessity of a specific reduction step might be an important prerequisite to maintain opposite redox ratios for NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH. So far it is unknown whether the human enzyme is selective for the reduced or oxidized form of NAD. It was observed, however, that this enzyme is highly specific for ATP as phosphoryl donor and does also not tolerate modifications of the pyridine moiety (18Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although information on the human form has remained scarce, the alteration of this possibly single NADK activity would be expected to greatly influence the cellular level of NADP and thereby NADP-dependent pathways including anti-oxidative defense systems. To understand the functional significance of the known human NADK we have generated cell lines stably overexpressing human NADK or small hairpin RNA targeting the NADK mRNA. Overexpression of NADK resulted in an almost 200-fold increase of both the mRNA level, the protein amount and the catalytic activity. Knock-down resulted in an about 3-fold lower mRNA level, which was accompanied by a similar decrease of the cellular NADK activity. Human NADK was found to reside in the cytoplasm and preferentially accepted NAD+ as substrate. However, the modulation of NADK expression was primarily reflected in the alteration of the NADPH, and not NADP+, levels. Our results are consistent with an essential role of the cytoplasmic protein in maintaining the cellular level of NADPH. Construction of Expression Vectors—For eukaryotic expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged human NADK the cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primer 5′-GCGGGAATTCAATGGAAATGGAACAAGAA and 5′-CCGCGGTACCGCCCTCCTCCTCCTC and subsequently ligated into pFLAG-CMV-4 (Sigma) using EcoRI and KpnI sites. An additional sequence encoding a C-terminal 6× histidine tag was subsequently introduced via KpnI and BamHI sites using rehybridized synthetic oligonucleotides. For eukaryotic expression of C-terminally FLAG-tagged human NADK the cDNA was amplified using the primer pair 5′-GCGGGAATTCCACCATGGAAATGGAACAAGAAAAAATG and 5′-GGCGGGATCCGCCCTCCTCCTCCTCCTCC following ligation into pFLAG-CMV-5a (Sigma) via EcoRI and BamHI sites.

In brief, DNA sequences encoding sh-RNAs against human NADK (targeted against positions 313–335 and 334–356 in mRNA) or eGFP (targeted against positions 122–143 in mRNA) (22Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S.

Subsequently, the shRNA expression cassettes were subcloned into the pCMV/Myc/Cyto (Invitrogen) via its KpnI and XhoI sites (see Fig. 3A).

Colonies were isolated after 2 weeks in media containing 0.55 mg/ml G-418 (PAA Laboratories) followed by another round of subclonal selection. Stably transfected, monoclonal HEK293 lines were maintained in medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml G-418. Treatment of Cells with Oxidants—All experiments were performed on actively growing cells. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 g/liter d-glucose containing 1 mm H2O2 (Merck) or 100 μm menadione sodium bisulfite (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated for the indicated period of time. Measurement of Cell Viability—24 h before treatment, HEK293 cells were seeded at equal density on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well cell culture plates. Cells were treated with H2O2 (1 mm) or menadione (100 μm) in PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 g/liter d-glucose for 30 min. After 21 h, the culture medium was replaced by medium containing 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 0.3 mg/ml), and incubation continued for 3 h. The MTT solution was aspirated and the generated formazan dissolved in 100 μl Me2SO. The absorbance was determined using a microplate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG-Labtech) at 600 nm. Cell viability is expressed as percentage of the absorbance obtained using untreated control cells. Determination of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Levels—Intracellular accumulation of ROS was determined using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, Invitrogen). This nonfluorescent dye is permeable to cells where it is hydrolyzed to DCFH and oxidized by ROS to the fluorescent DCF. The cells were seeded at equal density on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well cell culture plates and grown overnight. Cells were then loaded with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA in PBS containing 1 g/liter d-glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing the cells with PBS, they were treated with 1 mm H2O2 or 100 μm menadione in PBS supplemented with 1 g/liter d-glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min. The solution was replaced by PBS, and the DCF fluorescence measured in a fluorescence microplate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA) at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Fluorescence was normalized to the protein content, and data are represented relative to untreated control cells. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—Cells were scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PefablocSC, Roth), incubated 5 min on ice and pulled through a 23-gauge needle. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,200 rpm and 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected to separation in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) the blots were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies directed either against human NADK (Abnova Corporation), the FLAG epitope (Sigma), or β-tubulin (Sigma), and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). The rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against PRDX5 was a kind gift from Dr. N. V. Tomilin (St. Petersburg). The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 and HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked using EMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The primary antibodies were anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-NADK (Abnova Corporation) and secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor 488- or 594-conjugated IgGs (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using an inverted Leica DMI 6000B microscope. Measurement of NAD Kinase Activity—NAD kinase activity in cell lysates was assayed by a two-step procedure described previously (14Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. First, 30 μg of cell lysate was added to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NAD+, 10 mm ATP in a final volume of 100 μl following incubation for 5 min at 30 °C. The amount of NADP+ produced was then determined, using a cycling assay, by transferring the mixture into 900 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose-6-phosphate, 2 units of NADP-specific yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mm MTT, and 1.5 mm phenazine methosulfate (PMS). Reduction of MTT was monitored at 600 nm for 5 min using a BioMate3 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation), and the amount of NADP quantified by comparison to known concentrations of NADP+ standards. NADK activity was calculated by subtracting the amount of NADP produced without added substrates, and one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 μmol of NADP in 1 min at 30 °C. For measurements of NAD+ or NADH phosphorylation by the bacterially expressed recombinant NADK, the enzyme was isolated as described previously (18Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and nucleotide conversion analyzed by HPLC (see below). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the indicated cell lines using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol and used for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase (Mu-MLV, Fermentas) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Real-time PCR probes and primers specific for the indicated cDNAs were selected using the Universal Probe Library (Roche Applied Science). Aliquots of cDNA were amplified in a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Applied Science) using LightCycler 480 Probes Master (Roche Applied Science) in triplicate reactions. PCR cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 s. Transcript levels were calculated relative to β-actin mRNA levels as endogenous control. Relative expression was calculated (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). Analyses of Nucleotides and Redox Status—Nucleotides were extracted by adding 0.5 m KOH to dishes of cells, which were then scraped off and pulled through a 23-gauge needle. After incubation for 3 min on ice, the extracts were neutralized by adding phosphoric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatants were filtered through a 5,000 Da cut-off membrane using microcentrifugation devices (Millipore). The nucleotides in the filtrates were then immediately separated by reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC and quantified by peak integration based on analyses of standard nucleotides. Besides retention times, nucleotide peaks from cell extracts were verified by their UV spectra (200–400 nm). The HPLC system consisted of a LC-20AB solvent delivery module, an SPD-M20A photodiode array detector and a SIL-20AC autosampler (Shimadzu). Nucleotides were separated in a 125 mm × 2 mm (ID) Nucleodur C18 gravity, 3-μm pore size, column (Macherey & Nagel) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with buffer A consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and the ion-pairing reagent tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBA, 2 mm). Following injection of the sample, the column was washed with buffer A for 3 min. Thereafter, nucleotides were eluted in a 5-min gradient to 25% buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, 2 mm TBA, and 50% acetonitrile), followed by a 15-min gradient to 40% buffer B. The column was then rinsed by increasing the concentration of buffer B to 95% for 5 min followed by re-equilibration with buffer A for 5 min before the next injection. Human NADK Is a Cytoplasmic, NADP+-generating Enzyme—To establish the subcellular location of human NADK, we first analyzed the primary structure for the existence of potential amino acid motifs that would indicate a targeting sequence. The PSORT II algorithm (24Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar) predicts NADK to be cytoplasmic. The experiments presented in Fig. 1 are consistent with this prediction: independent of whether a FLAG tag was attached to the N terminus (FLAG-NADK) or C terminus (NADK-FLAG), the protein was detected within the cytoplasm, but not mitochondria, as visualized by the concomitant staining of HeLa and HEK293 (not shown) cells with mitotracker. During the original isolation of NADK from mammalian tissues it was noted that the enzyme activity is rather low because of low protein expression rather than a low specific activity (18Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, immunostaining of untransfected cells using a commercial monoclonal NADK antibody did not reveal any specific staining (not shown). The recent identification and characterization of NAD kinases from various species has established that several of these enzymes can use both NAD+ and NADH as substrate, whereas some appear to be selective for NAD+ (reviewed in Refs. 10Pollak N. Dölle C. Ziegler M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 25Magni G. Orsomando G. Raffaelli N. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), the human enzyme readily accepted NAD+ as substrate, whereas a conversion of NADH to NADPH was rather slow at a substrate concentration of 5 mm. Note that the incubation time of NADK with NAD+ (Fig. 2A) was only 10 min compared with 60 min when NADH was used as substrate (Fig. 2B). However, at lower concentrations (50–150 μm) and particularly when NAD+ was concomitantly present as substrate, NADH became far more efficiently phosphorylated (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, NAD+ was clearly the preferred substrate (Fig. 2C): in the absence of the other substrate, at 100 μm, NAD+ was 10-fold faster phosphorylated than NADH. These observations indicate that NADH may become inhibitory at very high concentrations (mm) and that its phosphorylation is stimulated in the presence of NAD+. According to a previous report (26Mori S. Kawai S. Shi F. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24104-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the “relaxed” selectivity of NAD kinases is associated with the presence of a glycine or a polar amino acid in the position corresponding to residue 312 (glutamine) in the human enzyme (Fig. 2D). It was shown, for example, for the NAD+-specific NADK from Escherichia coli that a substitution of the corresponding arginine 175 residue by glycine resulted in the capability of the enzyme to phosphorylate NADH (26Mori S. Kawai S. Shi F. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24104-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is a polar residue (glutamine) in the human enzyme (Fig. 2D) consistent with its capability to use NADH as substrate. Modulation of NAD+Kinase Activity in HEK293 Cells—We constructed HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human NADK, which we termed NADK(+) cells. Moreover, to decrease the NADK activity, HEK293 cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting the NADK mRNA were also generated. Two different shRNAs targeting two different parts of the NADK mRNA were chosen (shRNA1-NADK and shRNA2-NADK, see Fig. 3A). Control cells were transfected with a vector mediating the expression of an unrelated shRNA, which was directed against the mRNA of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The efficiency of the selected shRNAs was analyzed by co-transfection of a pFLAG-NADK plasmid and the respective shRNA-NADK construct followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, co-expression of the shRNAs reduced FLAG-NADK expression indicating their suitability for down-regulation of endogenous NADK. The shRNA1-NADK exhibited a notably higher efficiency compared with the shRNA2-NADK construct. Stable transformants for the recombinant NADK and shRNA constructs were generated as described under “Materials and Methods” and characterized for their NADK content with regard to catalytic activity, mRNA and protein levels. As shown in Table 1, both shRNA-NADK-expressing cell lines exhibited substantially less NADK activity compared with control cells, whereas cells overexpressing NADK showed a dramatic increase in the specific activity, and this was similar for all selected clones initially analyzed (not shown).TABLE 1NAD+ kinase activity and transcript levels in HEK293 cells with modulated NADK expression NAD+ kinase activity in cell extracts of HEK293 cell lines was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are presented as units/g protein. One unit is defined as 1 μmol NADP produced per min. The reported values are the means of three independent experiments ± S.D. NADK mRNA transcript levels were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to β-actin.

Furthermore, immunoblot analyses using a monoclonal anti-NADK antibody showed similar alterations on the protein level with a marked decrease of NADK in the knock-down cells (Fig. 3D). Based upon the more efficient down-regulation compared with shRNA2-NADK, subsequent experiments were conducted using the cells expressing shRNA1-NADK, which were designated NADK(-) cells. None of the expressed constructs (NADK or shRNA1-NADK) caused any visible phenotypic changes of the cells (Fig. 3E) nor was the proliferation rate affected (not shown). Human NAD Kinase Activity Controls the Cellular Concentration of NADPH—We next investigated the influence of the NADK expression level on the cellular pyridine nucleotide state. The nucleotides were extracted by alkali treatment. Under these conditions the reduced nucleotides are stable, while the oxidized ones tend to hydrolyze. The experimental protocol was optimized such that about 75–80% of the oxidized and almost 100% of the reduced nucleotides were recovered (not shown). The filtered cellular extracts were analyzed by reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC. The nucleotide spectrum (including pyridine nucleotides, ATP and ADP, see Fig. 4A and Table 2) was surprisingly similar in all cell lines studied. However, overexpression of NADK caused a 4–5-fold increase in the NADPH content, whereas the concentration of this nucleotide was about 3-fold decreased in the NADK(-) cells (Fig. 4, B and C). These observations were somewhat unexpected, because human NADK would rather phosphorylate NAD+ (see above). Because the NADP+ concentration did not prominently change, the excessive NADPH generated in the NADK(+) cells must have arisen from the reduction by NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. At least within the cytosol, among the major NADP+-reduci"

We have previously shown that in endothelial cells Semaphorin 4D acts through its receptor, Plexin-B1, to elicit a pro-angiogenic phenotype that involves the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Here we show through the use of a receptor chimeric approach, Plexin-B1 mutants, and dominant negative and pharmacological inhibitors that this response is dependent upon the activation of RhoA and its downstream target, Rho kinase (ROK). Indeed, we demonstrate that in endothelial cells, Semaphorin 4D promotes the formation of focal adhesion complexes, stress fibers, and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain, a response that was abolished by the use of ROK inhibitors and absent from cells expressing Plexin-B1 mutant constructs incapable of signaling to RhoA. Stress fiber polymerization and contraction are in turn necessary for RhoA-dependent pro-angiogenic signaling through Plexin-B1. Furthermore, we observed that in endothelial cells Plexin-B1 promotes the integrin-mediated activation of Pyk2, resulting in the stimulation of PI3K, Akt, and ERK. These findings provide evidence that Plexin-B1 promotes endothelial cell motility through RhoA and ROK by regulating the integrin-dependent signaling networks that result in the activation of PI3K and Akt.

The semaphorins are a family of transmembrane and secreted proteins originally identified as regulators of axonal growth and neurite extension in the developing nervous system (1Kolodkin A.L.

Currently, more than 20 semaphorins have been identified, which are grouped into eight classes; classes 1 and 2 are invertebrate semaphorins, classes 3–7 are found in vertebrates, and an eighth class, class V, has been identified in some non-neurotropic DNA viruses (1Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 15Goodman C.S. Kolodkin A.L. Luo Y. Püschel A.W. Raper J.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 551-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plexins, which are receptors for the semaphorins, share homology in their extracellular segment with the scatter factor receptors c-Met and RON but fail to exhibit significant homology with any other known receptor in their intracellular region (16Ohta K. Mizutani A. Kawakami A. Murakami Y. Kasuya Y. Takagi S. Tanaka H. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1189-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In humans, at least nine plexins have been identified and grouped into four families, A through D, most of which have been shown to mediate neuronal cell adhesion and contact, nerve fasciculation, and axon guidance (17Carmeliet P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 2005; 436: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Secreted semaphorins, such as those in class 3, require co-receptors, the neuropilins, to bind and initiate intracellular signaling through the plexins (18Rohm B. Ottemeyer A. Lohrum M. Puschel A.W. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M.

Ligation of plexins by semaphorins initiates a signaling cascade, which in many cases involves small GTPases of the Ras and Rho family and their signaling pathways. For example, Plexin-A1 and Plexin-B1 are known to act as R-Ras GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) when bound by their respective semaphorins (20Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11473-11480Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Plexin-B1 may also compete for Rac binding with p21-activated kinase; therefore, in addition to inhibiting R-Ras signaling, Plexin-B1 may sequester Rac and inhibit p21-activated kinase activation (22Vikis H.G. Li W. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Plexin-B1 can also inhibit RhoA signaling in certain cell culture conditions through the membrane trapping of p190 RhoGAP (23Barberis D. Casazza A. Sordella R. Corso S. Artigiani S. Settleman J. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4689-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this regard, however, our group and others have found that the Rho-specific GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors), leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), and PDZ-RhoGEF bind to the C terminus of Plexin-B1 and mediate activation of the small GTPase RhoA in response to Sema4D (24Aurandt J.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, we have observed that the robust migratory and pro-angiogenic response elicited by Sema4D in endothelial cells is dependent upon the ability of Plexin-B1 to stimulate RhoA (25Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We have also observed that Plexin-B1 stimulation in endothelial cells leads to the activation of an intracellular tyrosine kinase cascade resulting in the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt (30Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study suggests that Plexin-B1 can utilize RhoA to stimulate ERK (31Aurandt J. Li W. Guan K.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). How Plexin-B1 activates ERK through RhoA and which of the signaling pathways controlled by Plexin-B1 result in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activation are at the present unknown. In the present study, we used a chimeric receptor approach, Plexin-B1 mutants, and dominant negative and pharmacological inhibitors of RhoA signaling to show that in endothelial cells the Plexin-B1-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Akt, ERK, and Pyk2 are dependent upon its ability to activate RhoA and not on Plexin-B1 residues involved in its RasGAP activity. We show that in those cells capable of signaling to RhoA, Sema4D treatment results in phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), as a consequence of ROK activation, and the downstream polymerization and contraction of actin/myosin stress fibers. We also provide evidence that, in response to Sema4D activation of Plexin-B1, integrin-mediated attachment to the extracellular matrix is required for pro-angiogenic signaling to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and ERK in endothelial cells downstream from RhoA. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Sigma). Cells stably expressing Trk-A/Plexin-B1 fusion proteins (see below) were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Trk/Plexin Fusion Proteins—Trk-A/Plexin-B1 fusion proteins were made as previously described (28Perrot V. Vazquez-Prado J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43115-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intracellular portion of Plexin-B1 with and without the PDZ binding motif was cut out of the plasmid pCEFL EGFP Plexin-B1 with NheI/NotI and cloned in-frame with the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor Trk-A in the vector pCEFL-HA. The constructs were then transfected into endothelial cells using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stable cells selected in G418. A Trk-A/Plexin-B1 mutant lacking key residues involved in RasGAP activity was generated as previously described (30Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Production of Soluble Semaphorin 4D—Semaphorin 4D was produced and purified as described previously (25Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extracellular portion of mouse Semaphorin 4D was subjected to PCR and the resulting product cloned into the plasmid pSecTag2B (Invitrogen). This construct was transfected into 293T cells growing in serum-free medium using the calcium chloride (Fluka Chemika, Sigma Aldrich) BES (Fluka Chemika) method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Medium containing soluble Semaphorin 4D was collected 65 h post-transfection and purified with TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration and purity of the TALON eluates were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis with silver stain (Amersham Biosciences) and the Bio-Rad assay (Hercules, CA). In all cases, medium collected from parallel transfectants using the empty pSecTag2B vector was used as control. Measurement of R-Ras Activity—Cells were maintained on plates coated with collagen (10 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) or poly-l-lysine (1 μg/ml; Sigma) and treated with 100 ng/ml NGF (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) for 10 min. The cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm β-glycero-phosphate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl/ml aprotinin and leupeptin; Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm NaF and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate; Sigma). Aliquots were reserved for an immunoblot, while the rest was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) previously bound to glutathione S-transferase fused to the Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1 for 30 min at 4 °C to affinity precipitate GTP-bound R-Ras. The beads were washed in ice-cold lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis along with aliquots of total protein and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The membranes were then incubated with anti-R-Ras antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were treated with soluble 400 ng/ml Sema4D (see above) or 100 ng/ml NGF (Upstate) and infected with lentivirus encoding the RGS or PDZ domains of PDZ-RhoGEF (see below) or co-treated with the following inhibitors, where indicated: 25 μm HA1077 (fasudil; Calbiochem), 100 μm blebbistatin (Calbiochem), 50 μm RGDS peptide (Sigma), 67 units of tetanolysin and C3 toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) to inhibit ROK, stress fiber contraction, integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin, and RhoA, respectively. Cells were then lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (see above) for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad assay. 100 μg of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp.). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies. The antibodies used were as follows: Sema4D (BD Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences), phospho-Akt (Ser-473; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology), total ERK (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-Pyk2 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), total Pyk2 (BD Biosciences), Myc (Santa Cruz C-33), GFP (Covance, Princeton, NJ), phospho-MLC (Cell Signaling Technology), paxillin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and tubulin (TU-02; Santa Cruz). Proteins were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Pierce) and quantitation performed with NIH image software. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in buffer (see above), and proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with antibody against Pyk2 (BD Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were recovered with γ-bind-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Lysates and anti-Pyk2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see above) and immunoblotted with anti-Pyk2, anti-phospho Pyk2, and anti-paxillin antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Lentiviral Infections—CSCG-based retroviral vectors were prepared as previously reported (33Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) for EGFP-RGS and EGFP-PDZ expression using 293T cells as the packaging cells. Endothelial cells were infected with viral supernatants for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 μg/ml of polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma). The plates were washed twice with PBS and returned to normal medium. Immunofluorescence—Endothelial cells expressing the Trk-A/Plexin-B1 full-length ΔPBM and RasGAP mutant chimera were grown on sterile glass coverslips in 35-mm six-well plates and treated with 400 ng/ml of purified Sema4D or 100 ng/ml NGF, with and without 25 μm HA1077 or 50 μm RGDS peptide for 3 min. The cells were processed for phalloidin staining and paxillin immunofluorescence as follows (all steps were carried out at room temperature). The cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Alternatively, 293T cells grown on poly-l-lysine were transfected as indicated and incubated 24 h later with anti-Myc antibodies (1/100 in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) at 4 °C for 1 h to label membrane-exposed TrkA chimera before fixation. The cells were blocked in 3% fetal bovine serum for 30 min, followed by a 1-h incubation in a humidity chamber with anti-paxillin antibody (1:200 dilution in PBS with 3% fetal bovine serum; BD Transduction Laboratories). After three more washings with PBS, coverslips were again placed in a humidity chamber for 1 h and covered with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno-Research) and phalloidin, (Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin; Invitrogen), both diluted at 1:400 in PBS with 3% fetal bovine serum. Coverslips were inverted and mounted onto glass slides with Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken using a SPOT digital camera attached to a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Stress fiber formation was determined as described previously (30Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The number of endothelial cells exhibiting stress fiber polymerization were counted and the results expressed as a percentage of the total number of endothelial cells counted. Migration Assays—Serum-free medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (positive control), 0.5% bovine serum albumin (negative control), or 400 ng/ml of purified Sema4D was placed in the bottom well of a Boyden chamber and served as a chemoattractant. Serum-starved endothelial cells were added to the top chamber with or without the indicated concentrations of RGDS peptide. The two chambers were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone membrane (8-μ pore size, Osmonics; GE Water Technologies, Trevose, PA) coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen). The migration assay was then performed as described (30Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 7 h, the chamber was disassembled and the membrane stained with Diff-Quick stain (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL), placed on a glass slide, and scanned. Densitometric quantitation was performed with NIH image software and cell migration expressed as staining intensity relative to the negative control wells. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and average and standard deviation calculated. Plexin-B1 Signaling Is Dependent upon Its Ability to Activate RhoA, but Not on Its Ras GAP Activity—We have previously demonstrated that Sema4D induces polymerization of actin stress fibers and chemotaxis in endothelial cells that is dependent upon the ability of Plexin-B1 to activate RhoA (25Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our group and others also have observed phosphorylation of Akt, Pyk2, (30Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and ERK (31Aurandt J. Li W. Guan K.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in response to treatment with Sema4D, although the question remains whether or not this response is specifically dependent upon Rho. To address this question and to examine whether the ability of Plexin-B1 to act as a RasGAP is important in these responses, we generated endothelial cells stably expressing chimeric receptor constructs containing the extracellular portion of the NGF receptor, Trk-A, fused to the full-length intracellular portion of Plexin-B1, the intracellular portion of Plexin-B1 mutated at the arginine residues required for RasGAP activity (20Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 34Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar, 35Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and a chimeric receptor where the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of Plexin-B1 necessary for recruiting PDZ-RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF and activating RhoA was deleted (28Perrot V. Vazquez-Prado J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43115-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed the localization of Trk-A/Plexin-B1 wild-type control (WT), Ras GAP mutant (mut), and the C-terminal PDZ binding motif deletion chimera (ΔPBM) in 293T. As shown by confocal analysis after surface staining of living cells, all three chimeric molecules accumulated at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). We then examined whether the Trk-A/Plexin-B1 chimera functions as a ligand-dependent R-RasGAP protein, as shown for the endogenous Plexin-B1 in response to Sema4D (34Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). We performed a pulldown assay in NGF-treated 293T cells expressing the Trk-A/Plexin-B1 wild-type receptor (WT) grown on poly-l-lysine or on collagen, which increases endogenous R-Ras-GTP levels (Fig. 1B), as previously reported (34Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with an active mutant of R-Ras were used as an internal control. The level of R-Ras-GTP was clearly diminished in response to NGF in Trk-A/Plexin-B1-expressing cells, consistent with the ligand-activated R-Ras-GAP activity of Plexin-B1 (Fig. 1B) (34Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Trk-A/Plexin-B1 R-RasGAP mutant failed to block R-Ras activation, whereas Trk-A/Plexin-B1 lacking its C-terminal PDZ binding motif (ΔPBM) was still able to function as a ligand-dependent R-RasGAP protein (Fig. 1C). We then began investigating how Plexin-B1 signals in endothelial cells, by expressing Trk-A/Plexin-B1 wild-type control (WT) and the R-Ras GAP mutant (mut) and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif deletion (ΔPBM) chimeras (Fig. 1D). Endothelial cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips, treated with NGF to elicit Plexin-B1 signaling, and analyzed under immunofluorescence for development of focal adhesion complexes and polymerization of actin/myosin stress fibers. Wild-type and R-RasGAP mutant chimeras demonstrated robust stress fiber polymerization (Fig. 1, E and F, WT and R-RasGAPmut, respectively), indicating that the ability of Plexin-B1 to act as a R-RasGAP is not necessary for stress fiber polymerization, whereas cells expressing the Trk-A/Plexin-B1 ΔPBM mutant construct failed to do so (Fig. 1, E and F, ΔPBM). We also observed phosphorylation and activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in both wild-type (WT) and R-RasGAP mutant (mut)-expressing cells in response to NGF (Fig. 1G, left two columns), but not in cells stably expressing the ΔPBM mutants incapable of signaling RhoA (Fig. 1G, right two columns). Activation of RhoA Is Necessary for Plexin-B1 Signaling in Endothelial Cells—The PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF has been shown to disrupt RhoA signaling in response to Plexin-B1 activation in a dominant negative manner by competing for endogenous PDZ binding domains of the Rho GEFs (28Perrot V. Vazquez-Prado J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43115-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway does not involve the RGS domain of the Rho GEFs, which links Gα12- and Gα13-coupled receptors to RhoA activation (36Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We thus decided to test the effect of PDZ and RGS overexpression on Plexin-B1 signaling. First, confocal analysis showed the correct membrane localization of the Trk-A/Plexin-B1 chimera in 293T cells overexpressing GFP and the PDZ or RGS domains fused to GFP (Fig. 2A). We also confirmed that the overexpression of these domains did not affect the ligand-dependent R-RasGAP activity of the Plexin-B1 intracellular domain (Fig. 2B). Vectors expressing these EGFP-tagged RGS and PDZ domains of PDZ-RhoGEF were then engineered and packaged into lentiviruses, which were used to infect endothelial cells. The expression of both EGFP-PDZ and EGFP-RGS constructs in infected cells was confirmed by Western blot for EGFP (Fig. 2C) and visualization of EGFP expression under the fluorescent microscope (Fig. 2D). Endothelial cells treated with Sema4D revealed phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and Pyk2 when infected by viruses encoding EGFP-RGS, but not with EGFP-PDZ-expressing viruses (Fig. 2E, left two columns). Phosphorylation of these proteins in control-treated cells, but not in cells treated with the RhoA-specific inhibitor C3 toxin, provided further evidence for the importance of RhoA in Plexin-B1-mediated activation of Akt, ERK, and Pyk2 (Fig. 2E, right two columns). The phosphorylation of MLC by ROK contributes to actin polymerization and increased myosin light chain contractility downstream from RhoA activation. Thus, the status of phosphorylation of MLC served as a control for monitoring RhoA function (38Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed loss of MLC phosphorylation, and therefore actin/myosin stress fiber contraction, in cells infected with the EGFP-PDZ virus but not in EGFP-RGS-infected populations (Fig. 2E, left two columns, P-MLC) and in cells treated with the C3 toxin, but not in the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2E, right two columns). Taken together, these results suggested that the phosphorylation and activation of Pyk2, Akt, and ERK1/2, as well as phosphorylation of MLC and hence contraction of the stress fibers that form in Sema4D-treated endothelial cells, are dependent upon Plexin-B1-mediated activation of RhoA and ROK.

A recent and exciting proposal is that a dynamic intersubunit interplay may contribute to GPCR activation. Here, we examined this possibility using dimeric metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We first developed a system to perfectly control their subunit composition and show that mGluR dimers do not form larger oligomers. We then examined an mGluR dimer containing one subunit in which the extracellular agonist-binding domain was uncoupled from the G protein-activating transmembrane domain. Despite this uncoupling in one protomer, agonist stimulation resulted in symmetric activation of either transmembrane domain in the dimer with the same efficiency. This, plus other data, can only be explained by an intersubunit rearrangement as the activation mechanism. Although well established for other types of receptors such as tyrosine kinase and guanylate cyclase receptors, this is the first clear demonstration that such a mechanism may also apply to GPCRs.

The common structural feature of all GPCRs is a transmembrane domain (TMD) made of seven transmembrane segments (TM1–TM7). Despite the vast variety of ligands and the low sequence similarity between GPCRs from various classes, their activation results from similar conformational changes in their TMDs (2Schwartz T.W.

In particular, movement of TM6 likely opens a crevice allowing interaction with the C terminus of the G protein α-subunit, triggering its activation (5Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin.

Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Guo W. Shi L. Filizola M. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9297-9301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To further elucidate a possible role of an intersubunit rearrangement in the activation of a dimeric GPCR, we chose a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) as a model. These GPCRs are clearly established as constitutive dimers, the two subunits being linked by a disulfide bridge (16Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Moreover, glutamate and its analogs do not bind to the TMD of an mGluR, but to a distinct extracellular domain called the Venus flytrap (VFT) domain (17Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prézeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This separation may help to dissect the relationship between agonist binding and activation within these GPCRs. Agonist binding stabilizes a closed conformation of the VFT domain (Fig. 1) (18Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 19Muto T. Tsuchiya D. Morikawa K. Jingami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11097-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and sufficient (21Kniazeff J. Saintot P.P. Goudet C. Liu J. Charnet A. Guillon G. Pin J.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for the activation of a class C GPCR. How the VFT domain closure is in turn transduced into TMD activation is, however, yet unknown. Two mechanisms, not necessarily exclusive, have been proposed. The first model (Fig. 2A) proposes that the closed VFT domain directly stabilizes the active conformation of the TMD of the same subunit (22Pin J.P. De Colle C. Bessis A.S. Acher F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). But agonist binding may also induce a relative reorientation of the two VFT domains (Fig. 1) (18Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), and a second model (Fig. 2B) thus proposes that this may in turn yield an activating rearrangement of the two TMDs (24Pin J.P. Kniazeff J. Liu J. Binet V. Goudet C. Rondard P. Prézeau L. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2947-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Kubo Y. Tateyama M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies are indeed consistent with a glutamate-induced reorientation of the two TMDs within an mGluR dimer (26Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O. Kubo Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, this could also simply be a “side effect” not necessarily involved in the activation process. Moreover, in contrast to mGlu1, the relative orientation of the VFT domains of mGlu3 appears not to be influenced by agonist binding (Fig. 1) (19Muto T. Tsuchiya D. Morikawa K. Jingami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), further putting into question this second proposal (Fig. 2B). Notably, only in the second model (Fig. 2B), but not the first (Fig. 2A), agonist binding to one VFT domain will not only cis-activate the TMD of the same, but also equally well trans-activate the TMD of the other subunit. Using a new system to control the subunit composition and thereby introduce different mutations specifically into either protomer, we demonstrate here that both cis- and trans-activation within an mGluR dimer occur with the same probability. We show moreover that this trans-activation is not indirect via the other VFT domain, via the other TMD, or by a domain “swap” between the two subunits (see also Fig. 5). Our data therefore demonstrate that an agonist-induced intersubunit rearrangement can indeed be responsible for the activation of a dimeric GPCR, a mechanism already well accepted for tyrosine kinase and guanylate cyclase receptors (27Livnah O.

Boudier L. Maurel D. Blahos J. Pin J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Compared with the previously described C2 constructs (31Kniazeff J.

Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the last 120 amino acid residues were replaced with the sequence KKTN in the C2KKXX constructs, right after the coiled-coil (CC) domain. Similarly, in some of the C1 constructs, we also replaced the last 39 residues with the sequence KKTN, right after the CC domain. However, we found no significant functional differences between the C1 and C1KKXX constructs (supplemental Fig. B). Both types of constructs are therefore collectively referred to as C1 throughout this work. The FLAG-V2 plasmid was a generous gift from L. Albizu. CD4 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. B. Schwappach. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cell culture and transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were performed as described (32Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Hlavackova V. Malhaire F. Maurel D.

To avoid any mGluR activation due to ambient glutamate, a plasmid encoding the high affinity glutamate transporter EAAC1 was always cotransfected, and the cells were incubated in glutamate-free medium for at least 4 h before the experiments. All experiments were carried out 1 day after transfection. Intracellular Ca2+ Release—Intracellular Ca2+ release was measured as described (36Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were preincubated for 1 h with the Ca2+-sensitive Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen). The fluorescence signals (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm) were then measured for 60 s (Flex-Station, Molecular Devices). Quis (quisqualate; Tocris Bioscience) was added after the first 20 s. The Ca2+ response is given as the Quis-stimulated fluorescence increase. Sigmoidal concentration-response curves were fitted using GraphPad Prism. FRET—FRET measurements were conducted as described (37Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Ansanay H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with Eu3+ cryptate pryidine-bipyridine-labeled anti-hemagglutin (HA; donor) and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-FLAG (acceptor) antibodies or with the donor antibody only (negative control). Following excitation at 337 nm, the emission at 665 nm was measured (RUBYstar, BMG Labtech). The FRET signal was calculated as Δ665, i.e. the difference between the emissions at 665 nm in the presence and absence of the acceptor. The fluorophore-labeled antibodies were provided by Cisbio International (Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs)—ELISAs using anti-HA antibody were performed as described previously (35Brock C. Boudier L. Maurel D. Blahos J. Pin J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same protocol was applied for ELISAs using anti-FLAG antibody, but with 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) and 0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) instead. “Heterodimerization” of an mGluR—To study the intersubunit interactions within a dimeric receptor, one first has to control its subunit composition. To this end, we previously transferred the “quality control” system of the heterodimeric γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor (35Brock C. Boudier L. Maurel D. Blahos J. Pin J.P. Mol. Biol.

Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Replacing its C-terminal tail with that of the GABAB1 subunit (C1) (supplemental Fig. A) generates chimeric mGlu5-C1, which is retained inside the cell, unless it forms a heterodimer with chimeric mGlu5-C2, carrying the C-terminal tail of the GABAB2 subunit (C2). In fact, the intracellular retention signal (the sequence RSR) of the C1 part becomes masked by the specific interaction of the adjacent CC domain with the CC domain in the C2 part. However, the mGlu5-C2 chimera, which does not carry a retention signal, could still reach the cell surface and function as a homodimer. To solve this problem, we generated an mGlu5-C2KKXX construct, in which we replaced the extreme C-terminal tail of the C2 part with an intracellular retention signal (KKXX), right after the CC domain (supplemental Fig. A). As a consequence, both mGlu5-C1 and mGlu5-C2KKXX are retained inside the cell when expressed alone (Fig. 3). However, both can reach the cell surface when they are coexpressed in the same cells, demonstrating that the CC domain interaction results in efficient mutual masking of the two retention signals within the heterodimer. Notably, this “heterodimerized” mGlu5 is functional because the Ca2+ response evoked by stimulation with the glutamate analog Quis was similar between wild-type mGlu5 and an mGlu5-C1/C2KKXX heterodimer (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the C1/C2KKXX parts did not affect the symmetry within the dimer because the Quis-stimulated Ca2+ response of such heterodimerized receptors carrying the G protein-uncoupling mutation F767S (31Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in either the C1 or C2KKXX subunit was similar (Fig. 3D). mGlu5 Is a Dimer, Not a Higher Order Oligomer—At least some GPCRs may form not only dimers, but also higher order oligomers (41Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 42Lopez-Gimenez J.F. Canals M. Pediani J.D. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). If this occurs also for mGluRs, this would substantially complicate our analysis of their intramolecular signal transduction. Our new system to control the subunit composition of cell surface-expressed mGluR dimers (Fig. 3) now permitted us to test this possibility. We first used a FRET approach using donor and acceptor fluorophore-labeled anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively, to test a possible physical interaction between two distinct mGlu5 dimers at the cell surface (37Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Ansanay H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We coexpressed mGlu5-C1/C2KKXX “heterodimers” with only the C2KKXX subunits carrying an HA or a FLAG tag at their extracellular N termini (Fig. 4A, middle). To reach the cell surface and become accessible to the antibodies, any tagged C2KKXX subunit must be in a dimer with an untagged C1 subunit (and not with another tagged C2KKXX subunit). Only a very low FRET signal was measured under these conditions (Fig. 4A, middle), similar to that obtained with the vasopressin V2 receptor as a negative control (Fig. 4A, right). A large FRET signal was detected, however, with the positive control with both subunits (C1 and C2KKXX) of the same dimer being tagged (Fig. 4A, left). These differences in FRET were not due to different cell-surface expression levels, which were controlled in parallel by ELISA. Similar results were obtained with the inverse combination of the C1 and C2KKXX subunits (supplemental Fig. D). We next tested a possible functional complementation between two nonfunctional mGlu5 dimers. An mGlu5-C1/C2KKXX dimer with both TMDs carrying the mutation F767S, which abolishes G protein activation (31Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), was coexpressed with mGlu5-YADA, which is not activated by glutamate or its analogs due to a mutation in the VFT domain (31Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To reach the cell surface, the C1 and C2KKXX subunits both carrying the F767S mutation must necessarily be part of the same dimer. No functional complementation was observed between this dimer and mGlu5-YADA (Fig. 4B, right), despite the fact that, in line with our previous findings (31Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), mGlu5-F767S was principally capable of trans-activating mGlu5-YADA (Fig. 4B, middle). Again, these differences cannot be accounted for by differences in the cell-surface expression levels, which were controlled in parallel by ELISA. Thus, no functional complementation can be observed between two different mGlu5 dimers. In conclusion, these data reveal that mGlu5 dimers neither physically nor functionally associate into larger higher order oligomers. “Direct” trans-Activation?—The observed trans-activation between mGlu5-F767S and mGlu5-YADA (Fig. 4B, middle) is perfectly in line with the model of an agonist-induced intersubunit rearrangement as the activating mechanism of an mGluR dimer (Fig. 2B). However, other possibilities also exist. First, this trans-activation could be due to a swap between the VFT domains and the TMDs of the two subunits (Fig. 5A). Second, this trans-activation could be indirect via the other VFT domain, i.e. the mutated VFT domain might nonetheless, through interaction with the agonist-bound VFT domain, become stabilized in an “active” (closed) conformation, in turn activating its TMD (Fig. 5B). Third, the observed trans-activation might also be indirect via the other TMD (Fig. 5C). The aim of the subsequent experiments was to test these possibilities. trans-Activation Is Not by Swap between the VFT Domains and TMDs within an mGluR Dimer—For several glycoprotein hormone GPCRs, it has been demonstrated that a receptor with an inactivated exodomain (extracellular hormone-binding domain) can be trans-activated by a hormone-bound exodomain devoid of the receptor's endodomain (TMD + cytosolic tail) (43Jeoung M. Lee C. Ji I. Ji T.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260 (262): 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggests that the hormone-bound “isolated” exodomain may swap with the inactivated one to activate that subunit's endodomain. Could such a swap also occur between the VFT domains and TMDs within an mGluR dimer (Fig. 5A)? To answer this question, we tested whether VFT domain-mutated mGlu5-YADA could also be trans-activated by mGlu5-(1–614), devoid of its TMD (34Liu J. Maurel D. Etzol S. Brabet I. Ansanay H. Pin J.P. Rondard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15824-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this construct, only TM1 was left as a “membrane anchor”, with TM2–TM7 and the cytosolic tail missing. In contrast to TMD-mutated mGlu5-F767S, this TMD-deficient mGlu5-(1–614) did not trans-activate mGlu5-YADA (Fig. 6). This was not due to a lack of heterodimerization, as controlled by FRET (Fig. 6, lower). Thus, in contrast to what has been proposed for the exo- and endodomains of a glycoprotein hormone receptor (43Jeoung M. Lee C. Ji I. Ji T.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260 (262): 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), there is no swap between the two VFT domains and TMDs (Fig. 5A), and such a mechanism can therefore not account for the observed trans-activation within an mGluR dimer. Uncoupling a VFT Domain from Its TMD—To further clarify how agonist binding to a VFT domain leads to activation of a TMD of an mGlu5 dimer, our idea was to introduce another mutation, C240E, which functionally uncouples the VFT domain from the TMD (33Rondard P. Liu J. Huang S. Malhaire F. Vol C. Pinault A. Labesse G. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24653-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), into only one of the two subunits. The combination with other mutations should then allow us to study the functional interactions between the different domains within such a dimer. We first verified that an mGlu5-C1/C2KKXX dimer carrying the C240E mutation in only one subunit is still functional (Fig. 7). Indeed, such a receptor was still activated by Quis, although with a reduced maximal response as compared with the receptor not carrying this mutation at similar cell-surface expression levels. Because, at the expression levels used in this study, the maximal Ca2+ response was directly proportional to the amount of mGlu5 at the cell surface (supplemental Fig. C), this reduced maximal response (at similar cell-surface expression levels) of mGlu5 with one “uncoupled” VFT domain therefore indicates a reduced maximal activity. Two different explanations can be proposed. The observed resting activity may simply reflect the activity of the subunit not carrying the C240E mutation, resulting from intrasubunit transduction (Fig. 2A). Alternatively, the decreased maximal response could also reflect that the disulfide bond involving Cys240 (33Rondard P. Liu J. Huang S. Malhaire F. Vol C. Pinault A. Labesse G. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24653-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is important for transmitting the relative movement of the two VFT domains to the TMDs (Fig. 2B), which may be less efficient when one disulfide bond is missing. Most important, however, the fact that this disulfide bond is not mandatory in both subunits opens the possibility to experimentally refine the route of intramolecular signal transduction within an mGluR dimer. trans-Activation Is Not via the Other VFT Domain—Accordingly, we next tested a possible trans-activation between mGlu5-F767S and mGlu5-C240E. Indeed, Quis stimulation of an mGlu5 dimer composed of these two subunits still elicited a Ca2+ response (Fig. 8). This demonstrates a trans-activation of one TMD (of the C240E mutant) by the VFT domain of the other subunit (the F767S mutant) in a way not involving indirect activation via the other VFT domain (of the C240E mutant) (Fig. 5B). That the maximal response obtained with this combination is lower than that obtained with the heterodimer carrying only the C240E mutation in one subunit is also consistent with the notion that one VFT domain can either cis-activate the TMD of the same subunit or trans-activate that of the other subunit because the cis-activation of the F767S mutant TMD does not yield any G protein activation. trans-Activation Is Not via the Other TMD—The results presented so far do not exclude the theoretical possibility of an indirect activation via the other TMD (Fig. 5C). The VFT domain of the F767S subunit could first activate the TMD of the same subunit (although incapable of G protein activation), in turn trans-activating the TMD of the other subunit. This pathway, anyway, would also imply an intersubunit rearrangement, viz. changes at the interface of the two TMDs. However, this scenario would be in contrast to recent reports indicating that only one TMD within a GPCR dimer can reach the active state at a time (12White J.F. Grodnitzky J. Louis J.M. Trinh L.B.

Mesnier D. Pin J.P. Baneres J.L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5693-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We nevertheless verified whether this is also true for mGlu5, in particular with one subunit carrying the C240E mutation, as used in our trans-activation experiment in Fig. 8. To this end, we used an mGlu5 subunit with a TMD that, because of a triple mutation (P654S/S657C/L743V, termed 3Ro), can be specifically blocked in its active conformation by the drug Ro 01-6128 (45Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but without triggering any G protein activation, due to an additional F767S mutation. Indeed, pretreatment with this drug completely abolished the Quis-stimulated Ca2+ response mediated by an mGlu5 carrying these mutations (3Ro + F767S) in one of the two subunits (Fig. 9). This demonstrates that, indeed, once the 3Ro-mutated TMD is in the active state (but without triggering G protein activation due to the F767S mutation), the second TMD cannot reach the active state any more. Thus, also in an mGlu5 dimer, only one TMD can reach the active state at a time. Of note, the effect was independent of the absence or presence of the C240E mutation in the other subunit. Thus, the observed trans-activation of one TMD by the VFT domain of the other subunit within an mGluR dimer (Fig. 8) cannot be indirect via activation of the second TMD (Fig. 5C).

Susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to EAE is in part determined by major histocompatibility complex haplotype; however, other molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Galectins bind GlcNAc-branched N-glycans attached to surface glycoproteins, forming a molecular lattice that restricts lateral movement and endocytosis of glycoproteins. GlcNAc branching negatively regulates T cell activity and autoimmunity, and when absent in neurons, induces apoptosis in vivo in young adult mice. We find that EAE susceptible mouse strains PL/J, SJL, and NOD have reduced GlcNAc branching. PL/J mice display the lowest levels, partial deficiencies in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, II, and V (i.e. Mgat1, -2, and -5), T cell hyperactivity and spontaneous late onset inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration; phenotypes markedly enhanced by Mgat5+/- and Mgat5-/- backgrounds in a gene dose-dependent manner. Spontaneous disease is transferable and characterized by progressive paralysis, tremor, dystonia, neuronophagia, and axonal damage in both demyelinated lesions and normal white matter, phenocopying progressive MS.

This is commonly followed by a secondary progressive neurodegenerative phase distinguished by axonal damage and neuronal loss (1Steinman L. Nat.

Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Mgat5 is near the end of a linear pathway of Golgi processing enzymes required for GlcNAc-branching in N-glycans, structures on glycoproteins that serve as ligands for the galectin family of N-acetyllactosamine binding lectins. Multivalent binding between N-glycans attached to surface glycoproteins and galectins forms a molecular lattice that restricts lateral movement of glycoproteins and their loss to endocytosis (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 16Partridge E.A. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Pawling J. Cheung P. Granovsky M. Nabi I.R. Wrana J.L. Dennis J.W. Science. 2004; 306: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Galectin binding to N-glycans increases proportionally for mono-, bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary Glc-NAc-branched N-glycans, the products of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, II, IV, and V (i.e. Mgat1, -2, -4, and -5), respectively. The number of N-glycans, an encoded feature of protein sequence, varies widely between glycoproteins and is a critical determinant of galectin binding. This allows for differential regulation of surface glycoproteins by the galectin lattice (17Lau K.S. Partridge E.A. Grigorian A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W.

Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar).In resting T cells, the Mgat5 mutation reduces T cell receptor (TCR) binding to galectin-3, thereby enhancing agonist-induced TCR clustering and signaling. This lowers activation thresholds and promotes subsequent TH1 differentiation (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After several rounds of cell division, T cells undergo growth arrest following translocation of CTLA-4 to the cell surface (20Alegre M.L. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). CTLA-4 recycles rapidly from the surface to endosomes and retention of CTLA-4 at the cell surface is promoted by GlcNAc-branched N-glycan-mediated inhibition of endocytosis (17Lau K.S. Partridge E.A.

In this manner, N-glycan GlcNAc-branching negatively regulates T cell growth early by increasing TCR activation thresholds and late by promoting growth arrest via CTLA-4.The Golgi enzymes Mgat1, -2, -4, and -5 sequentially display decreasing protein levels and affinities for their shared sugar-nucleotide donor UDP-GlcNAc (22Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As such, tri- and tetra-antennary GlcNAc-branched N-glycans produced by Mgat4 and -5 are subsaturating on mature glycoproteins and sensitive to changes in both enzyme expression and UDP-GlcNAc availability (17Lau K.S.

Metabolic supplementation to UDP-Glc-NAc biosynthesis in T cells (e.g. GlcNAc, uridine, and glucose) enhances GlcNAc-branching, increases thresholds for T cell activation and TH1 differentiation of naïve T cells, and promotes CTLA-4 surface retention in activated T cells. Moreover, GlcNAc supplementation of T cells inhibits adoptive transfer EAE in PL/J mice and as an oral supplement, reduces spontaneous diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (21Grigorian A.

These data demonstrate that metabolism, via UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis, conditionally regulates T cell-mediated autoimmunity by altering GlcNAc branching in N-glycans.Here we report that among inbred mouse strains, N-glycan GlcNAc-branching in T cells is highly variable and inversely correlates with EAE susceptibility. PL/J mice display the lowest levels, partial deficiency of Mgat1, -2, and -5 enzyme activity, TCR hypersensitivity, and mild spontaneous inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration after 1 year of age. Spontaneous disease was markedly enhanced by Mgat5+/- and Mgat5-/- backgrounds in a gene dose-dependent manner, demonstrating interactions between inherited and experimentally induced defects in N-glycan processing. PL/J mice with spontaneous disease displayed features of chronic MS, including progressive paralysis, tremor, focal dystonic posturing, paroxysmal dystonia, neuronophagia, and axonal damage in demyelinated lesions and normal white matter (1Steinman L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 25Tranchant C. Bhatia K.P. Marsden C.D. Mov. Disord. 1995; 10: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that naturally arising hypomorphisms in multiple N-glycan GlcNAc-branching enzymes regulate EAE susceptibility among inbred strains of mice Moreover, Mgat5-/- PL/J mice provide a unique spontaneous model of MS that arises from physiologically relevant gene dysfunction and displays the two critical phenotypes observed in MS, namely inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFACS Analysis and in Vitro Proliferation Assays—The PL/J and C57BL/6 mice were congenic at backcross 6 from 129/Sv and showed no difference in L-PHA staining compared with PL/J and C57BL/6 mice obtained from Jackson Laboratories. 129/Sv mice were from our original Mgat5 gene targeted population. All other mice (SJL, NOD, Balb/c, and B10.S) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and acclimatized prior to use. Mice used for FACS staining and proliferation assays were sex and age matched and housed in the same cage. All procedures and protocols with mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Irvine. Mouse cells were stained with anti-CD4 (RM4-5), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CD45R (RA3-6B2), anti-CD25 (PC61), anti-CD69 (H1.2F3), anti-CD62L (MEL-14), anti-TIM-3 (8B.2C12), anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16s), anti-CD11b (M1/70), and anti-F4/80 (BM8) from eBioscience and Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinating lectin (L-PHA, 4 μg/ml) from Vector Laboratories. Purified CD3+ T cells (R&D Systems) were labeled with 5 μm 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline for 8 min at room temperature and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3ϵ (2C11, eBioscience) in the presence or absence of swainsonine (SW) (Sigma).TCR Signaling—TCR signaling was preformed as previously described (21Grigorian A. Lee S.U. Tian W. Chen I.J. Gao G. Mendelsohn R. Dennis J.W. Demetriou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20027-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: hamster anti-CD3ϵ (2C11, eBioscience), rabbit anti-phospho-Src family Tyr416 (Cell Signaling Technology), which cross-reacts with phospho-lck Tyr394, rabbit anti-phospho-LAT (Upstate), and anti-actin (Santa Cruz).Enzymatic Assays—Enzyme activity was measured using synthetic specific acceptors. The acceptors for Mgat5 (GnTV), Mgat2 (GnTII), and Mgat1 (GnTI) were βGlcNAc(1,2)αMan(1,6) βGlc-O(CH2)7CH3, βGlcNAc(1,2)αMan(1,3)[αMan(1,6)]βMan-O(CH2)7CH3, and αMan(1,3)βMan-O(CH2)7CH3, respectively (Toronto Research Chemicals). 10 μl of cell lysate (0.9% NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 on ice, centrifuged 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) was added to 1 mm acceptor, 1 mm [6-3H]UDP-GlcNAc (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm GlcNAc, and 25 mm AMP for a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Mgat2 and Mgat1 reactions also contained 5 mm MnCl2 and were incubated for 1 h; Mgat5 for 3 h at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold water. Enzyme products were separated from radioactive substrates by binding to 50-mg C18 cartridges (Alltech) preconditioned with methanol rinsing and water washing. Reactions were loaded and the columns washed 5 times with 1 ml of water. Radiolabeled products were eluted directly into scintillation vials with two separately applied 0.5-ml aliquots of methanol and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Quantitative Real-time PCR—RNA from purified CD3+ T lymphocytes of 129/sv, PL/J, and C57BL/6 mice was purified using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen) and used to synthesize cDNA with the RETROscript® Kit (Ambion). For expression of mouse Mgat1,-2, and -5 and β-actin, a 7900HT platform (3840-well plate, Applied Biosystems) was used with SYBR® Green PCR master mixture and the following primers: Mgat5, 5′-GGAAATGGCCTTGAAAACACA-3′ and 5′-CAAGCACACCTGGGATCCA-3′; β-actin, 5′-CCAGCAGATGTGGATCAGCA-3′ and 5′-TTGCGGTGCACGATGG-3′; Mgat1, 5′-CGTTGTTGGGAGATGGAAAG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGCAACAAACAAGGACA-3′; and Mgat2, 5′-AGTAGCAATGGGCGACAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTTGCGAAGCGAGTCTAT-3′. Automatically detected threshold cycle (Ct) values were normalized relative to β-actin and -fold differences in expression were calculated based on a cDNA standard dilution curve.MALDI-TOF Mass Spectroscopy—This was done as a service at the Glycotechnology Core Facility, a resource of the Glycobiology Research and Training Center at the University of California, San Diego. CD3+ T cells were lysed with 1% SDS in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, dialyzed to remove SDS, digested with trypsin to generate glycopeptides, and treated with PNGase F to release the N-glycans. To focus on early processing, N-glycans were desialylated by mild acid digestion prior to permethylation and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. Monoisotopic peaks in the spectra were identified using GlycanMass and GlycoMod online software, with specific targeting of the N-glycan intermediates occurring during Golgi processing.Spontaneous Demyelinating Disease and Adoptive Transfer of Disease—PL/J mice at two facilities were assessed for clinical demyelinating disease and dystonia (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). The first cohort was at backcross 4 from 129/Sv (Table 1) and was housed at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute vivarium, a colony infected with mouse hepatitis virus, EDIM, minute virus, mouse parvovirus, GDVII, pinworm, and fur mites. These mice were initially assessed by blindly examining all Mgat5-/- (n = 43), Mgat5+/- (n = 22), and Mgat5+/+ (n = 15) PL/J mice in the colony over 6 months of age. Only mice over 1 year of age were found to have weakness and this smaller cohort (n = 21, 13, and 10, respectively) was scored for clinical severity every 1-2 weeks over the next ∼4 months. Weakness was slowly progressive without recovery in all affected mice, an observation confirmed by daily assessment of a smaller cohort (n = 12) of clinically affected mice over a 4-week period. At sacrifice, mice were perfused with paraformaldehyde via cardiac perfusion and harvested brain and spinal cord were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin or Luxol Fast Blue. The second cohort (supplemental Table 1) at backcross 6 were re-derived from the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute mice by embryo transfer and housed at the University of California, Irvine, vivarium that is pathogen-free except for some rooms with mouse parvovirus. Disease was observed in both pathogen-free and mouse parvovirus-containing rooms. For adoptive transfer of demyelinating disease, 1 × 107 splenocytes harvested from spontaneously diseased Mgat5+/- and Mgat5-/- donor mice were transferred by intraperitoneal injections into naïve wild-type PL/J recipient mice following 48 h of in vitro activation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28.TABLE 1Clinical observations of spontaneous disease in PL/J miceGenotypenAgeWeaknessDystoniaDeathep = 0.0194, chi square comparing all 3 genotypes.Incidenceap = 0.0234 (0 m), p = 0.0263 (4 m) chi square test for trend comparing all 3 genotypes.Scorebp = 0.0007, two-way ANOVA comparing all 3 genotypes at both time points.Incidencecp = 0.04 chi square (time 0), p = 0.0263 (4 m) chi square test for trend comparing all 3 genotypes.Scoredp = 0.0076, two-way ANOVA comparing all 3 genotypes at both time points.months%%%Mgat5+/+1014 ± 0.4200.4 ± 0.270017.5 ± 0.6400.8 ± 0.33100.10Mgat5+/−1315.6 ± 0.738.50.8 ± 0.2823.10.69 ± 0.3718.2 ± 0.869.21.6 ± 0.3838.50.92 ± 0.377.7Mgat5−/−2115.4 ± 0.561.91.3 ± 0.2542.90.86 ± 0.2618.2 ± 0.481.02.9 ± 0.4452.41.10 ± 0.2838.1a p = 0.0234 (0 m), p = 0.0263 (4 m) chi square test for trend comparing all 3 genotypes.b p = 0.0007, two-way ANOVA comparing all 3 genotypes at both time points.c p = 0.04 chi square (time 0), p = 0.0263 (4 m) chi square test for trend comparing all 3 genotypes.d p = 0.0076, two-way ANOVA comparing all 3 genotypes at both time points.e p = 0.0194, chi square comparing all 3 genotypes. Open table in a new tab Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies—Mice were anesthetized with Avertin. Temperature was maintained at 35-37 °C using infrared heat lamps. Monopolar needle electrodes (Ambu Inc., Glen Burnie, MD) were used for stimulation and recording motor nerve potentials. The active and indifferent recording electrodes were placed in medial gastrocnemius and ipsilateral footpad, respectively. The active and reference stimulating electrodes were placed percutaneously in the popliteal or sciatic notch and ipsilateral thoraco-lumbar paraspinal muscle, respectively. A pre-gelled strip electrode at the tail acted as a ground. Responses from supramaximal electrical stimulation (pulse width 0.05 ms) were analyzed with additional stimulations done to record late responses (F waves and H reflexes). H reflexes were identified when successive late responses had identical morphology and onset latency; F waves were identified when successive late responses had variable onset latency and morphology. For needle EMG recording, the recording monopolar needle electrode was inserted into one or more hindlimb muscles: quadriceps, hamstrings, lumbar paraspinals, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior. The presence of spontaneous muscle activity (i.e. fasiculations, fibrillations, or myokymia) was assessed in at least three regions of the muscle. All recordings were made on a Sierra LT portable machine (Cadwell Laboratories, Kennewick, WA) and analyzed using the proprietary software supplied by the manufacturer.RESULTSEAE Susceptible Mouse Strains Are Hypomorphic for N-Gly-can GlcNAc Branching—Reducing GlcNAc-branching by ∼20-25%, either by loss of a single Mgat5 allele or by partial inhibition of Golgi processing with the mannosidase II inhibitor SW, is sufficient to enhance TCR signaling and T cell proliferation (Ref. 21Grigorian A. Lee S.U. Tian W. Chen I.J. Gao G. Mendelsohn R. Dennis J.W. Demetriou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20027-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, we explored whether susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to EAE correlates with levels of GlcNAc-branching. For this purpose we stained the cell surface with L-PHA (P. vulgaris leukoagglutinin), a plant lectin that specifically binds β1,6Glc-NAc-branched N-glycans produced by Mgat5 and serves as a marker of GlcNAc-branching (15Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 21Grigorian A. Lee S.U. Tian W. Chen I.J. Gao G. Mendelsohn R. Dennis J.W. Demetriou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20027-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the EAE susceptible strains PL/J, SJL, and NOD, which also develops spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, expressed ∼30-40% less β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans than the three EAE-resistant strains 129/Sv, Balb/c, and B10.S (Fig. 1, A-C). Remarkably, CD4+ T cells from wild-type PL/J mice express ∼25% less β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans than Mgat5 heterozygous 129/Sv cells (Fig. 1A). This indicates that the PL/J strain harbors genetic hypomorphisms that reduce GlcNAc-branching to a significantly greater degree than loss of an Mgat5 allele. The C57BL/6 strain is less sensitive than the SJL strain to EAE, as evidenced by differential requirement for CD28 co-stimulation to induce disease (26Jabs C. Greve B. Chang T.T. Sobel R.A. Sharpe A.H. Kuchroo V.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2687-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 T cells display intermediate levels of β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans relative to T cells from the EAE-sensitive and -resistant strains (Fig. 1, B and C). Co-staining CD4+ T cells with L-PHA and the naïve T cell marker CD62L, the effector/regulatory T cell marker CD25, and/or the regulatory T cell marker Foxp3 demonstrated the same relative differences in β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans, with PL/J <C57BL/6 < 129/Sv (Fig. 1D). However, in B220+ B cells and F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages, β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycan levels were similar among the tested strains (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, susceptibility to EAE correlated inversely with β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycan expression in T cells in rank order PL/J > SJL, NOD > C57BL6 > Balb/c, 129/Sv, B10.S.Next we explored potential mechanisms for reduced β1,6GlcNAc-branching in PL/J T cells. The final step in the linear pathway to β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycan biosynthesis is mediated by Mgat5. Mgat5 enzyme activity but not mRNA levels are reduced ∼50% in splenocytes and T cells from PL/J and C57BL/6 mice relative to 129/Sv mice (Fig. 2, A and B). However, PL/J T cells display a greater reduction in β1,6Glc-NAc-branched N-glycans than C57BL/6 T cells, suggesting additional N-glycan processing defects proximal to Mgat5 are present in PL/J cells. Indeed, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy indicates that relative to 129/Sv and C57BL/6 T cells, PL/J T cells have reduced bi- and triantennary GlcNAc-branched N-glycans (E ions) and accumulate pathway intermediates upstream of Mgat2 (C and D ions) (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, Mgat2 and Mgat1 enzymatic activities, but not mRNA transcript levels, differ significantly among the three strains, with PL/J < C57BL/6 < 129/Sv and PL/J, C57BL/6 < 129/Sv, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). These data indicate that partial deficiencies at the post-transcriptional level in Mgat1, -2, and -5 combine to reduce GlcNAc-branching in PL/J > C57BL/6 > 129/Sv T cells and confirm that PL/J mice are naturally hypomorphic for GlcNAc-branched N-glycans. However, defects in other N-glycan processing enzymes may also contribute to the phenotype.FIGURE 2PL/J mice are deficient in multiple GlcNAc-branching enzymes. A and B, CD3+ T cells (A and B) or splenocytes (A) were lysed and used to assess enzyme activity (A) or isolate mRNA for cDNA synthesis and analysis by quantitative real time PCR (B). Results in A are an average of two independent experiments using cells pooled from 6 mice per experiment done in triplicate.

Defining the roles of the various p38 family members, specifically p38α and p38β, in these processes has been difficult. Here we use a chemical genetics approach using knock-in mice in which either p38α or p38β kinase has been rendered resistant to the effects of specific inhibitors along with p38β knock-out mice to dissect the biological function of these specific kinase isoforms. Mice harboring a T106M mutation in p38α are resistant to pharmacological inhibition of LPS-induced TNF production and collagen antibody-induced arthritis, indicating that p38β activity is not required for acute or chronic inflammatory responses. LPS-induced TNF production, however, is still completely sensitive to p38 inhibitors in mice with a T106M point mutation in p38β. Similarly, p38β knock-out mice respond normally to inflammatory stimuli. These results demonstrate conclusively that specific inhibition of the p38α isoform is necessary and sufficient for anti-inflammatory efficacy in vivo.

The ubiquitous involvement of protein kinases in cellular signal transduction pathways makes them attractive targets for pharmacologic intervention. Low molecular weight kinase inhibitors enable titratable control of signaling pathways. However, because of the high degree of structural conservation within protein kinases, the generation of truly specific inhibitors is very challenging (1Fischer P.M. Curr. Med.

In addition, tools are not readily available for comprehensive assessment of inhibitor specificity across the large family of >500 kinases in mammalian species (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R.

Genetic techniques, such as gene knock-outs and RNA interference, offer alternative ways to study the biological function of kinases. Nevertheless, interpretations of data generated using genetic techniques are not always straightforward because of the potential for compensation within highly adaptable signal transduction pathways. The phenotypes associated with genetic deletion of a kinase can be quite distinct from that associated with pharmacologic inhibition (5Jaeschke A. Karasarides M. Ventura J.J. Ehrhardt A. Zhang C.

One way to overcome these difficulties is through chemical genetics, which combines specific genetic mutations and pharmacological techniques to manipulate the selectivity of low molecular weight inhibitors. Chemical genetic approaches in which kinases are mutated to enable the binding of specific inhibitors have been described (5Jaeschke A. Karasarides M. Ventura J.J. Ehrhardt A. Zhang C. Flavell R.A.

In this report, we describe an alternative approach in which genetic knock-in mice are used to render p38α or p38β kinase resistant to the effects of specific inhibitors. Comparisons of the effects of in vivo administration of p38 inhibitors to wild-type versus drug-resistant knock-in mice provide powerful tools to dissect the biological function of these specific kinase isoforms. The p38 subfamily of MAP 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CAIA, collagen antibody-induced arthritis; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; neo, neomycin resistance; TK, thymidine kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase. kinases consists of 4 members, p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ, which share high sequence homology and a signature TGY phosphorylation motif in the kinase activation loop (8Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). p38α MAP kinase was originally identified as an enzyme that was phosphorylated and activated in LPS-stimulated monocytes and was subsequently shown to be an important mediator of TNFα and IL-1 signaling (9Lee J.C.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). The function of the various p38 family members has been investigated using a variety of techniques, including overexpression of wild-type and mutant kinases (11Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F.

Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The majority of p38 inhibitors that have been described are active against both p38α and p38β with minimal activity against p38γ and p38δ (18Hynes Jr., J. Leftheri K. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 967-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These dual p38α/β inhibitors have potent anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, and several compounds have advanced into the early stages of clinical development (16Kumar S. Boehm J. Lee J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The dual specificity of p38 kinase inhibitors for both p38α and p38β does not allow the use of these compounds as definitive tools to study the specific functions of the individual p38 isoforms. The deletion of the p38α gene in mice was reported by four separate groups and, in all cases, was associated with embryonic lethality (19Adams R.H. Porras A. Alonso G. Jones M. Vintersten K.

While tetraploid rescue of the placental defect in p38α knockouts enabled survival of the embryos (19Adams R.H. Porras A. Alonso G. Jones M. Vintersten K. Panelli S. Valladares A. Perez L. Klein R. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), there is little information available on the phenotype of adult p38α knock-out mice. The deletion of the p38β gene in mice was not associated with any known phenotype (23Beardmore V.A. Hinton H.J. Eftychi C. Apostolaki M. Armaka M. Darragh J. McIlrath J. Carr J.M. Armit L.J. Clacher C. Malone L. Kollias G. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10454-10464Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from p38β knock-out mice displayed normal signaling in response to stress stimuli. p38β knock-out mice had normal in vivo responses to LPS and still showed pathological responses to the overexpression of TNFα. However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the results obtained with p38β knockout mice because of the potential for compensation between different p38 isoforms. This type of compensation was previously described in p38γ knock-out mice in which phosphorylation of SAP97 was insensitive to a dual p38α/β inhibitor, SB203850, in wild-type cells but became sensitive to this compound in p38γ knock-out cells (24Sabio G. Arthur J.S. Kuma Y. Peggie M. Carr J. Murray-Tait V. Centeno F. Goedert M. Morrice N.A. Cuenda A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1134-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To generate better animal models to study the function of these p38 isoforms, we generated knock-in mice with point mutations in Thr106 of p38α or p38β. These mutations do not affect the kinetic properties of the kinases but render them resistant to certain classes of p38 inhibitors. We used these knock-in mice to demonstrate conclusively that specific inhibition of the p38α isoform is necessary and sufficient for antiinflammatory efficacy in vivo. Antibodies—The murine monoclonal antibody against p38β and the goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody were from Invitrogen (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against p38α was from Cell Signaling Technology. Donkey anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Arthrogen monoclonal antibody mixture was from Chemicon/Millipore. Compounds—The synthesis of MRK 4g and MRK 48 has been described (29Bao J. Hunt J.A. Miao S. Rupprecht K.M. Stelmach J.E. Liu L.

Mice—The Merck Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal procedures and were performed in accordance with institutional policy and National Institutes of Health guidelines governing the humane treatment of vertebrate animals. 129/SvEv mice were obtained from Taconic Farms, Inc. (Germantown, NY). Mice were housed at up to ten mice per cage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (21 °C, 50%) with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 0700) either in microisolator cages in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility or in a conventional facility. The mice had access to a standard rodent laboratory diet (Harland Teklad Laboratory Rodent Diet 7012) and reverse-osmosis water ad libitum. Sentinel animals were evaluated quarterly as part of a health surveillance program and were determined to be specific pathogen-free by Charles River Laboratory Assessment Plus profile (Wilmington, MA), endo- and ectoparasite examinations, and gross necropsy. In the LPS-induced TNF production experiments, male mice 12–15 weeks of age were used. In the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) experiments, female mice 11–15 weeks of age were used. All mice used for the in vivo experiments were on a 129S6 background. Cloning and Expression of p38 Proteins—Proteins were expressed, purified, and activated as described previously (47LoGrasso P.V. Frantz B. Rolando A.M. O'Keefe S.J. Hermes J.D. O'Neill E.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays and Km Determinations—Kinase assays were performed as previously described using 2 μm GST-ATF2 as the protein substrate (47LoGrasso P.V. Frantz B. Rolando A.M. O'Keefe S.J. Hermes J.D. O'Neill E.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ATP Km was determined by measuring the rate at various ATP concentrations. The resulting data were fit using Grafit software version 4.3 (Erithacus Software). Construction Targeting Vectors and Transfection of ES Cells—Portions of a murine p38β cDNA were used as hybridization probes to screen a mouse genomic library, and several phage clones were isolated that contained fragments of the p38β genomic sequence. One phage clone contained the entire p38β genomic sequence on a single 12.2-kb EcoRI fragment. The p38β allele was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate a MAPK11 (p38β)-null allele, a targeting vector consisting of a 5.4-kb 5′ arm of homology preceded by a thymidine kinase cassette, a neomycin resistance cassette and a 3-kb 3′ arm of homology was constructed as follows: The 5′ arm of the targeting vector was created by inserting a 5.4 BamHI fragment of the MAPK11 cosmid clone into the BglII site of pKO Scrambler NKTV-1901 to generate pKOp38βRIKpn. The 3′ arm was constructed from a KpnI-EcoRI cosmid fragment containing exons 10–12 inserted into the KpnI-EcoRI sites of pKO Scrambler NTKV-1902. A KpnI fragment of the MAPK11 cosmid containing part of exon 7 and all of exons 8 and 9 was ligated into the KpnI site of pKOp38βRIKpn, and clones in the correct orientation were selected. NotI-XhoI fragments were ligated together to generate the completed targeting vector. To generate a Mapk11 allele containing a T106M mutation in exon 4, a targeting vector consisting of a 4.2 kb 5′ arm of homology preceded by a thymidine kinase cassette, a neomycin resistance cassette and a 5kb 3′ arm of homology was constructed as follows: A 333-bp Sse83871 fragment of the murine Mapk11 gene containing exon 4 and the T106M mutation (ACG → ATG) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequence analysis. The 333-bp Sse83871 fragment containing the T-M mutation replaced the corresponding wild-type sequence in a 9.2-kb p38β genomic EcoRI fragment obtained from a cosmid clone. XhoI linkers were added to the mutated 9.2-kb genomic fragment, and it was subcloned into the XhoI site of pKI-TK3988, a modified pKOScramber-NTKV-1901 vector in which the neo cassette and the unique NotI site of the parental vector were removed. To introduce the neo cassette into the p38β genomic segment, a NotI site was introduced into a BsmBI-BspEI fragment from the intron between exons 1 and 2 using PCR mutagenesis. Finally, a 1.8-kb neomycin cassette flanked by loxP sites obtained from pBS246neoTK was inserted at the NotI site of the BsmBI-BspEI fragment, and the resulting product was used to replace the corresponding BsmBI-BspEI fragment in the p38β genomic sequence. To introduce a T106M mutation into exon 4 of the Mapk14 gene, a targeting vector consisting of a 4.2-kb long arm of homology, a neomycin resistance cassette and a 2.3-kb short arm of homology was constructed as follows: A 6.5-kb HindIII genomic fragment containing exon 4 of the murine Mapk14 gene (21Mudgett J.S. Ding J. Guh-Siesel L. Chartrain N.A. Yang L. Gopal S. Shen M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) was isolated and subcloned into pBS-KS. To mutate the fragment, a 1.8-kb KpnI-HindIII genomic fragment was created using PCR to insert the T106M mutation (ACC → ATG) just downstream of the 5′-terminal KpnI site. The corresponding fragment in the original subclone was replaced with the mutated fragment and confirmed by sequence analysis. The resulting mutated 6.5-kb genomic fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of pBS-KS. Last, a 1.8-kb neomycin cassette flanked by loxP sites obtained from pBS246neoTK was inserted at the PsiI site of Mapk14 located 0.74-kb upstream of the mutation to generate a 4.2-kb 5′ long arm and a 2.3-kb 3′ short arm. The targeting vectors were linearized and electroporated into the CMTI-1 ES line (obtained from CMTI, Inc.) and seeded on irradiated murine fibroblast feeder cells. The clones were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 for 3 days following electroporation and 150 μg/ml for routine culture. G418-resistant ES colonies were picked and placed into individual wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate. Genomic DNA was prepared from ES cells, and the various clones were screened by Southern blot analysis using DNA probes as described in the figure legends. Positive clones were identified and cultured in vitro to obtain adequate cell numbers for blastocyst injections. Positive ES clones that had the correct karyotype were used for injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Coat color chimeras were mated to C57BL/6 females to determine if germline transmission was achieved. PCR was used to genotype mice using DNA isolated from tail snips. For genotyping p38β-null mice, the following set of PCR primers were used: 5′-CCACCCACCTCCACCCCAGAAGTTACTTAGACATT-3′, 5′-CCTTCCCAGCCTCTGAGCCCAGAAA-3′, 5′-GATCCTCCCTTAGGAGACCCCTTTGAGTGGACAA-3′, 5′-AATCCTTCCTGTGAGCCTGGGGAGG-3′. The PCR reaction produces a 1004-bp product for the wild-type allele and a 749-bp product for the null allele. A second 2.5-kb product may be generated from the wild-type gene with these primers but not under the conditions used. For genotyping p38β(T106M) knock-in mice, the following set of PCR primers were used: 5′-CCACCCACCTCCACCCCAGAAGTTACTTAGACATT-3′, 5′-GATCCTCCCTTAGGAGACCCCTTTGAGTGGACAA-3′, 5′-TCACGAGGCCCTTTCGTCTTCAAGAATTCAAGTT-3′. The PCR reaction produces a 1000-bp product for the wild-type allele and a 714- and a 1200-bp product for the T106M allele. For genotyping p38α(T106M) knock-in mice, the following set of PCR primers were used: 5′-TCCTTCCTTTAAGGGAGAGCAGGATAGTACTCAT-3′, 5′-CGAGGCTAGAGCGGCCATCAAGCTTAGGATC-3′, 5′-TCAGCTTCTGGCACTTCACGATGTTGTTCA-3′. The PCR reaction produces a 1200-bp product for the wild-type allele and a 941-bp product for the T106M allele. RPA Assay—Tissue samples were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent per 50–100 mg of tissue using a Polytron homogenizer, and RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. A 307-bp p38β(T106M) probe containing a single mismatch to the p38β(T106M) sequence and two mismatches to the wild-type sequence was generated by PCR and cloned into the KpnI/PstI sites of pGEM3Z. A 250-bp p38α (T106M) probe that was an exact match for the mutant sequence was generated in a similar fashion. Ribonuclease protection assays were carried out using the RPA III™ Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Soluble protein extracts were run on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk overnight. The blocked membranes were incubated with anti-p38α or p38β antibodies (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation followed by three washes (10 min each) with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using Western chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Peritoneal Exudate Cell Preparation and LPS-induced TNF Assay—Peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were harvested from 2 to 3 mice of each genotype matched for age and gender 3 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 ml of 8% Brewer thioglycollate medium (Sigma). Mice were euthanized and the abdomens flushed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline plus heparin. Cells were collected from the peritoneal lavage fluid by centrifugation for 10 min at 1200 rpm, and resuspended at 5.56 × 105/ml in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (BioRad). The PEC suspension (180 μl) was dispensed into wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate and 2 μl of MRK 4g dissolved in Me2SO was added to the cell suspension. The cells were stimulated with 20 μl of a1 μg/ml solution of LPS (Salmonella minnesota Re 595, Sigma) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The supernatant was harvested, and the TNFα concentration was determined by ELISA. LPS Challenge—12-week-old mice were dosed with a p38 inhibitor (p.o., 3 mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose) or vehicle 2.5 h prior to injection of 10 μg/mouse LPS (Escherichia coli Serotype 0111:B4, Sigma) and 800 mg/kg d-galactosamine (Sigma) in saline. Animals were euthanized 90 min later, and plasma TNFα was measured by ELISA. Plasma compound levels were measured by HPLC. Collagen Antibody Arthritis Induction in Mice—Female mice were weighed and placed into vehicle or drug treatment groups on day 0. Arthritis-inducing monoclonal antibody mixture (Chemicon International, ECM 1400) was injected intravenously into the caudal portion of each tail following the manufacturer's protocol for arthritis induction in C57BL/6 mice. Briefly, 0.8 ml of the monoclonal antibody mixture was injected on day 0. On day 3 postinoculation, mice were each given an intraperitoneal injection with LPS. Vehicle or compound was given once daily by oral gavage beginning 24 h post-LPS injections. Limbs were scored daily using the following system: 0, normal; 1, one or two swollen digits; 2, swelling of more than two digits as well as swelling of the entire carpus/tarsus; 3, deformity; 4, rigidity and immobility of the joints. The lowest possible score was 0 for an asymptomatic mouse, and the highest possible score was 16, which would indicate all four limbs were rigid. Mutation of Thr106 to Methionine Does Not Affect the ATP Km but Does Decrease Inhibitor Potency—A variety of studies have demonstrated the important role of Thr106 within the ATP binding site of p38α in determining sensitivity to pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors (25Gum R.J.

We expressed mutant p38α and p38β proteins containing T106M mutations in E. coli and determined the effect of the mutation on the ATP Km and the IC50 of two structurally distinct p38α/β inhibitors, MRK 4g and MRK 48 (Fig. 1 and Refs. 29Bao J.

As shown in Table 1, the mutations, even though within the ATP binding site, had no significant effect on the binding of ATP compared with the wild-type proteins. Nevertheless, the mutation of Thr106 to Met dramatically decreased the potency of the two tested inhibitors 200–1000-fold. Both of these compounds are highly selective for p38α and β with at least 500-fold decrease in potency against other kinases that have been tested (29Bao J. Hunt J.A. Miao S. Rupprecht K.M.

Expression of such mutant proteins in animals would essentially make these dual inhibitors specific for the remaining wild-type kinase and allow us to probe the role of each kinase in vivo pharmacologically. The use of such a pharmacological approach in the presence of a complete complement of normally active kinases would eliminate any possible developmental or other type of compensation.TABLE 1Comparison of kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant enzymesWild-type(α)αT106MWild-type(β)βT106MVmax (arbitrary units)19 ± 0.158 ± 0.289 ± 1465 ± 9ATP Km (μm)128 ± 2.472 ± 4.869 ± 2535 ± 13MRK 48 IC50 (nm)0.08 ± 0.03 (n = 4)28 ± 12 (n = 5)0.25 ± 0.1 (n = 5)260 ± 30 (n = 5)MRK 4g IC50 (nm)0.1 (n = 1)34 (n = 1)0.1 (n = 1) Open table in a new tab Generation of p38α(T106M)-, p38β(T106M)-, and p38β-null Mice—The p38α and β loci were targeted by homologous recombination in murine ES cells. To generate p38β-null mice, we performed a targeted deletion of exons 1–7 in one of the p38β alleles in ES cells (Fig. 2A). Positive clones (Fig. 2B) were used to generate chimeric mice that successfully transmitted the null allele to their offspring. The genotypes of the mice were determined by PCR (Fig. 2C).

The possession of an impedance-matching tympanic middle ear is characteristic of all terrestrial vertebrates with a sophisticated hearing sense and an adaptively important feature of many modern terrestrial vertebrates. Whereas tympanic ears seem to have evolved multiple times within tetrapods, especially among crown-group members such as frogs, mammals, squamates, turtles, crocodiles, and birds, the presence of true tympanic ears has never been recorded in a Paleozoic amniote, suggesting they evolved fairly recently in amniote history. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we performed a morphological examination and a phylogenetic analysis of poorly known parareptiles from the Middle Permian of the Mezen River Basin in Russia. We recovered a well-supported clade that is characterized by a unique cheek morphology indicative of a tympanum stretching across large parts of the temporal region to an extent not seen in other amniotes, fossil or extant, and a braincase specialized in showing modifications clearly related to an increase in auditory function, unlike the braincase of any other Paleozoic tetrapod. In addition, we estimated the ratio of the tympanum area relative to the stapedial footplate for the basalmost taxon of the clade, which, at 23∶1, is in close correspondence to that of modern amniotes capable of efficient impedance-matching hearing. Conclusions/Significance Using modern amniotes as analogues, the possession of an impedance-matching middle ear in these parareptiles suggests unique ecological adaptations potentially related to living in dim-light environments. More importantly, our results demonstrate that already at an early stage of amniote diversification, and prior to the Permo-Triassic extinction event, the complexity of terrestrial vertebrate ecosystems had reached a level that proved advanced sensory perception to be of notable adaptive significance."
https://openalex.org/W2084479444,"Fibronectin (FN) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein that plays an important role in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. FN expression or its role in colitis is not known. The goal of this study is to characterize FN expression, regulation, and role during intestinal inflammation. Wild-type and transgenic mice expressing luciferase under the control of the human FN promoter, given water or 3% dextran sodium sulfate, were used as animal models of colitis. The Caco2-BBE model intestinal epithelial cell line was used for in vitro studies. FN protein is abundantly expressed by surface epithelial cells in the normal colon. Immunohistochemistry and luciferase assay in mice expressing the FN promoter linked to luciferase demonstrated that FN synthesis was up-regulated during colitis, during both the acute phase and the healing phase. In vitro experiments demonstrated that FN increased the expression of the FN integrin receptor α5β1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. FN also induced the expression and activation of NF-κB. Further, FN potentiated Caco2-BBE cell attachment and wound healing, which was inhibited by RGD peptide as well as NF-κB inhibitors MG-132 and 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid, ammonium salt. In conclusion, FN is abundantly expressed and synthesized by colonic epithelial cells. FN is transcriptionally up-regulated in epithelial cells during both the dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitic and the recovery phase. FN enhances cell attachment and wound healing, which is dependent on binding to the integrin receptor and the NF-κB signaling. Together our data show that epithelial-derived FN potentiates cell attachment and wound healing through epithelial-matrix interactions and that FN expression may have important implications for maintaining normal epithelial integrity as well as regulating epithelial response to injury during colitis.

Mucosal tissue damage requiring efficient wound healing is a cardinal feature of inflammatory bowel disease as well as other intestinal inflammatory conditions, including radiation enteritis, chronic ischemic enteritis, and cystic fibrosis. Inappropriate or ineffective tissue repair underlies the persistence of disease symptoms and results in complications such as fibrosis or fistula formation. Epithelial response to injury is a complex process and cell-matrix interactions play important roles in the healing response. Extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FN, fibronectin; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ECIS, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing; ADTC, 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid, ammonium salt. proteins such as fibronectin (FN), collagen, and laminin have been demonstrated to play a critical role in the wound healing process. In this study, we examined the expression and role of fibronectin in intestinal inflammation. FN is a high molecular weight adhesive glycoprotein that is found in basement membrane, lamina propria, and connective tissue matrices in the intestine (insoluble form) and in body fluids (soluble form). FN usually exists as a dimer composed of two nearly identical ∼250-kDa subunits linked covalently near their C termini by a pair of disulfide bonds (1Kaspar M. Zardi L. Neri D. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 2Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 (Pt. 20): 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Each monomer is an extended and flexible molecule that is folded in a series of repeating protein domains known as type I, II, and III repeats. These domains are resistant to proteolysis and contain binding sites for other ECM proteins (e.g. collagen), cell-surface receptors (integrins), blood protein derivatives (fibrin), and glycosaminoglycans (heparin). There are more than 20 splice variants of FN. FN exists mainly in two forms, soluble plasma FN and less soluble cellular FN. Plasma FN is synthesized predominantly in the liver by hepatocytes and forms a soluble FN dimer as compared with tissue FN, which forms disulfide cross-linked fibrils and is deposited as a matrix. FN is widely expressed by multiple cell types and is critically important in vertebrate development, as demonstrated by the early embryonic lethality of mice with targeted inactivation of the FN gene (3George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FN mediates a wide variety of cellular interactions with the ECM and plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation (4Cho J. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Yang H. Reheman A. Chen P. Zhu G. Hynes R.O. Freedman J. Wagner D.D. Ni H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, not surprisingly, altered deposition of FN matrix has been correlated with several pathological states. For example, increased deposition of an FN-rich matrix has been associated with atherosclerosis and fibrosis, while restoration of FN matrix assembly in transformed cells has been correlated with a reduction in tumorigenicity (6Wu C. Keightley S.Y. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Coppolino M. Goicoechea S. McDonald J.A. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). FN mRNA and protein levels are altered in patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, (7Verspaget H.W. Biemond I. Allaart C.F. van Weede H. Weterman I.T. Gooszen H.G. Pena A.S. Lamers C.B.

FN has also been shown to play an important role in myofibroblast and epithelial cell migration and proliferation (10Basson C.T. Knowles W.J. Bell L. Albelda S.M. Castronovo V. Liotta L.A. Madri J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) during wound healing. Surprisingly, despite the important roles of this matrix protein in cell-ECM interactions, not much is known about the cellular source, the signaling mechanism, or the role of FN in the context of intestinal inflammation. In this study, we explored the cellular source, the signaling, and the potential role of FN using a well established animal model of inflammatory bowel disease. Reagents—Reagents for SDS-PAGE and nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pores) were from Bio-Rad. FN antibody, luciferase antibody was from Sigma Aldrich (1:1000 dilutions), α5 integrin receptor antibody (1:500) was from Abcam, NF-κBp65 (1:500) was from BD Transduction Laboratories, β-tubulin antibody (1:1000) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), FN from bovine plasma was obtained from Sigma, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory (West Grove, PA). Vectastain ABC kit was from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA), and 8W1E culture plates were from Applied BioPhysics (Troy, NY). MG-132 and ADTC were from Acros Organics. DSS-induced Colitis in Mice—6–8-week-old C57/B6 mice were separated into control (water, n = 5) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -treated groups (n = 5) and recovery groups. Colitis was induced in mice by the addition of DSS (3% weight-to-volume ratio dissolved in distilled water; molecular mass 40 kDa) to their drinking water for 6 days after which the mice were sacrificed or allowed to recover. Following the induction of colitis, the recovery group was switched back to water (day 6) to assess the effects during the recovery phase. Daily body weights were recorded, and stool samples were collected to determine occult blood loss. The severity of colitis was assessed by using a standard protocol that includes clinical score (0–12) based on loss of body weight, presence of diarrhea, and occult blood loss (11Gaudio E. Taddei G. Vetuschi A. Sferra R. Frieri G. Ricciardi G. Caprilli R. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1999; 44: 1458-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Colonic inflammation and damage were assessed by histological scoring (0–11) that includes severity of immune cell infiltration, crypt damage, and ulcerations (12Dieleman L.A. Ridwan B.U.

Generation of Mice Transgenic for the Human Fibronectin Promoter Connected to a Luciferase Reporter Gene—Mice transgenic for the human fibronectin promoter connected to a luciferase reporter gene were created by the Emory University Winship Cancer Center Transgenic Mouse Core Facility. The transgenic mice were created by direct microinjection of a 1.2-kb human fibronectin promoter fragment connected to a 1.9-kb luciferase gene fragment (pFN[1.2kb]LUC) into 200 fertilized one-cell (C57BL/6 × SJL) F2 hybrid mouse eggs. All surviving eggs were reimplanted into pseudo pregnant recipient female mice to generate the pFN(1.2 kb)LUC founder transgenic mice. The offspring were backcrossed to C57B/6 mice for at least seven generations. These mice do not show phenotypic abnormalities. In these mice, immunohistochemical studies and luciferase detection revealed a pattern of luciferase expression in lung reminiscent of that shown by the endogenous fibronectin gene at baseline and after stimulation with nicotine. 3S. V. Sitaraman, unpublished results. We have previously reported that nicotine stimulates fibronectin expression in lung and in cultured primary lung fibroblasts (13Roman J. Ritzenthaler J.D. Gil-Acosta A. Rivera H.N. Roser-Page S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As expected, primary lung fibroblasts isolated from the transgenic animals showed increased expression of luciferase driven by the human fibronectin promoter when exposed to nicotine (14Tomic R. Lassiter C.C. Ritzenthaler J.D. Rivera H.N. Roman J. Chest. 2005; 127: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—Transgenic mice expressing the human FN promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene were grouped into control (n = 5), DSS-treated (n = 5), and recovery groups (n = 5). Mucosal scrapings were homogenized in a minimum volume of luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using a Promega Luciferase Reporter Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture—Caco2-BBE cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (40 mg/liter), streptomycin (90 mg/liter), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent stock monolayers were subcultured by trypsinization (15Wang L. Walia B. Evans J. Gewirtz A.T. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Merlin D. Si-Tahar M. Sitaraman S.V. Eastburn K. Williams I. Liu X. Hediger M.A. Madara J.L. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1666-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on cells plated for 7–8 days on permeable supports of 0.33-cm2, 4.5-cm2 inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cell culture plates were coated with various concentrations of FN (0.1–20 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were rinsed with PBS, and then Caco2-BBE cells were plated after blocking with bovine serum albumin blocking buffer (10 mg of bovine serum albumin/PBS). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum was used in all experiments. Cell Adhesion Assay—24-Well plates were coated with FN (0–20 μg/ml) dissolved in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS twice, and then blocked with 100 μl of bovine serum albumin blocking buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. Caco2-BBE cells were trypsinized and plated on FN-coated plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum). After 1 h, medium was removed carefully, and the plates were rinsed twice with PBS. Adherent cells were incubated with hexosaminidase substrate (100 μl/well) at 37 °C overnight. Quenching buffer was then added to each well, and cell attachment was quantified using a plate reader at 405 nm (17Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Wound Healing Assays—Wound healing assays were performed with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) (Applied BioPhysics) technology. The ideal frequency was determined as described previously (18Charrier L. Yan Y. Driss A. Laboisse C.L. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G346-G353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For resistance measurements performed on Caco2-BBE cells, the frequency used was 500 Hz and amplitude was set at 1 V. For the wound healing assays, confluent Caco2-BBE monolayers were plated with or without GLY-ARG-GLY-ASP-SER-PRO-LYS (GRGDSPK) (C28H49N11O11; Sigma Aldrich), an FN analog that binds to integrins, and cultured on ECIS 8W1E plates. Cells were then submitted to an elevated voltage pulse of 40-kHz frequency, 4.5-V amplitude, and 30-s duration, which led to death and detachment of cells present on the small active electrode, resulting in a wound in the cell monolayers. This wound is normally healed by cells surrounding the small active electrode that have not been submitted to the elevated voltage pulse. Wound healing was then assessed by continuous resistance measurements for ∼24 h. Western Blotting—Colon was flushed with PBS and everted with the help of a glass rod. Then the colonic mucosa was scraped gently into PBS on ice, homogenized in minimum volume of lysis buffer, and centrifuged. The supernatant was subjected to Western blot or luciferase assay. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. The proteins were probed with anti-FN (1:1000 dilutions), anti-integrin α5 (1:500), or anti-NF-κb p65(1:500) overnight and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) for 1 h. Band detection was performed by chemiluminescence. Caco2-BBE cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), EDTA, SDS, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium fluoride. Separation on SDS-PAGE was performed according to the Laemmli procedure. Proteins were electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with respective antibodies, NF-κBp65 (1:500), integrin α5β1 (1:500), or β-tubulin (1:500). Membranes were incubated with corresponding peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, washed, and incubated with ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions before exposure to high performance chemiluminescence films (Denville Scientific, Inc., Metuchen, NJ). For molecular mass determination, polyacrylamide gels were calibrated using standard proteins (Bio-Rad) with molecular mass markers within the range of 10 to 250 kDa. The band intensity of the Western blots was quantified by the use of a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining of FN and luciferase was carried out using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To perform the standard staining procedure, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated before the application of primary FN antibody (1:500 dilution), luciferase antibody (1:1000 dilution, incubated 4 °C overnight). Enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied, and the specific staining was visualized after the addition of the enzyme-specific substrate. These tissues were counterstained by hematoxylin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts from Caco2-BBE cells plated on FN-coated plates for various time intervals were prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (15Wang L. Walia B. Evans J. Gewirtz A.T. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The protein content of the nuclear extract was determined using the Bradford protein assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using the Lightshift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nuclear protein was assayed for DNA binding to biotin-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the NF-κB binding site (Promega). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled using the biotin 3′-end DNA-labeling kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were then incubated with nuclear proteins for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer provided with the kit. Binding was competed by 200-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotides (cold). Specificity of the binding was confirmed using NF-κB p50 antibody in supershift assay. NF-κB binding complexes were resolved by electrophoresis using 5% Tris borate-EDTA Criterion gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to Biodyne B precut modified nylon membranes (Pierce), UV-cross-linked, and visualized using the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection system (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as mean ± S.E. *, p values <0.05 by t test were considered statistically significant. FN Is Up-regulated in Murine Colitis—To investigate the effect of colonic inflammation on FN expression in intestinal epithelia in vivo, we used an established model of murine colitis induced by DSS. Mice were given 3% DSS in drinking water for a total of 6 days. Age- and sex-matched C57/B6 mice receiving plain drinking water served as controls. One group of DSS-treated mice was sacrificed at this time to evaluate the effect of active colitis on FN expression, while a second group of DSS-treated mice was switched back to plain drinking water for an additional 6 days to evaluate FN expression during the recovery phase. The mice were evaluated for clinical signs of disease (weight changes, stool consistency, and occult blood), and histological assessment of inflammation (crypt destruction, mucosal damage, epithelial erosions, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the mucosal tissue) was compared according to the grading system previously described (19Cooper H.S.

Roman J. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1991-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). All mice developed bloody diarrhea and weight loss consistent with severe colitis 6 days after DSS treatment (clinical score: control 1 (range, 0–2), DSS 11 (range, 7–12) p < 0.001). The histological examination of the colonic mucosa confirmed severe colitis in these mice (histological scores: control 1.2 (range, 0–2.2) DSS 8.4 (range, 7–10.9), p < 0.001. Recovery from DSS was reflected by resolution of bloody diarrhea and recovery of body weight at the end of recovery phase. Histological examination revealed healing of mucosal ulcerations. Western blot analysis performed on the colonic mucosa obtained from mice treated with DSS showed up-regulation of FN compared with control mice given water (Fig. 1a)(n = 5). Densitometric values demonstrated a 2.2-fold increase in FN in DSS-treated mice compared with control mice. Western blot analysis performed on colonic mucosa obtained from mice during the recovery phase (clinical and histological scores were normal) demonstrated a 6.5-fold increase in FN expression compared with controls (Fig. 1a). FN Localizes to Epithelial Cells and Extracellular Matrix—We next determined the localization of FN expression using immunohistochemical analysis in control, DSS-treated, and recovered mice. In normal colon, FN staining was readily evident in the superficial colonic epithelial cells at basal as well as apical surface (Fig. 1b). FN expression was also evident in the lamina propria surrounding the epithelial cells. As expected, FN expression was also seen in the muscularis propria. FN, however, was up-regulated during DSS-induced colitis, and FN deposition was seen throughout the crypt epithelial cells. In addition, there was increased FN staining in the lamina propria and at the ulcer base. During the recovery phase, FN staining returned to its normal distribution, i.e. superficial epithelial cells and surrounding lamina propria. However, there was clear up-regulation of the intensity of staining, suggesting an increase in its expression (Fig. 1b). FN Is Transcriptionally Activated—To determine whether FN expression is transcriptionally activated during colitis and to determine the cellular source of FN, we used transgenic mice expressing luciferase under the control of the FN promoter as described under “Materials and Methods”. We administered 3% DSS in drinking water (n = 10) or plain water (n = 10) to age- (6–8 weeks) and sex-matched C57/B6 FN-luciferase transgenic mice. The mice were evaluated for the clinical signs of disease, including weight changes, stool consistency, and occult blood, and sacrificed at the end of 6 days. A second group of mice were allowed to recover for an additional 6 days (recovery phase). Clinical and histological assessments were performed according to the established grading system described above. The expression of FN promoter-luciferase did not affect the development of colitis or recovery. These mice developed colitis similar to wild-type mice (clinical score, 10 (7Verspaget H.W. Biemond I.

Luciferase activity was 1.7-fold higher (*, p < 0.02) during the colitic phase and 4.1-fold higher (*, p < 0.001) during the recovery phase compared with water-treated controls (Fig. 2a). Consistent with the biochemical assay, immunohistochemistry with luciferase antibody demonstrated up-regulation of luciferase expression in DSS-treated mice during the colitic and the recovery phases. Importantly, luciferase expression was seen predominantly in epithelial cells (Fig. 2b) during both active colitis and during recovery. In the next series of experiments, we addressed FN-epithelial interaction and its role on cell attachment and wound healing using the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2-BBE plated on FN-coated transwells. FN Up-regulates α5-Integrin Levels—Integrins are structurally and functionally related cell surface heterodimeric receptors that link the ECM with the intracellular cytoskeleton. Many of the biological effects of FN are mediated via α5-β1 integrin, which belongs to the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell-matrix interactions, cell-cell adhesion, differentiation, and wound healing (22Akiyama S.K.

However, the effect of FN on the expression of its receptor in epithelial cells is unknown. We set out to examine the effect of FN on α5β1 integrin levels in Caco2-BBE cells. As shown in Fig. 3a, Caco2-BBE cells exposed to FN demonstrated increased α5 integrin receptor expression at a dose of 0.1 μg/ml and plateaued at 1 μg/ml. Caco2-BBE cells plated on 1 μg/ml FN demonstrated increased α5 expression with time that was maximal between 30 min and 2 h (Fig. 3b). FN Activates NF-κB Signaling Pathway—Little is known about FN signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. In view of the importance of the NF-κB signaling pathway in inflammation (25Jobin C.

Caco2-BBE cells were exposed to FN (1 μg/ml) for various time points. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-NF-κBp65 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4a, FN-induced NF-κBp65 activation was detected at 15 min, peaked at 30 min, and subsequently returned to baseline at 2 h after exposure to FN. We next examined the effect of FN on NF-κB DNA binding activity in Caco2-BBE cells exposed to FN for various time intervals. As shown in Fig. 4b, FN increased nuclear protein binding to DNA, which was maximal at 30 min after FN treatment. Binding is competed by unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotides (cold). In the presence of FN, the addition of NF-κB p50 antibody to the reaction resulted in supershift of this complex. Together, these data demonstrate that FN is a potent activator of NF-κB signaling pathway. To investigate the effect of colonic inflammation on NF-κBp65 activation and α5 integrin receptor expression in vivo, we used established model of murine colitis as described in Fig. 1. Western blot analysis performed on the colonic mucosa showed up-regulation of NF-κBp65 and α5 integrin receptor both in the colitic phase and the recovery phase compared with control mice given water.

We found that epinephrine significantly increases eNOS activity in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Epinephrine-dependent eNOS activation was accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 and with decreased eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory phosphoresidues Ser116 and Thr497. Epinephrine promoted activation of the small G protein Rac1 and also led to the activation of protein kinase A. All of these responses to epinephrine in BAEC were blocked by the β3AR blocker SR59230A. We transfected and validated duplex small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs to selectively “knock down” specific signaling proteins in BAEC. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 completely blocked all β3AR signaling to eNOS and also abrogated epinephrine-dependent cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Akt activation. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKA did not affect Rac1 activation by epinephrine but did attenuate Akt activation by epinephrine. These findings indicate that Rac1 is an upstream regulator of β3AR signaling to PKA and to eNOS and identify a novel β3AR → Rac1 → PKA → Akt pathway in endothelium. We exploited the p21-activated kinase pulldown assay to identify proteins associated with activated Rac1 and found that epinephrine stimulated the association of eNOS with Rac1; epinephrine-stimulated eNOS-Rac1 interactions were blocked by the β3AR antagonist SR59230A. Co-transfection of eNOS cDNA with constitutively active Rac1 enhanced β3AR-promoted eNOS-Rac1 association; co-transfection of eNOS with dominant negative Rac1 completely blocked the eNOS-Rac1 association. We also found that epinephrine-induced Rac1 → PKA → Akt pathway mediates β3AR-mediated endothelial cell migration. Taken together, our data establish that the small G protein Rac1 is a key regulator of β3AR signaling in cultured aortic endothelial cells with potentially important implications for the pathways involved in adrenergic modulation of eNOS pathways in the vascular wall. β-Adrenergic receptors (βAR) play an important role in vasodilation, but the mechanisms whereby adrenergic pathways regulate the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) are incompletely understood.

The sympathetic nervous system is a key determinant of vascular homeostasis and is implicated in many cardiovascular diseases that are associated with activation of neurohumoral pathways involving adrenergic receptor activation in the vasculature (1Saucerman J.J.

Distinct adrenergic receptor subtypes subserve different roles in vasoregulation, and the differential roles of adrenergic signaling pathways in the vasculature have been extensively studied over many years. The classical model for adrenergic control of vasomotor tone involves α1-adrenergic receptors in contraction of vascular smooth muscle, whereas β2-adrenergic receptors typically mediate the effects of catecholamines on relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. However, the more recent identification of β3-adrenergic receptor subtypes (5Emorine L.J. Marullo S. Briend-Sutren M.M. Patey G. Tate K. Delavier-Klutchko C. Strosberg A.D.

The activity of eNOS is also modulated by enzyme phosphorylation of multiple sites in the protein: phosphorylation at Ser1179 activates eNOS, but phosphorylation at Thr497 or Ser116 is associated with inhibition of eNOS activity (19Fulton D.

Of these phosphorylation sites, the regulation of eNOS Ser1179 has been most extensively characterized. Protein kinase Akt modifies eNOS at this residue, but other protein kinases, including the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), also have been implicated in eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation in response to shear stress (24Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The relative roles of PKA and Akt in the regulation of eNOS in response to adrenergic receptor activation have not been clearly defined. It seems plausible that adrenergic receptor regulation of eNOS will share some features in common with the pathways for regulation of eNOS by other receptors. We have shown previously (25Gonzalez E. Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3210-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that the small G protein Rac1 is an essential upstream modulator of receptor-regulated activation of kinase Akt and eNOS, but the regulation of Rac1 by adrenergic receptors has not been reported previously. Rac1 belongs to the Rho family of small GTPases and cycles between active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound states. Rac1 plays critical roles in a wide variety of endothelial cell functions, including cell migration and modulation of the cytoskeleton (25Gonzalez E. Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol.

The present studies established that the small G protein Rac1 is a key regulator of β3AR signaling to eNOS and suggest that Rac1 may play a central role in adrenergic modulation of NO-dependent pathways in the vascular wall. Materials—Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). All other cell culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen. Lipofectamine 2000 and FuGENE 6 transfection reagents were from Invitrogen and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Anti-phospho-eNOS Ser116 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-eNOS (Ser1177 and Thr495 in the human eNOS sequences, corresponding to Ser1179 and Thr497 in the bovine eNOS, respectively), phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-VASP (Ser157), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), total Akt, and total ERK were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibody directed against eNOS was from BD Pharmingen. SuperSignal substrate for chemiluminescence detection and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. Determinations of protein abundance using immunoblot analyses were quantitated using a ChemiImager (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). Protein determinations were made with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The Rac activity assay kit was from Upstate Biotechnology. All other agonists and reagents were from Sigma. Plasmids—Dominant negative Rac1 mutant (N17Rac1) and constitutively active Rac1 mutant (V12Rac1) cDNAs, epitope-tagged with HA peptide and subcloned into pcDNA3.1+, were obtained from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center. HA-tagged wild type eNOS cDNA was described previously (25Gonzalez E. Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3210-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Duplex siRNA Targeting Constructs—Small interfering RNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) or Ambion (Austin, TX). The sequence of the siRNA duplex construct targeting PKA was 5′-GGUGGUGAAGCUGAAACAG-dTdT-3′, corresponding to bases 237–258 from the open reading frame of the bovine PKA catalytic subunit mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_174584). The Rac1 siRNA duplex 5′-UGCGUUUCCUGGAGAAUAUdTdT-3′ was extensively characterized in an earlier report (25Gonzalez E. Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3210-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The duplex siRNA used as a negative control was 5′-GCCCGCUUUGUAGCAUUCG-dTdT-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were obtained from Cell Applications, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with FBS (10%, v/v) as described previously (28Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). BAEC were plated onto gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied prior to cell confluence between passages 5 and 9. siRNA transfections were performed as described previously in detail (29Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 30 nm siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (0.15%, v/v) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer 24 h after cells were split at 1:5 ratio; Lipofectamine 2000 was removed by changing into fresh medium containing 10% FBS 5 h post-transfection, and cells were analyzed 48 h following transfection. In some experiments, BAEC were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid cDNA using FuGENE 6 following the instruction provided by the supplier and were analyzed 48 h after transfection. Cell Treatments and Immunoblot Analysis—β-Adrenergic receptor antagonists were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide and kept at –20 °C; where indicated, 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v, final concentration) was used as vehicle control. Epinephrine was used at 1 μm in experiments unless otherwise indicated. After drug treatments, BAEC cell lysates were prepared using a cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.025% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Immunoblot analyses of protein expression and phosphorylation were assessed as described previously in detail (30Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of Western blots were performed using a ChemiImager HD4000 (AlphaInnotech). Rac1 Activity Assay—48 h following transfection with siRNA or plasmid constructs, BAEC in 100-mm dishes were treated with agonists or inhibitors as indicated, and cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Pulldown of the GTP-bound active form of Rac1 was performed by incubating the cell lysates with GST fusion protein corresponding to the p21-binding domain of PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C following the instructions provided by the supplier. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed for the amount of GTP-bound Rac in immunoblots probed with a Rac monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology); in some experiments, eNOS co-precipitated with the beads was detected in immunoblots probed with an eNOS monoclonal antibody. eNOS Activity Assay—eNOS activity in intact BAEC was quantified by measuring the formation of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]arginine as described previously (31Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 32Kou R. Igarashi J. Michel T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4982-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly the reaction was initiated by adding l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml, diluted with unlabeled l-arginine to give a final concentration of 10 μm) plus various drug treatments as described below. Each treatment was performed in duplicate cultures, which were analyzed in duplicate. NOS activity, measured as l-citrulline formation, was expressed as fmol of l-citrulline produced/mg of cellular protein/min). Endothelial Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed using a Transwell cell culture chamber containing polycarbonate membrane inserts with 8-μm pore size (Corning Costar Corp.). BAEC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 18 h before migration experiments. In some experiments, cells were transfected with control, Rac1-specific, or PKA-specific siRNA, and migration experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA treatment and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS. 5 × 104 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.4% FBS were added to the upper chamber. The bottom chamber was filled with 600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.4% FBS medium, and the assembly was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow cells to adhere to the membrane. Agonist was added into the lower chamber, and the chambers were incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow cell migration. In some experiments, vehicle or inhibitor as indicated was added into the lower chamber 1 h prior to adding agonist. The Transwell inserts were transferred into a new plate containing 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution to detach the cells from the membrane. Cells in the lower chamber were counted with a hemocytometer. Each treatment was measured in duplicate, and each sample was counted twice in four 4 × 4 square fields. Other Methods—All experiments were performed at least three times. Mean values for individual experiments were expressed as mean ± S.E. EC50 values were determined by analysis of Eadie-Hofstee plots based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. Statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance or paired t test as indicated. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Epinephrine Induces Rac1 Activation—We have shown previously that Rac1 is an upstream regulator of eNOS signaling in cultured endothelial cells (25Gonzalez E. Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3210-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The current experiments explored the activation of Rac1 in endothelial signal transduction pathways elicited by the adrenergic agonist epinephrine. Fig. 1A shows a time course of Rac1 activation following stimulation of BAEC with epinephrine (1 μm); Rac1 activation was quantitated in a pulldown assay of active GTP-Rac1 using the p21-binding domain of PAK-1 as described above. Fig. 1B shows a dose response of Rac1 activation analyzed 5 min after agonist addition. Immunoblots from the pulldown assay were probed with antibody against Rac to measure Rac1 activation; the cell lysates were probed with antibodies directed against other signaling proteins as shown. Densitometric analysis of pooled data from three experiments showed that epinephrine stimulation promoted activation of Rac1 by 2.4 ± 0.5-fold (n = 3, p < 0.05); the maximal effect was seen at 5 min following addition of epinephrine and persisted for at least 30 min. Analyses of dose-response experiments (Fig. 1B) established that epinephrine was a potent activator of Rac1 with an EC50 of 27 ± 7 nm (n = 5). Analysis of immunoblots probed with the phospho-VASP-Ser157-specific antibody revealed that epinephrine treatment promoted phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) at Ser157, the site on VASP that undergoes phosphorylation by PKA (33Comerford K.M. Lawrence D.W. Synnestvedt K. Levi B.P. Colgan S.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The time course (Fig. 1A) and dose response (Fig. 1B) of VASP phosphorylation paralleled that of epinephrine-inducted Rac1 activation. Equivalent loading was confirmed in immunoblots that showed no effect of epinephrine on the abundance of total eNOS or Rac1. Rac1 and βAR Mediate Epinephrine-induced eNOS Activation in BAEC—We next used siRNA methods to explore the role of Rac1 in epinephrine-induced eNOS activation. Cultured BAEC were transfected with control or Rac1 siRNA, and the effects of epinephrine on eNOS activity were analyzed 48 h following transfection by measuring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2A, epinephrine stimulation induced a 1.8 ± 0.4-fold increase of eNOS activity (from 3.8 ± 0.3 to 6.8 ± 1.1 fmol/min/mg of protein, p < 0.05, n = 3). siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 completely blocked epinephrine-induced eNOS activation (p < 0.05, n = 3). Fig. 2B shows the pooled data for dose-response experiments analyzing epinephrine-promoted eNOS activation that established that epinephrine promoted a 2.4 ± 0.3-fold (n = 3, p < 0.05) increase in eNOS activity, which is sufficient to promote coronary vasorelaxation (34Dessy C. Moniotte S. Ghisdal P. Havaux X. Noirhomme P. Balligand J.L. Circulation. 2004; 110: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with an EC50 of 25 ± 7 nm (n = 3). Fig. 2C shows that epinephrine-induced eNOS activation was blocked by the non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, whereas the α-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine had no effect on epinephrine-induced eNOS activation. Epinephrine Promotes Differential Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of eNOS—We next studied the effects of epinephrine on phosphorylation of key signaling proteins in BAEC with a focus on eNOS phosphorylation. We exploited phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to probe immunoblots prepared from BAEC treated with epinephrine for varying times (Fig. 3, A and B) or at different epinephrine doses (Fig. 3, C and D). Epinephrine promoted an increase in the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179; phosphorylation of eNOS at this residue has been shown to increase enzyme activity (19Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). As also shown in Fig. 3, epinephrine treatment promoted the dephosphorylation of eNOS at two sites (Thr497 and Ser116) that inhibit the enzyme when phosphorylated (22Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Harris M.B. Ju H. Venema V.J. Liang H. Zou R. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Kemp B.E. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16587-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in eNOS enzyme activity seen with epinephrine treatment (Fig. 2) is accompanied by an increase in enzyme phosphorylation at an activating residue and a decrease in phosphorylation at two inhibitory residues. The change in phosphorylation at Ser1179 and Thr497 was seen within 2 min of epinephrine addition, whereas eNOS dephosphorylation at Ser116 was seen only after 15 min of drug addition and persisted for at least an hour (Fig. 3B). Other signaling proteins also underwent robust phosphorylation following epinephrine treatment as shown in Fig. 3. Epinephrine induced the rapid and persistent phosphorylation of the PKA substrate VASP (6.2 ± 0.9-fold increase in phosphorylation, n = 7, p < 0.05) as revealed in immunoblots probed with a phosphospecific antibody for VASP Ser157, which is the site predominantly phosphorylated by PKA (33Comerford K.M. Lawrence D.W. Synnestvedt K. Levi B.P. Colgan S.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Kinase Akt underwent a 2.0 ± 0.2-fold increase in phosphorylation after the addition of epinephrine (n = 3, p < 0.05) with a time course similar to that seen with eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation as did the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. These same immunoblots were probed with an antibody against total eNOS, documenting equivalent protein loading under the different experimental treatments. Fig. 3C shows the epinephrine dose response to phosphorylation of VASP, Akt, and ERK1/2 as well as eNOS Ser116, eNOS Thr497, and eNOS Ser1179 levels in BAEC. Analysis of pooled data (Fig. 3D) revealed that epinephrine modulated these different phosphorylation responses with an EC50 of ∼20 nm (Fig. 3, C and D), which is similar to the EC50 for epinephrine-induced eNOS activation documented in BAEC (Fig. 2B). Effects of Subtype-specific β-Adrenergic Antagonists on Epinephrine Responses in Endothelial Cells—We next determined the β-adrenergic subtype that mediates these epinephrine-mediated responses in BAEC using a series of subtype-selective antagonists to block epinephrine action as determined in immunoblot analyses of endothelial cell lysates that were probed with various phosphorylation state-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, neither the β1AR blocker atenolol nor the β2AR blocker butoxamine substantively affected epinephrine-modulated phosphorylation pathways involving eNOS, VASP, or ERK. By contrast, the specific β3AR blocker SR59230A completely blocked epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1179 and dephosphorylation of eNOS Ser116 and eNOS Thr497 and also completely blocked epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of VASP and ERK1/2. We also explored the effects of the β3AR blocker SR59230A on epinephrine-stimulated Rac1 activation. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, epinephrine-promoted Rac1 activation was completely abolished by pretreatment with β3AR blocker SR59230A. Taken together, these data indicate that β3AR is the major receptor for epinephrine signaling in BAEC. Effects of Kinase Inhibitors on Epinephrine Responses in Endothelial Cells—The next series of studies explored the effects of a series of protein kinase inhibitors on epinephrine-modulated phosphorylation responses in BAEC. As shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment of BAEC with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin completely blocked epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of Akt, a well known PI3K substrate. However, wortmannin had no effect on epinephrine-induced modulation of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser116, Thr497, or Ser1179 nor was there any effect of wortmannin on ERK1/2 or VASP phosphorylation. Pretreatment of BAEC with the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126 completely blocked epinephrine-induced ERK phosphorylation without affecting epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of eNOS, VASP, or Akt. By contrast, pretreatment with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 completely blocked epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS Ser1179 without affecting epinephrine-induced dephosphorylation of eNOS Ser116 and Thr497 and without altering the epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of VASP and ERK. siRNA-mediated Rac1 Knockdown Attenuates β3AR-mediated Responses—The next series of experiments used siRNA approaches to explore the role of Rac1 in epinephrine-mediated eNOS phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6, Rac1 siRNA-mediated Rac1 knockdown decreased the basal level eNOS phosphorylation at Ser116 and Thr497 residues and blocked epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of eNOS1179 as well as dephosphorylation of eNOS116 and eNOS497. Knockdown of Rac1 also attenuated epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of PKA substrate VASP, suggesting that Rac1 is an upstream regulator of the PKA substrate VASP as well as a key determinant of eNOS responses. We then designed an siRNA targeting construct to knock down PKA expression, transfected this siRNA int"
https://openalex.org/W1983066278,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase having multiple functions and consisting of two isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β. Pressure overload increases expression of GSK-3α but not GSK-3β. Despite our wealth of knowledge about GSK-3β, the function of GSK-3α in the heart is not well understood. To address this issue, we made cardiac-specific GSK-3α transgenic mice (Tg). Left ventricular weight and cardiac myocyte size were significantly smaller in Tg than in non-Tg (NTg) mice, indicating that GSK-3α inhibits cardiac growth. After 4 weeks of aortic banding (transverse aortic constriction (TAC)), increases in left ventricular weight and myocyte size were significantly smaller in Tg than in NTg, indicating that GSK-3α inhibits cardiac hypertrophy. More severe cardiac dysfunction developed in Tg after TAC. Increases in fibrosis and apoptosis were greater in Tg than in NTg after TAC. Among signaling molecules screened, ERK phosphorylation was decreased in Tg. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, inhibited ERK in cultured cardiac myocytes. Knockdown of GSK-3α increased ERK phosphorylation, an effect that was inhibited by PD98059, rottlerin, and protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ) inhibitor peptide, suggesting that GSK-3α inhibits ERK through PKC-MEK-dependent mechanisms. Knockdown of GSK-3α increased protein content and reduced apoptosis, effects that were abolished by PD98059, indicating that inhibition of ERK plays a major role in the modulation of cardiac growth and apoptosis by GSK-3α. In conclusion, up-regulation of GSK-3α inhibits cardiac growth and pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy but increases fibrosis and apoptosis in the heart.

It has versatile biological functions, including regulation of metabolism, cell growth/death, development, cytoskeletal organization, transcription, and protein translation (1Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 3Woodgett J.R. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE12Google Scholar). GSK-3 remains active at resting state and is inactivated by a variety of mitogens, many protein kinases including protein kinase B/Akt, and by the Wnt signaling pathway. Many targets of GSK-3 are negatively regulated by it, and inactivation of GSK-3 stimulates cellular functions by removing the repression (1Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 3Woodgett J.R. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE12Google Scholar). GSK-3 has two isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β. The molecular mass of GSK-3α is 51 kDa, and that of GSK-3β is 47 kDa (4Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Structurally, the two isoforms have 97% sequence homology within their kinase domains, but GSK-3α has an extended N-terminal glycine-rich tail (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), and the two kinases share only 36% in the last 76 C-terminal residues (1Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Although both isoforms share substrates, their expression patterns, substrate preferences, and cellular functions are not identical (for review, see Ref. 5Hardt S.E. Sadoshima J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). GSK-3α is not phosphorylated/inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC), whereas the activity of GSK-3β is decreased by about 50% when phosphorylated by some PKC isotypes, including PKC-α,-β1, and -γ (6Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons, GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, is involved in regulating production of Alzheimer disease amyloid-β peptides (7Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of GSK-3β in mice results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (8Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), suggesting that GSK-3β and GSK-3α play different roles in development. Using constitutively active GSK-321A/21A/9A/9A knockin mice, it has recently been shown that inactivation of GSK-3β, rather than GSK-3α, is the major route by which insulin activates skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (9McManus E.J.

GSK-3β, but not GSK-3α, regulates cardiomyocyte mitochondrial permeability transition in culture (10Juhaszova M. Zorov D.B. Kim S.H. Pepe S. Fu Q. Fishbein K.W. Ziman B.D. Wang S. Ytrehus K.

Inhibition of GSK-3α more robustly enhances cAMP-response element- and NFκB-dependent transactivation than that of GSK-3β (11Liang M.H. Chuang D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Silencing of GSK-3α down-regulates the binding activity of early growth response-1 (EGR-1) to EGR1-responsive element, whereas silencing of GSK-3β up-regulates this activity (11Liang M.H. Chuang D.M.

However, the function of GSK-3α in the heart remains to be elucidated. The present study was designed to study the function of GSK-3α in the heart and the underlying signaling mechanisms. Primary Culture of Neonatal Rat Ventricular Myocytes—Primary cultures of ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Crl: (WI) BR-Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as previously described (18Zhai P. Yamamoto M. Galeotti J. Liu J. Masurekar M. Thaisz J. Irie K. Holle E. Yu X. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Wagner T. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3045-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A cardiac myocyte-rich fraction was obtained by centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Construction of Adenoviral Vectors—Recombinant adenovirus was constructed using an Adeno-X adenovirus construction kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). We made replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (devoid of E1 and E3) harboring GSK-3α (Ad-GSK-3α), GSK-3β (Ad-GSK-3β), and shRNA against GSK-3α (Ad-shRNA GSK-3α). Transgenic Mice—A cDNA clone of GSK-3α was kindly provided by Dr. J. R. Woodgett. Using this clone and the mouse αMHC promoter (provided by Dr. J. Robbins), we made transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of GSK-3α. GSK-3 Kinase Activity Assay—GSK-3α or GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated from tissue lysates with equal protein content. The immunoprecipitate was collected, washed, and resuspended in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m Na3VO4, and 200 μm ATP. One hundred ng of Tau was added as a substrate and mixed well. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation of Tau by GSK-3 was detected by standard immunoblotting using a phospho-Tau antibody (Sigma). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy fibrous tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was then carried out on a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (Bio-Rad) using the DyNAmo HS SYBR Green qPCR kit (Bio-Rad). The specific oligonucleotide primers for atrial natriuretic factor and α-skeletal actin have been previously reported (18Zhai P. Yamamoto M. Galeotti J. Liu J. Masurekar M. Thaisz J. Irie K. Holle E. Yu X. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Wagner T. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3045-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Echocardiography—Mice were anesthetized using 12 μl/g of body weight of 2.5% avertin (Sigma), and echocardiography was performed using ultrasonography (Acuson Sequoia C256, Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA) as previously described (18Zhai P. Yamamoto M. Galeotti J. Liu J. Masurekar M. Thaisz J. Irie K. Holle E. Yu X. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Wagner T. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3045-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A 13-MHz linear ultrasound transducer was used. Two-dimension guided M-mode measurements of LV internal diameter were taken from three or more beats and averaged. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was measured at the time of the apparent maximal LV diastolic dimension, whereas LV end-systolic dimension was measured at the time of the most anterior systolic excursion of the posterior wall. Histological Analysis—Histological analyses of the heart sections were conducted as described previously (18Zhai P. Yamamoto M. Galeotti J. Liu J. Masurekar M. Thaisz J. Irie K. Holle E. Yu X. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Wagner T. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3045-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Heart specimens were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6-μm thickness. Interstitial fibrosis was evaluated by picric acid Sirius red staining. The positively stained (red) fibrotic area was expressed as a percentage of total area. Total cardiac myocyte numbers were estimated using a published method (19Olivetti G. Quaini F. Lagrasta C. Ricci R. Tiberti G. Capasso J.M. Anversa P. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 227-239PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the number of nuclei per unit area of myocardium (N(n)A) was determined in 20 fields (40×). The average nuclear length (Dn) was determined in longitudinally oriented myocytes. The number of myocyte nuclei per unit volume of myocardium (N(n)v) was calculated using the equation N(n)v = N(n)A/Dn. The estimated total number of myocyte nuclei in the left ventricle was calculated as the product of the number of myocyte nuclei per unit volume, N(n)v, and the total ventricular volume, VT, which was derived from the left ventricular weight using the specific gravity of muscle tissue, 1.06 g/ml. Evaluation of Apoptosis in Tissue Sections—DNA fragmentation was detected in situ using TUNEL as described (18Zhai P. Yamamoto M. Galeotti J. Liu J. Masurekar M. Thaisz J. Irie K. Holle E. Yu X. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Wagner T. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3045-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, deparaffinized sections were incubated with proteinase K, and DNA fragments were labeled with fluoresce-in-conjugated dUTP using TdT (Roche Applied Science). Nuclear density was determined by manual counting of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei in 20 fields from each animal using the 40× objective and of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the same fields using the same power objective. Limiting counting of total nuclei and the TUNEL-positive nuclei to areas with a true cross-section of myocytes made it possible to selectively count only those nuclei that clearly were within myocytes. Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC)—TAC was performed according to the method published previously (20Zhai P. Galeotti J. Liu J. Holle E. Yu X. Wagner T. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery was conducted as described (21Odashima M. Usui S. Takagi H. Hong C. Liu J. Yokota M. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting Analysis—Cardiac tissue homogenates and cell lysates were made in CHAPS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). We used anti-phospho-specific and corresponding non-phospho-specific antibodies against GSK-3α (S21), GSK-3β (S9), Akt (S473), p70 S6 kinase (T389), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (T202/Y204) (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phospho-Tau antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses between groups were done by one-way analysis of variance, and when p values were significant, differences among group means were evaluated using the Bonferroni t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of GSK-3α Was Increased in Hypertrophied Myocardium Due to Chronic Pressure Overload or Myocardial Infarction—To examine the expression of GSK-3α under pathological conditions, the protein level of GSK-3α was measured in hearts subjected to pressure overload and in the remote area from myocardial infarction. The level of GSK-3α was increased by 2-fold, whereas phospho-GSK-3α was not significantly changed in the heart 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 1A), indicating that GSK-3α was up-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, the expression of GSK-3β and the phosphorylation of GSK-3β were not changed in the heart 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 1B). Similarly, GSK-3α expression was increased by 1.6-fold, and phosphorylation of GSK-3α was significantly decreased in myocardium remote from myocardial infarction 7 days after coronary ligation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, neither total expression nor phosphorylation of GSK-3β was significantly changed in the remote area of the infarcted heart (Fig. 1D). Generation of GSK-3α Transgenic Mice—To study the effect of GSK-3α up-regulation on cardiac phenotype in vivo, two lines of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of GSK-3α (Tg), line 13 and line 28, were established. Cardiac tissue transgene expression was assessed at the protein level using 2-3-month-old mice. The expression of GSK-3α in Tg mice was 4.3 and 3.7 times that of NTg mice in line 28 and line 13, respectively (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. IA). Interestingly, the expression of GSK-3β was down-regulated in Tg mice in both lines (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. IB). The GSK-3α kinase activity in Tg was increased by 1.7-fold in line 28, and the GSK-3β activity was decreased by 40% (Fig. 2, C and D). We primarily characterized line 28 in this study. GSK-3α Down-regulates Cardiac Physiological Growth—To examine the effect of GSK-3α on physiological growth of the heart, heart size, LV weight, and cardiac myocyte size were compared between NTg and Tg mice at both 3 and 7 months old. Tg mice had smaller hearts than NTg mice at both ages (Fig. 3A). The LV weight (LVW)/body weight (BW) and the LVW/tibia length (TL) in Tg mice were significantly lower than those in NTg mice at both ages (Fig. 3, B and C). The LV myocyte cross-sectional area was significantly smaller in Tg mice than in NTg mice at 3 and 7 months old (Fig. 3, D and E), indicating smaller myocyte size in Tg mice. To further examine the effect of GSK-3α on cardiac myocyte size, myocytes were isolated from 3-month-old mice. Cardiac myocyte capacitance, proportional to the cell surface area, was significantly decreased in Tg (Fig. 3F), indicating that the overall size of cardiac myocytes was smaller in Tg than in NTg. The estimated total number of cardiac myocytes was not significantly different between NTg and Tg at either 3 or 7 months old (supplemental Fig. II, A and B), suggesting that the smaller cardiac myocyte size rather than changes in the total number of myocytes is an important basis for the smaller heart in Tg. In the other line of Tg mice (line 13), LVW/BW and LVW/TL in Tg were significantly lower than those in littermate NTg (supplemental Fig. III, A and B). These data indicate that GSK-3α negatively regulates physiological growth of the heart. GSK-3α Modestly Increases Apoptosis and Fibrosis but Does Not Cause Cardiac Dysfunction at Base Line—The percent fibrosis in Tg mouse hearts was slightly but significantly increased as compared with that in NTg at 3 and 7 months old (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, the TUNEL-positive nuclei were slightly but significantly increased in Tg mouse hearts at both ages (Fig. 4C). Despite the modest increase in apoptosis and fibrosis, Tg mice did not develop any signs of heart failure. The lung weight/BW and lung weight/TL were not significantly different between NTg and Tg mice (data not shown). The ejection fraction and fractional shortening (FS), determined by echocardiographic measurement, in Tg mice were not significantly different from those in NTg mice (Table 2). The +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), determined by hemodynamic analysis, were also not significantly different between NTg and Tg mice (Table 3). After up to 7 months of follow-up, no significant increase in premature mortality was found in either line 28 or line 13 Tg mice. These data indicate that Tg mice did not develop cardiac dysfunction at base line up to 7 months of age despite a modest increase in apoptosis and fibrosis.TABLE 2Echocardiographic analysis of GSK-3α Tg mice3 Months old7 Months oldNTgTgNTgTgN6654DSEP WT (mm)0.83 ± 0.030.82 ± 0.010.98 ± 0.040.93 ± 0.03LVEDD (mm)3.71 ± 0.113.62 ± 0.103.77 ± 0.173.76 ± 0.12DPW WT (mm)0.80 ± 0.030.82 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.030.96 ± 0.02SSEP WT (mm)1.18 ± 0.021.22 ± 0.031.39 ± 0.031.41 ± 0.09LVESD (mm)2.47 ± 0.112.45 ± 0.112.50 ± 0.112.46 ± 0.09SPW WT (mm)1.07 ± 0.031.02 ± 0.031.20 ± 0.051.21 ± 0.02EF0.70 ± 0.020.69 ± 0.030.71 ± 0.010.72 ± 0.02FS (%)33 ± 132 ± 234 ± 134 ± 2HR (bpm)433 ± 23437 ± 22450 ± 45432 ± 41 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Hemodynamic measurements of GSK-3α Tg mice3-Month old7-Month oldNTgTgNTgTgN6654LVSP (mm Hg)101 ± 792 ± 5102 ± 296 ± 3LVEDP (mm Hg)2.4 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.02.7 ± 0.6+dP/dt (mm Hg/s)9000 ± 7647900 ± 9839000 ± 5008750 ± 331−dP/dt (mm Hg/s)7500 ± 6616625 ± 4537500 ± 5007000 ± 354MAP (mm Hg)74.9 ± 3.767.8 ± 6.878.7 ± 6.782.2 ± 6.2HR (bpm)485 ± 12498 ± 15558 ± 13498 ± 48 Open table in a new tab GSK-3α Inhibits Pressure Overload-induced Cardiac Hypertrophy but Exacerbates Cardiac Dysfunction Caused by Pressure Overload—To examine the effect of GSK-3α on pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, 3-month-old Tg mice and NTg mice underwent TAC operation. Two to 4 weeks after TAC, Tg mice developed less severe cardiac hypertrophy than NTg mice. The increases in LVW/BW (2 weeks of banding, 37.5 versus 48.1%, p < 0.01; 4 weeks of banding, 48.7 versus 59.1%, p < 0.01) and LVW/TL (2 weeks of banding, 36.2 versus 55.3%, p < 0.01; 4 weeks of banding, 50 versus 65.9%, p < 0.01) were significantly smaller in Tg mice than in NTg mice (Fig. 5, A and B, supplemental Fig. IV), and the increases in cardiac myocyte cross-sectional area 4 weeks after TAC (21% versus 40%, p < 0.01) were also significantly smaller in Tg mice than in NTg mice (Fig. 5, C and D). Expression of fetal-type genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor and α-skeletal actin, was significantly less in Tg than in NTg 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 5, E and F), although it was not significantly different between SHAM-operated NTg and Tg. These data suggest that GSK-3α overexpressed in the heart attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, despite the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy, Tg mice developed more severe cardiac dysfunction than NTg mice after TAC. Although no (of 11) NTg mice died after the operation, 2 (of 11) Tg mice died 3 days after the operation, and postmortem pathological measurements revealed severe lung congestion (data not shown), indicating that the mice died due to heart failure. More severe lung congestion (higher lung weight/BW and lung weight/TL) was observed in Tg mice 2 and 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 6, A and B, supplemental Fig. V, A and B). Echocardiographic measurements indicated that ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) in Tg mice were significantly lower than those in NTg mice 2 and 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 6, C and D, supplemental Fig. V, C and D). The radius/wall thickness (r/h) ratio, an indicator of LV wall stress, was significantly higher in Tg than in NTg 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 6E). LVEDP/EDD, an indicator of LV wall stiffness, was significantly greater in Tg than in NTg 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 6F). Hemodynamic measurements indicated that, although LV end-systolic stress was not different between NTg and Tg either at base line or after TAC, LV end-diastolic stress was significantly higher in Tg than in NTg 4 weeks after TAC (Fig. 6, G and H). LV +dP/dt and -dP/dt in Tg mice were significantly decreased compared with those in NTg mice, and the decreases were significantly greater in Tg than in NTg after 2 and 4 weeks of TAC (Table 4, supplemental Fig. VE).FIGURE 6The effect of 4 weeks of aortic banding on LV function.

Open table in a new tab GSK-3α Further Increases Cardiac Fibrosis and Apoptosis in Response to Pressure Overload—After TAC, cardiac fibrosis was increased in both NTg and Tg mice, with significantly more fibrosis in Tg mice (Fig. 7, A and B). The increase in percent fibrosis after 4 weeks of TAC was significantly greater in Tg than in NTg (1.52-versus 1.17-fold, p < 0.01). Similarly, TUNEL-positive nuclei were more numerous in both NTg and Tg mice 4 weeks after TAC, but Tg mouse hearts had significantly more positive nuclei than NTg (Fig. 7, C and D). The increase in percent TUNEL-positive nuclei was significantly greater in Tg than in NTg in response to 4 weeks of TAC (2.34-versus 1.72-fold, p < 0.01). The more severe fibrosis and apoptosis in Tg mouse hearts may, at least in part, explain more severe cardiac dysfunction in Tg mice after TAC. GSK-3α Inhibits Growth and Promotes Apoptosis in Cardiac Myocytes in Vitro—To study whether GSK-3α directly acts on cardiac myocytes to inhibit cardiac growth and increase apoptosis, we performed in vitro experiments using cultured NRCMs. We made an adenovirus harboring GSK-3α (Ad-GSK-3α) and an adenovirus harboring a shRNA against GSK-3α (Ad-shRNA-GSK-3α). Ad-GSK-3α and Ad-shRNA-GSK-3α specifically increased and knocked down the expression of GSK-3α, respectively, without influencing the expression level of GSK-3β in NRCMs (Fig. 8A). Overexpression of GSK-3α decreased cardiac myocyte size, whereas knockdown of GSK-3α increased cardiac myocyte size (Fig. 8B). Protein content in cardiac myocytes, another indicator of cardiac myocyte growth, was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in cells transduc"
https://openalex.org/W2137425092,"Previous research suggests that visual and haptic object recognition are viewpoint-dependent both within- and cross-modally. However, this conclusion may not be generally valid as it was reached using objects oriented along their extended y-axis, resulting in differential surface processing in vision and touch. In the present study, we removed this differential by presenting objects along the z-axis, thus making all object surfaces more equally available to vision and touch.Participants studied previously unfamiliar objects, in groups of four, using either vision or touch. Subsequently, they performed a four-alternative forced-choice object identification task with the studied objects presented in both unrotated and rotated (180 degrees about the x-, y-, and z-axes) orientations. Rotation impaired within-modal recognition accuracy in both vision and touch, but not cross-modal recognition accuracy. Within-modally, visual recognition accuracy was reduced by rotation about the x- and y-axes more than the z-axis, whilst haptic recognition was equally affected by rotation about all three axes. Cross-modal (but not within-modal) accuracy correlated with spatial (but not object) imagery scores.The viewpoint-independence of cross-modal object identification points to its mediation by a high-level abstract representation. The correlation between spatial imagery scores and cross-modal performance suggest that construction of this high-level representation is linked to the ability to perform spatial transformations. Within-modal viewpoint-dependence appears to have a different basis in vision than in touch, possibly due to surface occlusion being important in vision but not touch."
https://openalex.org/W2090738704,"Mitochondrial inheritance is generally assumed to be maternal. However, there is increasing evidence of exceptions to this rule, especially in hybrid crosses. In these cases, mitochondria are also inherited paternally, so ""paternal leakage"" of mitochondria occurs. It is important to understand these exceptions better, since they potentially complicate or invalidate studies that make use of mitochondrial markers. We surveyed F1 offspring of experimental hybrid crosses of the 17-year periodical cicadas Magicicada septendecim, M. septendecula, and M. cassini for the presence of paternal mitochondrial markers at various times during development (1-day eggs; 3-, 6-, 9-week eggs; 16-month old 1st and 2nd instar nymphs). We found evidence of paternal leakage in both reciprocal hybrid crosses in all of these samples. The relative difficulty of detecting paternal mtDNA in the youngest eggs and ease of detecting leakage in older eggs and in nymphs suggests that paternal mitochondria proliferate as the eggs develop. Our data support recent theoretical predictions that paternal leakage may be more common than previously estimated."

https://openalex.org/W2017530576,"Dynamic and localized actions of cAMP are central to the generation of discrete cellular events in response to a range of Gs-coupled receptor agonists. In the present study we have employed a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel sensor to report acute changes in cAMP in the restricted cellular microdomains adjacent to two different Gs-coupled receptor pathways, β2-adrenoceptors and prostanoid receptors that are expressed endogenously in HEK293 cells. We probed by either selective small interference RNA-mediated knockdown or dominant negative overexpression the contribution of key signaling components in the rapid attenuation of the local cAMP signaling and subsequent desensitization of each of these G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways immediately following receptor activation. Direct measurements of cAMP changes just beneath the plasma membrane of single HEK293 cells reveal novel insights into key regulatory roles provided by protein kinase A-RII, β-arrestin2, cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D3, and cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D5. We provide new evidence for distinct modes of cAMP down-regulation in these two Gs-linked pathways and show that these distinct G-protein-coupled receptor signaling systems are subject to unidirectional, heterologous desensitization that allows for limited cross-talk between distinct, dynamically regulated pools of cAMP.

Many tissues types, including airway epithelium and cardiac muscle, endogenously express both classes of G-protein-coupled receptor to generate cellular increases in cAMP following appropriate stimuli (1Billington C.K. Penn R.B. Respir. Res. 2003; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Steinberg S.F. Brunton L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 751-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Differential agonist actions are thus conjectured to be permitted via compartmentalization of cAMP signals to regions close to individual G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes (3Nikolaev V.O.

These local cAMP signals can then mediate specific downstream events through the regulation of neighboring effector molecules such as protein kinase A (PKA), exchange protein directly activated by cAMP, and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs). Temporally distinct, localized cAMP signals can be produced by two main factors: firstly, rapid cAMP hydrolysis by spatially organized cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (3Nikolaev V.O. Bunemann M.

Recent real-time, single cell approaches have provided some insight into the composition of signaling complexes whose tethered PDEs serve to shape a localized cAMP signal (9Willoughby D. Wong W.

However, the characteristics of the other key regulators comprising rapid attenuation of cAMP signal and receptor desensitization have not been addressed at this essential level. In addition, comparison of the regulation of local cAMP dynamics mediated by different receptor subtypes in the same cell, and their dependence upon a number of known signaling molecules, remains to be addressed. One key question of such compartmentalized events is whether activation of a specific Gs-linked receptor type is able to influence cAMP signals generated by other Gs-linked receptors in neighboring compartments of the cell.In the current study we have used a single cell approach to investigate the dynamics of specific cAMP signaling events in real-time. Using an adenovirus expressing a mutant CNGC as a high sensitivity probe for direct read-out of sub-plasmalemmal cAMP, we have assessed the role of specific signaling components in β2AR-mediated and EP-R-mediated signaling in HEK293 cells. In particular, we have examined the role of known signaling molecules in the local degradation of cAMP and subsequent loss of signaling efficiency. The functional role of individual proteins, including the β-arrestins, PKA, and PDE4 isoforms, was systematically assessed using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA). In complementary experiments we overexpressed catalytically inactive, “dominant negative” versions of PDE4D isoforms, to assess the role of these proteins during both isoproterenol- and prostaglandin-evoked receptor activation. By displacing such cognate, anchored endogenous PDE4 isoforms from their functionally relevant sites, these constructs provide a unique insight into signaling functions of spatially constrained PDE4 isoforms (14Lynch M.J. Baillie G.S. Mohamed A. Li X. Maisonneuve C. Klussmann E. van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

A dynamic framework of specific isoforms of β-arrestin, PKA regulatory subunit, and PDE4D subtypes governs the local cAMP dynamics and desensitization of β2AR-mediated signals; in contrast, dynamic regulation of EP-R signals was independent of β-arrestin recruitment and largely dependent upon PKA-RII and PDE4D5 activity. Despite highly efficient compartmentalization of cAMP signaling, we provide evidence for heterologous unidirectional desensitization of β2AR signaling as a consequence of EP-R activation, which suggests organized communication between discrete signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—HEK293 cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2).

Each siRNA was transfected into 40-60% confluent HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Lf2000, Invitrogen). siRNA samples were first diluted in Opti-MEM to a final concentration of 100 nm, and 4 μl of Lf2000 (1 mg/ml) was diluted in 96 μl of Opti-MEM. After 10-min incubation the diluted Lf2000 reagent (100 μl) was added to siRNA sample (100 μl), and after 20 min the mixture was added to cells plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well plates. 800 μl of Opti-MEM was also added to each well giving a total volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 37 °C (5% CO2) for ∼6 h the solution was replaced with 2 ml of serum-containing MEM per well.

Detergent-soluble proteins were isolated from cells by disruption in lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 2H2O) containing Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-phosphoglycerol, and 1 mm Na3VO4. After mixing on ice for 30 min detergent-insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 gav for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant containing soluble proteins was retained for Western blot analysis. Protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard, with ∼50 μg of protein run per well.CNGC Adenovirus Expression—One day prior to making single cell cAMP measurements HEK293 cells that had been plated onto 25-mm coverslips and transfected with specific siRNA oligonucleotides or dominant negative cDNA were infected with adenovirus encoding the α subunit of the rat olfactory CNGC with mutations C460W and E583M. The mutant CNGC adenovirus was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (8Rich T.C. Tse T.E. Rohan J.G. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque forming units per well was used, and after 2 h hydroxyurea (2 mm) was added to each coverslip to inhibit adenovirus vector replication.cAMP Measurements Monitored by Ca2+ Influx—CNGC-infected HEK293 cells were loaded with 4 μm fura-2/AM and 0.02% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 40 min in extracellular buffer containing (mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.1 MgCl2, 11 d-glucose, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. After loading, cells were washed and then imaged using a CoolSnap charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) and monochromator system (Cairn Research) attached to a Nikon TMD microscope (×40 objective). Emission images (D510/80M) at 340 nm and 380 nm excitation were collected at 1 Hz using MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging). Data were plotted as 340/380 nm ratio changes relative to the pre-stimulus fluorescence ratio. Only cells that gave >20% increase in fura-2 ratio over baseline in response to the first application of agonist were analyzed. Solutions were applied directly to the bath to enable rapid solution change.RT-PCR Experiments—Reverse transcription PCR reactions were performed by using total cellular RNA isolated with the SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega). The PCR primer sequences were designed and synthesized on the basis of published human cDNA sequences and are as follows: EP2-R (forward, 5′-GCTGCTGCTTCTCATTGTCTCG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCCGACAACAGAGGACTGAACG-3′ (392 bp)), EP3-R (forward, 5′-GGACTAGCTCTTCGCATAACT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCAGTGCTCAACTGATGTCT-3′ (293 bp)), and EP4-R (forward, 5′-ATCTTACTCATTGCCACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCTATTGCTTTACTGAGCAC-3′ (212 bp)). As a control for genomic DNA contamination of the RNA preparations, parallel samples were not reverse-transcribed. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.RESULTSThe Role of Specific PDE4 Isoforms in β2AR cAMP Signal Compartmentalization and Desensitization—Previous studies have highlighted the important role of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) activity in the compartmentalization of cAMP signals during cellular AC activity (3Nikolaev V.O.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2051-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To assess the specific role of PDE4 in shaping sub-plasmalemmal cAMP dynamics and in down-regulating signaling efficiency during β2AR activation, cells were treated with an adenoviral vector expressing a mutant α-subunit of the rat olfactory CNGC (C460W/E583M CNGC). Homologous expression of the C460W/E583M CNGC subunit produces a functional cation-conducting channel with ∼10-fold greater sensitivity to cAMP over cGMP (K½ values of 1.4 μm versus 11 μm for cAMP and cGMP, respectively) (8Rich T.C. Tse T.E. Rohan J.G. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Activity of the CNGCs in individual HEK293 cells was assessed by monitoring Ca2+ influx as a function of cAMP-mediated channel activation. In parallel experiments using uninfected HEK293 cells Gs-coupled agonists did not produce any changes in fura-2 signal, demonstrating that any Ca2+ influx observed was due to activation of the mutant CNGCs expressed.Under control conditions application of 1 μm isoproterenol for 1 min generated a rise in cAMP that, upon agonist removal, rapidly returned to basal (Fig. 1A). This behavior is thought to be due primarily to the rapid hydrolysis of sub-plasmalemmal cAMP (5Rochais F. Vandecasteele G. Lefebvre F. Lugnier C. Lum H. Mazet J.L. Cooper D.M.F. Fischmeister R. J.

A. 2001; 98: 13049-13054Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), although cAMP diffusion though the cell cytosol may also play a role (cAMP diffusion rate is estimated to be high, ∼0.8 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (19Bacskai B.J. Hochner B. Mahaut-Smith M. Adams S.R. Kaang B.K. Kandel E.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1993; 260: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), but is thought to be restricted to ∼5 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 for movements between sub-plasmalemmal microdomains and the bulk cytosol (20Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Nakata H. Schaack J. Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)). Subsequent 1-min applications of 1 μm isoproterenol given at 5-min intervals elicited no detectable rise in [cAMP] (Fig. 1A) indicating “desensitization” of AC-coupled signaling. At least 90% loss of signaling efficiency was detected in all cells tested (>400 cells) under control conditions following a 1-min application of 1 μm isoproterenol. This desensitization was quantified by “ratioing” the peak amplitude of cAMP increase during the first and second agonist application, with 100% representing complete desensitization. A similar degree of desensitization was seen when the interval between 1 μm isoproterenol applications was reduced to just 3 min (see supplemental Fig. S1). However, when the interval was increased to 10 min clear signs of recovery of β2AR signaling were seen, and at 15 min after the initial isoproterenol challenge up to 80% of the initial signaling efficiency was recovered in some cells (supplemental Fig. S1). For the purpose of this study we examined the effects of specific signaling components on the loss of cAMP signal seen at 5 min after the initial receptor stimulus as this generated a robust, reproducible loss of signaling efficiency.Using this protocol we found that co-application of 1 μm isoproterenol with the PDE4-selective inhibitor, rolipram (10 μm), eliminated the apparent desensitization to yield a robust cAMP rise at a time point that showed complete loss of isoproterenol responsiveness under control conditions (Fig. 1B). In previous single cell studies we found that, although the immediate recovery of sub-plasmalemmal cAMP signals is predominantly driven by PDE4 activity, inhibition of this enzyme does not directly influence the amplitude of cAMP rise (and subsequent CNGC activation) (9Willoughby D. Wong W. Schaack J. Scott J.D. Cooper D.M.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2051-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, the significant increase in cAMP signal seen in Fig. 1B upon co-application of isoproterenol and rolipram following a 1-min pre-treatment with isoproterenol implicates an essential role for PDE4 in isoproterenol-mediated desensitization. The PDE3-selective inhibitor, cilostamide (10 μm), had no significant effect on the rate of cAMP hydrolysis or degree of desensitization (data not shown).PDE4 represents the major fraction (∼70%) of total cAMP PDE activity in HEK293 cells (14Lynch M.J. Baillie G.S. Mohamed A. Li X. Maisonneuve C. Klussmann E. van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33178-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Hence, it is not surprising that this enzyme plays such an important role in the rapid hydrolysis of sub-plasmalemmal cAMP signals. However, the PDE4 group of enzymes comprises 4 families and around 20 isoforms, of which members are selectively expressed in different cell types (21Houslay M.D. Adams D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). It is not known which PDE4 isoform is predominantly responsible for compartmentalizing near membrane β2AR-mediated cAMP signals. >90% of total PDE4 activity in HEK293 cells is provided by the PDE4B and PDE4D subfamilies. Of this, PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 contribute ∼60% of total PDE4 activity, with PDE4B2 generating a further ∼30% (14Lynch M.J. Baillie G.S. Mohamed A. Li X. Maisonneuve C. Klussmann E. van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33178-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Using siRNA to selectively knock down the subfamilies of PDE4 in HEK293 cells we were able to examine the relative actions of each PDE4 class with respect to the dynamics of isoproterenol-induced cAMP signaling via β2ARs. Transfection of HEK293 cells with siRNA oligonucleotides directed against PDE4B and PDE4D markedly reduced endogenous levels of PDE4B2 (Fig. 1C), or PDE4D3 and PDE4D5, respectively (Fig. 1D). Cell lysates were collected 3 days post-transfection and subjected to Western blot analyses to confirm knockdown of endogenous protein levels. Although modest amounts of PDE4A activity (<8% of total PDE4 activity) have been reported previously for HEK293 cells (14Lynch M.J. Baillie G.S. Mohamed A. Li X. Maisonneuve C. Klussmann E. van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33178-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) no PDE4A immunoreactivity was found in the present study (data not shown). Previous investigation has shown that the PDE4B- and PDE4D-selective siRNA oligonucleotides are highly specific for their chosen isoform and do not lead to compensatory up-regulation of other PDE isoforms (14Lynch M.J. Baillie G.S. Mohamed A. Li X. Maisonneuve C. Klussmann E. van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33178-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Knockdown of PDE4B had little effect on the transient cAMP rises evoked by isoproterenol application (Fig. 1F), with rates and percentage of cAMP recoveries comparable to those seen under resting (basal) conditions (Fig. 1H). In contrast, following knockdown of PDE4D, recovery from isoproterenol-evoked increases in [cAMP] was greatly attenuated (Fig. 1, G and H). Such large reductions in the degree of cAMP recovery (just 9 ± 8% in PDE4D siRNA-treated cells versus 89 ± 11% in controls) are consistent with the requirement for local PDE4D activity to rapidly hydrolyze cAMP following β2AR occupancy. Although PDE4D activity was clearly involved in shaping isoproterenol-evoked cAMP transients, knockdown of all PDE4D isoforms, using pan 4D family-specific siRNA oligonucleotides, was not well suited to testing the role of PDE4D isoforms in desensitization, because sustained, elevated [cAMP] in the vicinity of the CNGCs serves to limit the detection of any further channel activation in response to a second agonist application. To obviate this complication, the knockdown of specific PDE4D isoforms was used to gain further detailed insight into the importance of PDE4D in desensitization (see below). These data support a significant role for PDE4D, and not PDE4B, isoforms in the control of dynamic β2AR Gs-coupled signaling.Selective Knockdown of β-Arrestin Isoforms and PKA Regulatory Subunits—Previous studies in a HEK293 cell line that constitutively overexpressed β2ARs revealed that stimulation with 10 μm isoproterenol transiently recruited endogenous β-arrestin-associated PDE4D isoforms to the plasma membrane (15Baillie G.S.

However, it is unclear if the critical PDE4D activity involved in shaping the β -agonist response is pre-associated in the immediate vicinity of the β2AR and plays a direct role in the loss of its signaling in response to subsequent isoproterenol applications, or if the actions of PDE4D are dependent on other signaling components that are reportedly involved in β2AR desensitization, particularly β-arrestin, which sequesters PDE4 isoforms and allows for their recruitment to agonist-stimulated β2ARs (15Baillie G.S.

Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar) and are capable of mimicking an early developmental process by forming embryoid bodies (EBs). Because human ES cells have been established (2Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12358) Google Scholar), they are expected to become a valuable source for therapeutic interventions and model systems for investigating human embryogenesis. Thus, understanding of ES cell self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency is essential for the application of ES cells. Mouse ES cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which binds to a dimer of the LIF receptor and gp130 (3Smith A.G. Heath J.K.

In turn, gp130 activates STAT3, which directly regulates c-Myc transcription in ES cells. Dominant activation of STAT3 or c-Myc is known to be sufficient for maintaining ES cells in an undifferentiated state (5Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T.

Development. 2005; 132: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gp130 activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Erk signaling (7Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Whereas Erk signaling promotes ES cell differentiation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase promotes proliferation and ES cell self-renewal through its inhibitory effect on Erk signaling (8Paling N.R.D. Wheadon H. Bone H.K. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48063-48070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Indeed, activation of Akt signaling is sufficient to maintain the pluripotency of both mouse and primate ES cells (9Watanabe S. Umehara H. Murayama K. Okabe M. Kimura T. Nakano T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2697-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Moreover, BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signals are involved in ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency (10Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 11Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). It thus seems likely that these signaling pathways are synergistically involved in ES cell self-renewal. Several transcription factors including Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Nanog have been identified as playing an essential role in the self-renewal of ES cells (12Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Developmental pluripotency-associated (Dppa) 4 is one such uncharacterized gene expressed in ES cells. Dppa4 has been originally identified as a gene expressed in mouse early embryos with other factors named Dppa1, Dppa2, and Dppa5 (27Bortvin A. Eggan K. Skaletsky H. Akutsu H. Berry D.L. Yanagimachi R. Page D.C. Jaenisch R. Development. 2003; 130: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The expression of Dppa4 is restricted to early developmental stages and germ cells including primordial germ cells, gonads, and testis (27Bortvin A. Eggan K. Skaletsky H. Akutsu H. Berry D.L. Yanagimachi R. Page D.C. Jaenisch R. Development. 2003; 130: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28Maldonado-Saldivia J. van den Bergen J. Krouskos M. Gilchrist M. Lee C. Li R. Sinclair A.H. Surani M.A. Western P.S. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Comprehensive ChIP-on-chip analysis has indicated that Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Nanog each bind to the Dppa4 promoter region in human ES cells (29Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. Gifford D.K. Melton D.A. Jaenisch R. Young R.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of DPPA4 protein indicates that DPPA4 shows weak similarity to DPPA2 and DPPA3 (Stella/PGC7) (30Sato M. Kimura T. Kurokawa K. Fujita Y. Abe K. Masuhara M. Yasunaga T. Ryo A. Yamamoto M. Nakano T. Mech. Dev. 2002; 113: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 31Saitou M. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). These three proteins have a putative DNA-binding domain named SAP (Scaffold attachment factor A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain. The SAP domain is found in SAF-A/B, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Ku70, PIAS, and Acinus and is thought to be involved in chromosomal organization including RNA processing, DNA repair, and apoptotic degradation of chromatin (32Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, it is little known regarding whether Dppa4 is involved in the self-renewal and differentiation of ES cells. To clarify the mechanisms of ES cell self-renewal, we focused on Dppa4 because of its expression pattern and the SAP domain. In the present study, we found that Dppa4 overexpression in ES cells resulted in inhibition of differentiation and proliferation of differentiated ES cells. Suppression of Dppa4 expression in ES cells induced ES cell differentiation into a primitive ectoderm lineage even in the presence of LIF. DPPA4 protein was localized in nuclear chromatin and was extracted with high salt concentration from chromatin pellet. Interestingly, the solubility property of DPPA4 from ES cell chromatin is identical to that of RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on serine 2 (RNAPIIO-S2), representing localization in active chromatin. Our results indicate that Dppa4 is associated with active chromatin and maintains ES cells in an undifferentiated state by inhibiting differentiation into an ectoderm lineage. ES Cell Culture and Differentiation—The mouse ES cell line, MGZRTcH2 (33Masui S. Shimosato D. Toyooka Y. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was maintained in ES medium consisting of knockout Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.3 mm monothioglycerol (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1,000 units/ml LIF (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) on gelatin-coated dishes (34Chinzei R. Tanaka Y. Shimizu-Saito K. Hara Y. Kakinuma S. Watanabe M. Teramoto K. Arii S. Takase K. Sato C. Terada N. Teraoka H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ES cell differentiation was induced in the ES medium in the absence of LIF. EBs were formed from ES cells by hanging drop culture for 2 days and then cultured on gelatin-coated dishes as previously described (34Chinzei R. Tanaka Y. Shimizu-Saito K. Hara Y. Kakinuma S. Watanabe M. Teramoto K. Arii S. Takase K. Sato C. Terada N. Teraoka H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Production of Polyclonal Antibody to DPPA4—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a mouse DPPA4 peptide, DAYKRL-LARAFPEQ (amino acids 106-119), were produced by Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan), available from Cosmo Bio (Tokyo, Japan). This epitope is present in the central region of DPPA4 containing part of the SAP domain (see Fig. 1B). Generation of Tetracycline (Tc)-regulatable Dppa4-overexpressing ES Cells—The open reading frame of Dppa4 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using cDNAs synthesized from ES cells as a template. The primers used for Dppa4 cDNA cloning were 5′-CTCGAGATGGAGACTGCTGGAGACAA and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTATCCTTCGAGGCTCTTAG. The amplified 905-bp fragment was subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The Dppa4 cDNA in the vector was excised with XhoI and NotI and ligated into an exchange vector, pPthC (33Masui S. Shimosato D. Toyooka Y. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). pPthC-HA was constructed by insertion of annealed HA oligonucleotide consisting of 5′-TCGATATGTATCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCGC and 5′-TCGAGCGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGATACAT into the XhoI site of the pPthC vector. Each of the pPthC-Dppa4 and pPthC-HADppa4 vectors was co-transfected with pCAGGS-Cre (Cre expression vector) into the MGZRTcH2 ES cells (see Fig. 2A) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described (33Masui S. Shimosato D. Toyooka Y. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The puromycin-resistant colonies were selected in the presence of 1 μg/ml Tc (Sigma), and then clones showing sensitivity to hygromycin B (Invitrogen) in the absence of Tc were selected as correctly targeted clones. The selected clones were maintained in ES medium containing 1 μg/ml Tc and 3 μg/ml puromycin. Transfection of Dppa4 in NIH3T3 Cells—The Dppa4-amplified fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site of a pIREShyg2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting pIREShyg2-Dppa4 or mock vector was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with GenElute mammalian total RNA Mini-Prep kit (Sigma) and treated with DNase I (Promega). cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of the total RNA using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using a Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves of cycle threshold values were obtained from amplification of stepwise dilutions of cDNA. For each experimental sample, the expression levels of each gene were determined from the standard curves. The level of each gene transcript was normalized to β-actin expression levels. The samples were run in triplicate. The real time PCR primers and amplified size of each gene are as follows: for Dppa4, 5′-AGGAAGTCAGCACCACCGTAGT, 5′-AAGCAGGAAGAGGGCAATGGCT; for Oct-3/4, 5′-GTTGGAGAAGGTGGAACCAA, 5′-CCAAGGTGATCCTCTTCTGC; for Nanog, 5′-ATGCCTGCAGTTTTTCATCC, 5′-GAGGCAGGTCTTCAGAGGAA; for Rex-1, 5′-TGTCCTCAGGCTGGGTAGTC, 5′-TGATTTTCTGCCGTATGCAA; for Fgf5, 5′-ACAAGAGAGGGAAAGCCAAGAG, 5′-GAACAGTGACGGTGAAGGAAAG; for Nestin, 5′-GCAGGGTCTACAGAGTCAG, 5′-GCAAGCGAGAGTTCTCAG; for Brachyury (T), 5′-CAGCCCACCTACTGGCTCTA, 5′-GAGCCTCGAAAGAACTGAGC; for Goosecoid, 5′-CGGCACCGCACCATCT, 5′-TGGGTACTTCGTCTCCTGGAA; for Gata4, 5′-TCTCACTATGGGCACAGCAG, 5′-GCGATGTCTGAGTGACAGGA; for Foxa2, 5′-GGCCCAGTCACGAACAAAGC, 5′-CCCAAAGTCTCCACTCAGCCTC; and for β-actin, 5′-GCCAACCGTGAAAAGATGACC, 5′-GCGTGAGGGAGAGCATAGC. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed with PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The whole cell extract was centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on 13% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, the protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Little Chalfont, UK) at 200 mA for 1.5 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) and then probed with either rabbit anti-DPPA4 antibodies (1:3,000), mouse anti-β-actin antibodies (1:10,000; AC-74, Sigma), rabbit anti-histone H2A variant X (H2AX) antibodies (1:5,000; BL552, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), rabbit anti-HA antibodies (1:2,000; Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-tubulin-β antibodies (1:1,000; Ab-3, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), mouse anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibodies (1:2,000; C-2-10, BioVision, Mountain View, CA), mouse anti-heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) antibodies (1/2,000; 15.19S2, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or mouse anti-RNAPIIO-S2 antibodies (1:5,000; H5, Covance, Berkeley, CA). The membrane was washed with TTBS and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After washing with TTBS, the antigen-antibody complex was visualized by chemiluminescence with Immobilon Western (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Flow Cytometric Analysis—The cells were washed with PBS, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, added to PI solution (PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 20 μg/ml RNase A; Sigma), and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur HG (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data acquisition was performed with CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) software. Expression of Short Hairpin RNAs—To construct short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors, oligonucleotides targeting the coding region of Dppa4 and its mutated sequence were annealed and inserted into the BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). The shRNA was designed to target mouse Dppa4 mRNA at nucleotides 126-144 from the ATG codon. The oligonucleotides used were as follows: shRNA for Dppa4, 5′-GATCCCCGTCGGAGACAGATAATGGTTTCAAGAGAACCATTATCTGTCTCCGACTTTTTA and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGTCGGAGACAGATAATGGTTCTCTTGAAACCATTATCTGTCTCCGACGGG; mutated shRNA for Dppa4, 5′-GATCCCCGTCGGAGACAGAATTAGGTTTCAAGAGAACCTAATTCTGTCTCCGACTTTTTA and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGTCGGAGACAGAATTAGGTTCTCTTGAAACCTAATTCTGTCTCCGACGGG. The underlining indicates mutated nucleotides in the stem region of shRNA for Dppa4. A puromycin resistance gene expression unit in pCre-Pac (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) was excised with SalI and was inserted into the SalI site of the constructed shRNA expression vectors and mock vector. Each vector was transfected into ES cells with Lipofectamine 2000 with subsequent selection in the ES medium containing 3 μg/ml puromycin. Cell Fractionation—Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated essentially as described by Smith et al. (35Smith E.R. Smedberg J.L. Rula M.E. Xu X.X. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ES cells were washed with PBS, scraped into hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The lysate was homogenized with 50 strokes of a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 5 min at 380 × g. The resulting pellet was washed five times with hypotonic lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant was centrifuged twice at 380 × g to obtain the cytoplasmic fraction. The cytoplasmic fractions were further centrifuged at 14,500 × g to remove insoluble material. The protein was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Chromatin Fractionation—To isolate soluble and insoluble fractions, ES cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150-500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the soluble fraction was separated from the pellet by centrifugation at 22,500 × g for 20 min with additional centrifugation. The pellet (insoluble fraction) was washed with the Nonidet P-40 buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue), with subsequent sonication. Micrococcal Nuclease Digestion—Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion was performed according to Rose and Garrard (36Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Remboutsika et al. (37Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ES cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in N buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture) containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, washed with N buffer, and finally resuspended in 200 μl of N buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the ES cell nuclei were digested with 0.2, 1, or 5 units of MNase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) per 5 × 106 nuclei at 37 °C for 10 min. After the addition of EDTA to stop digestion, the digested nuclei were immediately placed on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was designated as the S1 fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 2 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitor mixture, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged again. The resultant supernatant and pellet were designated as the S2 and P fractions, respectively. These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. After treatment with Proteinase K (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight, DNA in the samples was extracted with phenol, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. Immunocytochemistry—ES cells were cultured on gelatin-coated glass slides. The cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10 min, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and blocked with PBS containing 2% goat serum for 1 h. Then the cells were incubated with either rabbit anti-HA antibodies (1:200), rabbit anti-DPPA4 antibodies (1:1,200), mouse anti-RNAPIIO-S2 antibodies (1:500), mouse anti-HP1α antibodies (1:200), mouse anti-histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4 tri-me) antibodies (1:200; ab1012, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or mouse anti-histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9 tri-me) antibodies (1;400; ab6001, Abcam) in 2% goat serum overnight and then with appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary goat antibodies. The nuclei were stained with Cellstain 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole solution (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Immunofluorescence images were photographed at x630 magnification under a laser scanning confocal microscopy LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Expression of Dppa4 Is Down-regulated in ES Cell Differentiation—First, to characterize how specifically Dppa4 is expressed in ES cells and during early differentiation, we explored the expression profile of Dppa4 in ES cell differentiation by qRT-PCR. ES cells robustly expressed transcripts of Dppa4, Oct-3/4, Nanog, and Rex-1 (Fig. 1A). When EBs formed from ES cells were cultured, these gene expression levels decreased (Fig. 1A). To examine DPPA4 expression at a protein level, we produced anti-DPPA4 polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic 14-amino acid peptide that partially overlaps the SAP domain (Fig. 1B). The open reading frame of the mouse Dppa4 cDNA encodes 296 amino acids with calculated molecular weight of 32,699 (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis with the anti-DPPA4 antibodies detected 42-kDa and 50-kDa bands in the ES cells (Fig. 1C). The 42-kDa band was detected in NIH3T3 cells transfected with mouse Dppa4 cDNA, but not in mock-transfected NIH3T3 cells, indicating that the 42- and 50-kDa bands represent DPPA4 and nonspecific bands, respectively (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis revealed that DPPA4 is down-regulated upon ES cell differentiation, similar to its mRNA expression (Fig. 1D). Dppa4 Overexpression Inhibits EB Differentiation and Proliferation—To study the role of expression of Dppa4 in ES cell differentiation, we generated mouse ES cell lines carrying a Tc-regulatable Dppa4 cDNA unit in the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 2A) (33Masui S. Shimosato D. Toyooka Y. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using both the exchange vector carrying Dppa4 cDNA and a Cre expression vector, the Dppa4 cDNA was stably introduced under the control of the Tc-regulatable promoter (hCMV*-1) between the loxP and loxPV sites in the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 2A). After correct integration of the Dppa4 cDNA into this locus, the expression of the Dppa4 can be suppressed by the addition of Tc. Upon withdrawal of Tc, the introduced Dppa4 and Venus, a green fluorescent protein variant, were expressed (Fig. 2A). Two days after the withdrawal of Tc, the ES cells increased expression of Dppa4 (Fig. 2B). Increased expression of DPPA4 and VENUS were also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C) and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2D), respectively, in the ES cells cultured in the absence of Tc. To study the effects of Dppa4 overexpression on ES cell fate, we formed EBs from the Dppa4-ES cell line by hanging drop culture for 2 days, subsequently culturing the EBs on gelatin-coated dishes in the presence and absence of Tc. In the presence of Tc (no induction of Dppa4 expression), decreased expression of Oct-3/4, Nanog, Rex-1, and Dppa4 (Fig. 2E), and increased expression of Fgf5, a primitive ectoderm marker, T, a mesoderm marker, and Gata4, a primitive endoderm marker (Fig. 2F) were detected during the EB culture as assessed by qRT-PCR. In the absence of Tc (induction of Dppa4 expression), the cultured EBs expressed Dppa4 at a high level (Fig. 2E). Dppa4 overexpression slightly blocked the down-regulation of Nanog and Rex-1 in the EBs compared with those cultured in the presence of Tc for 5 days (Fig. 2E). Expression of Fgf5 and T, but not Gata4, was significantly decreased in the Dppa4-overexpressing EBs (Fig. 2F). In addition, Dppa4 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation in EBs (Fig. 2G, panel b) compared with the normal EBs (Fig. 2G, panel a) on Day 5. Dppa4 Overexpression Inhibits ES Cell Differentiation toward a Mesodermal Lineage and Causes Cell Death—We next examined the effect of Dppa4 overexpression on ES cell differentiation in monolayer culture. In the presence of LIF, no morphological change was observed in"
https://openalex.org/W2162649886,"The human APOBEC3G protein is an innate anti-viral factor that can dominantly inhibit the replication of some endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. The prospects of purposefully harnessing such an anti-viral defense are under investigation. Here, long-term co-culture experiments were used to show that porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission from pig to human cells is reduced to nearly undetectable levels by expressing human APOBEC3G in virus-producing pig kidney cells. Inhibition occurred by a deamination-independent mechanism, likely after particle production but before the virus could immortalize by integration into human genomic DNA. PERV inhibition did not require the DNA cytosine deaminase activity of APOBEC3G and, correspondingly, APOBEC3G-attributable hypermutations were not detected. In contrast, over-expression of the sole endogenous APOBEC3 protein of pigs failed to interfere significantly with PERV transmission. Together, these data constitute the first proof-of-principle demonstration that APOBEC3 proteins can be used to fortify the innate anti-viral defenses of cells to prevent the zoonotic transmission of an endogenous retrovirus. These studies suggest that human APOBEC3G-transgenic pigs will provide safer, PERV-less xenotransplantation resources and that analogous cross-species APOBEC3-dependent restriction strategies may be useful for thwarting other endogenous as well as exogenous retrovirus infections."
https://openalex.org/W1982329916,"The entry of human immunodeficiency virus into target cells requires successive interactions of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. We previously demonstrated, by Förster resonance energy transfer experiments, the constitutive association of CD4 and CCR5 at the surface of living cells. We therefore speculated that this interaction may correlate with compartmentalization of CD4 and CCR5 within the plasma membrane. Here, we characterize the lateral distribution, the dynamics, and the stoichiometry of these receptors in living cells stably expressing CD4 and/or CCR5 by means of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching at variable radii experiments. We found that (i) these receptors expressed alone are confined into 1-μm-sized domains, (ii) CD4-CCR5 associations occur outside and inside smaller domains, and (iii) these interactions involve multiple CCR5 molecules per CD4.

Current models suggest an initial interaction between the trimeric viral envelope protein gp120 and the primary CD4 receptor on target cells. This results in a conformational change of gp120 that exposes a co-receptor binding site. After binding to the co-receptor molecule, either CXCR4 or CCR5 depending on virus tropism, additional structural changes take place, allowing the viral gp41 protein to initiate the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. This last step leads to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the target cell (for a review, see Ref. 1Doms R.W. Virology. 2000; 276: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A more efficient co-immunoprecipitation of CD4 with CCR5 compared with CXCR4 supports the existence of preferential interactions between CCR5 and CD4 (2Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which could be at the origin of the predominance of R5-tropic HIV. In addition, a multiplicity of interactions are involved, since the attachment of several gp120 envelope trimers to multiple CD4 (3Layne S.P. Merges M.J. Dembo M. Spouge J.L. Nara P.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and to multiple CCR5 co-receptors (4Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) seems to be needed for infection to proceed (5Sougrat R. Bartesaghi A. Lifson J.D. Bennett A.E. Bess J.W. Zabransky D.J. Subramaniam S. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the fusion process involves the encounter and interaction of multiple receptors at the plasma membrane. A compartmentalization of the partners could favor this step of the infection. The virus may take advantage of a clustering to rapidly form multivalent interactions with the receptors and co-receptors required for fusion. The heterogeneous patchiness of the membrane can account for such an organization. Indeed, the current view of the plasma membrane is a “dynamically structured mosaic model” (6Vereb G. Szollosi J. Matko J. Nagy P. Farkas T. Vigh L. Matyus L. Waldmann T.A. Damjanovich S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence is accumulating that compartmentalization of membrane components could be essential for the regulation of cellular functions (7Marguet D. Lenne P.F. Rigneault H. He H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3446-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the case of CD4 and CCR5, several results suggest the existence of such a compartmentalization. First, electron microscopy observations show that CCR5, CXCR4, and CD4 form homogeneous microclusters at the surface of primary macrophages and T cells (9Singer I.I. Scott S. Kawka D.W. Chin J.

Second, our recent study carried out using a steady state Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach, at the surface of living cells, demonstrated the constitutive interaction of CD4 and CCR5, reinforced by gp120. This finding indicated that a ternary complex between gp120, CD4, and CCR5 would form before the fusion process occurred (10Gaibelet G. Planchenault T. Mazeres S. Dumas F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lopez A. Lagane B. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37921-37929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the successive interactions leading to the virus attachment is an important point of this process; the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 must take place within the lifetime of the gp120-CD4 bound. Due to the short lifetime of this interaction (11Chang M.I. Panorchan P. Dobrowsky T.M. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14748-14755Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), CD4 and CCR5 must encounter very fast. This condition can be fulfilled by either a rapid diffusion or a close localization of the receptors at the membrane. Currently, data on dynamic and membrane organization of receptors are still incomplete, and a thorough analysis of the dynamic behavior of the HIV co-receptors within the membrane is needed for a better understanding of the early steps of the infection process. To investigate the diffusion behavior of CD4 and CCR5 in the membrane of living HEK293T cells, we exploited vrFRAP, a powerful approach used to identify and characterize membrane domains (12Cezanne L.

We show further evidence for a specific interaction between CD4 and CCR5 receptors at the basal state and demonstrate that these interactions involved several CCR5 per CD4. Finally, for the first time, we highlight the dynamics of this prefusion complex within the membrane of living cells. Chemicals—sCD4 and gp120 were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program catalog of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). The fluorescent lipid didodecylphosphatidylethanolamine-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl (dC12-PE-NBD) was synthesized as previously described (14Monti J.A. Christian S.T. Shaw W.A. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 222-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tagged and Wild-type CD4 and CCR5 cDNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding wild-type CD4 and CCR5 receptors were inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA 3.1 hygro between the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites. The cDNAs encoding the tagged receptors with the T7 tag at the N terminus and eGFP at the C terminus (10Gaibelet G. Planchenault T. Mazeres S. Dumas F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lopez A. Lagane B.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5227-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were inserted into pRC/CMV expression vectors (Invitrogen) between the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites. The following plasmids were obtained: pcDNA 3.1 hygro/wtCCR5, pcDNA 3.1 hygro/wtCD4, pRC/CMV-SP/α7AChR-T7-CCR5-eGFP, and pRC/CMV-SP/α7AChR-T7-CD4-eGFP. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/strepto-mycin (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The tagged receptors were expressed in these cells by transfection of plasmid (concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2 μg) using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method. For the vrFRAP experiments, cells were plated onto 22 × 22-mm2 coverslips precoated with polylysine (Poly-L-Lysine; Sigma) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in a 100 μg/ml aqueous solution. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+-Mg2+, and the coverslip was placed in a homemade chamber filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (12Cezanne L. Lecat S. Lagane B.

FRAP measurements were acquired on the apical pole of the cell. Cell Line Selection—Monoclonal cell lines were sorted using flow cytometry (FACSTARPLUS cytometer, Epics Altra flow cytometer; BD Biosciences). Initially, the cells expressing eGFP-tagged receptors having an eGFP fluorescence level compatible with vrFRAP measurements were selected. A further selection of the cells expressing the wild-type counterpart receptors was performed by means of labeling with phycoerythrin (PhE)-conjugated anti-CCR5 2D7 or anti-CD4 SK3 monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences). Functional Analysis of Chimeric Receptors—HIV-1 infection tests of cells expressing the chimeric receptors were carried out by inoculations of cells with pseudotyped cell-free virions generated by trans-complementation of a luciferase reporter HIV-1 provirus (Env-) with an R5-HIV-1 BaL Env as described in Ref. 15Percherancier Y.

Cell Membrane Labeling by dC12-PE-NBD Lipid Probes—0.4 μmol of dC12-PE-NBD were taken from a chloroform/methanol (9:1) mix. Solvents were removed under vacuum. The lipid solution was then dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol, and the mix was injected with a syringe (Hamilton, Switzerland) in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+-Mg2+. The final lipid concentration was 40 μm. Cells were incubated with the lipid for 15 min at 20 °C and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+-Mg2+ before carrying out the vrFRAP experiments. Experimental vrFRAP Measurements—Fluorescence recovery curves were measured at 20 °C in order to minimize eventual internalization of tagged receptors using a homemade device (12Cezanne L. Lecat S. Lagane B. Millot C. Vollmer J.Y. Matthes H. Galzi J.L. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45057-45067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The bleaching times were set between 20 and 40 ms, and the recovery was recorded over 20 s with a sampling rate of 2 ms. The radius of the observation area (R) was varied between 1.40 and 3.45 μm. For each experimental condition tested, more than 30 fluorescence recoveries were accumulated on different cells. These series of experiments were carried out at least in triplicate, and all curves set were averaged. The diffusion coefficient (D) and the mobile fraction (M) were estimated with a confidence interval of 95% by fitting the data with the suitable diffusion equation (16Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), assuming either one or two diffusing populations of tracers. Conceptual Background of the vrFRAP Data Analysis—vrFRAP is a powerful approach for studying membrane dynamic organization. Monte Carlo simulations and experiments on a model of compartmentalized membranes showed that the analyses of the variation of M and D with R allow one to characterize membrane compartmentalization (17Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as follows. (i) In the absence of domains, M and D are independent of R, and the measured diffusion coefficient corresponds to the real one. (ii) If the membrane is compartmentalized, then M and D are dependent on R. For a domain size L < R, the following relationship is expected, M=Mp+0.63L/R(Eq. 1) where MP is the permanent mobile fraction. For domain sizes L > R, the mobile fraction reaches a limit value called MI. MI can be roughly estimated by the value of the mobile fraction at R ∼ L (see Fig. 1). Depending on the MP value, two cases can be considered. (i) If MP ≈ 0, there is a single population of tracers confined in closed domains. The measured diffusion coefficient is an apparent one (Dapp), and the real diffusion coefficient inside the domains Dconf can be evaluated from Equation 2. Dconf=1/2Dapp(L/R)2(Eq. 2) The analysis must be validated by verifying that Dconf is invariant with R. (ii) If MP > 0, the tracers are either inside joined but open domains or distributed inside and outside of isolated domains. An analysis of the recovery curves assuming two populations of tracers is necessary, which leads to the determination of the weight and diffusion coefficient of each population. One has a measured diffusion coefficient varying according to Equation 2 and corresponds to confined tracers with Dconf. The second has a diffusion coefficient Dfree invariant with R and corresponds to tracers with a long range free diffusion. If Dfree > Dconf, domains are isolated with a long range diffusion taking place around them. Note that, for relevance of the two-diffusion coefficient analysis, the weight of the free diffusion population should be in the same range as MP. All of the vrFRAP data have been analyzed following this procedure. Functional Characterization of Stable Cell Lines—Four stable monoclonal cell lines were established to study the dynamics and confinement of CD4-eGFP and CCR5-eGFP receptors expressed alone or with their unlabeled counterparts. We first generated and sorted two cell lines expressing either CD4-eGFP or CCR5-eGFP. Further stable expression of wild-type CCR5 or CD4 (wtCCR5 or wtCD4, respectively) counterpart was generated, leading to two additional cell lines. The membrane expression of the receptors was verified by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2 shows that cells exhibited a homogeneous receptor distribution at the plasma membrane and that the fluorescence intensity originating from the intracellular compartments was negligible (<5%). For each stable cell line, with anti-CCR5 and anti-CD4 antibodies conjugated to phycoerythrin (1 mol of PhE/mol of IgG), the ratios between eGFP-tagged receptors and their wild-type counterparts were determined. Antibody solutions of equivalent concentrations were prepared based on absorbance and fluorescence measurements. Saturation curves were obtained by adding increasing amounts of antibody suspensions to cell solutions (Fig. 3). Fluorescence intensities were measured by flow cytometry. In both the CD4-eGFP + wtCCR5 and CCR5-eGFP + wtCD4 cell lines, the receptor/co-receptor ratio was about 1.FIGURE 3CD4 (○) and CCR5 (□) cell surface titration using CD4-PHE and CCR5-PHE conformational antibodies. A, the cell line expressing CD4-eGFP + wtCCR5. B, the cell line expressing wtCD4 + CCR5-eGFP. Fluorescence intensities have been determined by flow cytometry with the same setup; each point corresponds to the mean of the fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells. Nonspecific binding of CD4-PhE (•) and CCR5-PhE (▪) antibodies has been determined on parental HEK293T cells. After nonspecific binding correction, we determined that both cell lines present a CD4/CCR5 ratio of 1 ± 0.2. u.a., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functionality of the tagged receptors was previously checked (10Gaibelet G.

However, we ensured that the monoclonal cell lines sorted presented correctly folded and fully functional proteins. Fig. 4 presents the results of HIV-1 infection tests. Similar levels of viral replication were measured both in CD4-eGFP + wtCCR5 and CCR5-eGFP + wtCD4 cell lines. Furthermore, we observed a strong decrease of virus entry and replication by TAK779, a CCR5-specific ligand. Thus, neither the T7 tag at the N terminus nor the eGFP at the C terminus of the receptors hindered the induction of virus infection. Since a modification in its composition could influence the membrane organization, we verified that the protein, lipid, and cholesterol contents of each cell line were unchanged compared with the wild-type cells (data not shown). Furthermore, to verify that the ectopic expression of receptors had no effect on the membrane dynamic structure, we measured the diffusion of fluorescent lipids (dC12-PE-NBD) by vrFRAP experiments. Quite similarly for the wild-type and transfected cell lines, lipids were found to have a long range free diffusion with a diffusion coefficient D = 1.8 ± 0.5 μm2/s. An immobile fraction of 30 ± 5% was also observed, consistent with the results of previous studies on HEK239T cells (12Cezanne L. Lecat S. Lagane B. Millot C. Vollmer J.Y. Matthes H. Galzi J.L. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45057-45067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Diffusion of the Receptors Expressed Alone—Prior to studying the behavior of proteins in the presence of their counterpart, we first analyzed the dynamic of the receptors expressed alone. Fig. 5 shows that, when expressed alone, CD4-eGFP and CCR5-eGFP receptors presented similar diffusion characteristics. In both cases, the mobile fraction M increased linearly with the bleached area radius up to R ∼ L, indicating a receptor confinement into 1-μm-sized domains. By performing a two-population analysis and correlated with the low values of MP, we concluded that for both receptors, only one diffusing population was present. CD4-eGFP receptors were confined into domains with a mean radius of 1.7 μm with Dconf = 0.52 μm2/s, and CCR5-eGFP co-receptors were confined into domains of about 1.6 μm with Dconf = 0.45 μm2/s (Table 1). The immobile fractions were found equal to 30 and 40%, respectively.TABLE 1Lateral diffusion parameters of CD4-eGFP and CCR5-eGFP receptorsExperimental conditionNDomain sizeDconfDfreeDfreeMP100-MIμmμm2/sμm2/s%CD4-eGFP4401.7 ± 0.40.52 ± 0.29NAaNA, nonapplicable because of the absence of a long range diffusing population.NA10 ± 7∼40b100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the smallest radius (1.4 μm).CD4-eGFP + wtCCR53201.6 ± 0.40.45 ± 0.29NANA17 ± 10∼40b100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the smallest radius (1.4 μm).CCR5-eGFP4001.5 ± 0.30.45 ± 0.17NANA15 ± 5∼30b100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the smallest radius (1.4 μm).CCR5-eGFP + wtCD42800.34 ± 0.050.07 ± 0.100.40 ± 0.04∼5051 ± 2∼10c100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the extrapolation of the radius to R → 0.CCR5-eGFP + wtCD4 + sCD41001.1 ± 0.20.30 ± 0.14NANA18 ± 6∼30b100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the smallest radius (1.4 μm).CCR5-eGFP + wtCD4 + gp120dThe measurements for this condition are corrected according to the test condition of the day.1600.25 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.100.40 ± 0.04∼5058 ± 3∼10c100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the extrapolation of the radius to R → 0.a NA, nonapplicable because of the absence of a long range diffusing population.b 100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the smallest radius (1.4 μm).c 100-MI is the immobile fraction determined at the extrapolation of the radius to R → 0.d The measurements for this condition are corrected according to the test condition of the day. Open table in a new tab Diffusion of the Receptors Expressed in the Presence of Their Counterparts—In order to study the influence of the wild-type counterparts on the dynamics of the tagged receptors, we performed vrFRAP experiments on CD4-eGFP + wtCCR5 and CCR5-eGFP + wtCD4 cell lines. Interestingly, two distinct types of behavior were observed, depending on the receptor studied. Within the experimental error, we obtained similar results for the CD4-eGFP + wtCCR5 receptors and CD4-eGFP alone (Fig. 5A and Table 1). In both cases, there was only one diffusing population (Mp ≈ 0), and the domain size, the diffusion coefficients, and the immobile fraction varied less than 10%. On the contrary, the behavior of CCR5-eGFP expressed alone was markedly modified by the presence of wtCD4 (Fig. 5B). Indeed, in the presence of wtCD4, two CCR5-eGFP diffusing populations were observed. The MP increased to about 50%, in total agreement with the weight of the long range diffusion population. This population had a long range diffusion coefficient Dfree = 0.4 μm2/s. A second population of CCR5-eGFP receptors remained confined in domains, but the presence of wtCD4 led to different diffusion parameters. The domain size decreased from 1.5 to 0.34 μm, and Dconf decreased from 0.45 to 0.07 μm2/s (Table 1). Meanwhile, the immobile fraction, 100-MI, was decreased to a value of about 10%. Effects of sCD4 and gp120 on the Dynamics and Lateral Organization of the Receptors—Our previous FRET experiments illustrated a disruption of the interactions between CD4 and CCR5 by the soluble part of CD4 (sCD4), whereas the viral gp120 protein strengthened the interaction (10Gaibelet G. Planchenault T. Mazeres S. Dumas F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lopez A. Lagane B. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37921-37929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In order to further investigate their influence, we have performed vrFRAP experiments in the presence of saturating concentrations (100 nm) (18Doranz B.J. Baik S.S. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10346-10358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of each of these molecules. None of these proteins induced a change of the diffusion parameters of CD4-eGFP either expressed alone or in the presence of wtCCR5 (data not shown). Likewise, no effect was detected on CCR5-eGFP expressed alone, but significant changes were observed in the presence of wtCD4. Indeed, after the addition of sCD4, the population of receptors with a long range diffusion disappeared, and the immobile fraction recovered to a value of 30%. Furthermore, a 3-fold increase of the domain size and a 4-fold increase of the diffusion coefficient of the confined receptors were observed (Table 1). This indicates that sCD4 disrupted CCR5-eGFP/wtCD4 interactions, rendering CCR5-eGFP behavior similar to when the protein was expressed alone. However, the addition of the viral protein gp120 was not accompanied by significant modifications of the dynamics or the organization of receptors (only moderate changes of the diffusion parameters of confined CCR5 receptors were observed with wtCD4). The 20% decrease of the domain size and the absence of significant difference of the diffusion coefficient are consistent with a slight reinforcement of the interactions between CCR5-eGFP and wtCD4 by gp120. Conversely, no change on the diffusion behavior of CD4 was observed when gp120 was added to the CD4-eGFP + wtCCR5 cell line. Viral entry mediated by the HIV-1 Env protein is a highly cooperative process that requires the presence of several receptors and coreceptors (3Layne S.P. Merges M.J. Dembo M. Spouge J.L. Nara P.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 4Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the interaction and the dynamic of these molecules in order to have a better comprehension of the early events driving virus attachment to the host cell membrane. Diffusion Behavior of CD4-eGFP and CCR5-eGFP Proteins Expressed Alone—The dynamic organizations of the receptors expressed alone were overall quite similar. First, our data suggest that a subset (about 30-40%) of CD4-eGFP and CCR5-eGFP receptors were immobile. This observation corroborates that of Steffens and Hope (19Steffens C.M. Hope T.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), who reported the existence of a similar immobile fraction for CD4 and CCR5. Since it was also reported in another work (20Foti M. Phelouzat M.A. Holm A. Rasmusson B.J. Carpentier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the immobilization of a fraction of the CD4 receptors appears to be quite general. This could be attributed to interaction of this receptor with the cytoskeleton (20Foti M. Phelouzat M.A. Holm A. Rasmusson B.J. Carpentier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The analysis of our vrFRAP experiments showed that both receptors exhibit a single population having a diffusion restricted into 1-μm-sized domains. Whether the receptors expressed alone are in a monomeric state or not can be further deduced from our results. Since CD4 homo-oligomerization has been shown to occur via extracellular domains (23Li S. Satoh T. Korngold R. Huang Z. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 455-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the absence of change in the dynamics of CD4-eGFP expressed alone following the addition of sCD4 suggests that CD4 receptors are in a monomeric form. HEK293T cells being not lymphoid cells, they can be expected to express monomeric CD4 receptors. As a matter of fact, HEK293T cells compare more closely with resting T-cells, where CD4 is predominantly found as monomers, while the dimer expression increases markedly after T-cell stimulation (22Lynch G.W. Sloane A.J. Raso V. Lai A. Cunningham A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2590-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consequently, the comparison between the diffusion coefficients of CD4 and CCR5 permits us to deduce that CCR5 is also probably in a monomeric state. The diffusion coefficient inside the domains of CCR5 appears to be slightly smaller by a factor of ∼0.8 than that of CD4. Considering the respective sizes of the receptors (7 helices and 1 helix for CCR5 and CD4, respectively), this difference is in agreement with the value expected from the relationship between the size of a membrane protein and the lateral diffusion coefficient established by Saffman and Delbrück (21Saffman P.G. Delbrück M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3111-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Diffusion Characteristics of Receptors Expressed in the Presence of Their Wild-type Counterpart—Although no effect of the co-expression of wtCCR5 on the CD4-eGFP diffusion behavior was detectable, wtCD4 expression strongly modified the dynamic organization of CCR5-eGFP. We suggest that a constitutive interaction between both receptors occurs, inducing a change in the receptor membrane dynamics. We propose that this cannot be evidenced by the analysis of CD4-eGFP diffusion, presumably due to the involvement of several CCR5 per CD4 in the interaction (this point will be developed further below). The modifications of CCR5 receptor behavior in presence of wtCD4 are 2-fold. On one hand, confined CCR5-eGFP receptors have a diffusion restricted to smaller domains than those observed with CCR5-eGFP alone, and they have a decreased diffusion coefficient inside these domains. This is consistent with a CD4-CCR5 interaction inside these domains. On the other hand, wtCD4 counterpart expression induces the emergence of an additional mobile population with a long range free diffusion. The diffusion coefficient Dfree obtained for this second population is more rapid than the diffusion coefficient Dconf obtained for confined receptors. Thus, according to the vrFRAP data analysis procedure explained above, we could characterize these domains as isolated. The confined receptors diffuse inside the domains, and the free receptors diffuse around them. Finally, the CCR5-eGFP expressed alone presents an immobile fraction, about 30% of which tends to vanish in the presence of its wtCD4 counterpart. This supports further the existence of a basal interaction between CD4 and CCR5. Effect of sCD4 and gp120 on the Dynamics and the Lateral Organization of Receptors—First, we investigated the influence of sCD4 on CCR5 and CD4 dynamic behavior. sCD4 has been previously shown to interact with CCR5 expressed alone (24Platt E.J. Kuhmann S.E. Rose P.P. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12266-12278Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) via its extracellular domain (10Gaibelet G. Planchenault T. Mazeres S. Dumas F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lopez A. Lagane B. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37921-37929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, unlike wtCD4, sCD4 does not modify the dynamics of CCR5. The transmembrane domain of CCR5 seems thus be the major limiting factor of its diffusion. Indeed, in the absence of a dense glycocalix (data not shown), the extracellular domains of a transmembrane protein are in an aqueous medium and thus not expected to affect the diffusion, which tends to be rather dominated by the high viscosity of the membrane (21Saffman P.G. Delbrück M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3111-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). The addition of sCD4 to the CCR5-eGFP + wtCD4 cell line strongly affected CCR5-eGFP dynamics, which became similar to the dynamic behavior of the receptor expressed alone. Thus, the interaction of sCD4 with CCR5 fully reversed the effect induced by wtCD4 expression, suggesting that sCD4 probably competes with wtCD4 for binding to CCR5. These results confirm the previous work, suggesting a constitutive interaction of CCR5 with CD4 (2Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Gaibelet G. Planchenault T. Mazeres S. Dumas F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lopez A. Lagane B. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37921-37929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we provide evidence here that CCR5 associated with CD4 has a dynamic organization different from that of CCR5 alone. We then investigated the influence of the gp120 viral protein on CD4-CCR5 interaction. Previously, we have shown by FRET that the viral gp120 protein strengthens CD4-CCR5 interactions (10Gaibelet G. Planchenault T. Mazeres S. Dumas F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lopez A. Lagane B. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37921-37929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This observed increase of FRET could have resulted either from a closer proximity of donors and acceptors or from a rise in the number of interacting receptors. In our vrFRAP experiments, the absence of change in the respective weights of the two populations is in favor of the first hypothesis; CD4-CCR5 interaction was maximal in the basal state, and the addition of gp120 brings closer the two receptors. Stoichiometry of CD4-CCR5 Interaction—vrFRAP measures the average dynamic of diffusing molecules, and different populations can only be distinguished if they represent more than 10-15% of tracers. On one hand, our experiments demonstrate that wtCD4 interacts with CCR5-eGFP, modifying its lateral organization within the membrane. On the other hand, the expression of wtCCR5 does not induce any detectable change in the dynamics of CD4-eGFP, even in the presence of gp120. The most straightforward explanation of this discrepancy is that less than 15% of CD4 are involved in a CD4-CCR5 interaction. Since the two receptors are expressed in a 1:1 molar ratio, one CD4 protein must be interacting with multiple CCR5 proteins. A rough estimation gives a ratio of 1 CD4 molecule interacting with at least 5 CCR5, consistent with data indicating that the assembly of 4-6 CCR5 around the virus is required for infection (4Kuhmann S.E.

In addition, according to the suggested preferential use by HIV of monomeric CD4 to gain entry into target cells (25Bourgeois R. Mercier J. Paquette-Brooks I. Cohen E.A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the receptors probably form complexes composed of multiple CCR5 for a single CD4. Dynamics of Receptors and Kinetics of Interactions—Since the conformational changes of gp120 induced by the binding of CD4 are reversible (18Doranz B.J. Baik S.S. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10346-10358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the gp120-CD4 complex must encounter CCR5 before gp120 dissociates from CD4. The lifetime of the CD4-gp120 interaction has been recently determined to be equal to about 0.2 s (11Chang M.I. Panorchan P. Dobrowsky T.M. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14748-14755Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on the value of the diffusion coefficient of CD4-eGFP, the largest area that the CD4-gp120 complex can explore within this time is 0.1 μm2. Assuming that T cells have a radius of ∼5.5 μm and express 10,000 CCR5 receptors homogeneously distributed at the cell surface (26Desmetz C. Lin Y.L. Mettling C. Portales P. Rabesandratana H. Clot J. Corbeau P. Immunology. 2006; 119: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the CD4-gp120 complex would thus be likely to encounter only one CCR5 before disrupting. This would not allow infection to occur and reinforces our proposition that the receptors are compartmentalized within the membrane. Conclusions—A microcompartmentalization of CD4 and CCR5 receptors into domains of ∼350 nm was demonstrated by our vrFRAP analysis of the diffusion of the receptors at the surface of living cells. As demonstrated by the comparison with the behavior of the receptors expressed alone, this domain organization results from constitutive interactions between CD4 and CCR5. Moreover, we could establish the specificity of these interactions and determine their stoichiometry of about 1 CD4 for 5 CCR5. Therefore, an organization of the HIV co-receptors precedes the attachment of the virus at the cell surface that allows the accomplishment of the infection process. Indeed, the compartmentalization of CD4 would favor the binding of the virus to multiple CD4 (3Layne S.P. Merges M.J. Dembo M. Spouge J.L. Nara P.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Sougrat R. Bartesaghi A. Lifson J.D. Bennett A.E. Bess J.W. Zabransky D.J. Subramaniam S. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the stoichiometry of the CD4/CCR5 interaction would facilitate the subsequent multiple interactions with CCR5 (4Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, the vrFRAP approach provided valuable information for unraveling the mechanisms of the early step of infection. While being consistent with our previous FRET study, we could here go one step further in the description of the dynamic organization of the receptors. Now the understanding of the origin and regulation mode of the compartmentalization remain challenging issues that single particle tracking experiments, currently under progress in our laboratory, should enable us to take up.

https://openalex.org/W1968300166,"The neuronal cortical network generates slow (<1 Hz) spontaneous rhythmic activity that emerges from the recurrent connectivity. This activity occurs during slow wave sleep or anesthesia and also in cortical slices, consisting of alternating up (active, depolarized) and down (silent, hyperpolarized) states. The search for the underlying mechanisms and the possibility of analyzing network dynamics in vitro has been subject of numerous studies. This exposes the need for a detailed quantitative analysis of the membrane fluctuating behavior and computerized tools to automatically characterize the occurrence of up and down states.Intracellular recordings from different areas of the cerebral cortex were obtained from both in vitro and in vivo preparations during slow oscillations. A method that separates up and down states recorded intracellularly is defined and analyzed here. The method exploits the crossover of moving averages, such that transitions between up and down membrane regimes can be anticipated based on recent and past voltage dynamics. We demonstrate experimentally the utility and performance of this method both offline and online, the online use allowing to trigger stimulation or other events in the desired period of the rhythm. This technique is compared with a histogram-based approach that separates the states by establishing one or two discriminating membrane potential levels. The robustness of the method presented here is tested on data that departs from highly regular alternating up and down states.We define a simple method to detect cortical states that can be applied in real time for offline processing of large amounts of recorded data on conventional computers. Also, the online detection of up and down states will facilitate the study of cortical dynamics. An open-source MATLAB toolbox, and Spike 2-compatible version are made freely available."

Levels of these metabolites reflect cellular LOX activity. 293 EcR cells expressing 15-, 12-, and 5-LOX enzymes were incubated 37 °C for 30 min with 60 μm AA, 60 μm AA plus 10 μm NDGA, 60 μm AA plus 3 μm baicalein, or vehicle. Cell culture media was removed and diluted 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:50 in 0.05 m pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (PBS) for analysis according to the protocol supplied with the enzyme immunoassay kits. Results are the mean ± S.E., n = 3–4. Oxidation of Prx to PrxSO3 in Cells Treated with Phospholipase A2—293 EcR cells expressing 15-LOX-1 or 12-LOX were incubated for 30, 60, and 90 min in 1% v/v FCS and DMEM with 20 units/ml pancreatic PLA2, to determine whether metabolism of endogenous fatty acids released from cellular phospholipids leads to PrxSO3 formation. Cells were also incubated for 60 min with 60 μm AA to compare PrxSO3 formation via oxidation of endogenous, versus exogenous fatty acids. Cells were lysed at times specified; PrxSO3 and Prx1 were determined by Western blotting. Oxidation of Prx to PrxSO3 in Human Cells That Constitutively Express LOX—Undifferentiated HL-60 human leukemia cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI medium, 10% FCS with 2 mm glutamine. Human platelets were suspended in Ca+2 free 1% v/v FCS and DMEM. HL-60 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) constitutively express 5-LOX and human platelets (6 × 107 cells/ml) constitutively express 12-LOX. Cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min, 37 °C in 1% v/v FCS and DMEM with 0 or 30 μm AA. Cells were lysed, and 5-LOX, 12-LOX, PrxSO3, and Prx1 were determined by Western blotting. Detection of Prx Oxidation by Alkylation with Biotin-conjugated Maleimide—We adapted an independent method (28Kwon J. Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Ahn Y. Kim Y.J. Stadtman E.R. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16419-16424Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) to determine whether and which, 2-Cys-Prx were co-oxidized during LOX catalysis. Briefly, 293 EcR cells expressing 15-LOX-1 were incubated for 30 min with vehicle or 60 μm AA in 1% FCS 1× DMEM. In step 1, cells were washed, lysed, frozen, and reacted under vacuum for 1 h at 25°C with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 10 mm iodoacetic acid in 1 ml of O2-depleted 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysate was mixed in 1% SDS for 2 h at 25°Cinthe dark. In step 2 proteins were precipitated with 10% v/v trichloroacetic acid for 1 h, 4 °C. The protein precipitate was washed twice with acetone, then dissolved and reduced for 0.5 h at 50 °C with 4 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1 ml of O2-free 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, and 2% v/v SDS. In step 3 the reduced proteins in the sample were reacted for 0.5 h at 50 °C with 1 mm biotin conjugated to polyethylene oxide-maleimide in 0.9 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were precipitated in 10% v/v trichloroacetic acid; precipitate was dissolved in 0.3 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, and 2% v/v SDS. The sample was then diluted with 0.3 ml of buffer without SDS. A portion of sample containing 200-μg protein was added to 100 μl of immobilized Neutr-Avidin in PBS 0.1% Tween (1.0-ml final volume). Samples were rotated for 1 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged, and NeutrAvidin beads were washed 2× with PBS/0.1% Tween. Laemmli loading buffer (50 μl) with 5% β-mercapto ethanol was added to the beads, boiled for 10 min to release biotinylated proteins, and then fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blot analysis. The membrane was probed with an anti-Prx1, 2, 3, and 4 antibodies. Two-dimensional PAGE Analysis—293 EcR cells expressing 15-LOX-1 were treated with AA as described above to oxidize Prx to PrxSO3. We used a modified method to prepare protein samples for two-dimensional PAGE (9Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼1 × 106) were washed once in PBS and lysed in two-dimensional lysis buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris (pH 8.4) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) by sonication (2 × 15 s at 4 °C). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentration was determined using a fluorometric method (Quant-iT kit, Invitrogen). Immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10 non-linear) (Invitrogen) were soaked for 75 min in rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) carrier ampholyte solution (Invitrogen), and 0.005% bromphenol blue) containing sample (5 μg protein). A ZOOM IPGRunner System (Invitrogen) was used to perform isoelectric focusing (∼2800 V-h). The pH strips were equilibrated for second dimension SDS-PAGE according to the manufacture's protocol, which were then run on ZOOM Tris/glycine 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to be visualized by immunoblot with anti-Prx1, 2, 3, and 4 antibodies. Western Immunoblot—Proteins were measured using mouse anti-5-LOX (1:500), rabbit anti-platelet 12-LOX (1:1000), rabbit anti-15-LOX (1:1000), rabbit anti-COX-2 (1: 450), rabbit anti-Prx1, 2, 3, or 4 (1:2000), and rabbit anti-PrxSO3 (1:2000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000). Chemiluminescent protein-antibody complexes were quantified with a Kodak Image Station 440™. The ratio of PrxSO3/Prx1 was calculated from the image density. PrxSO3/Prx1 ratios were expressed in arbitrary units. Bar graphs depict the mean ± S.E., for n = 3–6 separate experiments. Statistics—Statistical significance at 95% confidence was determined by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc test. Oxidation of 2-Cys Prx to PrxSO3 by Cellular LOX and COX-2 Catalysis—Immunoblots with isoform specific anti-Prx antibodies show that 293 EcR cells constitutively expressed Prx1, 2, 3, and 4; their levels did not change because of the treatment with ponasterone or AA (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). The panels for Prx1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 1A represent the chemiluminescence signal at different exposure times for each separate Prx isoform, whose relative expression varies. Separate experiments showed that these proportions were approximately 30% Prx1, 10% Prx2, 60% Prx3, and 2% Prx4. 15-LOX-1 protein was induced in 293 EcR cells treated with ponasterone, as expected (27Yu M.K. Moos P.J. Cassidy P. Wade M. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28028-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Prx was oxidized to PrxSO3 during 15-LOX-1 catalysis. Quantification of PrxSO3 is simplified by the fact that it migrates as a single band on 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Likewise, approximately 26.5-kDa Prx1, 24-kDa Prx2, 27-kDa Prx3, and 28-kDa Prx4 all migrate closely and are not fully resolved on a 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Prx1 was used as a loading control to normalize quantitation of PrxSO3. Results were comparable if PrxSO3 levels were normalized against tubulin, Prx2, or Prx3. The PrxSO3/Prx1 ratio rose 7–8-fold when 293 EcR cells expressing wild type 15-LOX-1 were treated with 60 μm AA (Fig. 1A, lane 2). This increase was significant (Fig. 1A, bar graph, p < 0.05) compared with cells treated with vehicle (lanes 1 and 3) or to cells expressing mutant, inactive Δile662 15-LOX-1 (Fig. 1B). The LOX inhibitors, NDGA and baicalein, each blocked PrxSO3 formation with IC50 ∼ 10 and 3 μm, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–10). Cells expressing mutant Δile662 15-LOX-1 had undetectable levels of 15-HETE in their medium (<0.10 ng/ml), consistent with the loss of its catalytic function. Results were similar in 293 EcR cells expressing 12-LOX or 5-LOX. The PrxSO3/Prx1 ratio rose 6–9-fold when cells with 12-LOX were treated with 60 μm AA, compared with vehicle or cells not expressing 12-LOX (p < 0.05; Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). NDGA and baicalein each inhibited PrxSO3 formation by 12-LOX catalysis, with IC50 ∼ 5 and 3 μm, respectively (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–10). The PrxSO3/Prx1 ratio rose 5–12-fold in cells expressing 5-LOX treated with AA, compared with vehicle or control cells not expressing 5-LOX (p < 0.05; Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). NDGA and baicalein inhibited PrxSO3 formation by 5-LOX catalysis with IC50 ∼ 5 and 6 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–10). We verified that NDGA and baicalein inhibited 15-LOX, 12-LOX, and 5-LOX activity induced by ponasterone in 293 EcR cells (Table 1).TABLE 1NDGA and baicalein inhibit cellular lipoxygenase activityTreatment15-LOX Activity 15(S)-HETE12-LOX Activity 12(S)-HETE5-LOX Activity LTB4ng/mlng/mlng/ml60 μm AA120.0 ± 6.185.8 ± 9.18.3 ± 0.160 μm AA plus16.0 ± 4.35.8 ± 0.40.210 μm NDGA(87 ± 4% inhibition)ap < 0.01.(93 ± 1% inhibition)ap < 0.01.(98% inhibition)60 μm AA plus65.7 ± 25.641.8 ± 10.93.23 μm baicalein(45 ± 21% inhibition)bp < 0.05.(51 ± 13% inhibition)bp < 0.05.(61% inhibition)Vehicle0.4 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.70.7 ± 0.05a p < 0.01.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab The PrxSO3/Prx1 ratio rose 2–4-fold when cells expressing COX-2 were treated with 60 μm AA, compared with vehicle or cells that did not express COX-2 (p < 0.05; Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). NS-398 a selective COX-2 inhibitor blocked PrxSO3 formation; however, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) did not. This result is consistent with the ability of acetylated Ser516 COX-2 to metabolize AA into a lipid hydroperoxide, 15R-HpETE, but not prostaglandins (29Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2020838087,"In this study we investigated the involvement of p53 in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced tumor target cell killing mediated by the perforin/granzymes pathway. For this purpose we used a human CTL clone (LT12) that kills its autologous melanoma target cells (T1), harboring a wild type p53. We demonstrated initially that LT12 kills its T1 target in a perforin/granzymes-dependent manner. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis indicated that conjugate formed between LT12 and T1 resulted in rapid cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 and its activation in T1 target cells. Cytotoxic assay using recombinant granzyme B (GrB) showed that this serine protease is the predominant factor inducing such accumulation. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated lowering of the p53 protein in T1 cells or pifithrin-α-induced p53-specific inhibition activity significantly decreased CTL-induced target killing mediated by CTL or recombinant GrB. This emphasizes that p53 is an important determinant in granzyme B-induced apoptosis. Our data show furthermore that when T1 cells were treated with streptolysin-O/granzyme B, specific phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-37 residues was observed subsequent to the activation of the stress kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p38K. Treatment of T1 cells with pifithrin-α resulted in inhibition of p53 phosphorylation at these residues and in a significant decrease in GrB-induced apoptotic T1 cell death. Furthermore, small interference RNAs targeting p53 was also accompanied by an inhibition of streptolysin-O/granzyme B-induced apoptotic T1 cell death. The present study supports p53 induction after CTL-induced stress in target cells. These findings provide new insight into a potential role of p53 as a component involved in the dynamic regulation of the major pathway of CTL-mediated cell death and may have therapeutic implications.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in host defense against malignancies in both mouse and human models (1Smyth M.J. Godfrey D.I. Trapani J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In the T cell-mediated cytotoxicity process, two major pathways are involved after T cell receptor recognition of silver-major histocompatibility complex complexes expressed on target cells. The first one is an alternate pathway based on T cell receptor-induced surface expression of death receptor ligands (FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and TNF) on effector cells, which cross-links the corresponding receptors (Fas/CD95, TRAIL receptors, and TNF-RI/p55, respectively) on target cells (2Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). The second, which is undoubtedly the major pathway, is a secretory pathway involving receptor-triggered exocytosis of preformed secretory lysosomes, termed lytic granules (3Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 4Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). On the basis of findings in genetically manipulated mice, human genetic disease, and in vitro studies, the granule exocytosis pathway seems to have the dominant role in eliminating virus-infected cells and in tumor immunosurveillance (5Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. Seiler P. Odermatt B. Olsen K.J. Podack E.R. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Nature. 1994; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of highly specific serine proteases know as granzymes. In mice and humans, A and B are the most abundant granzymes and have received the most attention, in particular granzyme B. It has been suggested that the latter induces target cell death by cleaving and activating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid (6Barry M. Heibein J.A. Pinkoski M.J. Lee S.F. Moyer R.W. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Truncated Bid disrupts the outer mitochondrial membrane to cause release of proapoptotic factor cytochrome c and endonuclease G (7Sutton V.R. Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that granzyme B (GrB) 5The abbreviations used are: GrB, granzyme B; wt, wild type; CTL, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte; Ab, antibody; Dioc6(3), 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine; CMA, concanamycin A; PFT-α, pifithrin-α; ROS, reactive oxygen species; siRNA, small interference RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SLO, streptolysin-O; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated. may induce target cell death by activating caspase 3 directly, by cleaving caspase substrates like poly ADP-ribose polymerase or inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) to free CAD, and/or by cleaving several non-caspase substrates (8Sharif-Askari E. Alam A. Rheaume E. Beresford P.J. Scotto C. Sharma K. Lee D. DeWolf W.E. Nuttall M.E. Lieberman J. Sekaly R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3101-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). GrB also directly disrupts the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in a caspase- and Bid-independent manner (3Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 9Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, despite these advances, the functional relationship between GrB and the tumor suppressor protein p53 remains unknown. It is well established that an appropriate response to stress stimuli is crucial for preventing cellular transformation as well as for maintaining normal tissue function. The tumor suppressor protein p53 has a central role in protecting cells from a variety of stress stimuli such as DNA damage, nucleotide depletion, oncogene activation, or γ-irradiation (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). The p53 protein has a short half-life and is often undetectable in normal cells. It is activated as a transcription factor through numerous post-translational modifications that allow its stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (11Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Activated p53 induced transcription from promoters that harbor a p53 consensus binding site of genes involved in the maintenance of genetic stability and cellular homeostasis (12el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Many apoptosis-related genes are regulated by p53, such as those encoding death receptors (13Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) (14Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar) and Noxa (15Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). As an additional mode of apoptotic activity, p53 also accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it directly activates the proapoptotic protein Bax to promote mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (16Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that in response to a broad spectrum of apoptotic stimuli, a fraction of wtp53 rapidly translocates to mitochondria in cell lines, in primary cells, and in vivo (17Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 18Sansome C. Zaika A. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Endogenous mitochondrial p53 physically interacts with the Bcl-2 family member proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and antagonizes their anti-apoptotic stabilization of the outer membrane (19Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). p53 possesses, therefore, a non-transcriptional function that is independent of its nuclear activity (20Vousden K.H. Science. 2005; 309: 1685-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The physiological consequences of p53 activation essentially lead to cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, or apoptosis; thereby, p53 prevents cells from replicating a genetically compromised genome. Moreover, the ability of p53 to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis has been reported to contribute to drug sensitivity induced by many anti-cancer agents (21Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of this tumor suppressor protein in the control of apoptosis mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) is not well documented. In this regard we have previously shown that p53 is a key determinant in anti-tumor CTL response as it regulates induction of Fas receptor expression, cellular FLICE/caspase-8 inhibitory protein (cFLIP) short protein degradation, and CD95-induced activation of mitochondrial pathway in tumor cells (22Thiery J. Dorothee G. Haddada H. Echchakir H. Richon C. Stancou R. Vergnon I. Benard J. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5919-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Thiery J.

The present studies were designed to delineate the relationship between p53 and GrB during tumor-specific lysis. We first demonstrated that CTL-tumor target cell interaction resulted in p53 accumulation and activation. Such activation is mediated by GrB and contributes at least in part to GrB-induced apoptosis. The current study emphasizes that in addition to its role in controlling irradiation and drug responses, p53 also plays a key role in the regulation of CTL-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies directed against p53 (DO-1, mouse IgG2a), Mdm2 (SMP14, mouse IgG1), Bid (FL195, rabbit IgG), and actin (C11, goat IgG) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-caspase 3 (8G10) rabbit monoclonal Ab, phospho-p53 antibody (Ser-6, Ser-9, Ser-15, Ser-20, Ser-37, Ser-46, and Ser-392), phospho-p38K (Thr-180/Tyr-182), and phospho-ATM (Ser-1981) polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Recombinant human GrB was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). Tumor Cell Line and CTL Clone—The T1 tumor cell line was established from the primary lesion of a patient suffering from a melanoma (24Dufour E. Carcelain G. Gaudin C. Flament C. Avril M.F. Faure F. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3787-3795PubMed Google Scholar) and was cultured at 37 °C (5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 with GlutaMax™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% of fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 5% Ultroser® G (BioSera, France). The LT12 CTL clone was isolated from autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as described previously (24Dufour E. Carcelain G. Gaudin C. Flament C. Avril M.F. Faure F. J.

Cell Death Analysis—T1 tumor cell sensitivity to LT12 was evaluated after interaction lasting 30 min and 1 h by 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (Dioc6(3)) and propidium iodide labeling (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Inhibition of the perforin/granzymes-mediated cytotoxicity was performed using LT12 cells preincubated for 2 h with 100 nm concanamycin A (CMA) (Sigma). Cells were analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer, and data were processed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Cytotoxicity Assay—Cytotoxicity assays were performed using a standard 4-h chromium release assay. Briefly, 2 × 103 51Cr-labeled T1 target cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with effector cells (LT12) at different effector/target ratios in a final volume of 200 μl in 96-well microplates. Experiments were performed in triplicate. At the end of the incubation 40 μl of the supernatant was transferred into 96-well Luminaplate solid scintillation plates (Packard Instrument Co.) and, after overnight drying, counted in a Top Count β counter (Packard). Data were expressed as the percentage of specific lysis at the T1/LT12 cell ratio indicated. The percentage of specific 51Cr release (specific lysis of target cells) was calculated as (experimental release - spontaneous release)/(total release - spontaneous release) × 100. Lytic units present in 107 effector cells were then assessed according to Pross et al. (25Pross H.F. Baines M.G. Rubin P. Shragge P. Patterson M.S. J. Clin. Immunol. 1981; 1: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) using a computer program. One lytic unit was defined as the number of effector cells required for 30% lysis of 3 × 103 target cells. Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular extracts were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Equivalent protein extracts (30–50 μg) were denatured by boiling in SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Hybond™ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The efficiency of the electrotransfer was assessed by Ponceau Red staining. Blots were blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with appropriated antibody for 1 h (anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-Mdm2 (SMP14), anti-Bid (FL195), and actin (C11)) or overnight (anti-caspase 3 (8G10), anti-phospho-p53, anti-phospho-ATM, and anti-phospho-p38K). After washing, blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugate secondary Ab. The complexes were detected using SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Inhibition of p53 Activation—p53 activation was inhibited by preincubating the T1 tumor cell line with 20 μm pifithrin-α (PFT-α) (BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth, PA) for 48 h before co-culturing T1 and LT12 CTL clone or before loading with granzyme B. Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Transfection—Two sequences of p53 siRNAs were used. The first siRNA used was designed with the Sigma-Proligo RNA interference designer tool: (siRNA p53_2) 5′-GUG AGC GCU UCG AGA UGU UdTdT, and the second sequence was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (NM_000546.2) (siRNA p53_JT) CGG CAU GAA CCG GAG GCC CAU dTdT. Subconfluent cells were transfected with siRNA in Opti-MEM I according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal Scanning Immunofluorescence Microscopy—T1 cells cultured on coverslips were co-incubated with LT12 CTL clone (effector/target ratio 2/1) for 10, 30, or 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% w/v in PBS) for 1 h, and then permeabilized with SDS (0.1% w/v in PBS) for 10 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked with fetal bovine serum 10% in PBS for 20 min before staining with anti-p53 (DO-1) monoclonal Ab; p53 expression was detected by Alexa Fluor 546 (red) goat anti-mouse secondary Ab (Molecular Probes). Nuclear staining was performed with TO-PRO®-3 (blue) (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using a drop of Vectashield hard set (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The fluorescence was examined under an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) as previously described (26Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Endert VanP. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Loading of Granzyme B—T1 cells were plated on coverslips at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Forty-eight hours later cells were loaded with recombinant granzyme B using sublytic doses of the pore-forming protein streptolysin-O (SLO) (Sigma, MDL number MFCD00132389). Briefly, SLO was preactivated by incubating for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then washed in serum-free medium followed by dropwise addition of 150 μl of RPMI containing 100 nm GrB to cell monolayers. Wells were flooded 15 min later with 1.5 ml of RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum. Early apoptotic events were evaluated 30 min and 1, 2, or 4 h after loading GrB with Dioc6(3) and propidium iodide labeling. The T1 Target Apoptotic Cell Death Induced by LT12 CTL Clone Is Mediated by the Perforin/Granzymes Pathway—Initially we investigated the susceptibility of T1, the wild type p53 target cells, to the cytotoxicity induced by the autologous CTL clone LT12 using Dioc6(3) and propidium iodide labeling. As shown in Fig. 1, at an effector/target ratio of 2/1, LT12 induced between 30 and 35% apoptotic T1 cells by the times indicated. Incubation of these cells with staurosporin (1 μm for 3 h) used as a positive control resulted in the induction of 50% of apoptotic cells. Moreover, preincubation of T1 target cells with CMA, an inhibitor of cytotoxic granules exocytosis by chelating free calcium, resulted in cell death being dramatically inhibited, indicating that the apoptotic death observed is mediated by the perforin/granzymes pathway. p53 Accumulation in T1 Target Cells after Their Interaction with the LT12 CTL Clone—To gain more insights into p53 implication in the control of CTL-mediated lysis, we asked whether tumor T1 cell interaction with the CTL LT12 clone constitutes cellular stress sufficient to induce p53 activation in tumor cells. To this end we co-incubated T1 tumor target cells with LT12 CTL clone at an effector/target ratio of 2/1 for 10, 30, or 60 min. Western blot analysis consistently revealed that although low level expression of p53 was maintained in non-stressed T1 control target cells, T1/LT12 conjugation resulted in rapid p53 accumulation in T1 tumor target cells (Fig. 2A). Using another melanoma cell line and its specific CTL clone, we obtained data confirming the p53 accumulation in target cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Because p53 activity depends on its expression level and its cell localization, p53 expression in T1 target cells was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Data provided in Fig. 2B show rapid nuclear and cytoplasm p53 accumulation in T1 target cells after CTL-target conjugation. These results underline that CTL hitting of T1 target cells effectively represents significant stress sufficient to induce p53 accumulation. To determine the possible involvement of the cytotoxic granules exocytosis-dependent pathway in cytoplasmic and nuclear p53 accumulation and activity after T1 recognition by LT12, we inhibited the perforin/granzyme-mediated pathway using CMA. Western blot (Fig. 2C) or confocal microscopy (Fig. 2D) analysis showed that preincubation of the LT12 CTL clone with CMA resulted in the inhibition of cytoplasmic and nuclear p53 accumulation and activity at the time indicated. These data show that p53 accumulation and activation observed after T1/LT12 interaction is induced by the perforin/granzymes pathway, further supporting the notion that it constitutes an effective stress in target cells. The Inhibition of p53 Activity or Lowering of Its Expression Induced a Decrease in LT12-mediated T1 Target Lysis—To determine whether the cytoplasmic and nuclear p53 accumulation observed and its activation were involved in LT12-mediated lysis, we performed experiments to inhibit either p53 expression using gene silencing or its activation using PFT-α (27Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Kletsas D. Mariatos G. Zoumpourlis V. Ryan K.M. Kittas C. Papavassiliou A.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T1 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting the p53 gene. As shown in Fig. 3A, Western blot analyses indicate that both p53 siRNA (siRNA 2 and siRNA JT) were effective in significantly lowering the p53 level (70%), whereas siRNA control (siRNA Sc, a non-targeting siRNA) had only a marginal effect. We then used the p53 inhibitor PFT-α that has been reported to inhibit, in vitro, p53-dependent gene transcription and to protect against a variety of genotoxic agents. As shown in Fig. 3B, when T1 tumor target cell line was preincubated with PFT-α before co-culture with the LT12 CTL clone, inhibition of target lysis (60% inhibition) by LT12 was observed. Furthermore, siRNA targeting p53 was also accompanied by dramatic inhibition of T1 lysis, whereas the siRNA Sc had only a slight effect. Granzyme B-dependent Induction of p53 Phosphorylation and Accumulation in Tumor Target Cells by Granzyme B—Granule-mediated killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires the combined action of the membranolytic protein perforin and granule-associated granzymes. Because the bacterial pore-forming toxin SLO was reported to have the same membranolytic and/or endosome disrupting properties as perforin, it was used in the course of these studies (28Browne K.A. Blink E. Sutton V.R. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8604-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the perforin/granzyme B pathway on the induction of apoptosis in T1 cells, these cells were incubated with sublytic doses of SLO (2 μg/ml) alone or in combination with human recombinant GrB (100 nm). Data shown in Fig. 4A indicate that SLO/GrB combination resulted in strong induction of apoptotic cell death, whereas SLO alone had only a slight effect. The data produced using Western blot analysis and depicted in Fig. 4B indicate that SLO/GrB-induced apoptotic T1 cell death correlates with Bid and caspase 3 cleavage, whereas incubation of T1 cells with SLO alone has no effect on either events (Fig. 4B). To investigate the capability of GrB for inducing p53 accumulation during CTL/target tumor interaction, T1 cells were treated with SLO (2 μg/ml) alone or in combination with recombinant GrB at the times indicated. The Western blot data shown in Fig. 5A indicate that SLO/GrB treatment resulted in the induction of p53 accumulation and transcriptional activity (data not shown). This accumulation was associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death in T1 cells (Fig. 4A). It should be noted, however, that treatment of T1 tumor cells with SLO alone resulted in a less significant increase in p53 that was not accompanied by induction of apoptotic cell death (see Fig. 4A). Given that post-translational modifications such as serine and threonine phosphorylation are fundamental for p53 activation, we asked whether the concomitant SLO/GrB exposure interferes with p53 phosphorylation. Western blot analyses were performed using specific antibodies to evaluate the seven sites of p53 most commonly phosphorylated. Although no phosphorylation was detected in whole cell lysates of control cultures and in cells treated with SLO alone, specific bands corresponding only to Ser-15 and Ser-37 could be observed early on at 30 min and 1 and 2 h after exposure of T1 cells to SLO/GrB (Fig. 5B). These observations suggest that GrB can effectively induce p53 activation at least in part by a mechanism involving Ser-37 and Ser-15 phosphorylation after stress kinase activation. Given that ATM and p38K are involved in the phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-37, respectively, we wondered whether SLO/GrB interfere with the activation of these stress kinases. The results illustrated in Fig. 5C indicate that whereas SLO alone had no effect, the SLO/GrB combination leads to the specific phosphorylation of ATM and p38K in T1 cells at 30 min and 1 and 2 h. Granzyme B-mediated Target Cell Death Involves p53 Phosphorylation—Because p53 phosphorylation is essential in the regulation of its activity and to further investigate how p53 activity impacts on GrB-induced killing of T1 cells, we examined the relationship between p53 phosphorylation and GrB-induced apoptotic cell death. In this aim, to explore this, we preincubated T1 cells with the specific p53 inhibitor PFT-α (20 μm) for 48 h. Data shown in Fig. 6A indicate that such treatment resulted in a significant decrease in GrB-induced apoptosis of T1 cells, which correlated with inhibition of Bid and caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 6B). These data were confirmed using another melanoma cell line (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). More interestingly, as depicted in Fig. 6C, the latter event correlated with inhibition of GrB-induced p53 phosphorylation at residues Ser-15 and Ser-37 especially at 1 and 2 h. These observations indicate that GrB-induced phosphorylation of p53 is a key event in coordinating the magnitude of apoptotic target killing. siRNA Targeting p53 Induced Inhibition of SLO/GrB-mediated Apoptotic T1 Cell Death—To investigate the functional consequence of p53 silencing on SLO/GrB-induced apoptotic cell death in T1 cells, p53 was silenced in these cells by RNA interference. As shown in Fig. 7A, small interfering RNA against wild type p53 dramatically depressed p53 expression in T1 cells. We next examined the effect of SLO/GrB on the viability of siRNA-treated cells. Data depicted in Fig. 7B indicate a significant down-regulation in the percentage of apoptotic T1 cells induced by the SLO/GrB treatment. Approaches to treatment of cancer based on the immune system have often focused on specific cytolytic effector cells such as CTLs (29Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was intended to provide insight into the functional relationship between GrB and p53 during tumor-specific lysis mediated by CTLs. Several phenomenological studies on T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro have been extensively reviewed (30Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), and major advances have been made in understanding CTL-mediated apoptosis. However, increasing evidence from studies in patients and on cultured cells has highlighted the possibility that the induction of CTLs may be essential but not sufficient to the control of tumor progression (31Anichini A. Molla A. Mortarini R. Tragni G. Bersani I. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Pilotti S. Dunbar R. Cerundolo V. Parmiani G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 651-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is assumed that tumor cell growth in vivo is influenced not only by the ability of CTLs to recognize and respond to the tumor but also by the susceptibility of tumor cells to host-mediated anti-tumor immune responses (32Medema J.P. de Jong J. van Hall T. Melief C.J. Offringa R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Such susceptibility involves not only the effector and target cell features but also their reciprocal interaction, which so far remains not clearly understood. Recently we provided evidence indicating that tumor killing by autologous CTLs can be enhanced by targeting degranulation-independent mechanisms via restoration of wtp53, a key determinant of apoptotic machinery regulation (22Thiery J. Dorothee G. Haddada H. Echchakir H. Richon C. Stancou R. Vergnon I. Benard J. Mami-Chouaib F. Cho"

https://openalex.org/W2062395555,"Hemolymph coagulation in arthropods plays key roles in host defense, including sealing wounds to staunch bleeding and immobilizing invading microorganisms. We have previously reported that horseshoe crab transglutaminase (TGase) promotes cross-linking of a clotting protein (coagulin) with hemocyte-derived proteins (proxins), resulting in the formation of stable coagulin fibrils. Here we show that TGase also cross-links proxins to another hemocyte-derived protein named stablin. Stablin is a cysteine-rich protein of 131 residues. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed the specific interaction of stablin with proxin-1 at Kd = 4.0 × 10-9m. Stablin was predominantly localized in the large granules of hemocytes and secreted by lipopolysaccharide-induced exocytosis. Interestingly, stablin bound to chitin at Kd = 1.5 × 10-8m, as determined by using a quartz-crystal microbalance. Stablin also interacted with lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids and exhibited bacterial agglutinating activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Immunostaining showed that stablin is co-localized with coagulin in the clotting fibrils that effectively trap bacteria. Moreover, an anti-stablin antibody strongly inhibited the proper formation of the clotting fibrils. These data suggest that stablin promotes the formation of the clotting mesh and the immobilization of invading microbes at injury sites. In arthropods, the TGase-mediated cross-linking may play an important role in the initial stage of host defense, wound closure, and healing, as in the case of mammals.

In arthropods, the TGase-mediated cross-linking may play an important role in the initial stage of host defense, wound closure, and healing, as in the case of mammals. In arthropods, hemolymph clot is an extracellular matrix established at sites of damage to staunch bleeding and functions as an important element of the innate immune system through its ability to entrap and immobilize bacteria that have entered the body via wounds (1Theopold U. Schmidt O. Söderhäll K. Dushay M.S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In mammals blood coagulation is based on the proteolytically induced polymerization of fibrinogen (2Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Initially, fibrin monomers non-covalently interact with each other, and the resulting homopolymers are further stabilized by the plasma transglutaminase (TGase) 4The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; DCA, monodansylcadaverine; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 4The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; DCA, monodansylcadaverine; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. through the intermolecular cross-linking of ϵ-(γ-glutamyl) lysine bonds (3Lorand L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In crustaceans, although no proteolytic cascades are involved in the hemolymph coagulation, the coagulation also depends on the TGase-mediated cross-linking of specific plasma-clotting proteins (1Theopold U.

Insect hemolymph coagulation requires close interaction between plasma components and cellular components derived from hemocytes, resulting in the precipitation of an insoluble matrix (5Theopold U. Li D. Fabbri M. Scherfer C. Schmidt O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This precipitation leads to a soft clot, which is hardened through the activity of cross-linking enzymes. Recently, a proteomic study of Drosophila larval hemolymph before and after clotting has led to the isolation of several candidates for clotting factors, which include proteins with similarity to prophenoloxidase-activating proteases, two phenoloxidases, and substrates for the TGase (6Karlsson C.

On the other hand, hemolectin, one of the most abundant hemolymph proteins in Drosophila, has been isolated and characterized as a coagulation-related factor (7Scherfer C. Karlsson C. Loseva O. Bidla G. Goto A. Havemann J. Dushay M.S. Theopold U. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 625-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In horseshoe crabs, granular hemocytes comprise 99% of all hemocytes and are involved in the storage and release of defense molecules, including serine protease zymogens, the clot-able protein coagulogen, protease inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, and lectins (8Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Kawabata S. Tsuda R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In response to the stimulation from bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the defense molecules stored in granules are secreted by hemocyte exocytosis (8Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem.

The coagulation cascade of these zymogens is triggered by LPS or β-1,3-glucans, which finally leads to the conversion of coagulogen into coagulin, resulting in noncovalent coagulin homopolymers through head-to-tail interaction (12Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Kawasaki H. Nose T. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Shimohigashi Y. Kawabata S.

Moreover, LPS has been shown to induce the secretion of horseshoe crab TGase from the hemocyte cytosol through an unknown mechanism (14Osaki T. Okino N. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40084-40090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Horseshoe crab TGase shows a significant sequence similarity with the mammalian TGase members (15Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A.

Although horseshoe crab TGase neither catalyzes monodansylcadaverine (DCA) incorporation into coagulin nor cross-links coagulin intermolecularly, TGase cross-links coagulin with the hemocyte-derived proline-rich proteins known as proxins, resulting in more stably clotting fibrils (14Osaki T.

In the American horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus, at least three hemolymph proteins, i.e. α2-macroglobulin, C-reactive proteins, and hemocyanin, are involved in the formation of the clotting fibrils (18Isakova V. Armstrong P.B. Biol. Bull. 2003; 205: 203-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The clotting mesh cross-liked by TGase may function to seal the wound to stop bleeding, serve as a barrier to the entry of microbes into the interior of the animal via the wound, and operate as a transient extracellular matrix for the migration of wound-healing epithelial cells. In this study we identified a TGase substrate of 15 kDa, named stablin, as shorthand for clot-stabilizing protein, and demonstrated that stablin is an essential component of the clotting mesh and, thus, functions in the forefront of innate immunity. Materials—Hemocyte debris from the Japanese horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus was prepared as described previously (19Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem.

The recombinant plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac™ competent cells (Invitrogen) that contained the bacmid with a mini-att Tn7 target site and the helper plasmid according to the manufacturerŉs specifications. The mini-Tn7 element on the pFastBac™ donor plasmid can transpose to the mini-att Tn7 target site on the bacmid in the presence of transposition proteins provided by the helper plasmid. The transposed bacmid was transfected into Sf9 insect cells with Cellfectin® Transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The resultant baculovirus pools were collected from the cell culture medium at 72 h post-transfection. The insect cells were infected with the recombinant virus and harvested 72 h after the infection. The cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1% Nonidet® P-40. The homogenized cell lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column. The TGase activity of each fraction was detected by DCA incorporation into proxins (14Osaki T. Okino N. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40084-40090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Incorporation of DCA into Hemocyte-derived Proteins by TGase—Hemocyte extract was incubated with TGase in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm DCA at 37 °C for 1 h. The aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The fluorescence-labeled proteins were visualized by a trans-illuminator. Purification of a TGase Substrate of 15 kDa—The hemocyte debris (77.3 g, wet weight) was extracted twice by homogenizing with 200 ml of 30% acetic acid, and the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min was lyophilized. The dried material was dissolved in 100 ml of 10% acetic acid then applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (3.6 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 10% acetic acid (Fig. 1A). SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel indicated the presence of the 15-kDa protein in fractions 60–70 (data not shown). These fractions were collected, lyophilized, and then applied to an S-Sepharose fast flow column (2 × 32 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. After washing with the equilibration buffer, proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 0.1–0.4 m in the same buffer (Fig. 1B). SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel indicated the presence of the 15-kDa protein in fractions 95–99 (data not shown). These fractions were collected and further separated into 3 peaks by a phenyl-5PW reverse-phase HPLC (rpHPLC) column (4.6 × 75 mm) (Fig. 1C). The partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the protein at peak 1 contained the previously characterized protease inhibitor of 7 kDa, a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (21Nakamura T. Hirai T. Tokunaga F. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The 15-kDa protein was eluted at peak 2. The extinction of coefficient of the 15-kDa protein at 280 nm for 1% solution in water was calculated by using the data from the amino acid analysis, and a value of 11.8 was used for subsequent determinations of protein concentrations. The final yield of the 15-kDa protein from 100 g of hemocyte debris was about 4.0 mg. Proteolytic Digestion—Protein samples were digested with lysyl endopeptidase (enzyme/substrate = 1/50, w/w) in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 containing 2 m urea at 37 °C for 20 h. The resulting peptides were separated by rpHPLC using a Cosmosil 5C18-MS column (2.0 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 8–48% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 65 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm. Amino Acid Composition and Sequence Analyses—Amino acid analysis was performed by using an AccQ-Tag system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer. The protein concentration for determining the extinction coefficient of the 15-kDa protein was calculated from the amino acid mass at A280. An internal standard, norleucine, was added to the protein hydrolysates to allow for the collection of losses. Isolation of cDNA Clones of the 15-kDa Protein—The degenerate nucleotide sequences of primers used for reverse transcription-PCR were based on the NH2-terminal sequence (FIKQTK) and that of the peptide derived from lysyl endopeptidase digestion (NQFQQT). Sense and antisense nucleotides were synthesized with an EcoRI site at the 5′ end. The PCR reactions were carried out using a reaction mixture containing cDNA template (corresponding to 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA) and 20 pmol of each primer in a Takara PCR thermal cycler (Takara Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The PCR product was treated with EcoRI and purified using agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragment of interest was then ligated into a plasmid Bluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for a sequence analysis as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the insert was analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence was found to be identical to the determined partial amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal region and the peptides derived from lysyl endopeptidase digestion of the 15-kDa protein. RACE—5′- or 3′-RACE analysis was carried out using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). This technique involved the incorporation of a “Smart Oligo” onto the 5′ end of the reverse-transcribed cDNA for the 5′-RACE analysis. For the 3′-RACE analysis, the Smart Oligo was attached to an oligo(dT) primer to yield cDNA that had a complete 3′-untranslated region, a poly-A tail, and the Smart Oligo sequence extension. The 5′-and 3′ ends of the 15-kDa protein were amplified using primers designed for RACE PCR, according to the manufacturerŉs instruction manual. Inhibitory Effect of the 15-kDa Protein on Trypsin—The inhibitory activities of the 15-kDa protein and the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor toward trypsin were examined as follows; trypsin (1.3 nm) was preincubated with various concentrations of the inhibitor in a total volume of 180 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C. After 5 min of incubation, 20 μl of a fluorogenic peptide substrate, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-Val-Pro-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (final 0.1 mm), was added to the mixture. After 5 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.8 ml of 5% (v/v) acetic acid. The amount of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin liberated from the substrates was estimated by fluorescence measurement with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer 650-10S. Overexpression of Proxin-1 in E. coli—To construct an expression vector for proxin-1, a DNA fragment encoding the full-length of proxin-1 (14Osaki T. Okino N. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40084-40090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) followed by a stop codon was created by PCR and subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pET-28a (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA). The construct was verified by sequencing. Proxin-1 was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)/pLysS. The cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1% Nonidet® P-40. The homogenized cell lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column followed by a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. Preparation of Polyclonal Antibodies against the 15-kDa Protein (Stablin)—The immunization was carried out at Asahi Techno Glass Corp., Chiba, Japan. An antiserum against stablin was raised in a rabbit as described previously (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.1-13.104Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against stablin was purified from the rabbit antiserum with an Ampure PA kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking of Stablin with Proxin-1—Stablin (5 μg) was incubated with proxin-1 (5 μg) in the presence of TGase (0.2 μg) in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2 (25 μl) at 37 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by Western blotting using the anti-stablin antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Proxin-1 (50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0) was immobilized on a sensor chip CM5 of the BIAcore 1000 system (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturerŉs specifications. After washing the proxin-1-immobilized sensor chip with 10 mm HCl followed by 10 mm NaOH, stablin was injected at 10 μl/min in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and the change in the mass concentration on the sensor chip was monitored as a resonance signal using the program supplied by the manufacturer. Sensorgrams of the interaction obtained using various concentrations of stablin (80–100 nm) were analyzed using the software provided with the instrument. Western Blotting—For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then treated with anti-stablin antibody, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and visualized using a Chemi-Lumi One Kit (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Total concentrations of extracted proteins with 2% SDS were determined by using a Micro BCA™ Protein Assay reagent kit (Pierce), and 10 μg of protein of each tissue extract was applied to SDS-PAGE. Binding Analysis by 27-MHz Quartz-crystal Microbalances—The interaction of stablin with chitin or LPS from S. minnesota R595 was examined using 27-MHz quartz-crystal microbalances (Initium Co., Tokyo, Japan). Chitin or LPS (5 μg) in water was immobilized onto a 27-MHz electrode. The electrode was dried at room temperature, washed with water several times to remove the excess chitin, soaked in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (8 ml), and monitored continuously for frequency changes at 25 °C. The frequency changes in response to the various concentrations (2–64 nm) of stablin were assessed. The dissociation constant (Kd) of stablin against chitin or LPS was determined by the published method (25Sato T. Serizawa T. Okahata Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bacteria Agglutinating and Antimicrobial Activities—Bacterial agglutinating activity (26Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and antimicrobial activity (27Saito T. Kawabata S. Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Cho J. Nakajima H. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were determined as described earlier using E. coli K12. Minimum agglutinating concentrations of stablin were determined against various bacteria or fungi in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. For screening of inhibitors of agglutination, carbohydrates, LPS, or lipoteichoic acids in the same buffer were incubated with stablin before adding E. coli K12. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—One milliliter of T. tridentatus hemolymph was collected into 50 ml of pyrogen-free 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the diluted hemolymph was plated on coverslips (10Ariki S. Koori K. Osaki T. Motoyama K. Inamori K. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After a 20-min incubation, the attached hemocytes were incubated with 1 μg/ml LPS or E. coli expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein for 1 h and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (11Koshiba T. Hashii T. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3962-3967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The hemocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 5% bovine calf serum. Then the hemocytes were incubated for 1 h with anti-coagulogen monoclonal antibody and the anti-stablin polyclonal antibody. For detection, Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), rhodamine-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DACO, Glostrup, Denmark), and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used. Hemocytes were imaged with an Olympus BX-FLA fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Purification of a TGase Substrate and Its Nucleotide Sequence—To identify potential proteins involved in the TGase-mediated hemolymph clot, hemocyte extract was incubated with TGase in the presence of DCA and subjected to SDS-PAGE (data not shown). A DCA-labeled protein with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa was observed accompanied with proxins and the 8.6-kDa protein, i.e. the TGase substrates already characterized (15Tokunaga F. Yamada M. Miyata T. Ding Y.L. Hiranaga-Kawabata M. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Ichinose A. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Osaki T. Kawabata S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 15-kDa protein was then purified from hemocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified 15-kDa protein had a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C) and was labeled with DCA by TGase, concomitant with the cross-linked dimer, indicating a protein substrate for TGase (Fig. 1D). A full-length cDNA of the 15-kDa protein contained a 595-nucleotide including a 30-base poly(A) tail (Fig. 2A). The open reading frame encoded a 20-amino acid signal peptide and 131-amino acid mature protein. Interestingly, homology search showed a low sequence similarity between the 15-kDa protein and keratin-related proteins (Fig. 2B): Caenorhabditis elegans F46E10.11 (28The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar) (16.7% identity), keratin-associated protein 12.4 (29Shibuya K. Obayashi I. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Genomics. 2004; 83: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (15.4%), keratin-associated protein 4.4 (30Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (14.9%), and mouse keratin (31McNab A.R. Wood L. Theriault N. Gierman T. Vogeli G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (14.8%). The keratin-associated proteins, which constitute the matrix of the keratin composite of wool, are a large group of possibly up to 100 different proteins. They are divided into three main families based on their amino acid composition: ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated proteins (>30% Cys content), high sulfur keratin-associated proteins (16–30% Cys content) (29Shibuya K. Obayashi I. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Genomics. 2004; 83: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and high Gly/Tyr keratin-associated proteins (35–60% Gly and Tyr content) (32Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jollés P. Zahn H. Höcker H Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Crossref Google Scholar). Among these three types, the high sulfur keratin-associated proteins possess Cys clusters such as Cys-Cys-Val-Pro and Cys-Cys-Gln-Pro (Fig. 2B). The 15-kDa protein also contained a high Cys content (12.2%) that included Cys clusters such as Cys-Cys-Val-Pro and Cys-Cys-Ala-Thr (Fig. 2, A and B). The 15-kDa protein was revealed to be a cysteine-rich protein (16 Cys residues), and its NH2-terminal sequence was identical to the NH2-terminal sequence of L2 up to the first 13 residues, which is a previously identified protein stored in the large granules of hemocytes and secreted by LPS-induced hemocyte exocytosis (33Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We named the 15-kDa protein stablin, as shorthand for clot-stabilizing protein, as described later. As expected, stablin was predominantly localized in hemocytes (Fig. 3). Moreover, stablin showed significant sequence similarity with the partial NH2-terminal sequence of a new type of trypsin inhibitor previously identified in hemocytes of the American horseshoe crab L. polyphemus, with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa on SDS-PAGE (34Donovan M.A. Laue T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the reported NH2-terminal sequence of the Limulus trypsin inhibitor is VSPPFIKQTKFSTXFLGXSS, which is identical to stablin up to 10 residues. To test whether stablin inhibits trypsin, stablin at various concentrations was preincubated with trypsin followed by incubation with a fluorogenic peptide substrate for trypsin. Stablin did not inhibit the amidase activity of trypsin at a 10 m excess of trypsin. During the purification of stablin, a protease inhibitor was co-purified after gel filtration and ion-exchange column chromatography and finally separated from stablin by rpHPLC (peak 1 in Fig. 1C), which was identical to the previously identified Kunitz-type protease inhibitor with Mr = 6824 (21Nakamura T. Hirai T. Tokunaga F. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The purified Kunitz-type inhibitor (peak 1 in Fig. 1C) strongly inhibited the tryptic activity and completely inhibited at a5 m excess of trypsin under the same conditions. The reported inhibitory characteristics of the 15-kDa protein of L. polyphemus are quite similar to those of the Kunitz-type inhibitor of T. tridentatus (21Nakamura T. Hir"
https://openalex.org/W2147806061,"The 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is up-regulated in a wide variety of tumor cell types and contributes to the resistance of these cells to the induction of cell death by anticancer drugs. Hsp70 binding protein 1 (HspBP1) modulates the activity of Hsp70 but its biological significance has remained unclear. We have now examined whether HspBP1 might interfere with the prosurvival function of Hsp70, which is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of the death-associated permeabilization of lysosomal membranes. HspBP1 was found to be expressed at a higher level than Hsp70 in all normal and tumor cell types examined. Tumor cells with a high HspBP1/Hsp70 molar ratio were more susceptible to anticancer drugs than were those with a low ratio. Ectopic expression of HspBP1 enhanced this effect of anticancer drugs in a manner that was both dependent on the ability of HspBP1 to bind to Hsp70 and sensitive to the induction of Hsp70 by mild heat shock. Furthermore, anticancer drugs up-regulated HspBP1 expression, whereas prevention of such up-regulation by RNA interference reduced the susceptibility of tumor cells to anticancer drugs. Overexpression of HspBP1 promoted the permeabilization of lysosomal membranes, the release of cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-3 induced by anticancer drugs. These results suggest that HspBP1, by antagonizing the prosurvival activity of Hsp70, sensitizes tumor cells to cathepsin-mediated cell death.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, Hsp70 proteins function as ATP-dependent molecular chaperones by facilitating the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the assembly of multiprotein complexes, and the transport of proteins across cellular membranes. Under stressful conditions, the synthesis of inducible Hsp70 enhances the ability of cells to cope with increased concentrations of unfolded or denatured proteins (1Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A.

The Hsp70 proteins undergo a cycle of substrate binding and release that is accelerated by ATP hydrolysis (1Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 2Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The substrate binding domain of Hsp70 is localized to a 25-kDa COOH-terminal region, with substrate access to this domain being controlled by a COOH-terminal “lid” that exposes the domain in the ATP-bound form and allows substrate binding to occur when Hsp70 is in the ADP-bound form. Opening and closing of the lid are governed by conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis, which occur within the cleft of the 45-kDa NH2-terminal ATPase domain. The exchange of bound ADP for ATP results in substrate release, thus allowing Hsp70 to enter a new round of substrate binding and release. The chaperone activity of Hsp70 proteins is regulated by various accessory proteins, known as cochaperones (1Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 2Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 3Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). For example, Hsp40 binds to the COOH terminus of Hsp70, stimulates its ATPase activity, and thereby stabilizes the substrate-bound form. The cochaperones Hip and Bag-1 bind to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 and function as nucleotide exchange factors: Hip prevents the dissociation of ADP from Hsp70 and thereby stabilizes the substrate-bound form, whereas Bag-1 promotes the release of ADP and rebinding of ATP, thereby triggering the premature unloading of bound substrate proteins from Hsp70. In addition to their essential role in protein quality control, Hsp70 proteins have been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis. A high level of expression of these proteins thus enhances the tumorigenic potential of rodent cells in syngeneic animals (7Jäättelä M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and is associated with a poor therapeutic outcome in several human cancers (8Jäättelä M. Exp.

The prosurvival function of Hsp70 proteins has been suggested to be distinct from their chaperone activity (14Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jäättelä M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Hsp70 has been localized to membranes of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment and shown to inhibit the cell death-associated release of cathepsins from these vesicles in tumor cells, thus presumably contributing to its prosurvival function (19Nylandsted J. Gyrd-Hansen M. Danielewicz A. Fehrenbacher N. Lademann U. Hoyer-Hansen M. Weber E. Multhoff G. Rohde M. Jäättelä M. J. Exp.

Hsp70-binding protein 1 (HspBP1) was originally identified as a protein that interacts with Hsp70 and inhibits its chaperone activity (21Raynes D.A. Guerriero Jr., V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32883-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown to bind to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 and to inhibit its ATPase activity (22McLellan C.A. Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19017-19022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, HspBP1 has also been shown to function as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70 and Hsc70 (23Kabani M. McLellan C. Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. Brodsky J.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and to stimulate their chaperone activities (24Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although HspBP1 appears to represent a new member of the class of nucleotide exchange factors for Hsp70/Hsc70, its biological significance has remained poorly understood. We have now investigated the physiological function of HspBP1, focusing on its possible interference with the prosurvival activity of Hsp70. Our results suggest that anticancer drugs up-regulate the expression of HspBP1, which then specifically binds to Hsp70 and antagonizes its ability to inhibit the cell death-associated permeabilization of lysosomes. HspBP1 thus contributes to the induction of cathepsin-mediated programmed cell death by anticancer drugs in tumor cells. Materials—Vincristine and paclitaxel were obtained from Sigma, and etoposide was from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). CA-074 Me was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HspBP1 were generated in response to a peptide corresponding to residues 342 to 359 (EKLLQTCFSSPADDSMDR) of the human protein. Other antibodies used included those to β-actin (A4700) from Sigma, Bid (number 2002) or to caspase-3 cleaved at Asp175 (number 9661) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), cathepsin L (clone 22) from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA), cathepsin B (CA10) from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), green fluorescent protein (GF200) from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), Hsp70 (sc-24) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Hsc70 (SPA-815) from Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Other chemicals and reagents were of the purest grade available. Cell Culture and Heat Shock Treatment—The human cell lines MKN1 (gastric adenocarcinoma), MKN28 (gastric adenocarcinoma), NUGC-3 (gastric adenocarcinoma), Hep3B (hepatocellular carcinoma), HLE (hepatocellular carcinoma), HLF (hepatocellular carcinoma), WiDr (colon adenocarcinoma), DLD-1 (colon adenocarcinoma), HeLa S3 (cervical adenocarcinoma), A431 (epidermoid carcinoma), SUIT-2 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), RPMI-SE (renal cell carcinoma), PC3 (prostatic adenocarcinoma), T24 (bladder carcinoma), TIG-3 (diploid fibroblasts), WI-38 (diploid fibroblasts), and FS-4 (foreskin fibroblasts) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (25Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or an EGFP-HspBP1 fusion protein were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Geneticin (200 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). For heat shock treatment of cells, culture dishes were immersed for 60 min in a circulating water bath at 43 °C and then returned to the 37 °C CO2 incubator for 16 h before treatment with anticancer drugs. Plasmids and Cell Transfection—An HspBP1 cDNA was isolated from a human heart cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid screening with the ATPase domain of human Hsp70 as the bait (DDBJ number AB020592). To generate expression plasmids encoding EGFP-HspBP1 or the deletion mutant EGFP-HspBP1(ΔC), we amplified cDNA fragments from human TIG-3 diploid fibroblast cDNA by polymerase chain reaction with the primers 5′-CGGAATTCCATGTCAGACGAAGGCTC-3′ (forward), with the underlined sequence corresponding to an EcoRI site, and either 5′-CGGCTCGAGTCACCGATCCATGCTGTC-3′ (reverse) for HspBP1 or 5′-CGGCTCGAGTCACGGCTCCCGACACTC-3′ (reverse) for HspBP1(ΔC), with the underlined sequences corresponding to a XhoI site. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the resulting fragments were cloned into the EcoRI- and SalI-digested pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and verified by sequencing. To generate expression plasmids for EGFP-HspBP1(ΔM) or EGFP-HspBP1(ΔMC), we amplified DNA fragments corresponding to COOH-terminal portions of HspBP1 (amino acids 196 to 359 for HspBP1(ΔM) and 196 to 313 for HspBP1(ΔMC)) by PCR with the primers 5′-GGAAGGTACCTGGACCGCGACGCCTGCGAC-3′ (forward), with the underlined sequence corresponding to a KpnI site, and either 5′-GCAGGATCCTCACCGATCCATGCTGTC-3′ (reverse) for HspBP1(ΔM) or 5′-GCAGGATCCTCACGGCTCCCGACACTC-3′ (reverse) for HspBP1(ΔMC), with the underlined sequences corresponding to a BamHI site. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and BamHI, and the resulting fragments were cloned into the EGFP-HspBP1 expression vector that had been digested with KpnI and BamHI (to delete the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 154 to 359) and were verified by sequencing. Transfection of HeLa S3 cells with expression plasmids was performed with the use of the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For establishment of HeLa S3 cells stably expressing EGFP or EGFP-HspBP1, the cells were subjected to selection in culture medium supplemented with Geneticin (400 μg/ml) after transfection, and individual resistant colonies were isolated to obtain cell clones. Recombinant Proteins—The HspBP1 coding sequence was inserted into the pET24b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the resulting construct was introduced by transformation into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Expression of His6-tagged HspBP1 was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the bacterial culture. Bacterial cells were lysed by ultrasonic disruption in 20 ml of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech). Recombinant His6-HspBP1 was eluted from the column with the cell lysis solution supplemented with 100 mm imidazole and subjected to dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Recombinant human Hsp70 (NSP-555) and recombinant bovine Hsc70 (SPP-751) were obtained from Stressgen Bioreagents. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for human HspBP1 mRNA and a control nontargeting siRNA were obtained from B-Bridge International (San Jose, CA). The sense sequences targeted by the HspBP1 siRNAs were 5′-GTGCAGAAGCTCAAGGTCA-3′ (HspBP1 siRNA-A) and 5′-GAGCTGGAGTTCTGTGAAA-3′ (HspBP1 siRNA-B), whereas that targeted by the control siRNA was 5′-ATCCGCGCGATAGTACGTA-3′. Subconfluent cultures of MKN1 cells were transfected with siRNAs (50 nm) for 24 h with the use of Lipofectamine 2000. Cell Lysis and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off culture plates into a hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml)), and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 60 s. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with primary antibodies as described previously (26Iwasaki S. Iguchi M. Watanabe K.

Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare). Image analysis was performed with Multi Gauge software version 3.0 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml)), and cell lysates were incubated and gently rocked for 6 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated with Protein A/G Plusagarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed three times with IP lysis buffer, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by exposure to trypsin, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) (DNase-free, Sigma), and stained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) as described previously (27Hoshino R. Tanimura S. Watanabe K. Kataoka T. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2686-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At least 1 × 104 cells were analyzed for DNA content (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 620 nm) or the expression of EGFP-tagged proteins (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 530 nm) with the use of a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay—Cells seeded in 12-well plates (250 cells per well) were allowed to grow for 48 h before treatment with various drugs for 48 h. They were then allowed to form colonies by incubation in drug-free medium for 5 days. The resulting colonies were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were counted (29Fujiwara Y. Hosokawa Y. Watanabe K. Tanimura S. Ozaki K. Kohno M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were exposed to various reagents, fixed with methanol at –20 °C, and transferred to blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin). Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies to cathepsin L or cathepsin B (1/200 dilution in blocking buffer), and immune complexes were then detected with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G (1/200 dilution in blocking buffer) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Confocal images were obtained with an Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with an LSM 5 Pascal system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. and analyzed where indicated by the two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Preferential Association of HspBP1 with Hsp70 in Cells—To confirm the physiological interaction between HspBP1 and Hsp70 or Hsc70, we examined the association of these proteins in HeLa S3 cells with a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to HspBP1 were found to contain not only HspBP1 but also a substantial amount of Hsp70 and a small amount of Hsc70 (Fig. 1A). Conversely, HspBP1 was detected in substantial amounts in immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-Hsp70 but was virtually undetectable in those prepared with anti-Hsc70. Essentially identical results were obtained with MKN1 cells (data not shown). Hsc70 is an abundant protein that is constitutively expressed in normal and tumor cells at similar levels; its concentration in most of the cell lines examined was 20 to 30 μg/mg of cellular protein, a value more than 10 times that for Hsp70 (Fig. 2, A and B). These results thus indicated that HspBP1 binds to Hsp70 in cells with much higher affinity than it does to Hsc70. Given that only a small proportion of Hsc70 molecules are associated with HspBP1 in cells, it is likely that HspBP1 exerts little effect on the physiological function of Hsc70. We therefore focused on the interaction between HspBP1 and Hsp70 in subsequent experiments.FIGURE 2Expression levels of Hsp70, Hsc70, and HspBP1 in tumor cells. A, lysates (20 μg of protein) of the indicated cell types were subjected to immunoblot (IB) analysis with antibodies to Hsp70, Hsc70, HspBP1, or β-actin (loading control). The asterisk indicates nonspecific bands. Data are representative of three separate experiments. B, the indicated amounts of recombinant Hsp70 (upper panel), Hsc70 (middle panel), His6-tagged HspBP1 (lower panel), or cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the respective antibodies. The blots were subjected to densitometry, and standard curves were constructed for the recombinant proteins for determination of the concentrations of Hsp70, Hsc70, and HspBP1 in the cell lysates. The open arrowhead and asterisk indicate His6-tagged HspBP1 and nonspecific bands, respectively. Data are mean ± S.D. of values from three separate experiments.

Values are based on a molecular size of 70 kDa for Hsp70 and 39.5 kDa for HspBP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HspBP1 is thought to bind to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 through major (including helices α2, α5, α8, and α11) and minor (including helices α14 and α17) interaction sites (24Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To confirm these observations, we constructed expression vectors for EGFP-tagged deletion mutants of HspBP1 that lack helix α5 (EGFP-HspBP1(ΔM)), helix α17 (EGFP-HspBP1(ΔC)), or both of these helices (EGFP-HspBP1(ΔMC)) and then introduced the vectors into HeLa S3 cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Hsp70 and immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP revealed a marked reduction in the ability of not only EGFP-HspBP1(ΔM) but also EGFP-HspBP1(ΔC) to bind to Hsp70, compared with that of EGFP-HspBP1; EGFP-HspBP1(ΔMC) did not appear to interact with Hsp70 at all (Fig. 1B). Increased Sensitivity of Tumor Cells with a High HspBP1/Hsp70 Molar Ratio to Anticancer Drugs—The molar ratio of HspBP1 to Hsp70 in cells might be expected to be an important determinant of the interaction between these two proteins as well as of the function of the resulting complex. In this regard, an HspBP1/Hsp70 ratio of ∼4 has been suggested to be required for inhibition of Hsp70 activity by 50% (30Raynes D.A. Graner M.W. Bagatell R. McLellan C. Guerriero V. Tumour Biol. 2003; 24: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore next determined the amounts of Hsp70 and HspBP1 in a variety of tumor cell types by immunoblot analysis, with recombinant Hsp70 and HspBP1 (His6-tagged) as respective standards. The concentration of Hsp70 in all the tumor cell lines examined was severalfold greater than that in diploid fibroblasts (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the concentration of HspBP1 in many tumor cell types was greater than that in normal fibroblastic cells, the difference in the amount of HspBP1 between tumor cells and normal cells was not as marked as that for Hsp70. Furthermore, no correlation between the expression level of Hsp70 and of HspBP1 was apparent in the tumor cells. The molar ratio of HspBP1 to Hsp70 was thus highly variable among the tumor cell types, ranging from a value similar to that for diploid fibroblasts (more than 10) for HLF, MKN1, and DLD-1 cells to less than 2 for A431, NUGC-3, and MKN28 cells (Fig. 2C). HspBP1 has been shown to bind to Hsp70 and modulate its activity either negatively (21Raynes D.A. Guerriero Jr., V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32883-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22McLellan C.A. Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. J. Biol.

Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, the increased expression of Hsp70 in tumor cells is thought to contribute to the resistance of these cells to the induction of cell death by anticancer drugs (8Jäättelä M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 9Ciocca D.R. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005; 10: 86-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the biological effect of HspBP1 on Hsp70 activity, we compared the drug sensitivities of tumor cell types with a high HspBP1/Hsp70 ratio (MKN1, DLD-1, and HLF cells) and those with a low HspBP1/Hsp70 ratio (HeLa S3, WiDr, and MKN28 cells). The cells were treated with vincristine (100 nm), paclitaxel (100 nm), or etoposide (34 μm) for up to 48 h, and the proportion of dead cells with a fractional DNA content (cells in sub-G1 phase) was then determined by flow cytometry. Tumor cells with a high HspBP1/Hsp70 molar ratio were more susceptible to the anticancer drugs than were those with a low ratio (Fig. 3, A and B). The differences in drug sensitivity between these two groups of tumor cell lines were confirmed by clonogenic cell survival assays performed with much lower concentrations of the anticancer drugs compared with those used for assay of the induction of cell death (Fig. 3C, data not shown). These results suggested that HspBP1 antagonizes the ability of Hsp70 to protect tumor cells from anticancer drug-induced cell death. Ectopic Expression of HspBP1 Increases the Susceptibility of Tumor Cells to Anticancer Drugs—To elucidate further the biological significance of HspBP1, we established HeLa S3 cells that stably express EGFP-HspBP1.

Several cystatin family members oligomerize, including cystatin C that forms amyloid deposits associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Our studies demonstrate that CRES also forms oligomers. Size exclusion chromatography revealed the presence of multiple forms of CRES in the epididymal luminal fluid, including SDS-sensitive and SDS-resistant high molecular mass complexes. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CRES is a substrate for transglutaminase and that an endogenous transglutaminase activity in the epididymal lumen catalyzed the formation of SDS-resistant CRES complexes. The use of a conformation-dependent antibody that recognizes only the oligomeric precursors to amyloid, negative stain electron microscopy, and Congo Red staining showed that CRES adopted similar oligomeric and fibrillar structures during its aggregation as other amyloidogenic proteins, suggesting that CRES has the potential to form amyloid in the epididymal lumen. The addition of transglutaminase, however, prevented the formation of CRES oligomers recognized by the conformation antibody by cross-linking CRES into an amorphous structure. We propose that transglutaminase activity in the epididymal lumen may function as a mechanism of extracellular quality control by diverting proteins such as CRES from the amyloidogenic pathway.

We propose that transglutaminase activity in the epididymal lumen may function as a mechanism of extracellular quality control by diverting proteins such as CRES from the amyloidogenic pathway. As spermatozoa migrate through the long convoluted tubule known as the epididymis, they undergo maturation and acquire motility and fertility. Since sperm are synthetically inactive, the maturation process requires the interaction of sperm with proteins that are synthesized and secreted in a region-dependent manner by the epididymal epithelium. Following secretion, the fate of proteins in the epididymal lumen is varied. Some proteins bind to sperm and presumably affect sperm function directly, whereas others remain in the lumen throughout the length of the tubule (1Cuasnicu P.S. Cohen D.J. Ellerman D.A. Busso D. Ros Da G Morgenfeld.V. Robaire B. Hinton B.T. The Epididymis: From Molecules to Clinical Practice. 2002: 389-404Google Scholar, 2Dacheux J.L. Dacheux F. Robaire B. Hinton B.T. The Epididymis: From Molecules to Clinical Practice. 2002: 151-168Google Scholar). Other proteins are present in the epididymal lumen for only a short time, suggesting that their continued presence may be detrimental to sperm maturation and/or epididymal cell functions, and thus selective mechanisms are in place for their removal. CRES is the defining member of a reproductive subgroup of family 2 cystatins within the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors (MEROPS classification subfamily I25B) (3Cornwall G.A. Hsia N. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Cornwall G.A. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Hann S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CRES is synthesized and secreted into the lumen by the epithelial cells in the most proximal part of the epididymis and then abruptly disappears from the lumen a short time later (5Cornwall G.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In vitro CRES does not inhibit cysteine proteases but rather inhibited the serine protease prohormone convertase 2, suggesting an intracellular rather than an extracellular role for CRES (6Cornwall G.A. Cameron A. Lindberg I. Hardy D.M. Cormier N. Hsia N. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although a function of CRES within the secretory pathway of the epididymal epithelial cells would make it dispensable once it was secreted into the luminal fluid, it is not clear why or how CRES is so rapidly removed from the lumen. One possibility is that an accumulation of CRES within the epididymal lumen may be inherently harmful to epididymal cellular function and/or sperm maturation. The cystatins are one of several classes of proteins that are known to have an intrinsic propensity for cellular toxicity because of their ability to form amyloid (7Fernandez A. Berry R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Fernandez A. Kardos J. Scott L.R. Goto Y. Berry R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most proteins fold into stable three-dimensional structures that allow their proper biological function. However, for a select group of proteins, if misfolding occurs, the proteins can oligomerize and form defined higher ordered structures that can lead to fibril formation and deposition of protein aggregates or amyloid that are associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type II diabetes. The 20 or so proteins that are known to form amyloid seem to be unrelated, based on primary sequence, yet during their aggregation they will adopt common oligomeric and fibrillar structures that are detected with dyes such as Congo Red and thioflavin as well as with conformation-dependent antibodies (10Kayed R.

Although amyloid fibrils were thought to be the causative form associated with disease, more recent studies suggest that the oligomeric forms, precursors to the amyloid fibrils, are cytotoxic and may play the causal role in disease (12Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Several cystatins have been shown to self-aggregate and form dimers and oligomers in vivo (13Ekiel I. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1314-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Merz G.S. Benedikz E. Schwenk V. Johansen T.E. Vogel L.K. Rushbrook J.I. Wisniewski H.M. J. Cell Physiol. 1997; 173: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, cystatin C forms part of the amyloid deposits in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (15Nagai A. Kobayashi S. Shimode K. Imaoka K. Umegae N. Fujihara S. Nakamura M. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1998; 33: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), including that associated with Alzheimer disease (16Levy E. Sastre M. Kumar A. Gallo G. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Tagliavini F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the L68Q variant form of cystatin C forms amyloid deposits in the cerebral blood vessels of patients who suffer from hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy and who die from hemorrhagic stroke by the age of 30 (17Olafsson I. Grubb A. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the tendency to aggregate under certain environmental conditions may be a common trait of all cystatins rather than a characteristic of individual family members, and therefore it is feasible that CRES may also have the propensity to form amyloid (18Staniforth R.A. Giannini S. Higgins L.D. Conroy M.J. Hounslow A.M. Jerala R. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To date, whether amyloid can form in the epididymal lumen and affect fertility is not known. However, amyloid fibrils have been found in the blood vessels of the testis and epididymis (19Nistal M. Santamaria L. Codesal J. Paniagua R. Appl. Pathol. 1989; 7: 2-7PubMed Google Scholar) and within the seminiferous tubules of the testis (20Casella R. Nudell D. Cozzolino D. Wang H. Lipshultz L.I. Urology. 2002; 59: 445xxiii-4445xxivAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and L68Q cystatin C amyloid deposits have been found in the testes of hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy patients, suggesting the potential for reproductive pathologies as a result of amyloid formation (21Palsdottir A. Snorradottir A.O. Thorsteinsson L. Brain Pathol. 2006; 16: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Until recently, quality control mechanisms for removal of misfolded proteins have only been described intracellularly and include the rescue of proteins by chaperones and destruction by proteases. Presumably, mechanisms of protein folding control exist extracellularly as well; however, these have yet to be determined (22Yerbury J.J. Stewart E.M. Wyatt A.R. Wilson M.R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A family of enzymes whose members are known to directly modulate protein aggregation and the formation of large molecular weight complexes of both soluble and particulate proteins and thus might contribute to protein quality control are the transglutaminases (TGases). 3The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; tTGase, tissue-type transglutaminase; BOC-DON, butyloxycarbonyl-l-(6-diazo-5-oxonorleucinyl)-Gln-Ile-Val-OMe; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; o-IBA, o-iodosobenzoic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MS, mass spectrometry; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; LC, liquid chromatography. 3The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; tTGase, tissue-type transglutaminase; BOC-DON, butyloxycarbonyl-l-(6-diazo-5-oxonorleucinyl)-Gln-Ile-Val-OMe; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; o-IBA, o-iodosobenzoic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MS, mass spectrometry; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; LC, liquid chromatography. TGases are Ca2+-dependent enzymes that form stable protein cross-links through the formation of intra- and intermolecular ϵ-(γ-glutamyl) lysine bonds (23Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The role of tissue-type TGase (tTGase) in the pathogenesis of amyloidogenic diseases is paradoxical in that some studies indicate a role for tTGase in enhancing protein aggregation, thus contributing to the disease, such as in Alzheimer disease (24Boros S. Kamps B. Wunderink L. de Bruijn W. de Jong W.W. Boelens W.C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Dudek S.M. Johnson G.V. Brain Res. 1994; 651: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas other reports suggest a protective effect of tTGase by virtue of its forming protein cross-links, thus preventing the self-assembly of an amyloidogenic protein into the characteristic oligomeric structure that is cytotoxic and associated with disease (26Karpuj M.V. Garren H. Slunt H. Price D.L. Gusella J. Becher M.W. Steinman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Konno T. Morii T. Hirata A. Sato S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17520-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the studies suggesting that tTGase may act defensively against amyloidogenesis were carried out examining intracellular proteins (27Konno T. Morii T. Hirata A. Sato S. Oiki S. Ikura K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), tTGase is also present extracellularly and as such may perform similar functions as a means of extracellular quality control. Because of the active sperm maturation process that occurs within its lumen, the extracellular environment in the epididymis is unique from other organ systems and probably utilizes multiple surveillance/clearance mechanisms to protect against amyloid formation and the potential cytotoxicities that can be associated with these structures. In this report, we investigated whether CRES is present in the mouse epididymal lumen as high molecular mass oligomeric structures and thus may be a molecular model to examine amyloid formation and its control in the epididymis. We further determined whether an endogenous TGase activity in epididymal fluid may be involved in the oligomerization process and thus may be one mechanism of extracellular quality control. Materials—Butyloxycarbonyl-l-(6-diazo-5-oxonorleucinyl)-Gln-Ile-Val-OMe (BOC-DON) and guinea pig liver tTGase were purchased from N-zyme BioTec GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sigma. Cystamine was from Sigma. All chromatography supplies and [1,4-14C]putrescine dihydrochloride were purchased from GE Healthcare. Animals—Mature retired breeder male CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). Cres 129SvEv/B6 gene knock-out and wild type mice were bred in house. Mice were maintained under a constant 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Preparation of Mouse Epididymal and Testis Fluid Samples—Epididymides were dissected into five segments as shown in Fig. 1, minced in cold 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, and incubated on ice to allow sperm and luminal contents to disperse. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min to pellet the spermatozoa, and the supernatant was centrifuged again to remove remaining spermatozoa. The final supernatant was considered crude luminal fluid. Testes fluid samples were prepared in a similar manner. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Caput luminal fluid for size exclusion chromatography was prepared as described above, followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min to remove particulate material. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Caput luminal fluid was loaded on a Superose 12 size exclusion column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, on an LCC 500 Plus fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were either precipitated with 10% trichloracetic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100 for separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels or desalted by overnight dialysis against distilled water with four changes for vertical SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. [14C]Putrescine Label Incorporation Assay—TGase activity was measured by incorporation of [1,4-14C]putrescine into N,N-dimethylcasein. One hundred micrograms of luminal fluid from the testis and each epididymal region were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm DTT, 5 mg/ml N,N-dimethylcasein, and 0.5 μCi of [1,4-14C]putrescine (specific activity 107 μCi μmol-1). The reaction was terminated by trichloracetic acid precipitation, and protein pellets were dissolved in 25% NaOH (w/v) for 30 min at room temperature, mixed with ScintiVerse® fluid (Fisher), and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). All values were corrected for background dpm levels yielded by a blank control. For some samples, the TGase inhibitor BOC-DON dissolved in Me2SO or cystamine was included during the incubation at varying concentrations, whereas control samples contained equal volumes of vehicle alone. Cross-linking of Caput Luminal Proteins by TGase—Luminal fluid from region I (50–70 μg) was incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm DTT in the presence or absence of 0.005 units of guinea pig liver tTGase. Some reactions also contained 10 mm cystamine or 20 μm BOC-DON or the appropriate vehicle. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm and storage at -20 °C. Recombinant Protein Studies—Recombinant CRES and cystatin C proteins were expressed in bacteria as previously described (5Cornwall G.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with one modification. Linear MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry determined that CRES had a mass of 13 kDa compared with the expected 15.8 kDa. Mutation of lysine 115 to serine (CRESK115S) by site-directed mutagenesis (generated by Iris Lindberg, Ph.D., Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center) alleviated the site-specific cleavage that occurred during protein purification and enabled us to express a full-length CRES protein in Escherichia coli as confirmed by linear MALDI-TOF analysis using a Voyager DE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc). Recombinant mouse cystatin C was of an appropriate mass and did not require modification. Guinea pig liver tTGase was incubated with 10 μg of CRES in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm DTT for the indicated times at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA. Some samples included 20 mm EDTA or 10 mm cystamine during the incubation. To label CRES with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), 0.5 mm MDC was included during the incubation with tTGase, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h. The reaction products were trichloracetic acid-precipitated, separated by reducing 15% SDS-PAGE, and examined under UV. Fluorescent Peptide Mapping and Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Chemical proteolysis of CRES was done according to a previously published procedure (29Fontana A. Dalzoppo D. Grandi C. Zambonin M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of recombinant CRES was incubated with 0.5 mm MDC for 2 h in the presence of guinea pig liver tTGase as described. The precipitated protein was dissolved in 200 μl of 80% aqueous acetic acid, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, o-iodosobenzoic acid (o-IBA) (20 mg/1.5 ml), and p-Cresol (30 μl/1.5 ml). The reaction mixture was incubated overnight for 18 h at room temperature in the dark. Resulting peptides were precipitated by trichloracetic acid for 30 min on ice. The pellet was washed twice with ice-cold acetone and then dissolved in Tricine-PAGE sample buffer while still slightly wet and resolved on 16.5% Tricinepolyacrylamide gels (30Schagger H. Aquila H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The gels were washed with 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol for 30 min, and fluorescent bands were visualized with a UV transilluminator. For mass spectrometry analysis, MDC-labeled recombinant CRES was digested with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed with a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were analyzed by SEQUEST (Bioworks 3.1, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) software, which cross-correlates the experimentally acquired mass spectrometric data with theoretical idealized mass spectra generated from a data base of protein sequences. A mouse FASTA data base generated from the NCBI nonredundant mouse protein sequence data base as well as an indexed protein data base containing the sequence of heterologous CRES sequences was used for the SEQUEST analysis. The search algorithm was modified to include permission of variable mass alterations of +318.16 Da for dansylated glutamine residues, +57 Da for carboxamidomethylated cysteines and +16 Da for oxidized methionines. Peptide precursors containing a modified glutamine residue displayed a 446.22-Da loss for Q-MDC as compared with the 128.05-Da loss observed for the native glutamine during collision-induced fragmentation. All of the peptides except for the proline-containing Gln-89 peptide (Xcorr = 1.85) had acceptable Xcorr scores (4.3 (Gln-13), 2.61 (Gln-58), 3.05 (Gln-66) in the SEQUEST scoring system and were confirmed manually by analysis of their corresponding raw MS/MS spectra. The diminished score for the Gln-89 peptide resulted from its predominant fragmentation at the isoleucine-proline bond. The corresponding daughter ions y3 and b10 exceeded all other daughter ions in relative abundance (Fig. 5C). This unusual fragmentation behavior for proline-containing peptides has been observed previously and has been shown to have a lowering impact on correlation scores (31Breci L.A. Tabb D.L. Yates J.R. II I Wysocki V.H. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Wysocki V.H. Tsaprailis G. Smith L.L. Breci L.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Vertical SDS-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—A glycine-NaOH/sodium sulfate buffer system was used as described (33Acevedo F. Marin V. Wasserman M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 34von Horsten, H. (2003) Anal. Biochem. 316, 139-141Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2.5% agarose gel was prepared by mixing Metaphor®-agarose (Cambrex Bioscience, Rockland, ME) with gel buffer (50 mm Na2SO4 and 0.05% SDS) and dissolving the agarose by boiling. Glass plates from the CBS Minigel System (CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA) were assembled and heated by radiation with a 40-watt electric bulb placed at a distance of 5 cm for about 5 min. The warm liquid agarose was poured between the warmed glass plates, and a Bio-Rad mini-Protean 3 System 10-well comb (Bio-Rad) adapted to only insert 3 mm deep into the agar was inserted. The gel was left to solidify at room temperature for 20 min, and the comb was removed. The gel was then stored at 4 °C for 20 min in order to improve gelation. The gel cassette was placed in the gel box, and the whole apparatus was tilted backward to an angle of 45°. A sealant gel consisting of 20 ml of 1% agarose (UltraPure™; Invitrogen) in anode buffer (50 mm Na2SO4) was poured underneath the gel into the tilted anode buffer tank in order to prevent the resolving gel from sliding through the plates. After the sealant gel had solidified, the tanks were filled with prechilled anode and cathode buffers (100 mm glycine, pH 9.5, and 0.025% SDS). Samples were desalted by dialysis against distilled water, lyophilized, and redissolved in sample buffer (100 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.5, 50% (w/v) sucrose, 0.025% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, trace of phenol red). Small sample volumes were dialyzed using a modification of the microdialysis method described by Sodhi and Rajput 2003 (35Sodhi R. Rajput Y.S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 315: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The samples and marker were loaded, and the gel was electrophoresed at 70 V constant voltage at 4 °C. Gels were stopped when the phenol red dye front had migrated to a point 1 cm ahead of the gel bottom. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE (5Cornwall G.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or by 2.5% vertical SDS-agarose gels (33Acevedo F. Marin V. Wasserman M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 34von Horsten, H. (2003) Anal. Biochem. 316, 139-141Google Scholar). Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine transfer buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.01% SDS, blocked in 3% milk/TBS-T (0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse CRES antibody (1.3 μg/10 ml) in 3% milk in TBS-T (5Cornwall G.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The blots were washed with TBST and incubated for 2 h with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) at a 1:20,000 dilution in 3% milk in TBS-T. Blots were washed with TBS-T followed by incubation with chemiluminescence reagent (Western Pico or Femto ECL; Pierce) and exposure to film. Dot Blot Analysis—Preexisting oligomeric complexes were removed from recombinant CRES and cystatin C proteins by Centricon (30 kDa cut-off) centrifugation. The filtrate was quantitated by BCA (Pierce), and 10-μg aliquots were either frozen immediately or incubated (0.2–0.5 mg/ml) for 1–2 days at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (CRES) or 25 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.8 (cystatin C) to allow oligomerization. Protein samples were also incubated for 2 h in the presence of 0.005 units of tTGase, 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm calcium. The samples were spotted in small (2–5-μl) volumes on to prewet nitrocellulose membrane (Pell Biotrace NT), and a vacuum was applied using a dot blot apparatus without the top until the sample was adsorbed. The membrane was allowed to dry, and then Western blot analysis was carried out as described above using the A11 oligomer antibody (1:1000) (Invitrogen) with the exception that Tween-20 was reduced to 0.01%. Blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-CRES, cystatin C (Dako), or amyloid β (6E10) (BIOSOURCE) antibodies. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy and Congo Red Staining—Monomeric recombinant CRES was prepared as described above and incubated (0.15–0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1–10 days in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Some samples were incubated for 2 h with 0.005 units of tTGase in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm calcium. The samples were removed from 37 °C at various times and stored at -20 °C. Samples (5 μl) were spotted on to Formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh nickel grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) for 1 min, the liquid was removed with filter paper, and the samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. The samples were examined with a Hitachi 8100 electron microscope operating at an excitation voltage of 75 kV or a Hitachi 7650 electron microscope operating at an excitation voltage of 80 kV. The time of oligomerization required to detect the various amyloid structures varied between experiments and may reflect effects of protein concentration and the presence or absence of CRES seeds in the starting preparations. CRES oligomers recovered from the retentate fraction after Centricon centrifugation and stored at 4 °C for prolonged periods of time (>4 weeks) or monomeric CRES prepared as described above were examined for amyloid fibrils by Congo Red staining (Amyloid Stain kit; Sigma). Briefly, samples were spread on a microscope slide and air-dried. The slides were then incubated in alkaline sodium chloride solution for 25 min, followed by incubation in alkaline Congo Red for 3 h. The slides were washed three times in 100% ethanol, followed by PBS, and then mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and examined with a Zeiss Axiostar microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRC digital camera. Presence of CRES Protein Complexes in Caput Epididymal Luminal Fluid—Based on the propensity of cystatins to oligomerize, we investigated whether CRES formed high molecular weight complexes following secretion into the epididymal lumen. We previously have determined that CRES is synthesized and secreted into the lumen by the proximal caput epididymidis (region I), is present in the lumen of the midcaput (region II), and then abruptly disappears from the lumen of the distal caput (region III). Luminal fluid isolated from the caput epididymal regions I–III was centrifuged at high speed to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography followed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an affinity-purified CRES antibody (33Acevedo F. Marin V. Wasserman M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 34von Horsten, H. (2003) Anal. Biochem. 316, 139-141Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the void volume (fraction 13) contained multiple forms of CRES, including SDS-sensitive and SDS-resistant high molecular weight forms. Specifically, the detection of the 15-kDa and N-glycosylated 19-kDa monomeric forms of CRES proteins (5Cornwall G.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in the void volume suggested their presence in large molecular mass complexes that reversed in the presence of SDS. The CRES proteins in Fig. 1A did not migrate to their true molecular weight, since proteins resolved on agarose gels do not separate entirely based"

https://openalex.org/W2005464135,"It has been suggested that cortical neural systems for language evolved from motor cortical systems, in particular from those fronto-parietal systems responding also to action observation. While previous studies have shown shared cortical systems for action--or action observation--and language, they did not address the question of whether linguistic processing of visual stimuli occurs only within a subset of fronto-parietal areas responding to action observation. If this is true, the hypothesis that language evolved from fronto-parietal systems matching action execution and action observation would be strongly reinforced.We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects watched video stimuli of hand-object-interactions and control photo stimuli of the objects and performed linguistic (conceptual and phonological), and perceptual tasks. Since stimuli were identical for linguistic and perceptual tasks, differential activations had to be related to task demands. The results revealed that the linguistic tasks activated left inferior frontal areas that were subsets of a large bilateral fronto-parietal network activated during action perception. Not a single cortical area demonstrated exclusive--or even simply higher--activation for the linguistic tasks compared to the action perception task.These results show that linguistic tasks do not only share common neural representations but essentially activate a subset of the action observation network if identical stimuli are used. Our findings strongly support the evolutionary hypothesis that fronto-parietal systems matching action execution and observation were co-opted for language, a process known as exaptation."

Src activation (signal initiation) by phosphorylation of Tyr-418 occurs at lamellipodia leading edges. However, little is known about Src inactivation mediated by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) Tyr-529 phosphorylation. In an established platelet model cell line (A5-Chinese hamster ovary), we studied the inactivation of Src during αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen with live cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. Imaging revealed highly dynamic Src-Csk interactions at the leading edges of active lamellipodia. The Src-Csk interaction followed a highly dynamic pattern. Every 2–3 min, Src-Csk complexes moved inward in the cell, reorganized, and formed stable focal adhesions. These accumulations were primarily seen during retraction of lamellipodia, whereas no interaction was observed during protrusions. Western blot analysis during the run time of FRET signaling revealed an increase in Csk-mediated SrcTyr-529 phosphorylation with a parallel decline of tyrosine 418 phosphorylation. Mutation analysis provided additional insights into the role of Src. Although inactivation of Csk (CskK222R) had no effect on cell adhesion and spreading efficiency, cells with constitutively active expressed Src (SrcY529F) exhibited hardly any adhesion and no spreading. The few adherent cells showed weak focal adhesions that were disorganized and oversized. The data clearly demonstrate the important role of tight Src control by Csk for functional cell adhesion and spreading. The novel experimental FRET approach reported here for the inactivation of Src can be readily applied to other integrin and signaling pathways, including closely related Src family kinase members.

Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Src thereby regulates the interaction between integrin and the cytoskeleton (5Felsenfeld D.P. Schwartzberg P.L. Venegas A. Tse R. Sheetz M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). From extensive studies with platelets and platelet model cells (A5-CHO), 3The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; Csk, C-terminal Src kinase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SFK, Src family kinase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin. the role of Src in αIIbβ3 adhesion signaling is well described (6Shattil S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 399-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Membrane-anchored Src is constitutively bound to the β3 cytoplasmic tail of the fibrinogen receptor. Fibrinogen binding at lamellipodia leading edges causes microclustering of integrins thus leading to trans-autophosphorylation at Tyr-418, conformational opening, and full activation of Src. Many proteins are known to influence Src activation in platelets. However, inactivation is controlled only by Csk (7Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar, 8Cole P.A. Shen K. Qiao Y. Wang D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). With its Src homology 2 domain, Csk binds to the C-terminal tail of active Src thereby phosphorylating Tyr-529. This chemical clamp mechanism controls Src recognition (9Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The intramolecular interaction of Tyr(P)-529 with the Src homology 2 domain leads to the conversion of Src back to the inactive (closed) conformation with Csk bound to the integrin-Src complex (4Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This Csk-mediated inactivation is observed with all members of the SFK (8Cole P.A. Shen K. Qiao Y. Wang D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Src is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and is, in addition to platelet integrin signaling, involved in other distinct pathways and cellular targets (G-protein-coupled receptors, cytokine and immune recognition receptors, and ion channels) (7Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Src is the first discovered and best studied proto-oncogene. Its role in focal adhesions is associated with cell detachment, migration, and invasion that is important in the spreading of cancer (10Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Increased Src activity has been demonstrated in a number of human malignancies, and control of Src by Csk was associated with the progression of cancer (10Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Higher Src activity or low levels of Csk weakened focal adhesions and supported cell detachment. In nonmigrating cells, Csk was found to co-localize with Src in stable focal adhesions (11Nakagawa T. Tanaka S. Suzuki H. Takayanagi H. Miyazaki T. Nakamura K. Tsuruo T. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Csk overexpression was also found to strengthen focal contacts as seen in a mouse model where overexpression of Csk suppresses metastasis (11Nakagawa T. Tanaka S. Suzuki H. Takayanagi H. Miyazaki T. Nakamura K. Tsuruo T. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results support that Src inactivation mediated by Csk plays an important role in the regulation of focal adhesion formation and stability. However, location and dynamics of this interaction and its role in αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion remain unclear. To address the question of Src inactivation, we used FRET, a noninvasive and stable technique for the imaging of live cell protein-protein interactions that is superior over other protein interaction reporter assays (12Kenworthy A.K. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 14Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FRET is a physical effect (energy transfer) between fluorescent donor (e.g. cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)) and acceptor molecules (e.g. yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)) that only occurs efficiently within the range of molecular interactions. A5-CHO cells, stably expressing human integrin αIIbβ3, were transiently transfected with Src and Csk and labeled with FRET acceptor (YFP) and donor (CFP) molecules, respectively. The Src and Csk interaction was then visualized and tracked in single cells during adhesion on a fibrinogen-coated glass coverslip. This study reveals insights into the inactivation of integrin αIIbβ3 signaling and contributes to a better understanding of adhesion signaling in platelets. The presented FRET approach is currently the only system that reports on Src inactivation and may be used in other cells and pathways. Its extension and use in SFK-mediated integrin signaling pathways may also help for a better understanding of some behavioral aspects of cancer cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Total Src was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody 327 (Sigma) and active and inactive Src with phospho-specific rabbit polyclonal anti-Src_ Tyr(P)-418 and anti-Src_Tyr(P)-529 (BIOSOURCE). Antibodies against Csk (antibody 52) and integrin β3 (antibody SAP) were from BD Biosciences and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Purified human fibrinogen was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). l-Glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and Alfazyme (mild detachment agent) were from PAA Laboratories (Colbe, Germany). Culture media and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. DNA Constructs—Constructs coding for Csk (rat) were kind gifts from S. Nada (Dept. of Oncogene Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Japan) (15Matsuoka H. Nada S. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5975-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Csk_wt (wild-type) and the FRET-labeled Csk_wt-CFP and CskK222R-CFP (kinase-inactive) (Fig. 1) were used. For optimal FRET results, CFP in Csk_wt-CFP was replaced by the optimized CFP variant Cerulean (obtained from C. Krasel, Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Wurzburg, Germany) (16Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) using a PCR-based strategy.FIGURE 4Localization and FRET of Src_wt-YFP and Csk_wt-CFP during fibrinogen adhesion. Cells expressing Src_wt-YFP and Csk_wt-CFP on fibrinogen-coated coverslips were imaged after 25 min of adhesion. A–C, protein localization imaged with confocal fluorescence microscopy (×63). A, membrane-targeted Src_wt-YFP locates to focal adhesions (green arrows) and accumulates at the edges of lamellipodia (white arrows, together with cytoplasmic Csk_wt-CFP (in B, white arrows)). C, overlay image zooms into the boxed region in B (Src_wt-YFP in green, Csk_wt-CFP in red) and shows in more detail the Src and Csk localizations. Partial co-localization (yellow) is visible in lamellipodia leading edges (white arrow) and in focal adhesions (green arrows). D–F, Src-Csk interaction imaged with wide field FRET microscopy (×63). FRET efficiencies range from ∼15 to 30% (color bar). D shows FRET in a single cell whereas E shows 2 lamellipodia of the same cell in an image sequence with the corresponding Src_wt-YFP localization sequence for comparison. Protein interaction mostly occurs in lamellipodia and their leading edges (D, red arrows, EFRET > 25%) and dynamically relocates in moving lamellipodia (E). An inward moving FRET signal wave appears in the white-boxed lamellipodium in E (white arrows). Control cells plated to BSA-coated coverslips exhibit only low FRET levels (F, 15–20%). Cells are representative for at least 20 typical cells imaged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1Schematic representation of Src-YFP and Csk-CFP chimeric proteins used for the detection of Src-Csk interactions by FRET. N-terminally membrane-anchored Src was labeled at the C terminus with YFP (linker length, 14 amino acids). The activating Tyr-418 is located in the kinase domain and the inactivating Tyr-529 in the negative-regulatory tail. Csk-CFP is labeled N-terminally with CFP (15Matsuoka H. Nada S. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5975-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Kinase-inactive Src and Csk are mutated in Lys-295 and Lys-222, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Constructs coding for chicken Src were a kind gift from S. J. Shattil (Dept. of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Division, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla). In this study we used Src_wt, SrcK295R (kinase-inactive), and SrcY527F (constitutively active) pLNCX constructs (17Thomas J.E. Soriano P. Brugge J.S. Science. 1991; 254: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Harris K.F. Shoji I. Cooper E.M. Kumar S. Oda H. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For simplicity reasons, Tyr-527 is named Tyr-529 here following the human numbering. All Src constructs were labeled with an improved YFP variant, Venus (19Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Venus, cloned into the XbaI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3, was received from J.-P. Vilardaga (Dept. of Pharmacology, University Wurzburg, Germany). Src coding sequences were amplified by PCR using primers that introduce BamHI and EcoRI sites and then cloned upstream of Venus in pcDNA3-Venus with the linker EFCRYPSHWRPLET (Fig. 1) and are referred to as Src-YFP constructs. Cell Culture and Transfections—A5-CHO, stably overexpressing human integrin αIIbβ3 (20O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X.P. Glass A.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H.

Blood. 1991; 78: 369-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from M. Ginsberg (Dept. of Medicine, University of California, San Diego). Cells were cultured in growth medium (D5671) as described (22O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) for a maximum of 2 weeks ahead of use to maintain constant integrin expression. 4S. J. Shattil, personal communication. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs recommendations at 90% cell density. To avoid cell density stress, cells were split 1:3 after 24 h and cultured for another 24 h. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested (Alfazyme), washed twice with PBS, and lysed for 10 min on ice with RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 (Sigma), 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). After centrifugation (2 min, 16,000 × g) protein concentrations were determined with the biuret reaction (BCA assay, Pierce). Five μg of total protein were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred by Western blot on nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected using the indicated primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested in RIPA/lysis buffer without deoxycholic acid (inhibitors as described). After clarification, 500 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of an antibody specific to β3 integrin subunit (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by another 2-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow; Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Protein complexes were released by 5 min of boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis, and immunoblotted on nitrocellulose. Proteins were detected using the indicated primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies as described. Src Phosphorylation Assay—A5-CHO cells in 100-mm plates were co-transfected with Src_wt and Csk_wt (or Src_wt-YFP and Csk_wt-CFP) constructs and cultured for 2 days (as described above). Alfazyme was used for harvesting (instead of trypsin) to prevent preactivation artifacts that may derive from partial integrin αIIbβ3 digestion. Cells were diluted in 6 ml of complete culture medium (without penicillin/streptomycin) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, 6% CO2 (resuspension by mild agitation every 10 min). Then cells were plated on 100-mm dishes pre-coated with fibrinogen (100 μg/ml) or BSA (5 mg/ml) according to Ref. 23Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and incubated for the times indicated at 37 °C, 6% CO2. Fibrinogen-adherent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, overlaid with 600 μl of ice-cold, complete lysis buffer, scraped off, and lysed completely for 10 min on ice. Nonadherent cells from BSA plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation and testing with BCA assay methods, equal amounts of total protein were blotted and immunodetected for total, active, and inactive Src. As controls, platelet lysates were used (0.05 units/ml thrombin-stimulated platelets for activated Src; unstimulated platelets for inactive Src). Phosphorylated Tyr-418 (Tyr(P)-418) is the marker for active Src and Tyr(P)-529 for inactive Src. Bands on the x-ray film were scanned and quantified by calibrated densitometry using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Amounts of active and inactive Src were expressed in a line graph as normalized percentages. Therefore, the levels of Src_Tyr(P)-418 and Src_Tyr(P)-529 were expressed relative (in %) to the highest respective level present (100%). Cell Preparation for Microscopy—Cells transfected with Src-YFP and Csk-CFP constructs (60-mm dish) were harvested with Alfazyme 2 days post-transfection, resuspended in 2 ml of phenol red-free and serum-reduced medium (D1145, 1% fetal bovine serum, other supplements as in growth medium, no penicillin/streptomycin), and incubated as described for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated on fibrinogen-coated number 1 glass coverslips (Hartenstein, Wurzburg, Germany), clamped in a coverslip chamber, and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C, 6% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing twice with warm PBS, and adherent cells were overlaid with warm incubation medium and immediately transferred to the microscope. Single cells with intermediate CFP and YFP fluorescence (∼1:1) were selected and focused to lamellipodia regions. Confocal Fluorescence and FRET Localization—Measurements were performed at room temperature on a confocal microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica, Mannheim, Germany). This microscope was equipped with a ×63 objective (NA 1.32, oil), two laser lines (430 nm for CFP or FRET and 514 nm for YFP excitation), and excitation beam splitters RSP455 (430 nm) and DD458/514 (514 nm). The fluorescence was detected by 2 high efficiency photomultipliers (CFP, 463–496 nm; YFP and FRET, 549–600 nm). Cells were scanned at 400 lines/s and with four times averaging. Images (512 × 512 pixels) were optimized and overlay images (YFP/CFP) created with ImageJ. FRET was calculated according to the sensitized emission methods of Ref. 24Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar in which the FRET, CFP, and YFP emission channels were recorded sequentially line-by-line per recorded image. Intensities in FRET images were color-coded (ImageJ). From time series images (every 25 s) videos (“.avi” format) were generated in ImageJ. For more details of the sensitized emission FRET calibration and calculations, see the Supplemental Material. Fluorescence Detection and FRET Efficiency Imaging with Wide Field Microscopy—The microscopic setup used was described previously (25Vilardaga J.P. Steinmeyer R. Harms G.S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A ×63 objective (N.A. 1.4, oil) was used. Donor excitation occurred at 430 nm, acceptor excitation at 514 nm, and both wavelengths of equal intensity (at the objective, ∼10 watts/cm2) were successively switched on (time lag, 100 ms) for 100–400 ms (depending on relative CFP and YFP expression in the individual cells) to obtain fluorescence signals of comparable intensity. Frames were taken every 5 s to track fluorescence or FRET changes. The method has been previously described (25Vilardaga J.P. Steinmeyer R. Harms G.S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency (EFRET) images (150 × 150 pixels) were calculated in ImageJ according to Equation 1, EFRET=IYFP/(IYFP+ICFP)(Eq. 1) IYFP and ICFP are the intensities in the YFP and CFP channel at 430 nm excitation corrected for spectral bleed through factors. Acceptor photobleaching measurements were performed in lamellipodia and proved the presence of FRET by a significant increase in CFP and decrease of the FRET signal after total acceptor (YFP) bleaching. FRET images were color-coded (ImageJ) to better discriminate between signal intensities. Videos (in .avi format) were produced in ImageJ. For more detail on FRET efficiency (EFRET) calibration and calculations, see the Supplemental Material. Immunofluorescence Co-staining of Vinculin—For vinculin immunostaining, Src_wt-YFP/Csk_wt-CFP transfected A5-CHO were plated on fibrinogen-coated glass chamber slides for 20, 30, and 45 min, fixed in 4% (w/v) para-formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and then stained with monoclonal vinculin antibody (1:50, Sigma) followed by secondary Cy3-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The co-localization of the Cy3-vinculin, Csk-CFP, and Src-YFP was imaged with a confocal microscope (TCS-SP5, Leica, Mannheim, Germany). This microscope was equipped with a ×63 objective (N.A. 1.4, oil), three laser lines (405 nm for CFP or FRET, 514 nm for YFP, and 561 nm for Cy3 excitation), and an acousto-optic excitation beam splitter for all laser excitation lines simultaneously. The fluorescence was detected by three high efficiency photomultipliers (CFP, 472–502 nm; YFP and FRET, 520–556 nm; and Cy3, 582–692 nm). The fixed cells were scanned at 400 lines/s and with eight times averaging. Calculation of Protein Expression Levels in FRET Cells—The emission rate of single YFP and CFP molecules as a function of laser excitation intensity was determined on the wide field microscopy setup described above (26Harms G.S. Cognet L. Lommerse P.H. Blab G.A. Schmidt T. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2396-2408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Steinmeyer R. Noskov A. Krasel C. Weber I. Dees C. Harms G.S. J. Fluoresc. 2005; 15: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). With the applied excitation times, laser intensity, mean emission wavelengths, and objective conditions (×63, N.A. 1.4, oil, depth of focus 0.041 μm) the amount of detected YFP and CFP molecules recorded on the CCD camera were approximated. FRET effects in these calculations were negligible (supplemental Fig. 1). Src-YFP and Csk-CFP Expression—For the detection of Src-Csk interactions in living cells with FRET microscopy, the proteins need to be labeled with CFP and YFP. Csk was labeled N-terminally with CFP because this construct had already been successfully used in another FRET study (15Matsuoka H. Nada S. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5975-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Src-YFP constructs were generated by introducing a 14-amino acid linker to the Src C terminus to facilitate Tyr-529 phosphorylation by Csk (Fig. 1). The expression of labeled and unlabeled Csk and Src constructs was tested by Western blotting after single transfection of A5-CHO cells (Fig. 2). Src_wt and SrcY529F were detected at 60 kDa and Src_wt-YFP, SrcY529F-YFP, and SrcK295R-YFP at 87 kDa (YFP, 27 kDa). Csk_wt and CskK222R as well as Csk_wt-CFP and CskK222R-CFP were detected at 43 and 70 kDa, respectively (CFP, 27 kDa) (Fig. 2B). The endogenous expression of Src and Csk was negligible for later FRET signaling as determined by Western blot analysis. In cells co-transfected with Src_wt and Csk_wt constructs, clear expression of both proteins was observed (Fig. 2C) (similar results for labeled Src and Csk; data not shown). Expression of integrin αIIbβ3, stably overexpressed in A5-CHO, was verified with an antibody specific to the β3 chain. The integrin was found to be highly expressed, and the expression level was not altered by transient expression of Src and Csk (Fig. 2, B and C). From single molecule studies examining the fluorescence emission of the YFP and CFP variants, the expression levels of Src and Csk in the monitored cells was calculated to be 2 μm for Src_wt-YFP and 4 μm for Csk_wt-CFP. In platelets Src concentrations have been determined to be ∼25 μm (supplemental Fig. 1). Csk-CFP/Src-YFP Co-immunoprecipitation—For Src-mediated integrin outside-in signaling in platelets, the interaction of Src with αIIbβ3 is critical. Therefore, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to demonstrate the interaction of Src with the integrin. As seen in Fig. 2, D and E, in lysates from fibrinogen-adherent A5-CHO cells Src_wt was detected in β3 immunoprecipitates in complex with Csk_wt. The association was independent of FRET labeling. Interestingly, the Csk-kinase-dead mutant CskK222R is still binding to Src_wt, whereas no binding is observed between permanent active SrcY529F and Csk_wt (Fig. 2E). Csk-CFP/Src-YFP Interaction during Adhesion to Fibrinogen—Because FRET signaling between labeled Src and Csk (showing Src-Csk interactions) has only limited value without biochemical proof of real Src inactivation, we tested Src inactivation in A5-CHO cells co-expressing Src_ wt-YFP and Csk_wt-CFP during the course of adhesion to fibrinogen. After plating for 20, 30, and 45 min on BSA- or fibrinogen-coated plates, cell lysates were tested for Src_Tyr(P)-529 (inactive), Src_ Tyr(P)-418 (active), and total Src content (Fig. 3A). Whereas the phosphorylation status of Src was not altered after plating up to 45 min on a BSA-coated surface (Fig. 3A, BSA), specific changes in the amount of Src_Tyr(P)-529 and Src_Tyr(P)-418 phosphorylation were observed after spreading on fibrinogen. After 20 min of plating, the relative amounts of inactive Src clearly increased whereas active Src in total decreased (Fig. 3A, Fibrinogen). Relative percentages of band intensities from densitometric analysis illustrate this trend (Fig. 3B). Identical results were obtained from cells co-expressing unlabeled proteins (data not shown). In A5-CHO cells transfected with either Src_wt alone or Src_wt in combination with Csk_K222R, no change in the phosphorylation status of Src was observed (Fig. 3C). Before plating, cells already exhibited a considerable amount of pre-phosphorylated Src. Control experiments with cells transfected with Src alone also showed this high pre-activation (data not shown) assuming that the amount of Tyr-418 phosphorylation seen in the Western blots of Fig. 3A is, at least in part, because of incomplete single-transfected cells expressing only Src without the inhibitory modulator Csk. However, for the FRET experiments only double transfected cells were used. Src Co-localization by Csk Occurs at the Leading Edges of Lamellipodia—To assess the subcellular localization of Src_wt-YFP and Csk_wt-CFP, confocal fluorescence images were taken from the basal surface of A5-CHO cells 30 min after plating on fibri"
