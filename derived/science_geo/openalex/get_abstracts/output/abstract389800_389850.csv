https://openalex.org/W1983502810,"Background Stopping a manual response requires suppression of the primary motor cortex (M1) and has been linked to activation of the striatum. Here, we test three hypotheses regarding the role of the striatum in stopping: striatum activation during successful stopping may reflect suppression of M1, anticipation of a stop-signal occurring, or a slower response build-up. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a stop-signal paradigm, in which anticipation of stopping was manipulated using a visual cue indicating stop-signal probability, with their right hand. We observed activation of the striatum and deactivation of left M1 during successful versus unsuccessful stopping. In addition, striatum activation was proportional to the degree of left M1 deactivation during successful stopping, implicating the striatum in response suppression. Furthermore, striatum activation increased as a function of stop-signal probability and was to linked to activation in the supplementary motor complex (SMC) and right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) during successful stopping, suggesting a role in anticipation of stopping. Finally, trial-to-trial variations in response time did not affect striatum activation. Conclusions/Significance The results identify the striatum as a critical node in the neural network associated with stopping motor responses. As striatum activation was related to both suppression of M1 and anticipation of a stop-signal occurring, these findings suggest that the striatum is involved in proactive inhibitory control over M1, most likely in interaction with SMC and rIFC."
https://openalex.org/W1965176643,"The miR-200 family plays a crucial role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition via controlling cell migration and polarity. We hypothesized that miR-200b, one miR-200 family member, could regulate angiogenic responses via modulating endothelial cell migration. Delivery of the miR-200b mimic in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) suppressed the angiogenic response, whereas miR-200b-depleted HMECs exhibited elevated angiogenesis in vitro, as evidenced by Matrigel® tube formation and cell migration. Using in silico studies, miR target reporter assay, and Western blot analysis revealed that v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (Ets-1), a crucial angiogenesis-related transcription factor, serves as a novel direct target of miR-200b. Knocking down endogenous Ets-1 simulated an anti-angiogenic response of the miR-200b mimic-transfected cells. Certain Ets-1-associated genes, namely matrix metalloproteinase 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, were negatively regulated by miR-200b. Overexpression of Ets-1 rescued miR-200b-dependent impairment in angiogenic response and suppression of Ets-1-associated gene expression. Both hypoxia as well as HIF-1α stabilization inhibited miR-200b expression and elevated Ets-1 expression. Experiments to identify how miR-200b modulates angiogenesis under a low oxygen environment illustrated that hypoxia-induced miR-200b down-regulation de-repressed Ets-1 expression to promote angiogenesis. This study provides the first evidence that hypoxia-sensitive miR-200b is involved in induction of angiogenesis via directly targeting Ets-1 in HMECs."
https://openalex.org/W2130392934,"The gabbroic layer comprises the majority of ocean crust. Opportunities to sample this expansive crustal environment are rare because of the technological demands of deep ocean drilling; thus, gabbroic microbial communities have not yet been studied. During the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 304 and 305, igneous rock samples were collected from 0.45-1391.01 meters below seafloor at Hole 1309D, located on the Atlantis Massif (30 °N, 42 °W). Microbial diversity in the rocks was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing (Expedition 304), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing, and functional gene microarray analysis (Expedition 305). The gabbroic microbial community was relatively depauperate, consisting of a low diversity of proteobacterial lineages closely related to Bacteria from hydrocarbon-dominated environments and to known hydrocarbon degraders, and there was little evidence of Archaea. Functional gene diversity in the gabbroic samples was analyzed with a microarray for metabolic genes (“GeoChip”), producing further evidence of genomic potential for hydrocarbon degradation - genes for aerobic methane and toluene oxidation. Genes coding for anaerobic respirations, such as nitrate reduction, sulfate reduction, and metal reduction, as well as genes for carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, and ammonium-oxidation, were also present. Our results suggest that the gabbroic layer hosts a microbial community that can degrade hydrocarbons and fix carbon and nitrogen, and has the potential to employ a diversity of non-oxygen electron acceptors. This rare glimpse of the gabbroic ecosystem provides further support for the recent finding of hydrocarbons in deep ocean gabbro from Hole 1309D. It has been hypothesized that these hydrocarbons might originate abiotically from serpentinization reactions that are occurring deep in the Earth's crust, raising the possibility that the lithic microbial community reported here might utilize carbon sources produced independently of the surface biosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2135166338,"Background White-nose syndrome is a disease of hibernating insectivorous bats associated with the fungus Geomyces destructans. It first appeared in North America in 2006, where over a million bats died since then. In Europe, G. destructans was first identified in France in 2009. Its distribution, infection dynamics, and effects on hibernating bats in Europe are largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We screened hibernacula in the Czech Republic and Slovakia for the presence of the fungus during the winter seasons of 2008/2009 and 2009/2010. In winter 2009/2010, we found infected bats in 76 out of 98 surveyed sites, in which the majority had been previously negative. A photographic record of over 6000 hibernating bats, taken since 1994, revealed bats with fungal growths since 1995; however, the incidence of such bats increased in Myotis myotis from 2% in 2007 to 14% by 2010. Microscopic, cultivation and molecular genetic evaluations confirmed the identity of the recently sampled fungus as G. destructans, and demonstrated its continuous distribution in the studied area. At the end of the hibernation season we recorded pathologic changes in the skin of the affected bats, from which the fungus was isolated. We registered no mass mortality caused by the fungus, and the recorded population decline in the last two years of the most affected species, M. myotis, is within the population trend prediction interval. Conclusions/Significance G. destructans was found to be widespread in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with an epizootic incidence in bats during the most recent years. Further development of the situation urgently requires a detailed pan-European monitoring scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2150734848,"Preventing unintended pregnancy among HIV-positive women constitutes a critical and cost-effective approach to primary prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and is a global public health priority for addressing the desperate state of maternal and child health in HIV hyper-endemic settings. We sought to investigate whether the prevalence of contraceptive use and method preferences varied by HIV status and receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among women in Soweto, South Africa.We used survey data from 563 sexually active, non-pregnant women (18-44 years) recruited from the Perinatal HIV Research Unit in Soweto (May-December, 2007); 171 women were HIV-positive and receiving HAART (median duration of use = 31 months; IQR = 28, 33), 178 were HIV-positive and HAART-naïve, and 214 were HIV-negative. Medical record review was conducted to confirm HIV status and clinical variables. Logistic regression models estimated adjusted associations between HIV status, receipt of HAART, and contraceptive use.Overall, 78% of women reported using contraception, with significant variation by HIV status: 86% of HAART users, 82% of HAART-naïve women, and 69% of HIV-negative women (p<0.0001). In adjusted models, compared with HIV-negative women, women receiving HAART were significantly more likely to use contraception while HAART-naïve women were non-significantly more likely (AOR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.25, 4.62 and AOR: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.88, 2.85; respectively). Among HIV-positive women, HAART users were non-significantly more likely to use contraception compared with HAART-naïve women (AOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 0.84, 2.88). Similar patterns held for specific use of barrier (primarily male condoms), permanent, and dual protection contraceptive methods.Among HIV-positive women receiving HAART, the observed higher prevalence of contraceptive use overall and condoms in particular promises to yield fewer unintended pregnancies and reduced risks of vertical and sexual HIV transmission. These findings highlight the potential of integrated HIV and reproductive health services to positively impact maternal, partner, and child health."
https://openalex.org/W1991744568,"Background Treatment with nucleotide analogs is known to be effective in inhibiting HBV replication; however, patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) often show a wide range of clinical responses to these drugs. Therefore, the identification of an early immunologic marker associated with the clinical outcomes in such cases is critical for the improved clinical management. In our study, we aimed to investigate whether the viral load in CHB patients affected the ratio of the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the number of interleukin-17-producing helper (Th17) cells. Further, we evaluated the clinical implications of the alterations in this ratio. Methodology/Principal Findings Nine patients seropositive for hepatitis B e antigen received entecavir monotherapy for 12 months and the percentages of Tregs and Th17 cells as well as the HBV-specific IL-17 productions in these patients were longitudinally analyzed. The entecavir-induced suppression of HBV replication was accompanied by a rapid increase in the number of Th17 cells, together with a decrease in Treg cells, which lead to a significant reduction of Treg/Th17 ratios. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibited a decreased IL-17 production upon stimulation with the HBV core antigen in vitro. Conclusions The inhibition of viral replication results in an increase in Th17 cells and concomitant decrease in Treg cells. This imbalance of Treg cells to Th17 cells might have an important role in HBV persistence during entecavir treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1987769201,"Tumor cell motility and invasion is governed by dynamic regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The actin-binding protein cortactin is commonly upregulated in multiple cancer types and is associated with increased cell migration. Cortactin regulates actin nucleation through the actin related protein (Arp)2/3 complex and stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Cortactin is regulated by multiple phosphorylation events, including phosphorylation of S405 and S418 by extracellular regulated kinases (ERK)1/2. ERK1/2 phosphorylation of cortactin has emerged as an important positive regulatory modification, enabling cortactin to bind and activate the Arp2/3 regulator neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp), promoting actin polymerization and enhancing tumor cell movement.In this report we have developed phosphorylation-specific antibodies against phosphorylated cortactin S405 and S418 to analyze the subcellular localization of this cortactin form in tumor cells and patient samples by microscopy. We evaluated the interplay between cortactin S405 and S418 phosphorylation with cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating cortactin conformational forms by Western blotting. Cortactin is simultaneously phosphorylated at S405/418 and Y421 in tumor cells, and through the use of point mutant constructs we determined that serine and tyrosine phosphorylation events lack any co-dependency. Expression of S405/418 phosphorylation-null constructs impaired carcinoma motility and adhesion, and also inhibited lamellipodia persistence monitored by live cell imaging.Cortactin phosphorylated at S405/418 is localized to sites of dynamic actin assembly in tumor cells. Concurrent phosphorylation of cortactin by ERK1/2 and tyrosine kinases enables cells with the ability to regulate actin dynamics through N-WASp and other effector proteins by synchronizing upstream regulatory pathways, confirming cortactin as an important integration point in actin-based signal transduction. Reduced lamellipodia persistence in cells with S405/418A expression identifies an essential motility-based process reliant on ERK1/2 signaling, providing additional understanding as to how this pathway impacts tumor cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1977128472,"Ionizing radiation (IR) and bleomycin (BLM) are used to treat various types of cancers. Both agents generate cytotoxic double strand breaks (DSB) and abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)) sites in DNA. The human AP endonuclease Ape1 acts on abasic or 3'-blocking DNA lesions such as those generated by IR or BLM. We examined the effect of siRNA-mediated Ape1 suppression on DNA repair and cellular resistance to IR or BLM in human B-lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and HCT116 colon tumor cells. Partial Ape1 deficiency (∼30% of normal levels) sensitized cells more dramatically to BLM than to IR cytotoxicity. In both cases, expression of the unrelated yeast AP endonuclease, Apn1, largely restored resistance. Ape1 deficiency increased DNA AP site accumulation due to IR treatment but reduced the number of DSB. In contrast, for BLM, there were more DSB under Ape1 deficiency, with little change in the accumulation of AP sites. Although the role of Ape1 in generating DSB was greater for IR, the enzyme facilitated removal of AP sites, which may mitigate the cytotoxic effects of IR. In contrast, BLM generates scattered AP sites, and the DSB have 3'-phosphoglycolate termini that require Ape1 processing. These DSB persist under Ape1 deficiency. Apoptosis induced by BLM (but not by IR) under Ape1 deficiency was partially p53-dependent, more dramatically in TK6 than HCT116 cells. Thus, Ape1 suppression or inhibition may be a more efficacious adjuvant for BLM than for IR cancer therapy, particularly for tumors with a functional p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2012046013,"Dysferlin is critical for repair of muscle membranes after damage. Mutations in dysferlin lead to a progressive muscular dystrophy. Recent studies suggest additional roles for dysferlin. We set out to study dysferlin's protein-protein interactions to obtain comprehensive knowledge of dysferlin functionalities in a myogenic context. We developed a robust and reproducible method to isolate dysferlin protein complexes from cells and tissue. We analyzed the composition of these complexes in cultured myoblasts, myotubes and skeletal muscle tissue by mass spectrometry and subsequently inferred potential protein functions through bioinformatics analyses. Our data confirm previously reported interactions and support a function for dysferlin as a vesicle trafficking protein. In addition novel potential functionalities were uncovered, including phagocytosis and focal adhesion. Our data reveal that the dysferlin protein complex has a dynamic composition as a function of myogenic differentiation. We provide additional experimental evidence and show dysferlin localization to, and interaction with the focal adhesion protein vinculin at the sarcolemma. Finally, our studies reveal evidence for cross-talk between dysferlin and its protein family member myoferlin. Together our analyses show that dysferlin is not only a membrane repair protein but also important for muscle membrane maintenance and integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2098229274,"Background Experimental research has shown that emotional stimuli can either enhance or impair attentional performance. However, the relative effects of specific emotional stimuli and the specific time course of these differential effects are unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, participants (n = 50) searched for a single target within a rapid serial visual presentation of images. Irrelevant fear, disgust, erotic or neutral images preceded the target by two, four, six, or eight items. At lag 2, erotic images induced the greatest deficits in subsequent target processing compared to other images, consistent with a large emotional attentional blink. Fear and disgust images also produced a larger attentional blinks at lag 2 than neutral images. Erotic, fear, and disgust images continued to induce greater deficits than neutral images at lag 4 and 6. However, target processing deficits induced by erotic, fear, and disgust images at intermediate lags (lag 4 and 6) did not consistently differ from each other. In contrast to performance at lag 2, 4, and 6, enhancement in target processing for emotional stimuli was observed in comparison to neutral stimuli at lag 8. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that task-irrelevant emotion information, particularly erotica, impairs intentional allocation of attention at early temporal stages, but at later temporal stages, emotional stimuli can have an enhancing effect on directed attention. These data suggest that the effects of emotional stimuli on attention can be both positive and negative depending upon temporal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2066609193,"Background Early detection of melanoma is of great importance to reduce mortality. Discovering new melanoma biomarkers would improve early detection and diagnosis. Here, we present a novel approach to detect volatile compounds from skin. Methods and Findings We used Head Space Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify volatile signatures from melanoma, naevi and skin samples. We hypothesized that the metabolic state of tissue alters the profile of volatile compounds. Volatiles released from fresh biopsy tissue of melanoma and benign naevus were compared based on their difference in frequency distribution and their expression level. We also analyzed volatile profiles from frozen tissue, including skin and melanoma. Conclusions Three volatiles, 4-methyl decane, dodecane and undecane were preferentially expressed in both fresh and frozen melanoma, indicating that they are candidate biomarkers. Twelve candidate biomarkers evaluated by fuzzy logic analysis of frozen samples distinguished melanoma from skin with 89% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Our results demonstrate proof-of-principle that there is differential expression of volatiles in melanoma. Our volatile metabolomic approach will lead to a better understanding of melanoma and can enable development of new diagnostic and treatment strategies based on altered metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2054108096,"Increased versican expression in breast tumors is predictive of relapse and has negative impact on survival rates. The C-terminal G3 domain of versican influences local and systemic tumor invasiveness in pre-clinical murine models. However, the mechanism(s) by which G3 influences breast tumor growth and metastasis is not well characterized. Here we evaluated the expression of versican in mouse mammary tumor cell lines observing that 4T1 cells expressed highest levels while 66c14 cells expressed low levels. We exogenously expressed a G3 construct in 66c14 cells and analyzed its effects on cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle progression, and EGFR signaling. Experiments in a syngeneic orthotopic animal model demonstrated that G3 promoted tumor growth and systemic metastasis in vivo. Activation of pERK correlated with high levels of G3 expression. In vitro, G3 enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation and migration by up-regulating EGFR signaling, and enhanced cell motility through chemotactic mechanisms to bone stromal cells, which was prevented by inhibitor AG 1478. G3 expressing cells demonstrated increased CDK2 and GSK-3β (S9P) expression, which were related to cell growth. The activity of G3 on mouse mammary tumor cell growth, migration and its effect on spontaneous metastasis to bone in an orthotopic model was modulated by up-regulating the EGFR-mediated signaling pathway. Taken together, EGFR-signaling appears to be an important pathway in versican G3-mediated breast cancer tumor invasiveness and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2008472635,"Recently, a variant of ER-α, ER-α36 was identified and cloned. ER-α36 lacks intrinsic transcription activity and mainly mediates non-genomic estrogen signaling. The purpose of this study was to investigate the function and the underlying mechanisms of ER-α36 in growth regulation of endometrial Ishikawa cancer cells.The cellular localization of ER-α36 and ER-α66 were determined by immunofluorescence in the Ishikawa cells. Ishikawa endometrial cancer control cells transfected with an empty expression vector, Ishikawa cells with shRNA knockdown of ER-α36 (Ishikawa/RNAiER36) and Ishikawa cells with shRNA knockdown of ER-α66 (Ishikawa/RNAiER66) were treated with E2 and E2-conjugated to bovine serum albumin (E2-BSA, membrane impermeable) in the absence and presence of different kinase inhibitors HBDDE, bisindolylmaleimide, rottlerin, H89 and U0126. The phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules and cyclin D1/cdk4 expression were examined with Western blot analysis and cell growth was monitored with the MTT assay.Immunofluorescence staining of Ishikawa cells demonstrated that ER-α36 was expressed mainly on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, while ER-α66 was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus. Both E2 and E2-BSA rapidly activated PKCδ not PKCα in Ishikawa cells, which could be abrogated by ER-α36 shRNA expression. E2-and E2-BSA-induced ERK phosphorylation required ER-α36 and PKCδ. However, only E2 was able to induce Camp-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Furthermore, E2 enhances cyclin D1/cdk4 expression via ER-α36.E2 activates the PKCδ/ERK pathway and enhances cyclin D1/cdk4 expression via the membrane-initiated signaling pathways mediated by ER-α36, suggesting a possible involvement of ER-α36 in E2-dependent growth-promoting effects in endometrial cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073547426,"Background Outer hair cells are the specialized sensory cells that empower the mammalian hearing organ, the cochlea, with its remarkable sensitivity and frequency selectivity. Sound-evoked receptor potentials in outer hair cells are shaped by both voltage-gated K+ channels that control the membrane potential and also ligand-gated K+ channels involved in the cholinergic efferent modulation of the membrane potential. The objectives of this study were to investigate the tonotopic contribution of BK channels to voltage- and ligand-gated currents in mature outer hair cells from the rat cochlea. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work we used patch clamp electrophysiology and immunofluorescence in tonotopically defined segments of the rat cochlea to determine the contribution of BK channels to voltage- and ligand-gated currents in outer hair cells. Although voltage and ligand-gated currents have been investigated previously in hair cells from the rat cochlea, little is known about their tonotopic distribution or potential contribution to efferent inhibition. We found that apical (low frequency) outer hair cells had no BK channel immunoreactivity and little or no BK current. In marked contrast, basal (high frequency) outer hair cells had abundant BK channel immunoreactivity and BK currents contributed significantly to both voltage-gated and ACh-evoked K+ currents. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that basal (high frequency) outer hair cells may employ an alternative mechanism of efferent inhibition mediated by BK channels instead of SK2 channels. Thus, efferent synapses may use different mechanisms of action both developmentally and tonotopically to support high frequency audition. High frequency audition has required various functional specializations of the mammalian cochlea, and as shown in our work, may include the utilization of BK channels at efferent synapses. This mechanism of efferent inhibition may be related to the unique acetylcholine receptors that have evolved in mammalian hair cells compared to those of other vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2033057856,"The polar bear is the only living ursid with a fully carnivorous diet. Despite a number of well-documented craniodental adaptations for a diet of seal flesh and blubber, molecular and paleontological data indicate that this morphologically distinct species evolved less than a million years ago from the omnivorous brown bear. To better understand the evolution of this dietary specialization, we used phylogenetic tests to estimate the rate of morphological specialization in polar bears. We then used finite element analysis (FEA) to compare the limits of feeding performance in the polar bear skull to that of the phylogenetically and geographically close brown bear. Results indicate that extremely rapid evolution of semi-aquatic adaptations and dietary specialization in the polar bear lineage produced a cranial morphology that is weaker than that of brown bears and less suited to processing tough omnivorous or herbivorous diets. Our results suggest that continuation of current climate trends could affect polar bears by not only eliminating their primary food source, but also through competition with northward advancing, generalized brown populations for resources that they are ill-equipped to utilize."
https://openalex.org/W2031642253,"BORIS/CTCFL is a paralogue of CTCF, the major epigenetic regulator of vertebrate genomes. BORIS is normally expressed only in germ cells but is aberrantly activated in numerous cancers. While recent studies demonstrated that BORIS is a transcriptional activator of testis-specific genes, little is generally known about its biological and molecular functions.Here we show that BORIS is expressed as 23 isoforms in germline and cancer cells. The isoforms are comprised of alternative N- and C-termini combined with varying numbers of zinc fingers (ZF) in the DNA binding domain. The patterns of BORIS isoform expression are distinct in germ and cancer cells. Isoform expression is activated by downregulation of CTCF, upregulated by reduction in CpG methylation caused by inactivation of DNMT1 or DNMT3b, and repressed by activation of p53. Studies of ectopically expressed isoforms showed that all are translated and localized to the nucleus. Using the testis-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) promoter and the IGF2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR), it was shown that binding of BORIS isoforms to DNA targets in vitro is methylation-sensitive and depends on the number and specific composition of ZF. The ability to bind target DNA and the presence of a specific long amino terminus (N258) in different isoforms are necessary and sufficient to activate CST transcription. Comparative sequence analyses revealed an evolutionary burst in mammals with strong conservation of BORIS isoproteins among primates.The extensive repertoire of spliced BORIS variants in humans that confer distinct DNA binding and transcriptional activation properties, and their differential patterns of expression among germ cells and neoplastic cells suggest that the gene is involved in a range of functionally important aspects of both normal gametogenesis and cancer development. In addition, a burst in isoform diversification may be evolutionarily tied to unique aspects of primate speciation."
https://openalex.org/W1989452564,"Two-photon scanning microscopy has advanced our understanding of neural signaling in non-mammalian species and mammals. Various developments are needed to perform two-photon scanning microscopy over prolonged periods in non-human primates performing a behavioral task. In striate cortex in two macaque monkeys, cortical neurons were transfected with a genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensor, memTNXL, using AAV1 as a viral vector. By constructing an extremely rigid and stable apparatus holding both the two-photon scanning microscope and the monkey's head, single neurons were imaged at high magnification for prolonged periods with minimal motion artifacts for up to ten months. Structural images of single neurons were obtained at high magnification. Changes in calcium during visual stimulation were measured as the monkeys performed a fixation task. Overall, functional responses and orientation tuning curves were obtained in 18.8% of the 234 labeled and imaged neurons. This demonstrated that the two-photon scanning microscopy can be successfully obtained in behaving primates."
https://openalex.org/W2090306012,"Surface waters of aquatic environments have been shown to both evolve and consume hydrogen and the ocean is estimated to be the principal natural source. In some marine habitats, H(2) evolution and uptake are clearly due to biological activity, while contributions of abiotic sources must be considered in others. Until now the only known biological process involved in H(2) metabolism in marine environments is nitrogen fixation.We analyzed marine and freshwater environments for the presence and distribution of genes of all known hydrogenases, the enzymes involved in biological hydrogen turnover. The total genomes and the available marine metagenome datasets were searched for hydrogenase sequences. Furthermore, we isolated DNA from samples from the North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea, and two fresh water lakes and amplified and sequenced part of the gene encoding the bidirectional NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase. In 21% of all marine heterotrophic bacterial genomes from surface waters, one or several hydrogenase genes were found, with the membrane-bound H(2) uptake hydrogenase being the most widespread. A clear bias of hydrogenases to environments with terrestrial influence was found. This is exemplified by the cyanobacterial bidirectional NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase that was found in freshwater and coastal areas but not in the open ocean.This study shows that hydrogenases are surprisingly abundant in marine environments. Due to its ecological distribution the primary function of the bidirectional NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase seems to be fermentative hydrogen evolution. Moreover, our data suggests that marine surface waters could be an interesting source of oxygen-resistant uptake hydrogenases. The respective genes occur in coastal as well as open ocean habitats and we presume that they are used as additional energy scavenging devices in otherwise nutrient limited environments. The membrane-bound H(2)-evolving hydrogenases might be useful as marker for bacteria living inside of marine snow particles."
https://openalex.org/W1987469328,"The Mre11-Rad50 complex (MR) from bacteriophage T4 (gp46/47) is involved in the processing of DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we describe the activities of the T4 MR complex and its modulation by proteins involved in homologous recombination. T4 Mre11 is a Rad50- and Mn2+-dependent dsDNA exonuclease and ssDNA endonuclease. ATP hydrolysis is required for the removal of multiple nucleotides via dsDNA exonuclease activity but not for the removal of the first nucleotide or for ssDNA endonuclease activity, indicating ATP hydrolysis is only required for repetitive nucleotide removal. By itself, Rad50 is a relatively inefficient ATPase, but the presence of Mre11 and dsDNA increases ATP hydrolysis by 20-fold. The ATP hydrolysis reaction exhibits positive cooperativity with Hill coefficients ranging from 1.4 for Rad50 alone to 2.4 for the Rad50-Mre11-DNA complex. Kinetic assays suggest that approximately four nucleotides are removed per ATP hydrolyzed. Directionality assays indicate that the prevailing activity is a 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease, which is incompatible with the proposed role of MR in the production of 3′ ssDNA ends. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of a recombination mediator protein (UvsY) and ssDNA-binding protein (gp32), Mre11 is capable of using Mg2+ as a cofactor for its nuclease activity. Additionally, the Mg2+-dependent nuclease activity, activated by UvsY and gp32, results in the formation of endonuclease reaction products. These results suggest that gp32 and UvsY may alter divalent cation preference and facilitate the formation of a 3′ ssDNA overhang, which is a necessary intermediate for recombination-mediated double-strand break repair.

Colowick N. Gruidl M.E. Chang A. Harvey A.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 83-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The origin-dependent pathway relies on the host cell RNA polymerase to synthesize an mRNA transcript, which is then processed and remains stably bound at the origin in what is known as an R-loop (2Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

HR is essential to the lifecycle of T4 phage because the origin-dependent mode of initiation ends after only a few rounds of replication (4Miller E.S. Kutter E. Mosig G. Arisaka F. Kunisawa T.

A strong link between recombination and DNA repair was recognized early on using T4 phage as a model system (for review, see Ref. 5George J.W. Stohr B.A. Tomso D.J. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8290-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the late 1960s it was reported that certain genes when mutated severely affected replication, recombination, and DNA repair (6Lielausis A. Epstein R.H. Bolle A. Steinberg C.M. Kellenberger E. Boy De La Tour E. Chevalley R. Edgar R.S. Susman M. Denhardt G.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology. 1963; : 375Google Scholar). Indeed, the current models of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair share many of the same steps as recombination-mediated initiation of replication (7George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).DSBs are one of the most lethal forms of DNA damage, and unless repaired they may lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements, deletions, duplications, or cell death (9Helleday T. Lo J. van Gent D.C. Engelward B.P. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 10Povirk L.F. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1199-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). DSBs are caused by exogenous agents such as ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and chemical mutagens or endogenous agents such as reactive oxygen species. In eukaryotic cells, DSBs are repaired through two pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and HR; however, in T4 phage it appears that all DSBs are repaired through HR (4Miller E.S. Kutter E. Mosig G. Arisaka F. Kunisawa T. Rüger W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 86-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 11Shrivastav M. De Haro L.P. Nickoloff J.A. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar).The biochemical activities necessary for HR have been identified, and in most cases, the proteins responsible for these activities are known (8Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 12San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 13Valerie K. Povirk L.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5792-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HR begins with the processing of a dsDNA end to produce a 3′ ssDNA overhang. In Escherichia coli, this step is performed by the well characterized helicase-nuclease complex, RecBCD (14Dillingham M.S. Kowalczykowski S.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 642-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, the genomes of eukaryotes, Archaea, and T4 phage do not contain any obvious RecBCD orthologs, and it appears that the Mre11-Rad50 (MR) complex together with other proteins specific to each system perform the analogous function (15Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After end resection, the recombinase (RecA or RecA ortholog) binds to the ssDNA and forms a nucleoprotein filament that is capable of undergoing strand invasion and exchange with homologous DNA templates (16Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strand invasion event produces a D-loop structure that acts as a scaffold and primer for DNA synthesis (17Kreuzer K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The HR pathway ends with either the resolution of the Holliday junction by a nuclease or the dissociation and strand annealing of the newly synthesized DNA strands (18Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar).In T4 phage, all of the proteins implicated in HR are well characterized except for Mre11 and Rad50 (gp47 and gp46, respectively) (19Raaijmakers H.

Springer, New York2009: 337-364Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic systems, the MR complex has long been associated with the repair of DSBs (25Sharples G.J. Leach D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1215-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, null mutants of Mre11, Rad50, or Xrs2 (a third protein found in the S. cerevisiae MR complex) are unable to initiate and process meiotic DSBs and are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents that produce DSBs such as ionizing radiation or methylmethane sulfonate (18Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). This led to a proposal that the MR complex is responsible for resection (5′ to 3′ dsDNA exonuclease activity) of DSBs (26Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. White C.I. Fabre F. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3414-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, in vitro, the eukaryotic MR complex exhibits a 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease and ssDNA endonuclease activity (27Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.S. Lee E.Y. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 28Trujillo K.M. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The products of these activities are not 3′ ssDNA overhangs, and therefore, the true function of the MR complex has been elusive.Rad50 is a member of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome family of proteins), which are in turn members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. All known ABC protein family members are dimeric and bind ATP at the interface between two monomers. It is thought that the energy of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive conformational changes within the ABC protein/domain, which are then propagated to other associated proteins or domains (29Oldham M.L. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Most ABC protein family members are membrane transporters, such as the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator transporter and p-glycoprotein, which, when mutated, cause cystic fibrosis and multidrug resistance, respectively (30Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In addition to transporters, the DNA repair enzymes MutS and RecF are ABC proteins. The structure of the nucleotide binding domain of Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) Rad50 has been solved in the apo- and ATP-bound forms (31Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The structures reveal significant conformational rearrangements that occur upon ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, which are thought to control the activity of Mre11 (32Hopfner K.P. Tainer J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Rad50 and related SMC proteins have an unusual architecture where the ABC protein motifs are split by a long coiled-coil region. In Rad50, the apex of the coiled-coil contains a conserved CXXC motif, which dimerizes with a second Rad50 monomer to create a zinc binding site similar to a zinc finger (33Hopfner K. Craig L. Moncalian G. Zinkel R.A. Usui T. Owen B.A.L. Karcher A. Henderson B. Bodmer J. McMurray C.T. Carney J.P. Petrini J.H.J. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The purpose of the coiled-coil motif is not entirely clear, but it is thought to be involved in tethering the DSB to a homologous template or tethering the two ends of the DSB to each other (15Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes the coiled-coil domain contains ∼900 amino acids, whereas in T4 phage the coiled-coil contains around 200 residues. Presumably, the long coiled-coil region in eukaryotes is responsible for the expression difficulties encountered with the eukaryotic proteins. To date, only microgram quantities of eukaryotic Rad50 have been purified (27Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.S. Lee E.Y. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 28Trujillo K.M. Sung P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6036-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Mre11 is a member of the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family, which contains four conserved motifs and requires divalent cations for activity (36Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Although the mutation of Mre11 has only a mild effect in S. cerevisiae (37Bressan D.A. Baxter B.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7681-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), in human cells the nuclease activity of Mre11 is essential, and its inactivation results in embryonic lethality and extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation (38Buis J. Wu Y. Deng Y. Leddon J. Westfield G. Eckersdorff M. Sekiguchi J.M. Chang S. Ferguson D.O. Cell. 2008; 135: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In humans, inherited Mre11 mutations cause ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder, the symptoms of which include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and cerebellar degeneration (39Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The Pfu Mre11 protein is dimeric and binds dsDNA near the dimeric interface (40Williams R.S. Moncalian G. Williams J.S. Yamada Y. Limbo O. Shin D.S. Groocock L.M. Cahill D. Hitomi C. Guenther G. Moiani D. Carney J.P. Russell P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2008; 135: 97-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, in vitro assays reveal that Mre11 possesses a 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease activity along with ssDNA endonuclease activity (27Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.S. Lee E.Y. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Recently, several papers have clarified the role of the MR complex in the processing of DSBs. The Mimitou and Symington (41Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. Nature. 2008; 455: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and Ira and co-workers (42Zhu Z. Chung W.H. Shim E.Y. Lee S.E. Ira G. Cell. 2008; 134: 981-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) laboratories simultaneously demonstrated that DSBs are processed through a two-step mechanism involving the MR complex, Sae2, ExoI, Sgs1, and Dna2. In the initial step, the MRX complex, in conjunction with Sae2, removes ∼100–200 bases from the 5′ end of the DNA. In the second step, ExoI or Sgs1 with Dna2 catalyze rapid and processive removal of thousands of bases from the 5′ end of the DNA. The resulting 3′ ssDNA overhang can undergo Rad51-dependent HR or Rad52-dependent single-strand annealing.In this report, we express, purify, and biochemically characterize the MR DNA repair complex from T4 phage. We find that the T4 MR complex shares all the same activities as its eukaryotic counterparts, but expression and purification of the Rad50 and Mre11 proteins is rapid and yields milligram quantities of purified proteins, which allows for the mechanistic examination of the complex. Our experiments indicate that the T4 MR complex is a DNA-activated ATPase, a Mn2+-dependent ssDNA endonuclease. and a Mn2+- and ATP-dependent 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease. ATP hydrolysis is positively cooperative with respect to ATP concentration, and during the exonuclease reaction four nucleotides are removed per ATP hydrolyzed. Although the observed 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease activity is incompatible with its proposed in vivo function, we find that the presence of two T4 recombination proteins, UvsY and gp32, alter the nuclease activity of the MR complex, which may promote the formation of a 3′ ssDNA recombinogenic end.DISCUSSIONBacteriophage T4 is a well established model system for investigating the biochemistry of proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (3Mosig G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 379-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 52Nossal N.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 53Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Studies using the T4 phage model system led to the first proposed model for recombination-dependent DNA replication (RDR) (54Mosig G. Ehring R. Duerr E.O. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The RDR model begins with the formation of a single-stranded 3′ DNA end that subsequently undergoes strand invasion and pairing with a homologous dsDNA template. The single-stranded 3′ DNA can be formed as a result of incomplete replication of the lagging strand or through the action of a nuclease. Over the past three decades since the RDR model was proposed, all of the enzymes and proteins that are required to carry out RDR in T4 have been isolated and extensively characterized biochemically, with the notable exception of the nuclease complex thought to be responsible for the creation of the 3′ ssDNA overhangs (Rad50 (gp46) and Mre11 (gp47)). Here we have described for the first time the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of the Rad50 and Mre11 proteins from bacteriophage T4.On a qualitative level it appears that the various activities of the MR complex are well conserved between all three kingdoms of life. The T4 MR complex is an ATPase, an ssDNA endonuclease, and a 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease. ATP hydrolysis is positively cooperative and is activated by the presence of Mre11 and DNA. We have found that during repetitive dsDNA exonuclease activity, ∼4 nucleotides are removed for every ATP that is hydrolyzed, and the maximum exonuclease rate is 7.7 nucleotides/s. ATP hydrolysis increases the rate of multiple nucleotide excisions but does not alter the rate of the first nucleotide excision. Interestingly, we have found that two T4 phage proteins that are necessary for the subsequent steps of RDR/DSB repair activate the Mg2+-dependent nuclease reaction, which produces an altered product profile as compared with the Mn2+-dependent exonuclease reaction.To our knowledge, this is the first instance that the steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate constants have been reported for a Rad50 homolog in the presence and absence of Mre11 and a DNA substrate. We found that by itself, Rad50 is a relatively inefficient ATPase, with a kcat of 0.15 s−1. The reaction is mildly positively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.4, indicating Rad50 is a least a dimer, consistent with the structural analysis of Pfu Rad50 and other ABC proteins (31Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 32Hopfner K.P. Tainer J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Separately, the addition of DNA or Mre11 to Rad50 resulted in very minor perturbations in the kinetic parameters of Rad50. In contrast, the addition of both Mre11 and DNA resulted in a 20-fold increase in kcat and an increase in the Hill coefficient to 2.4. These reactions are performed with Mg2+ as the only divalent cation so that there is essentially no nuclease activity under these conditions. This indicates that ATP hydrolysis can be uncoupled from nuclease activity and suggests that Mre11 and dsDNA act as allosteric activators of Rad50. The increase in the Hill coefficient from 1.4 to 2.4 suggests that in the presence of Mre11 and dsDNA, there are more than two ATP sites in communication with each other. It is not clear how this might occur, but it is tempting to speculate that binding of dsDNA promotes hetero-octamer (Mre112/Rad502)2 formation through zinc-hook-mediated tethering of the Rad50 coiled-coil domains (15Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hetero-octamers of the Pfu MR complex have been previously observed in electron microscopy (33Hopfner K. Craig L. Moncalian G. Zinkel R.A. Usui T. Owen B.A.L. Karcher A. Henderson B. Bodmer J. McMurray C.T. Carney J.P. Petrini J.H.J. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and atomic force microscopy experiments (55Moreno-Herrero F. de Jager M. Dekker N.H. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Dekker C. Nature. 2005; 437: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have revealed that DNA binding results in a straightening of Rad50 coiled-coils, which prevents an intracomplex tether (hetero-tetramer) and promotes an intercomplex tether (hetero-octamer).The exact function of Rad50 ATP hydrolysis activity has been unclear (56Kinoshita E. van der Linden E. Sanchez H. Wyman C. Chromosome Res. 2009; 17: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on structural changes between the ATP-free and bound forms of Pfu Rad50, it has been proposed that ATP hydrolysis induces a conformational change that may promote product release (dNMP) or drive MR complex translocation (31Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Our data are inconsistent with the product release model, as the rate of excision of the first nucleotide at the 3′ end of the DNA is not affected by ATP. Additionally, the stoichiometry of ATP hydrolysis is one ATP per four nucleotides removed. If ATP hydrolysis was directly linked to product release, then a 1:1 correspondence between ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide removal would be expected. The data are more consistent with ATP being involved in the translocation of the MR complex after nucleotide excision and release. Because ATP and AMP-PNP do not affect the rate of the first nucleotide excision for either the wild-type or K42M-Rad50 MR complexes, it is unlikely that the MR complex must unwind or open the DNA duplex before nucleotide excision. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis increased the exonuclease rate when the probe is moved 17 bases away from the 3′ end, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for multiple, processive nucleotide excisions. This suggests that the energy of ATP hydrolysis likely drives translocation of the MR complex. Consistent with this, when the probe is in the 17 position, AMP-PNP potently inhibits the exonuclease activity of the wild-type enzyme, and both ATP and AMP-PNP inhibit the K42M-Rad50 MR complex. The observed inhibition is likely due to the stalling of the MR complex after nucleotide excision and product release (i.e. the MR complex is unable to translocate or dissociate from the DNA in the ATP-bound form). In the absence of ATP, the MR complex likely dissociates from the DNA substrate and rebinds at the new ss/dsDNA junction (non-processively). If this interpretation is correct, then the steady-state exonuclease rate constant in the presence of AMP-PNP is equal to the rate of dissociation of the MR complex from DNA. The 1:4 ATP/base stoichiometry suggests that the Mre11 is able to remove four nucleotides before it is required to translocate to the new ss/dsDNA junction. This would require “scrunching” of the DNA, similar to that which has been proposed for the NS3 helicase (57Myong S. Bruno M.M. Pyle A.M. Ha T. Science. 2007; 317: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).The data shown in Fig. 2 are consistent with a 3′ to 5′ dsDNA exonuclease. This activity is at odds with the proposed physiological function of the MR complex, a paradox that has been long recognized (15Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 58Assenmacher N. Hopfner K.P. Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 59Hopkins B.B. Paull T.T. Cell. 2008; 135: 250-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the observed 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is the relevant physiological activity and the MR complex does not directly participate in the production of a 3′ ssDNA overhangs. However, this possibility seems unlikely for the following reasons; 1) it is well established that in eukaryotes the nuclease activity of the MR complex is required for the removal of Spo11/Rec12, which is covalently linked to the 5′ end of the DSB during meiosis (60Borde V. Chromosome Res. 2007; 15: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), 2) the nuclease activity of Mre11 is required for the removal of topoisomerase-5′ DNA covalent adducts that are stabilized by anti-cancer etoposide derivatives (10Povirk L.F. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1199-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), 3) the nuclease activity of Mre11 is required for repair of ionizing radiation-induced DSBs (38Buis J. Wu Y. Deng Y. Leddon J. Westfield G. Eckersdorff M. Sekiguchi J.M. Chang S. Ferguson D.O. Cell. 2008; 135: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and 4) in T4 phage, Mre11 and Rad50 are necessary for the initiation of recombination-dependent replication and recombination-dependent DSB repair, which begins with the 5′ to 3′ resection of a DNA end (7George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Stohr B.A. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even with the above data, the precise role of the MR complex in DSB repair is still an open question, and the polarity paradox remains. Therefore, we tested several T4 recombination proteins for a possible change in the nuclease mechanism of the T4 MR complex. In the presence of MnCl2, we did not observe any significant differences in the rate or product profile of MR nuclease assays in the presence of UvsX, gp32, and UvsY either alone or in combination. However, UvsY and gp32 were found to enhance the ability of the T4 MR complex to utilize MgCl2 as a cofactor for the nuclease activity. We examined the product profile of the MgCl2-dependent reaction in the presence of UvsY and gp32, and in addition to the dGMP that is produced by 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, we also observed a distribution of products in the size range of 15–25 bases. These products could be the result of a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease or an endonuclease activity. We favor an endonuclease mechanism due to the absence of products between 50 and 25 bases, which would be produced if 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity had occurred. Experiments are currently under way to determine the exact nature of the alteration in nuclease mechanism. A metal-dependent change nuclease mechanism has also been observed in the MR complex from the thermophilic organism P. furiosus when assayed at elevated (physiologically relevant) temperatures (59Hopkins B.B. Paull T.T. Cell. 2008; 135: 250-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the case of the Pfu MR complex, the MgCl2-dependent reaction produces a 3′ ssDNA overhang through endonucleolytic cleavage of sites close to the 5′ end of the dsDNA, similar to what we are proposing here for the T4 MR complex.The mechanism behind the increased ability to use Mg2+ as a cofactor is not clear but likely involves physical interaction(s) between the MR complex and UvsY/gp32. Based on our observation that 5 mm MgCl2 does not inhibit the nuclease activity of the complex even when the concentration of MnCl2 is 50-fold lower (0.1 mm), it appears that the affinity of Mg2+ for the Mre11 active site is low compared with Mn2+. This is consistent with the fact that Mre11 crystals grown in the presence of MgCl2 only have one"
https://openalex.org/W2038183258,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is a gram-positive human pathogen responsible for a diverse variety of diseases, including pharyngitis, skin infections, invasive necrotizing fasciitis and autoimmune sequelae. We have recently shown that GAS cell adhesion and biofilm formation is associated with the presence of pili on the surface of these bacteria. GAS pilus proteins are encoded in the FCT (Fibronectin-Collagen-T antigen) genomic region, of which nine different variants have been identified so far. In the present study we undertook a global analysis of GAS isolates representing the majority of FCT-variants to investigate the effect of environmental growth conditions on their capacity to form multicellular communities. For FCT-types 2, 3, 5 and 6 and a subset of FCT-4 strains, we observed that acidification resulting from fermentative sugar metabolism leads to an increased ability of the bacteria to form biofilm on abiotic surfaces and microcolonies on epithelial cells. The higher biofilm forming capacity at low environmental pH was directly associated with an enhanced expression of the genes encoding the pilus components and of their transcription regulators. The data indicate that environmental pH affects the expression of most pilus types and thereby the formation of multicellular cell-adhering communities that assist the initial steps of GAS infection."
https://openalex.org/W2038616074,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and associated with considerable morbidities. Unfortunately, there is no currently available drug established to treat NAFLD. It was recently reported that intraperitoneal administration of taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) improved hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice. We hereby examined the effect of oral TUDCA treatment on hepatic steatosis and associated changes in hepatic gene expression in ob/ob mice. We administered TUDCA to ob/ob mice at a dose of 500 mg/kg twice a day by gastric gavage for 3 weeks. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and hepatic gene expression were examined in comparison with control ob/ob mice and normal littermate C57BL/6J mice. Compared to the control ob/ob mice, TUDCA treated ob/ob mice revealed markedly reduced liver fat stained by oil red O (44.2±5.8% vs. 21.1±10.4%, P<0.05), whereas there was no difference in body weight, oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and ER stress. Microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression demonstrated that oral TUDCA treatment mainly decreased the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis among the components of lipid homeostasis. At pathway levels, oral TUDCA altered the genes regulating amino acid, carbohydrate, and drug metabolism in addition to lipid metabolism. In summary, oral TUDCA treatment decreased hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice by cooperative regulation of multiple metabolic pathways, particularly by reducing the expression of genes known to regulate de novo lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1979918990,"Background In comparison to the comprehensive analyses performed on virulence gene expression, regulation and action, the intracellular metabolism of Salmonella during infection is a relatively under-studied area. We investigated the role of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the intracellular replication of Salmonella Typhimurium in resting and activated macrophages, epithelial cells, and during infection of mice. Methodology/Principal Findings We constructed deletion mutations of 5 TCA cycle genes in S. Typhimurium including gltA, mdh, sdhCDAB, sucAB, and sucCD. We found that the mutants exhibited increased net intracellular replication in resting and activated murine macrophages compared to the wild-type. In contrast, an epithelial cell infection model showed that the S. Typhimurium ΔsucCD and ΔgltA strains had reduced net intracellular replication compared to the wild-type. The glyoxylate shunt was not responsible for the net increased replication of the TCA cycle mutants within resting macrophages. We also confirmed that, in a murine infection model, the S. Typhimurium ΔsucAB and ΔsucCD strains are attenuated for virulence. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that disruption of the TCA cycle increases the ability of S. Typhimurium to survive within resting and activated murine macrophages. In contrast, epithelial cells are non-phagocytic cells and unlike macrophages cannot mount an oxidative and nitrosative defence response against pathogens; our results show that in HeLa cells the S. Typhimurium TCA cycle mutant strains show reduced or no change in intracellular levels compared to the wild-type [1]. The attenuation of the S. Typhimurium ΔsucAB and ΔsucCD mutants in mice, compared to their increased net intracellular replication in resting and activated macrophages suggest that Salmonella may encounter environments within the host where a complete TCA cycle is advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W1979507953,"Background Previous studies indicate that the frequency distributions of HLA alleles and haplotypes vary from one ethnic group to another or between the members of the same ethnic group living in different geographic areas. It is necessary and meaningful to study the high-resolution allelic and haplotypic distributions of HLA loci in different groups. Methodology/Principal Findings High-resolution HLA typing for the Uyghur ethnic minority group using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based-typing method was first reported. HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 allelic distributions were determined in 104 unrelated healthy Uyghur individuals and haplotypic frequencies and linkage disequilibrium parameters for HLA loci were estimated using the maximum-likelihood method. A total of 35 HLA-A, 51 HLA-B and 33 HLA-DRB1 alleles were identified at the four-digit level in the population. High frequency alleles were HLA-A*1101 (13.46%), A*0201 (12.50%), A*0301 (10.10%); HLA-B*5101(8.17%), B*3501(6.73%), B*5001 (6.25%); HLA-DRB1*0701 (16.35%), DRB1*1501 (8.65%) and DRB1*0301 (7.69%). The two-locus haplotypes at the highest frequency were HLA-A*3001-B*1302 (2.88%), A*2402-B*5101 (2.86%); HLA-B*5001-DRB1*0701 (4.14%) and B*0702-DRB1*1501 (3.37%). The three-locus haplotype at the highest frequency was HLA-A*3001-B*1302-DRB1*0701(2.40%). Significantly high linkage disequilibrium was observed in six two-locus haplotypes, with their corresponding relative linkage disequilibrium parameters equal to 1. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree between the Uyghur group and other previously reported populations was constructed on the basis of standard genetic distances among the populations calculated using the four-digit sequence-level allelic frequencies at HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 loci. The phylogenetic analyses reveal that the Uyghur group belongs to the northwestern Chinese populations and is most closely related to the Xibe group, and then to Kirgiz, Hui, Mongolian and Northern Han. Conclusions/Significance The present findings could be useful to elucidate the genetic background of the population and to provide valuable data for HLA matching in clinical bone marrow transplantation, HLA-linked disease-association studies, population genetics, human identification and paternity tests in forensic sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2061579738,"The ceratopsians represent one of the last dinosaurian radiations. Traditionally the only universally accepted speciose clade within the group was the Ceratopsidae. However, recent discoveries and phylogenetic analyses have led to the recognition of a new speciose clade, the Leptoceratopsidae, which is predominantly known from the Upper Cretaceous of North America.Here we report a new leptoceratopsid taxon, Zhuchengceratops inexpectus gen. et sp. nov., based on a partial, articulated skeleton recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Group of Zhucheng, Shandong Province, China. Although Zhuchengceratops is significantly different from other known leptoceratopsids, it is recovered as a derived member of the group by our phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, Zhuchengceratops exhibits several features previously unknown in leptoceratopsids but seen in ceratopsids and their close relatives, suggesting that the distribution of morphological features within ceratopsians is more complex than previously realized.The discovery of Zhuchengceratops increases both the taxonomic diversity and the morphological disparity of the Leptoceratopsidae, providing further support for the hypothesis that this clade represents a successful radiation of horned dinosaurs in parallel with the Ceratopsidae in the Late Cretaceous. This documents a surprising case of the coexistence and radiation of two closely-related lineages with contrasting suites of jaw and dental features that probably reflect adaptation to different food resources."
https://openalex.org/W2095300212,"The RTS,S/AS02(D) vaccine has been shown to have a promising safety profile, to be immunogenic and to confer protection against malaria in children and infants.We did a randomized, controlled, phase I/IIb trial of RTS,S/AS02(D) given at 10, 14 and 18 weeks of age staggered with routine immunization vaccines in 214 Mozambican infants. The study was double-blind until the young child completed 6 months of follow-up over which period vaccine efficacy against new Plasmodium falciparum infections was estimated at 65.9% (95% CI 42.6-79.8, p<0.0001). We now report safety, immunogenicity and estimated efficacy against clinical malaria up to 14 months after study start. Vaccine efficacy was assessed using Cox regression models. The frequency of serious adverse events was 32.7% in the RTS,S/AS02(D) and 31.8% in the control group. The geometric mean titers of anti-circumsporozoite antibodies declined from 199.9 to 7.3 EU/mL from one to 12 months post dose three of RTS,S/AS02(D), remaining 15-fold higher than in the control group. Vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria was 33% (95% CI: -4.3-56.9, p = 0.076) over 14 months of follow-up. The hazard rate of disease per 2-fold increase in anti-CS titters was reduced by 84% (95% CI 35.1-88.2, p = 0.003).The RTS,S/AS02(D) malaria vaccine administered to young infants has a good safety profile and remains efficacious over 14 months. A strong association between anti-CS antibodies and risk of clinical malaria has been described for the first time. The results also suggest a decrease of both anti-CS antibodies and vaccine efficacy over time.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00197028."
https://openalex.org/W1990381800,"Cancer stem cells/initiating cells (CSC/CIC), are thought to exist as a small population in malignant tissues. They are resistant to conventional cancer treatments and possibly underlie post-treatment relapse. The CIC population can be targeted with capsid modified oncolytic adenoviruses.We studied the mechanisms of innate immunity to oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-Delta24 in conventional treatment resistant non-CIC breast cancer cells, breast cancer CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) CIC population and normal breast tissue CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) stem cells. We compared virus recognition by pattern recognition receptors for adenovirus, Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 9 and virus induced type I interferon (IFN) response regulation in these cell types. We show TLR mediated virus recognition in these non-immune cell types. Normal tissue stem cells have intact type I IFN signaling. Furthermore, TLR9 and TLR2 reside constantly in recognition sites, implying constant activation. In contrast, breast cancer CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) CIC have dysregulated innate immune responses featuring dysfunctional virus recognition caused by impaired trafficking of TLR9 and cofactor MyD88 and the absence of TLR2, having a deleterious impact on TLR pattern recognition receptor signaling. Furthermore, the CIC have increased inhibitory signaling via the suppressor of cytokine signaling/Tyro3/Axl/Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (SOCS/TAM) pathway. These defects in contribute to dysfunctional induction of type I IFN response in CIC and therefore permissivity to oncolytic adenovirus.CICs may underlie the incurable nature of relapsed or metastatic cancers and are therefore an important target regarding diagnostic and prognostic aspects as well as treatment of the disease. This study addresses the mechanisms of innate infection immunity in stem cells deepening the understanding of stem cell biology and may benefit not only virotherapy but also immunotherapy in general."
https://openalex.org/W2140144289,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) constitutes more than 90% of ovarian cancers and is associated with high mortality. EOC comprises a heterogeneous group of tumours, and the causes and molecular pathology are essentially unknown. Improved insight into the molecular characteristics of the different subgroups of EOC is urgently needed, and should eventually lead to earlier diagnosis as well as more individualized and effective treatments. Previously, we reported a limited number of mRNAs strongly upregulated in human osteosarcomas and other malignancies, and six were selected to be tested for a possible association with three subgroups of ovarian carcinomas and clinical parameters.The six selected mRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR in biopsies from eleven poorly differentiated serous carcinomas (PDSC, stage III-IV), twelve moderately differentiated serous carcinomas (MDSC, stage III-IV) and eight clear cell carcinomas (CCC, stage I-IV) of the ovary. Superficial scrapings from six normal ovaries (SNO), as well as biopsies from three normal ovaries (BNO) and three benign ovarian cysts (BBOC) were analyzed for comparison. The gene expression level was related to the histological and clinical parameters of human ovarian carcinoma samples. One of the mRNAs, DNA polymerase delta 2 small subunit (POLD2), was increased in average 2.5- to almost 20-fold in MDSC and PDSC, respectively, paralleling the degree of dedifferentiation and concordant with a poor prognosis. Except for POLD2, the serous carcinomas showed a similar transcription profile, being clearly different from CCC. Another mRNA, Killer-specific secretory protein of 37 kDa (KSP37) showed six- to eight-fold higher levels in CCC stage I compared with the more advanced staged carcinomas, and correlated positively with an improved clinical outcome.We have identified two biomarkers which are markedly upregulated in two subgroups of ovarian carcinomas and are also associated with stage and outcome. The results suggest that POLD2 and KSP37 might be potential prognostic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2131214876,"Background AC3 is one of adenylyl cyclase isoforms involved in cAMP and insulin signaling pathway. Recent reports have demonstrated that the AC3 genetic polymorphisms are associated with obesity in a Swedish population. AC3 knock out mice exhibit obese when they age. These findings suggest that AC3 plays an important role in the regulation of body weight. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we evaluated the association between the AC3 genetic polymorphisms and obesity in a Han Chinese population. A total of 2580 adults, including 1490 lean (BMI = 18.5–23.9), 677 overweight (BMI 24.0–27.9) and 413 obese (BMI ≥28.0) subjects were genotyped for 5 TagSNPs in the AC3 gene. Single maker association analyses indicated that SNP rs753529 was significantly associated with BMI in obese subjects (P = 0.022, OR = 0.775 95%CI = 0.623–0.963), but not in overweight subjects (P = 0.818). Multiple maker association analyses showed that the haplotype (G-G-G) constructed with SNPs rs1127568, rs7604576 and rs753529 was significantly associated with obesity (P = 0.029). Further genotyping of SNP rs753529 in 816 children, including 361 overweight subjects (BMI>P80) and 455 controls (BMI = P20–50) were performed, and no significant association with BMI was found. All tests were adjusted for age, sex, physical activity index, household income and/or diet expenses. Conclusions The present study provides replication evidence that the AC3 genetic polymorphisms are associated with decreased risk of obesity among adults but not in children in a Chinese Han population. The data also suggest that the AC3 genetic effects on BMI may have interaction with the factors related to ageing and environment."
https://openalex.org/W2072424194,"Background This study characterizes the historical relationship between coverage of measles containing vaccines (MCV) and mortality in children under 5 years, with a view toward ongoing global efforts to reduce child mortality. Methodology/Principal Findings Using country-level, longitudinal panel data, from 44 countries over the period 1960–2005, we analyzed the relationship between MCV coverage and measles mortality with (1) logistic regressions for no measles deaths in a country-year, and (2) linear regressions for the logarithm of the measles death rate. All regressions allowed a flexible, non-linear relationship between coverage and mortality. Covariates included birth rate, death rates from other causes, percent living in urban areas, population density, per-capita GDP, use of the two-dose MCV, year, and mortality coding system. Regressions used lagged covariates, country fixed effects, and robust standard errors clustered by country. The likelihood of no measles deaths increased nonlinearly with higher MCV coverage (ORs: 13.8 [1.6–122.7] for 80–89% to 40.7 [3.2–517.6] for ≥95%), compared to pre-vaccination risk levels. Measles death rates declined nonlinearly with higher MCV coverage, with benefits accruing more slowly above 90% coverage. Compared to no coverage, predicted average reductions in death rates were −79% at 70% coverage, −93% at 90%, and −95% at 95%. Conclusions/Significance 40 years of experience with MCV vaccination suggests that extremely high levels of vaccination coverage are needed to produce sharp reductions in measles deaths. Achieving sustainable benefits likely requires a combination of extended vaccine programs and supplementary vaccine efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2095436582,"Recent studies have shown that stellate cells (SCs) of the medial entorhinal cortex become hyper-excitable in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. These studies have also demonstrated the existence of recurrent connections among SCs, reduced levels of recurrent inhibition in epileptic networks as compared to control ones, and comparable levels of recurrent excitation among SCs in both network types. In this work, we investigate the biophysical and dynamic mechanism of generation of the fast time scale corresponding to hyper-excitable firing and the transition between theta and fast firing frequency activity in SCs. We show that recurrently connected minimal networks of SCs exhibit abrupt, threshold-like transition between theta and hyper-excitable firing frequencies as the result of small changes in the maximal synaptic (AMPAergic) conductance. The threshold required for this transition is modulated by synaptic inhibition. Similar abrupt transition between firing frequency regimes can be observed in single, self-coupled SCs, which represent a network of recurrently coupled neurons synchronized in phase, but not in synaptically isolated SCs as the result of changes in the levels of the tonic drive. Using dynamical systems tools (phase-space analysis), we explain the dynamic mechanism underlying the genesis of the fast time scale and the abrupt transition between firing frequency regimes, their dependence on the intrinsic SC's currents and synaptic excitation. This abrupt transition is mechanistically different from others observed in similar networks with different cell types. Most notably, there is no bistability involved. 'In vitro' experiments using single SCs self-coupled with dynamic clamp show the abrupt transition between firing frequency regimes, and demonstrate that our theoretical predictions are not an artifact of the model. In addition, these experiments show that high-frequency firing is burst-like with a duration modulated by an M-current."
https://openalex.org/W1977876909,"The problem of reconstructing large-scale, gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has garnered considerable attention in bioinformatics over the past decade with the graphical modeling paradigm having emerged as a popular framework for inference. Analysis in a full Bayesian setting is contingent upon the assignment of a so-called structure prior—a probability distribution on networks, encoding a priori biological knowledge either in the form of supplemental data or high-level topological features. A key topological consideration is that a wide range of cellular networks are approximately scale-free, meaning that the fraction, , of nodes in a network with degree is roughly described by a power-law with exponent between and . The standard practice, however, is to utilize a random structure prior, which favors networks with binomially distributed degree distributions. In this paper, we introduce a scale-free structure prior for graphical models based on the formula for the probability of a network under a simple scale-free network model. Unlike the random structure prior, its scale-free counterpart requires a node labeling as a parameter. In order to use this prior for large-scale network inference, we design a novel Metropolis-Hastings sampler for graphical models that includes a node labeling as a state space variable. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the scale-free structure prior outperforms the random structure prior at recovering scale-free networks while at the same time retains the ability to recover random networks. We then estimate a gene association network from gene expression data taken from a breast cancer tumor study, showing that scale-free structure prior recovers hubs, including the previously unknown hub SLC39A6, which is a zinc transporter that has been implicated with the spread of breast cancer to the lymph nodes. Our analysis of the breast cancer expression data underscores the value of the scale-free structure prior as an instrument to aid in the identification of candidate hub genes with the potential to direct the hypotheses of molecular biologists, and thus drive future experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2073803104,"A key feature of many age-related diseases is the oxidative stress-induced accumulation of protein methionine sulfoxide (PMSO) which causes lost protein function and cell death. Proteins whose functions are lost upon PMSO formation can be repaired by the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) which is a key regulator of longevity. One disease intimately associated with PMSO formation and loss of MsrA activity is age-related human cataract. PMSO levels increase in the eye lens upon aging and in age-related human cataract as much as 70% of total lens protein is converted to PMSO. MsrA is required for lens cell maintenance, defense against oxidative stress damage, mitochondrial function and prevention of lens cataract formation. Essential for MsrA action in the lens and other tissues is the availability of a reducing system sufficient to catalytically regenerate active MsrA. To date, the lens reducing system(s) required for MsrA activity has not been defined. Here, we provide evidence that a novel thioredoxin-like protein called thioredoxin-like 6 (TXNL6) can serve as a reducing system for MsrA repair of the essential lens chaperone α-crystallin/sHSP and mitochondrial cytochrome c. We also show that TXNL6 is induced at high levels in human lens epithelial cells exposed to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. Collectively, these data suggest a critical role for TXNL6 in MsrA repair of essential lens proteins under oxidative stress conditions and that TXNL6 is important for MsrA defense protection against cataract. They also suggest that MsrA uses multiple reducing systems for its repair activity that may augment its function under different cellular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2003940278,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors arrest cancer cell growth and cause apoptosis with low toxicity thereby constituting a promising treatment for cancer. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor activity in lung cancer cells of the novel cyclic amide-bearing hydroxamic acid based HDAC inhibitors SL142 and SL325. In A549 and H441 lung cancer cells both SL142 and SL325 induced more cell growth inhibition and cell death than the hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Moreover, the combination treatment using retinoid drugs ATRA or 9-cis RA along with SL142 or SL325 significantly induced more apoptosis and suppressed colony formation than the single use of either. The expression of the retinoic acid receptors RARα, RARβ, RXRα and RXRβ were unchanged with the treatment. However a luciferase reporter construct (pGL4. RARE 7x) containing seven tandem repeats of the retinoic acid responsible element (RARE) generated significant transcriptional activity after the combination treatment of retinoic acids and SL142 or SL325 in H441 lung cancer cells. Moreover, apoptosis-promoting Bax expression and caspase-3 activity was increased after the combination treatment. These results suggest that the combination treatment of SL142 or SL325 with retinoic acids exerts significant anti-tumor activity and is a promising therapeutic candidate to treat human lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2005078364,"As a first step towards discovery of genes expressed from only one allele in the CNS, we used a tiling array assay for DNA sequences that are both methylated and unmethylated (the MAUD assay). We analyzed regulatory regions of the entire mouse brain transcriptome, and found that approximately 10% of the genes assayed showed dual DNA methylation patterns. They include a large subset of genes that display marks of both active and silent, i.e., poised, chromatin during development, consistent with a link between differential DNA methylation and lineage-specific differentiation within the CNS. Sixty-five of the MAUD hits and 57 other genes whose function is of relevance to CNS development and/or disorders were tested for allele-specific expression in F1 hybrid clonal neural stem cell (NSC) lines. Eight MAUD hits and one additional gene showed such expression. They include Lgi1, which causes a subtype of inherited epilepsy that displays autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance; Gfra2, a receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor GDNF that has been linked to kindling epilepsy; Unc5a, a netrin-1 receptor important in neurodevelopment; and Cspg4, a membrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan associated with malignant melanoma and astrocytoma in human. Three of the genes, Camk2a, Kcnc4, and Unc5a, show preferential expression of the same allele in all clonal NSC lines tested. The other six genes show a stochastic pattern of monoallelic expression in some NSC lines and bi-allelic expression in others. These results support the estimate that 1–2% of genes expressed in the CNS may be subject to allelic exclusion, and demonstrate that the group includes genes implicated in major disorders of the CNS as well as neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2001351790,"Background Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of necrotizing skin ulcerations in distinctive geographical areas. M. ulcerans produces a macrolide toxin, mycolactone, which has been identified as an important virulence factor in ulcer formation. Mycolactone is cytotoxic to fibroblasts and adipocytes in vitro and has modulating activity on immune cell functions. The effect of mycolactone on keratinocytes has not been reported previously and the mechanism of mycolactone toxicity is presently unknown. Many other macrolide substances have cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activities and mediate some of their effects via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have studied the effect of mycolactone in vitro on human keratinocytes—key cells in wound healing—and tested the hypothesis that the cytotoxic effect of mycolactone is mediated by ROS. Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of mycolactone on primary skin keratinocyte growth and cell numbers was investigated in serum free growth medium in the presence of different antioxidants. A concentration and time dependent reduction in keratinocyte cell numbers was observed after exposure to mycolactone. Several different antioxidants inhibited this effect partly. The ROS inhibiting substance deferoxamine, which acts via chelation of Fe2+, completely prevented mycolactone mediated cytotoxicity. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that mycolactone mediated cytotoxicity can be inhibited by deferoxamine, suggesting a role of iron and ROS in mycolactone induced cytotoxicity of keratinocytes. The data provide a basis for the understanding of Buruli ulcer pathology and the development of improved therapies for this disease."

Here we provide proof from experimental infection that abalone shriveling syndrome-associated virus (AbSV) can cause abalone shriveling syndrome. This malady produces histological necrosis and abnormally modified macromolecules (hemocyanin and ferritin). The AbSV genome is a 34.952-kilobase circular double-stranded DNA, containing putative genes with similarity to bacteriophages, eukaryotic viruses, bacteria and endosymbionts. Of the 28 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), eight ORF-encoded proteins have identifiable functional homologues. The 4 ORF products correspond to a predicted terminase large subunit and an endonuclease in bacteriophage, and both an integrase and an exonuclease from bacteria. The other four proteins are homologous to an endosymbiont-derived helicase, primase, single-stranded binding (SSB) protein, and thymidylate kinase, individually. Additionally, AbSV exhibits a common gene arrangement similar to the majority of bacteriophages. Unique to AbSV, the viral genome also contains genes associated with bacterial outer membrane proteins and may lack the structural protein-encoding ORFs. Genomic characterization of AbSV indicates that it may represent a transitional form of microbial evolution from viruses to bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2129451979,"Recently, we described that ATP induces changes in YFP/CFP fluorescence intensities of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensors based on CFP-YFP. To get insight into this phenomenon, we employed fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy to analyze the influence of ATP on these fluorescent proteins in more detail. Using different donor and acceptor pairs we found that ATP only affected the CFP-YFP based versions. Subsequent analysis of purified monomers of the used proteins showed that ATP has a direct effect on the fluorescence lifetime properties of CFP. Since the fluorescence lifetime analysis of CFP is rather complicated by the existence of different lifetimes, we tested a variant of CFP, i.e. Cerulean, as a monomer and in our FRET constructs. Surprisingly, this CFP variant shows no ATP concentration dependent changes in the fluorescence lifetime. The most important difference between CFP and Cerulean is a histidine residue at position 148. Indeed, changing this histidine in CFP into an aspartic acid results in identical fluorescence properties as observed for the Cerulean fluorescent based FRET sensor. We therefore conclude that the changes in fluorescence lifetime of CFP are affected specifically by possible electrostatic interactions of the negative charge of ATP with the positively charged histidine at position 148. Clearly, further physicochemical characterization is needed to explain the sensitivity of CFP fluorescence properties to changes in environmental (i.e. ATP concentrations) conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2010485949,"Background Pluripotent and multipotent stem cells hold great therapeutical promise for the replacement of degenerated tissue in neurological diseases. To fulfill that promise we have to understand the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of multipotent cells into specific types of neurons. Embryonic stem cell (ESC) and embryonic neural stem cell (NSC) cultures provide a valuable tool to study the processes of neural differentiation, which can be assessed using immunohistochemistry, gene expression, Ca2+-imaging or electrophysiology. However, indirect methods such as protein and gene analysis cannot provide direct evidence of neuronal functionality. In contrast, direct methods such as electrophysiological techniques are well suited to produce direct evidence of neural functionality but are limited to the study of a few cells on a culture plate. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we describe a novel method for the detection of action potential-capable neurons differentiated from embryonic NSC cultures using fast voltage-sensitive dyes (VSD). We found that the use of extracellularly applied VSD resulted in a more detailed labeling of cellular processes compared to calcium indicators. In addition, VSD changes in fluorescence translated precisely to action potential kinetics as assessed by the injection of simulated slow and fast sodium currents using the dynamic clamp technique. We further demonstrate the use of a finite element model of the NSC culture cover slip for optimizing electrical stimulation parameters. Conclusions/Significance Our method allows for a repeatable fast and accurate stimulation of neurons derived from stem cell cultures to assess their differentiation state, which is capable of monitoring large amounts of cells without harming the overall culture."
https://openalex.org/W1975765143,"Background Epigenetic mechanisms, via post-translational histone modifications, have roles in the establishment and maintenance of latency of the HSV-1 genome in the sensory neurons. Considering that many post-translational histone marks are reversible in nature, epigenetic mechanisms may also play a critical role in the process of induced HSV-1 reactivation. Methodology/Principal Findings This study utilized the rabbit ocular model of HSV-1 infection and reactivation, induced by the transcorneal iontophoresis of epinephrine (TCIE), to characterize changes to chromatin that occur between 0.5 and 4 h following the application of the reactivation stimulus. Our goal was to explore the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling is an early and essential step in the process of HSV-1 reactivation. Analysis of the HSV-1 latently infected rabbit trigeminal ganglia (TG) showed that enrichment of the euchromatic marker H3K4me2 significantly decreased in the LAT 5′exon region (∼2.5-fold) and significantly increased in the lytic ICP4 promoter region (∼3-fold) by 1 h post-TCIE in the highly efficient reactivating McKrae strain of HSV-1. In contrast, we observed no significant change in the euchromatic marks of H3K4me2 associated with LAT 5′exon or ICP4 promoter regions of the poorly reactivating KOS strain of HSV-1 following TCIE through 4 h. The implication that these observed epigenetic changes were linked to transcriptional activity was confirmed by qRT-PCR examining both LAT and lytic transcript abundance following TCIE. We found a significant decrease in the abundance of LAT RNA by 2 h post-iontophoresis of epinephrine coupled to an increase in the transcript abundance of ICP4 in the McKrae strain of HSV-1. By comparison, we observed no change in the LAT or ICP4 transcript abundance of the poor reactivator KOS following iontophoresis of epinephrine through 4 h. Conclusions/Significance Our results implicate that chromatin remodeling is an early and essential step involved in the process of in vivo HSV-1 reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1995346417,"Gene expression as governed by the interplay of the components of regulatory networks is indeed one of the most complex fundamental processes in biological systems. Although several methods have been published to unravel the hierarchical structure of regulatory networks, weaknesses such as the incorrect or inconsistent assignment of elements to their hierarchical levels, the incapability to cope with cyclic dependencies within the networks or the need for a manual curation to retrieve non-overlapping levels remain unsolved.We developed HiNO as a significant improvement of the so-called breadth-first-search (BFS) method. While BFS is capable of determining the overall hierarchical structures from gene regulatory networks, it especially has problems solving feed-forward type of loops leading to conflicts within the level assignments. We resolved these problems by adding a recursive correction approach consisting of two steps. First each vertex is placed on the lowest level that this vertex and its regulating vertices are assigned to (downgrade procedure). Second, vertices are assigned to the next higher level (upgrade procedure) if they have successors with the same level assignment and have themselves no regulators. We evaluated HiNO by comparing it with the BFS method by applying them to the regulatory networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, respectively. The comparison shows clearly how conflicts in level assignment are resolved in HiNO in order to produce correct hierarchical structures even on the local levels in an automated fashion.We showed that the resolution of conflicting assignments clearly improves the BFS-method. While we restricted our analysis to gene regulatory networks, our approach is suitable to deal with any directed hierarchical networks structure such as the interaction of microRNAs or the action of non-coding RNAs in general. Furthermore we provide a user-friendly web-interface for HiNO that enables the extraction of the hierarchical structure of any directed regulatory network.HiNO is freely accessible at http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/hino/."
https://openalex.org/W2004059218,"Funduscopy is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in the ophthalmic practice, allowing for a ready assessment of pathological changes in the retinal vasculature and the outer retina. This non-invasive technique has so far been rarely used in animal model for ophthalmic diseases, albeit its potential as a screening assay in genetic screens. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is well suited for such genetic screens for ocular alterations. Therefore we developed funduscopy in adult zebrafish and employed it as a screening tool to find alterations in the anterior segment and the fundus of the eye of genetically modified adult animals.A stereomicroscope with coaxial reflected light illumination was used to obtain fundus color images of the zebrafish. In order to find lens and retinal alterations, a pilot screen of 299 families of the F3 generation of ENU-treated adult zebrafish was carried out.Images of the fundus of the eye and the anterior segment can be rapidly obtained and be used to identify alterations in genetically modified animals. A number of putative mutants with cataracts, defects in the cornea, eye pigmentation, ocular vessels and retina were identified. This easily implemented method can also be used to obtain fundus images from rodent retinas.In summary, we present funduscopy as a valuable tool to analyse ocular abnormalities in adult zebrafish and other small animal models. A proof of principle screen identified a number of putative mutants, making funduscopy based screens in zebrafish feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2105527830,"The perception of global form requires integration of local visual cues across space and is the foundation for object recognition. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the location and time course of neuronal activity associated with the perception of global structure from local image features. To minimize neuronal activity to low-level stimulus properties, such as luminance and contrast, the local image features were held constant during all phases of the MEG recording. This allowed us to assess the relative importance of striate (V1) versus extrastriate cortex in global form perception.Stimuli were horizontal, rotational and radial Glass patterns. Glass patterns without coherent structure were viewed during the baseline period to ensure neuronal responses reflected perception of structure and not changes in local image features. The spatial distribution of task-related changes in source power was mapped using Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry (SAM), and the time course of activity within areas of maximal power change was determined by calculating time-frequency plots using a Hilbert transform. For six out of eight observers, passive viewing of global structure was associated with a reduction in 10-20 Hz cortical oscillatory power within extrastriate occipital cortex. The location of greatest power change was the same for each pattern type, being close to or within visual area V3a. No peaks of activity were observed in area V1. Time-frequency analyses indicated that neural activity was least for horizontal patterns.We conclude: (i) visual area V3a is involved in the analysis of global form; (ii) the neural signature for perception of structure, as assessed using MEG, is a reduction in 10-20 Hz oscillatory power; (iii) different neural processes may underlie the perception of horizontal as opposed to radial or rotational structure; and (iv) area V1 is not strongly activated by global form in Glass patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2053512041,"Background There has been plentiful evidence of kinesthetically induced rapid compensation for unanticipated perturbation in speech articulatory movements. However, the role of auditory information in stabilizing articulation has been little studied except for the control of voice fundamental frequency, voice amplitude and vowel formant frequencies. Although the influence of auditory information on the articulatory control process is evident in unintended speech errors caused by delayed auditory feedback, the direct and immediate effect of auditory alteration on the movements of articulators has not been clarified. Methodology/Principal Findings This work examined whether temporal changes in the auditory feedback of bilabial plosives immediately affects the subsequent lip movement. We conducted experiments with an auditory feedback alteration system that enabled us to replace or block speech sounds in real time. Participants were asked to produce the syllable /pa/ repeatedly at a constant rate. During the repetition, normal auditory feedback was interrupted, and one of three pre-recorded syllables /pa/, /Φa/, or /pi/, spoken by the same participant, was presented once at a different timing from the anticipated production onset, while no feedback was presented for subsequent repetitions. Comparisons of the labial distance trajectories under altered and normal feedback conditions indicated that the movement quickened during the short period immediately after the alteration onset, when /pa/ was presented 50 ms before the expected timing. Such change was not significant under other feedback conditions we tested. Conclusions/Significance The earlier articulation rapidly induced by the progressive auditory input suggests that a compensatory mechanism helps to maintain a constant speech rate by detecting errors between the internally predicted and actually provided auditory information associated with self movement. The timing- and context-dependent effects of feedback alteration suggest that the sensory error detection works in a temporally asymmetric window where acoustic features of the syllable to be produced may be coded."
https://openalex.org/W2166036411,"Identification of a small panel of population structure informative markers can reduce genotyping cost and is useful in various applications, such as ancestry inference in association mapping, forensics and evolutionary theory in population genetics. Traditional methods to ascertain ancestral informative markers usually require the prior knowledge of individual ancestry and have difficulty for admixed populations. Recently Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been employed with success to select SNPs which are highly correlated with top significant principal components (PCs) without use of individual ancestral information. The approach is also applicable to admixed populations. Here we propose a novel approach based on our recent result on summarizing population structure by graph Laplacian eigenfunctions, which differs from PCA in that it is geometric and robust to outliers. Our approach also takes advantage of the priori sparseness of informative markers in the genome. Through simulation of a ring population and the real global population sample HGDP of 650K SNPs genotyped in 940 unrelated individuals, we validate the proposed algorithm at selecting most informative markers, a small fraction of which can recover the similar underlying population structure efficiently. Employing a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict individuals' continental memberships on HGDP dataset of seven continents, we demonstrate that the selected SNPs by our method are more informative but less redundant than those selected by PCA. Our algorithm is a promising tool in genome-wide association studies and population genetics, facilitating the selection of structure informative markers, efficient detection of population substructure and ancestral inference."
https://openalex.org/W2041439093,"Background We have previously shown that serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is down-regulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) with respect to normal tissue. As hyper-methylation of promoter regions is a well-known mechanism of gene silencing in cancer, we tested whether the SGK1 promoter region was methylated in colonic tumour samples. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the methylation profile of the two CpG islands present in the promoter region of SGK1 in a panel of 5 colorectal cancer cell lines by sequencing clones of bisulphite-treated DNA samples. We further confirmed our findings in a panel of 10 normal and 10 tumour colonic tissue samples of human origin. We observed CpG methylation only in the smaller and more distal CpG island in the promoter region of SGK1 in both normal and tumour samples of colonic origin. We further identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1743963) which affects methylation of the corresponding CpG. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that even though partial methylation of the promoter region of SGK1 is present, this does not account for the different expression levels seen between normal and tumour tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2061556460,"Background Heritability in mate preferences is assumed by models of sexual selection, and preference evolution may contribute to adaptation to changing environments. However, mate preference is difficult to measure in natural populations as detailed data on mate availability and mate sampling are usually missing. Often the only available information is the ornamentation of the actual mate. The single long-term quantitative genetic study of a wild population found low heritability in female mate ornamentation in Swedish collared flycatchers. One potentially important cause of low heritability in mate ornamentation at the population level is reduced mate preference expression among inexperienced individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings Applying animal model analyses to 21 years of data from a Hungarian collared flycatcher population, we found that additive genetic variance was 50 percent and significant for ornament expression in males, but less than 5 percent and non-significant for mate ornamentation treated as a female trait. Female breeding experience predicted breeding date and clutch size, but mate ornamentation and its variance components were unrelated to experience. Although we detected significant area and year effects on mate ornamentation, more than 85 percent of variance in this trait remained unexplained. Moreover, the effects of area and year on mate ornamentation were also highly positively correlated between inexperienced and experienced females, thereby acting to remove difference between the two groups. Conclusions/Significance The low heritability of mate ornamentation was apparently not explained by the presence of inexperienced individuals. Our results further indicate that the expression of mate ornamentation is dominated by temporal and spatial constraints and unmeasured background factors. Future studies should reduce unexplained variance or use alternative measures of mate preference. The heritability of mate preference in the wild remains a principal but unresolved question in evolutionary ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2082635753,"Technology advances have promoted gene-based sequencing studies with the aim of identifying rare mutations responsible for complex diseases. A complication in these types of association studies is that the vast majority of non-synonymous mutations are believed to be neutral to phenotypes. It is thus critical to distinguish potential causative variants from neutral variation before performing association tests. In this study, we used existing predicting algorithms to predict functional amino acid substitutions, and incorporated that information into association tests. Using simulations, we comprehensively studied the effects of several influential factors, including the sensitivity and specificity of functional variant predictions, number of variants, and proportion of causative variants, on the performance of association tests. Our results showed that incorporating information regarding functional variants obtained from existing prediction algorithms improves statistical power under certain conditions, particularly when the proportion of causative variants is moderate. The application of the proposed tests to a real sequencing study confirms our conclusions. Our work may help investigators who are planning to pursue gene-based sequencing studies."
https://openalex.org/W2115738031,"Although there have been a few reports that the HIV-1 genome can be selectively integrated into the genomic DNA of cultured host cell, the biochemistry of integration selectivity has not been fully understood. We modified the in vitro integration reaction protocol and developed a reaction system with higher efficiency. We used a substrate repeat, 5'-(GTCCCTTCCCAGT)(n)(ACTGGGAAGGGAC)(n)-3', and a modified sequence DNA ligated into a circular plasmid. CAGT and ACTG (shown in italics in the above sequence) in the repeat units originated from the HIV-1 proviral genome ends. Following the incubation of the HIV-1 genome end cDNA and recombinant integrase for the formation of the pre-integration (PI) complex, substrate DNA was reacted with this complex. It was confirmed that the integration selectively occurred in the middle segment of the repeat sequence. In addition, integration frequency and selectivity were positively correlated with repeat number n. On the other hand, both frequency and selectivity decreased markedly when using sequences with deletion of CAGT in the middle position of the original target sequence. Moreover, on incubation with the deleted DNAs and original sequence, the integration efficiency and selectivity for the original target sequence were significantly reduced, which indicated interference effects by the deleted sequence DNAs. Efficiency and selectivity were also found to vary discontinuously with changes in manganese dichloride concentration in the reaction buffer, probably due to its influence on the secondary structure of substrate DNA. Finally, integrase was found to form oligomers on the binding site and substrate DNA formed a loop-like structure. In conclusion, there is a considerable selectivity in HIV-integration into the specified sequence; however, similar DNA sequences can interfere with the integration process, and it is therefore difficult for in vivo integration to occur selectively in the actual host genome DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2060767089,"The human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) gene comprises at least 6 different transcription units (TU-1, -1A, -1B, -1C, -1D and -1E), and is regulated by no less than 6 different promoters. The best characterized are TU-1 and TU-1A: TU-1 is responsible for producing plasma SHBG, while TU-1A is transcribed and translated in the testis. Transcription of the recently described TU-1B, -1C, and -1D has been demonstrated in human prostate tissue and prostate cancer cell lines, as well as in other human cell lines such as HeLa, HepG2, HeK 293, CW 9019 and imr 32. However, there are no reported data demonstrating their translation. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether TU-1A and TU-1B are indeed translated in the human prostate and whether 5' UTR exons 1A and 1B differently regulate SHBG translation.Cis-regulatory elements that could potentially regulate translation were identified within the 5'UTRs of SHBG TU-1A and TU-1B. Although full-length SHBG TU-1A and TU-1B mRNAs were present in prostate cancer cell lines, the endogenous SHBG protein was not detected by western blot in any of them. LNCaP prostate cancer cells transfected with several SHBG constructs containing exons 2 to 8 but lacking the 5'UTR sequence did show SHBG translation, whereas inclusion of the 5'UTR sequences of either exon 1A or 1B caused a dramatic decrease in SHBG protein levels. The molecular weight of SHBG did not vary between cells transfected with constructs with or without the 5'UTR sequence, thus confirming that the first in-frame ATG of exon 2 is the translation start site of TU-1A and TU-1B.The use of alternative SHBG first exons 1A and 1B differentially inhibits translation from the ATG situated in exon 2, which codes for methionine 30 of transcripts that begin with the exon 1 sequence."
