https://openalex.org/W1561347022,"When intense light interacts with an atomic gas, recollision between an ionizing electron and its parent ion creates high-order harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency. This sub-cycle effect generates coherent soft X-rays and attosecond pulses, and provides a means to image molecular orbitals. Recently, high harmonics have been generated from bulk crystals, but what mechanism dominates the emission remains uncertain. To resolve this issue, we adapt measurement methods from gas-phase research to solid zinc oxide driven by mid-infrared laser fields of 0.25 volts per ångström. We find that when we alter the generation process with a second-harmonic beam, the modified harmonic spectrum bears the signature of a generalized recollision between an electron and its associated hole. In addition, we find that solid-state high harmonics are perturbed by fields so weak that they are present in conventional electronic circuits, thus opening a route to integrate electronics with attosecond and high-harmonic technology. Future experiments will permit the band structure of a solid to be tomographically reconstructed."

https://openalex.org/W1604168172,"Exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars may lose some fraction of their atmospheres because of the extreme irradiation. Atmospheric mass loss primarily affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to the suggestion that hot rocky planets might have begun as Neptune-like, but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres; however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit signatures than in the optical spectrum. Here we report that in the ultraviolet the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths of 56.3 ± 3.5% (1σ), far beyond the 0.69% optical transit depth. The ultraviolet transits repeatedly start about two hours before, and end more than three hours after the approximately one hour optical transit, which is substantially different from one previous claim (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of about 10(8)-10(9) grams per second, which is far too small to deplete the atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would have been much greater in the past."
https://openalex.org/W1524555145,"The rest-frame ultraviolet properties of galaxies during the first three billion years of cosmic time (redshift z > 4) indicate a rapid evolution in the dust obscuration of such galaxies. This evolution implies a change in the average properties of the interstellar medium, but the measurements are systematically uncertain owing to untested assumptions and the inability to detect heavily obscured regions of the galaxies. Previous attempts to measure the interstellar medium directly in normal galaxies at these redshifts have failed for a number of reasons, with two notable exceptions. Here we report measurements of the forbidden C ii emission (that is, [C II]) from gas, and the far-infrared emission from dust, in nine typical star-forming galaxies about one billion years after the Big Bang (z ≈ 5-6). We find that these galaxies have thermal emission that is less than 1/12 that of similar systems about two billion years later, and enhanced [C II] emission relative to the far-infrared continuum, confirming a strong evolution in the properties of the interstellar medium in the early Universe. The gas is distributed over scales of one to eight kiloparsecs, and shows diverse dynamics within the sample. These results are consistent with early galaxies having significantly less dust than typical galaxies seen at z < 3 and being comparable in dust content to local low-metallicity systems."
https://openalex.org/W1899376386,"Tumour formation is blocked by two barriers: replicative senescence and crisis. Senescence is triggered by short telomeres and is bypassed by disruption of tumour-suppressive pathways. After senescence bypass, cells undergo crisis, during which almost all of the cells in the population die. Cells that escape crisis harbour unstable genomes and other parameters of transformation. The mechanism of cell death during crisis remains unexplained. Here we show that human cells in crisis undergo spontaneous mitotic arrest, resulting in death during mitosis or in the following cell cycle. This phenotype is induced by loss of p53 function, and is suppressed by telomerase overexpression. Telomere fusions triggered mitotic arrest in p53-compromised non-crisis cells, indicating that such fusions are the underlying cause of cell death. Exacerbation of mitotic telomere deprotection by partial TRF2 (also known as TERF2) knockdown increased the ratio of cells that died during mitotic arrest and sensitized cancer cells to mitotic poisons. We propose a crisis pathway wherein chromosome fusions induce mitotic arrest, resulting in mitotic telomere deprotection and cell death, thereby eliminating precancerous cells from the population."
https://openalex.org/W2131116946,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with type II diabetes (T2D) and obesity in several epidemiologic studies. To determine whether AD neuropathology can cause peripheral metabolic impairments, we investigated metabolic parameters in the triple-transgenic (3xTg)-AD mouse model of AD, compared with those in nontransgenic (non-Tg) controls, at 6, 8, and 14 mo of age. We found a more pronounced cortical Aβ accumulation (2- and 3.5-fold increase in Aβ42 in the soluble and insoluble protein fractions, respectively) in female 3xTg-AD mice than in the males. Furthermore, female 3xTg-AD mice displayed a significant deterioration in glucose tolerance (AUC, +118% vs. non-Tg mice at 14 mo). Fasting plasma insulin levels rose 2.5-fold from 6 to 14 mo of age in female 3xTg-AD mice. Glucose intolerance and cortical amyloid pathology worsened with age, and both were more pronounced in the females. Pancreatic amyloidopathy was revealed and could underlie the observed deficit in glycemic response in 3xTg-AD mice. The present results suggest that AD-like neuropathology extends to the pancreas in the 3xTg-AD mouse, leading to glucose intolerance and contributing to a pathologic self-amplifying loop between AD and T2D."

https://openalex.org/W3124373098,"Quantitative public financial management research focused on local governments is limited by the absence of a common database for empirical analysis. While the U.S. Census Bureau distributes government finance data that some scholars have utilized, the arduous process of collecting, interpreting, and organizing the data has led its adoption to be prohibitive and inconsistent. In this article we offer a single, coherent resource that contains all of the government financial data from 1967-2012, uses easy to understand natural-language variable names, and will be extended when new data is available."
https://openalex.org/W165348403,"Significant efforts are underway within the biomedical research community to encourage sharing and reuse of research data in order to enhance research reproducibility and enable scientific discovery. While some technological challenges do exist, many of the barriers to sharing and reuse are social in nature, arising from researchers' concerns about and attitudes toward sharing their data. In addition, clinical and basic science researchers face their own unique sets of challenges to sharing data within their communities. This study investigates these differences in experiences with and perceptions about sharing data, as well as barriers to sharing among clinical and basic science researchers.Clinical and basic science researchers in the Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health were surveyed about their attitudes toward and experiences with sharing and reusing research data. Of 190 respondents to the survey, the 135 respondents who identified themselves as clinical or basic science researchers were included in this analysis. Odds ratio and Fisher's exact tests were the primary methods to examine potential relationships between variables. Worst-case scenario sensitivity tests were conducted when necessary.While most respondents considered data sharing and reuse important to their work, they generally rated their expertise as low. Sharing data directly with other researchers was common, but most respondents did not have experience with uploading data to a repository. A number of significant differences exist between the attitudes and practices of clinical and basic science researchers, including their motivations for sharing, their reasons for not sharing, and the amount of work required to prepare their data.Even within the scope of biomedical research, addressing the unique concerns of diverse research communities is important to encouraging researchers to share and reuse data. Efforts at promoting data sharing and reuse should be aimed at solving not only technological problems, but also addressing researchers' concerns about sharing their data. Given the varied practices of individual researchers and research communities, standardizing data practices like data citation and repository upload could make sharing and reuse easier."
https://openalex.org/W1543368931,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly invasive and metastatic head and neck cancer. However, mechanistic study of the invasion and metastasis of NPC has been hampered by the lack of proper in vivo models. We established an in vivo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to study NPC tumor biology. We found 100% micro-tumor formation 3 days after inoculation with NPC cell lines (4/4) or primary tumor biopsy tissue (35/35). The transplanted NPC micro-tumors grew on CAMs with extracellular matrix interaction and induced angiogenesis. In addition, the CAM model could be used to study the growth of transplanted NPC tumors and also several important steps of metastasis, including tumor invasion by detecting the extent of basement membrane penetration, tumor angiogenesis by analyzing the area of neo-vessels, and tumor metastasis by quantifying tumor cells in distant organs. We established and described a feasible, easy-to-manipulate and reliable CAM model for in vivo study of NPC tumor biology. This model closely simulates the clinical features of NPC growth, progression and metastasis and could help elucidate the biological mechanisms of the growth pattern and invasion of NPC cells and in quantitative assessment of angiogenesis and cell intravasation."
https://openalex.org/W2176032417,"Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is known to predate asthma and other atopic disorders described under the term “atopic march”. However, this classic sequence is not always present and only a few studies have addressed children at risk of developing asthma. The objective of this study is to define early-onset AD phenotypes leading to asthma. Methods We performed a cluster analysis with 9 variables of 214 infants with early-onset AD prospectively enrolled in the ORCA cohort and followed each year on the occurrence of asthma until the age of 6. Results We identified 3 clusters - cluster 1 (n = 94) with low to no sensitization to food (27.7%) or aeroallergens (10.6%) and moderate AD severity (SCORAD 25.29 +/- 14.6) called “AD with low sensitization”; - cluster 2 (n = 84) characterized by a higher AD severity (SCORAD 32.66+/-16.6) and frequent sensitization to food (98.9%) or aeroallergens (26.2%), most likely multiple (96.4% for food allergens), called “AD with multiple sensitizations” - cluster 3 (n = 36) with parental history, moderate AD severity (SCORAD 24.46+/-15.7), moderate rate of sensitization to food allergens (38.9%) (exclusively single) with no sensitization to aeroallergens, called “AD with familial history of asthma”. Percentages of children suffering from asthma at the age of 6 were higher in clusters 2 and 3 (36.1% and 33.3% respectively versus 14.9% in cluster 1, p<0.01). Conclusion Two phenotypes in infants with early-onset AD convey a higher risk of developing asthma during childhood: multiple sensitization and familial history of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2129204384,"Rhythmic entrainment, or beat synchronization, provides an opportunity to understand how multiple systems operate together to integrate sensory-motor information. Also, synchronization is an essential component of musical performance that may be enhanced through musical training. Investigations of rhythmic entrainment have revealed a developmental trajectory across the lifespan, showing synchronization improves with age and musical experience. Here, we explore the development and maintenance of synchronization in childhood through older adulthood in a large cohort of participants (N = 145), and also ask how it may be altered by musical experience. We employed a uniform assessment of beat synchronization for all participants and compared performance developmentally and between individuals with and without musical experience. We show that the ability to consistently tap along to a beat improves with age into adulthood, yet in older adulthood tapping performance becomes more variable. Also, from childhood into young adulthood, individuals are able to tap increasingly close to the beat (i.e., asynchronies decline with age), however, this trend reverses from younger into older adulthood. There is a positive association between proportion of life spent playing music and tapping performance, which suggests a link between musical experience and auditory-motor integration. These results are broadly consistent with previous investigations into the development of beat synchronization across the lifespan, and thus complement existing studies and present new insights offered by a different, large cross-sectional sample."
https://openalex.org/W831431832,"Development of a reliable platform and workflow to detect and capture a small number of mutation-bearing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a blood sample is necessary for the development of noninvasive cancer diagnosis. In this preclinical study, we aimed to develop a capture system for molecular characterization of single CTCs based on high-density dielectrophoretic microwell array technology. Spike-in experiments using lung cancer cell lines were conducted. The microwell array was used to capture spiked cancer cells, and captured single cells were subjected to whole genome amplification followed by sequencing. A high detection rate (70.2%-90.0%) and excellent linear performance (R2 = 0.8189-0.9999) were noted between the observed and expected numbers of tumor cells. The detection rate was markedly higher than that obtained using the CellSearch system in a blinded manner, suggesting the superior sensitivity of our system in detecting EpCAM- tumor cells. Isolation of single captured tumor cells, followed by detection of EGFR mutations, was achieved using Sanger sequencing. Using a microwell array, we established an efficient and convenient platform for the capture and characterization of single CTCs. The results of a proof-of-principle preclinical study indicated that this platform has potential for the molecular characterization of captured CTCs from patients."
https://openalex.org/W1189177360,"Unfavorable ratios between the number and activation status of effector and suppressor immune cells infiltrating the tumor contribute to resistance of solid tumors to T-cell based therapies. Here, we studied the capacity of FDA and EMA approved recombinant cytokines to manipulate this balance in favor of efficient anti-tumor responses in B16.OVA melanoma bearing C57BL/6 mice. Intratumoral administration of IFN-α2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of ovalbumin-specific CD8+ T-cell (OT-I) therapy, whereas GM-CSF increased tumor growth in association with an increase in immunosuppressive cell populations. None of the cytokines augmented tumor trafficking of OT-I cells significantly, but injections of IFN-α2, IFN-γ and IL-2 increased intratumoral cytokine secretion and recruitment of endogenous immune cells capable of stimulating T-cells, such as natural killer and maturated CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, IFN-α2 and IL-2 increased the levels of activated tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells concomitant with reduction in the CD8+ T-cell expression of anergy markers CTLA-4 and PD-1. In conclusion, intratumoral administration of IFN-α2, IFN-γ and IL-2 can lead to immune sensitization of the established tumor, whereas GM-CSF may contribute to tumor-associated immunosuppression. The results described here provide rationale for including local administration of immunostimulatory cytokines into T-cell therapy regimens. One appealing embodiment of this would be vectored delivery which could be advantageous over direct injection of recombinant molecules with regard to efficacy, cost, persistence and convenience."
https://openalex.org/W793736076,"The ongoing bioethical debate on pharmacological cognitive enhancement (PCE) in healthy individuals is often legitimated by the assumption that PCE will widely spread and become desirable for the general public in the near future. This assumption was questioned as PCE is not equally save and effective in everyone. Additionally, it was supposed that the willingness to use PCE is strongly personality-dependent likely preventing a broad PCE epidemic. Thus, we investigated whether the cognitive performance and personality of healthy individuals with regular nonmedical methylphenidate (MPH) use for PCE differ from stimulant-naïve controls. Twenty-five healthy individuals using MPH for PCE were compared with 39 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls regarding cognitive performance and personality assessed by a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery including social cognition, prosocial behavior, decision-making, impulsivity, and personality questionnaires. Substance use was assessed through self-report in an interview and quantitative hair and urine analyses. Recently abstinent PCE users showed no cognitive impairment but superior strategic thinking and decision-making. Furthermore, PCE users displayed higher levels of trait impulsivity, novelty seeking, and Machiavellianism combined with lower levels of social reward dependence and cognitive empathy. Finally, PCE users reported a smaller social network and exhibited less prosocial behavior in social interaction tasks. In conclusion, the assumption that PCE use will soon become epidemic is not supported by the present findings as PCE users showed a highly specific personality profile that shares a number of features with illegal stimulant users. Lastly, regular MPH use for PCE is not necessarily associated with cognitive deficits."

The TCR mediates peptide-MHC recognition, whereas the CD3 molecules transduce activation signals to the T cell. Although much is known about downstream T cell signaling pathways, the mechanism whereby TCR engagement by peptide-MHC initiates signaling is poorly understood. A key to solving this problem is defining the spatial organization of the TCR-CD3 complex and the interactions between its subunits. We have applied solution NMR methods to identify the docking site for CD3 on the β chain of a human autoimmune TCR. We demonstrate a low affinity but highly specific interaction between the extracellular domains of CD3 and the TCR constant β (Cβ) domain that requires both CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ subunits. The mainly hydrophilic docking site, comprising 9–11 solvent-accessible Cβ residues, is relatively small (∼400 Å2), consistent with the weak interaction between TCR and CD3 extracellular domains, and devoid of glycosylation sites. The docking site is centered on the αA and αB helices of Cβ, which are located at the base of the TCR. This positions CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ between the TCR and the T cell membrane, permitting us to distinguish among several possible models of TCR-CD3 association.

Berry R. Hsiao Y.S. Chen Z. Shingu-Vazquez M.A. Yu X. Waghray D. Fischer S. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. Walz T. Garcia K.C. Molecular architecture of the αβ T cell receptor-CD3 complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 17576-17581Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, EM images revealed mainly dimeric complexes in which two TCRs projected outward from a central core composed of the CD3 ECDs. Although SAXS and negative stain EM have provided important information on the overall organization of the TCR-CD3 complex, these structural techniques lack the resolution necessary to establish the precise orientation of TCR and CD3 subunits in the complex or to define TCR-CD3 interfaces. At present, such information can only come from x-ray crystallography, NMR, or cryo-EM, applied individually or in combination. However, efforts to crystallize TCR-CD3 complexes have been thwarted by the very low affinity of TCR-CD3 interactions in solution. Similarly, previous attempts to map binding epitopes by NMR were unable to detect an interaction between TCR and CD3 ECDs (14Sun Z.Y. Kim S.T. Kim I.C. Fahmy A. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Solution structure of the CD3ϵδ ectodomain and comparison with CD3ϵγ as a basis for modeling T cell receptor topology and signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16867-16872Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Using optimized protein constructs and isotope labeling conditions, we have revisited the application of NMR to define TCR-CD3 contact sites in solution. Here we demonstrate a specific interaction between TCR and CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ ECDs by NMR, identify the docking site for CD3 on the TCR β chain, and correlate our structural results with mutational data on TCRβ-CD3 interactions from cell-based assays. Human CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ heterodimers were prepared by in vitro folding from inclusion bodies produced in Escherichia coli. CD3ϵδ needed to be folded together with the anti-CD3ϵ antibody UCHT1 in order to form a stable species (15Arnett K.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Crystal structure of a human CD3-ϵ/δ dimer in complex with a UCHT1 single-chain antibody fragment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16268-16273Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). By contrast, the CD3ϵγ heterodimer was stable on its own. DNA fragments encoding the ECDs of CD3ϵ (residues 1–105), CD3γ (residues 1–90), and CD3δ (residues 1–79) were inserted separately into the vector pET-26b (Novagen) and expressed as inclusion bodies in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen). The UCHT1 antibody was likewise produced in inclusion bodies as a single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) in which the light chain variable region was connected to the heavy chain variable region by a (GGGGS)3 linker. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to A600 = 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After incubation for 3 h, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA; cells were disrupted by sonication. Inclusion bodies were washed extensively with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2% (v/v) Triton X-100. The CD3ϵ, CD3γ, and CD3δ chains were dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm DTT; UCHT1 scFv was dissolved in 6 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm DTT. For in vitro folding of CD3ϵγ, solubilized CD3ϵ and CD3γ inclusion bodies were rapidly diluted into ice-cold folding buffer containing 0.8 m arginine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 3.7 mm cystamine, and 6.6 mm cysteamine to final protein concentrations of 59 and 52 mg/liter, respectively. For in vitro folding of scFv-CD3ϵδ, CD3ϵ, CD3δ, and scFv inclusion bodies were diluted into the same buffer at final concentrations of 59, 45, and 130 mg/liter, respectively. After 72 h at 4 °C, the folding mixtures were concentrated 50-fold, dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl, and centrifuged to remove aggregates. Correctly folded CD3ϵγ and scFv-CD3ϵδ proteins were then purified using sequential Superdex S-200 and MonoQ columns (GE Healthcare). The β chain of TCR MS2-3C8 (residues 1–244) with U-2H,13C,15N labeling was obtained by inclusion body expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent) transformed with pET-26b. Transformed cells were grown in 25 ml of LB medium containing 30% D2O (Isotec) at 37 °C until A600 ≥ 1.0 and then transferred in a 1:50 dilution to 25 ml of M9 medium containing 70% D2O, 1 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope) as the sole source of nitrogen and 4 g/liter [2H,13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope) as the sole source of carbon. The culture was grown until A600 = 0.5–1.0 and was transferred in a 1:100 dilution to 100 ml of M9 containing 100% D2O and grown overnight. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate 1 liter of M9/D2O to a starting of A600 = 0.10. Induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm was performed at A600 ≥ 0.6, and growth was continued for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were disrupted by sonication. Inclusion bodies were washed with and without 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then solubilized in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm DTT. The unlabeled TCR MS2-3C8 α chain (residues 1–205) was expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET-26b. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to A600 = 0.5–1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The inclusion bodies were washed with 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm DTT. For in vitro folding, the TCR MS2-3C8 α and β chains were mixed in a 3.6:1 molar ratio and diluted into a folding mixture containing 5 m urea, 0.4 m l-arginine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3.7 cystamine dihydrochloride, and 6.6 mm cysteamine to a final concentration of 50 mg/liter. The folding mixture was dialyzed against H2O for 72 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 48 h at 4 °C. After removal from dialysis, the folding mixture was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) at 4 °C overnight. Disulfide-linked TCR MS2-3C8 heterodimer was purified using sequential MonoQ and Superdex S-200 columns. A U-2H,15N-labeled MS2-3C8 β chain with U-13C, 15N-labeled Ile, Leu, and Val was produced as described above. [1H,12C]glucose (Sigma) was used as the sole carbon source, and 50 mg/liter of each labeled amino acid (Sigma/Isotec) was added to M9/D2O 1 h prior to induction. A U-2H,15N-labeled MS2-3C8 β chain for titration experiments was produced similarly except for the use of [1H,12C]glucose as the sole carbon source. TCR MS2-3C8α[β-2H,13C,15N] sample concentrations in the range of 200–240 μm were used in 50 mm NaPi, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) with the addition of 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc (Sigma). NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker AVANCE III 600 and 900 Hz spectrometers fitted with Z-gradient 1H/13C/15N cryoprobes. Backbone resonance assignment was carried out with TROSY versions of the following standard three-dimensional triple resonance experiments: HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO. The HNCACB and HN(CO)CACB experiments were also recorded with optimization on the Cβ signals. Three-dimensional spectra were acquired using non-uniform sampling (25%) and reconstructed employing the method of Hyberts et al. (23Hyberts S.G. Milbradt A.G. Wagner A.B. Arthanari H. Wagner G. Application of iterative soft thresholding for fast reconstruction of NMR data non-uniformly sampled with multidimensional Poisson Gap scheduling.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 52: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CA, and HNCA experiments were also recorded on an MS2-3C8 sample where the β chain was deuterated and selectively [13C,15N]Ile/Leu/Val(ILV)-labeled. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (25Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). NMR titration experiments were carried out at 25 °C using 100 μm MS2-3C8α[β-2H,15N] and either unlabeled CD3ϵγ, scFv-CD3ϵδ, or CD3ϵγ plus scFv-CD3ϵδ. Samples were exhaustively exchanged into identical buffer conditions (50 mm NaPi, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc, pH 7.0) prior to titration. Unlabeled CD3 samples (typically 50 μm in 0.8–2.4 ml of buffer) were added to 200 μl of 100 μm labeled TCR and concentrated back to 200 μl using Centricon membrane filtration. In each titration, a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was acquired for the MS2-3C8 TCR alone followed by spectra of successive CD3 additions. The following molar ratios were used for titrations: MS2-3C8/CD3ϵγ, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:5.8; MS2-3C8/scFv-CD3ϵδ, 1:2 and 1:3.3; MS2-3C8/CD3ϵγ/scFv-CD3ϵδ, 1:2:2, 1:4:4, and 1:6:6. Chemical shift perturbations were determined from Δδtotal = [(WHΔδH)2 + (WNΔδN)2]½, where ΔδH and ΔδN represent 1H and 15N chemical shift differences, respectively, between free and CD3-bound states of MS2-3C8, with weighting factors of WH = 1 and WN = 0.2. Values of Δδtotal above 0.01 ppm were estimated to be significant based on errors in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC measurement of chemical shifts in multiple identical MS2-3C8 samples. Experimentally significant decreases in peak intensity were estimated as being above the average peak intensity decrease plus one S.D. value. A CD3 multicistronic construct containing CD3ϵWT, CD3δWT, CD3ζWT, and CD3γWT and an AND TCR multicistronic vector containing TCRαWT and TCRβWT were generated as described previously (26Holst J.

Rapid analysis of T-cell selection in vivo using T cell-receptor retrogenic mice.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 2A peptide-linked CD3 and AND TCR constructs were generated by recombinant PCR and cloned into pMIG and pMIA, respectively (MSCV-based retroviral vectors containing an IRES-GFP or IRES-Ametrine1.1 (Addgene) cassette). Specific mutations in TCRβ (V166R, T199R, N203R, and R205E) were made by recombinant PCR, and subsequent mutant constructs were generated by appropriate subcloning. Transient transfection of HEK-293T cells was performed as described previously with some modifications (29Szymczak A.L. Workman C.J. Wang Y. Vignali K.M. Dilioglou S. Vanin E.F. Vignali D.A. Correction of multi-gene deficiency in vivo using a single “self-cleaving” 2A peptide-based retroviral vector.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). HEK-293T cells were incubated in 6-well plates at 2 × 105/well overnight at 37 °C. The AND TCRαβ pMIA plasmid (0.3 μg) and CD3 pMIG plasmid (0.3 μg) were transfected into HEK-293T cells using 6 μl of TransIT LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and stained with anti-CD3ϵ and anti-TCRβ monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometric analysis. For detailed NMR studies, we used a human autoimmune TCR, MS2-3C8, which recognizes a self-peptide from myelin basic protein (MBP) and the multiple sclerosis-associated MHC class II molecule HLA-DR4 (30Yin Y. Li Y. Kerzic M.C. Martin R. Mariuzza R.A. Structure of a TCR with high affinity for self-antigen reveals the basis for escape from negative selection.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pathogenic potential of MS2-3C8 was demonstrated using mice transgenic for this TCR and HLA-DR4 (31Quandt J.A. Baig M. Yao K. Kawamura K. Huh J. Ludwin S.K. Bian H.-J. Bryant M. Quigley L. Nagy Z.A. McFarland H.F. Muraro P.A. Martin R. Ito K. Unique clinical and pathological features in HLA-DRB1*0401-restricted MBP 111–129-specific humanized TCR transgenic mice.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An x-ray crystal structure of TCR MS2-3C8 bound to its pMHC ligand, MBP-HLA-DR4, has been determined (30Yin Y. Li Y. Kerzic M.C. Martin R. Mariuzza R.A. Structure of a TCR with high affinity for self-antigen reveals the basis for escape from negative selection.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as well as that of the ternary complex formed by MS2-3C8, MBP-HLA-DR4, and CD4 (32Yin Y. Wang X.X. Mariuzza R.A. Crystal structure of a complete ternary complex of T-cell receptor, peptide-MHC, and CD4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The interactions of MS2-3C8 with several of the key players in T cell signaling are therefore well characterized structurally, making this TCR a good candidate for studying critical associations with CD3ϵγ and CD3ϵδ. The MS2-3C8 TCR employed here was modified slightly from the wild-type used for previous x-ray studies, with three mutations in the α chain and four mutations in the β chain. The mutations were made to improve either expression (VβT55A), folding yield, and stability (CαT159C, CαC206(deleted), CβS171C, CβS189A, and CβC245(deleted)) or binding to HLA-DR4 (VαA31T). None of these mutations are at positions that contact CD3 (see below). Thus, the TCR MS2-3C8 ectodomain studied here is a heterodimer consisting of an unlabeled 205-residue α chain and a 2H,13C,15N-labeled 244-residue β chain for a total molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. Due to this relatively high molecular mass, transverse relaxation-optimized (TROSY)-based triple resonance experiments were utilized for the NMR assignment process (33Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Attenuated T2 relaxation by mutual cancellation of dipole-dipole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy indicates an avenue to NMR structures of very large biological macromolecules in solution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Interresidue connectivities were obtained through sequential matching of Cα and Cβ chemical shift patterns and confirmed with CO correlations in most cases. A selectively labeled ILV sample provided further validation of the assignments using methods described previously (34Tugarinov V. Muhandiram R. Ayed A. Kay L.E. Four-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of a 723-residue protein: chemical shift assignments and secondary structure of malate synthase G.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 10025-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Overall, 200 (87%) of the 230 possible main chain amide assignments were obtained, with extensive coverage of both TCR variable β (Vβ) and constant β (Cβ) domains (Fig. 1, A–D). Assignments of HN, 15N, Cα, Cβ, and CO resonances of the MS2-3C8α[β-2H,13C,15N] sample have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB accession code 26569). Chemical shift index analysis (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. The 13C chemical-shift index: a simple method for the identification of protein secondary structure using 13C chemical-shift data.J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar) using the assigned Cα, Cβ, and CO resonances identified the secondary structure elements for the MS2-3C8 β chain in solution (Fig. 2A). These results were compared with the x-ray structure of MS2-3C8 in complex with MBP-HLA-DR4 (Protein Data Bank accession code 3O6F) (30Yin Y. Li Y. Kerzic M.C. Martin R. Mariuzza R.A. Structure of a TCR with high affinity for self-antigen reveals the basis for escape from negative selection.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The only region that appears to be slightly different is strand D in the Cβ domain, which is a short 3-residue β-strand in the x-ray structure but has a coil conformation in solution. Interestingly, this is the region where we engineered a CαCys159-CβCys171 interchain disulfide (36Boulter J.M. Glick M. Todorov P.T. Baston E. Sami M. Rizkallah P. Jakobsen B.K. Stable, soluble T-cell receptor molecules for crystallization and therapeutics.Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) to increase yields of paired TCR αβ heterodimers for the NMR sample. The wild-type protein used for x-ray analysis did not contain this disulfide (30Yin Y. Li Y. Kerzic M.C. Martin R. Mariuzza R.A"

Archaea form a distinct domain in the tree of life that is separate and unique from bacteria and eukarya (1Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Upon their discovery, they were considered extremophiles, although it is now clear that archaea inhabit virtually all environments (2Cavicchioli R. Archaea: timeline of the third domain.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The ability to thrive in extreme environments is in part due to their cell envelopes, which display distinctive features (3Albers S.-V. Meyer B.H. The archaeal cell envelope.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These features include the use of unique ether lipids in the cell membrane and the replacement of the traditional bacterial peptidoglycan based cell wall with various proteinaceous crystalline layers on the cell surface, often in the form of an S layer (3Albers S.-V. Meyer B.H. The archaeal cell envelope.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, our understanding regarding the properties and functions of the archaeal cell envelopes remains superficial. Increased knowledge about the constituents of the archaeal cell envelopes is essential for understanding how specific archaea interact with their environment and how they are able to thrive in what we consider extreme environments. Methanogens are strict anaerobic archaea belonging to the euryarchaeota. They are characterized by their unique ability to produce methane, using carbon dioxide, acetate, isopropanol, and various one-carbon compounds as substrates (2Cavicchioli R. Archaea: timeline of the third domain.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Whitman W.B.

They play a fundamental role in driving the global biogeochemical carbon cycle, being the only known biological source of methane (4Liu Y. Whitman W.B.

They also represent the backbone of the anaerobic digestion technology used for production of biogas as energy source, which is considered the most promising sustainable alternative to natural gas (6Weiland P. Biogas production: current state and perspectives.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 85: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Methanogens of the two genera Methanosaeta and Methanospirillum are characterized by a complex cell wall architecture (3Albers S.-V. Meyer B.H. The archaeal cell envelope.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These microorganisms are occasionally found as single rod-shaped cells encased within a protein layer, which for Methanospirillum has been characterized as an S layer (7Firtel M. Southam G. Harauz G.

Inside the sheaths, septa or plugs separate the individual cells (8Shaw P.J. Hills G.J. Henwood J.A. Harris J.E. Archer D.B. Three-dimensional architecture of the cell sheath and septa of Methanospirillum hungatei.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 750-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sheaths provide resistance against protozoan grazing and cell turgor pressure, while allowing the uptake of substrates like hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and acetate and the release of products, mainly methane (9Walsby A.E.

Interestingly, most of these features are shared with a group of proteins known as functional amyloids (15Dueholm M.S. Nielsen P.H. Chapman M. Otzen D. Functional amyloids in bacteria.in: Otzen D.E.

Amyloids are defined as highly organized proteins or peptide polymers arranged in a cross-β-sheet pattern, in which intermolecular β-sheets are formed along the fibril axis with the β-strands oriented perpendicularly to the fibril axis (16Fändrich M. On the structural definition of amyloid fibrils and other polypeptide aggregates.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2066-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Functional amyloids were proposed in bacteria in 2002 with the identification of the adhesive curli fimbriae of Escherichia coli (17Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M.

The curli system has consequently become the model system for functional bacterial amyloids. However, the TasA fibrils from Bacillus subtilis (18Romero D. Aguilar C. Losick R. Kolter R.

The functional amyloids are associated with a large variety of functions in bacteria, ranging from structural components of biofilms to spore coat building blocks (15Dueholm M.S. Nielsen P.H.

Functional amyloids have also been described in eukaryotes. In fungi, they are used to modulate the hydrophobicity of hyphae and as a nongenetic but transmissible regulator of phenotypes (22Bayry J.

Mammals benefit from functional amyloids in the form of scaffolds for melanin synthesis, which provide the basis for our skin pigmentation (24McGlinchey R.P. Shewmaker F. McPhie P. Monterroso B.

Previous work involving amyloids in archaea is limited. In vitro studies have shown that the acylphosphatase from the hyperthermophile archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus is able to form amyloid-like aggregates directly from an active protein conformation at pH 5.5 in the presence of 15–25% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (26Plakoutsi G.

Another study has shown that components within the extracellular matrix of Haloferax volcanii biofilms are able to bind the amyloid dyes Congo red and thioflavin T (ThT) (29Chimileski S. Franklin M.J. Papke R.T. Biofilms formed by the archaeon Haloferax volcanii exhibit cellular differentiation and social motility, and facilitate horizontal gene transfer.BMC Biol. 2014; 12: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that amyloids may exist within archaeal biofilms. However, an individual functional amyloid and its principle component in association with a particular cellular structure and function have never been shown within the archaeal domain of life. In this study, we show that the cell wall sheath of the methanogenic archaea Methanosaeta thermophila PT is a functional amyloid assembly composed of the major sheath protein (MspA). The amyloid structure explains the very high resistance of the sheath, the elastic properties that allow diffusible substrates to penetrate the sheath through expandable hoop boundaries, and the ability of the extracellular sheaths to split and elongate to accommodate growth of the archaeal filaments. M. thermophila PT (DSM 6194) was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and cultured in DSMZ medium 387 according to the instructions provided by DSMZ. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored in sealed glass bottles under an oxygen-free atmosphere containing N2 (90%) and CO2 (10%). The proteinaceous sheaths were purified using a purification strategy similar to that used for functional amyloids in Pseudomonas (Fap) (19Dueholm M.S. Petersen S.V. Sønderkaer M. Larsen P. Christiansen G. Hein K.L. Enghild J.J. Nielsen J.L. Nielsen K.L. Nielsen P.H. Otzen D.E. Functional amyloid in Pseudomonas.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, archaea were collected from 300 ml of culture by centrifugation (7500 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, R6513), 0.1 mg/ml Turbo DNase (Ambion, AM2238), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The sample was lysed by three cycles of freeze thawing using a −80 °C freezer and a thermo block at 37 °C. The sample was kept at each temperature for at least 15 min. The sample was then incubated (37 °C, 2 h, 750 rpm) for enzymatic degradation of released nucleic acids. SDS was added to 2% and the sampled boiled for 5 min to dissolve the contaminating non-amyloid proteins. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 10 min), washed in 1 ml of buffer, and boiled once more in 2% SDS. The remaining insoluble material composed of the sheaths was then washed three times in 1 ml of buffer before it was finally resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing 1 mg/ml sodium azide. Purified sheaths were depolymerized using a formic acid procedure. Briefly, 10 μl samples of purified sheaths were mixed with 5 μl of reducing buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then lyophilized and depolymerized in 100 μl of either 90% or 100% formic acid. The samples were lyophilized again and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The lyophilized samples were dissolved in 20 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (75 mm M Tris, 0.6% (w/w) SDS, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 7.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.9 mg/liter bromphenol blue, 8 m urea at pH 6.8). Urea was required to avoid precipitation of the sheath proteins. 10 μl were loaded to an AnyKD gel (Bio-Rad), and electrophoresis was done at 140 V for 40 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. Gel bands were excised and cut into pieces. The gel plugs were then washed with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 30% (v/v) acetonitrile, followed by reduction and alkylation with DTT and iodoacetamide, respectively, in consecutive incubation steps. The gel plugs were dried and rehydrated with 10 ng/μl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). Trypsin digestion was done overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant and the following organic extract containing the digested peptides were combined and dried. The digests were reconstituted in 30 μl of LC-MS sample buffer (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A sample volume of 10 μl was injected onto a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system that was connected to a Quadrupole Orbitrap (Q Exactive) mass spectrometer equipped with a NanoSpray Flex ion source. Both instruments were from Thermo Scientific. The flow settings were 8 μl/min for the sample loading onto a trapping column, which was an Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 5-μm column from Thermo Scientific. The nanoflow was set to 300 nl/min for the peptide separation on the analytical column, which was a 50-cm Acclaim PepmapRSLC, 75-μm column connected with nanoviper fittings. The nano-electrospray was done using a Picotip Silicatip emitter from New Objectives. The LC buffers were buffer A (0.1% formic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid) and buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid). The applied gradient was from 12 to 40% buffer B over 30 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. A full MS scan in the mass range of 350–1850 m/z was acquired at a resolution of 70,000 with an AGC target of 3 × 106 and maximum fill time set to 250 ms. Instrument lock mass correction was applied using the contaminant ion at 391.28429 m/z. In each cycle, the mass spectrometer will trigger up to 12 MS/MS acquisitions on abundant peptide precursors ions. The MS/MS scans were acquired with a dynamic mass range at a resolution of 17,500 and with an AGC target of 2 × 105 and a maximum fill time of 60 ms. The precursor ions were isolated using a quadruple isolation window of 3 m/z and the fragmented in the HCD trap with a normalized collision energy set to 30. The under-fill ratio was set to 3.5% with the intensity threshold at 1.2 × 105. Apex triggering was 3–10 s with charge and exclude isotopes exclusion on, and dynamic exclusion set to 15 s. Peak lists were generated from the raw data files using ProteomeDiscoverer version 1.3 (ThermoScientific). Mascot server version 2.3 (Matrix Sciences) was used for searching against the Uniprot complete proteome databases for M. thermophila PT (METTP, released November 14, 2006). The search criteria were mass tolerances of 5 and 15 ppm on precursor and fragment level, respectively. No enzyme specificity and two missed cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carboxyamidomethylation was set as fixed, and methionine oxidation and lysine formylation were set as variable modifications. The peptide probability p value was set 0.01. The Mascot scores, protein sequence coverage, spectral counts, and emPAI scores were recorded from the Mascot search log. Suspension culture samples, purified sheaths and in vitro formed fibrils were mounted on 400-mesh carbon-coated, glow discharged nickel grids for 30 s. Grids were washed with one drop of double distilled water (ddH2O) and stained with three drops of 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid at pH 7.2. Samples were inspected in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, 1010) at 60 kV. Images were obtained using an electron-sensitive CCD camera (Olympus, KeenView). For size determination, a cross-line carbon replica grid (2160 lines/mm) was used. The presence of amyloid epitopes was analyzed using the amyloid conformational specific antibody WO1 as previously described (30Larsen P. Nielsen J.L. Otzen D. Nielsen P.H. Amyloid-like adhesins produced by floc-forming and filamentous bacteria in activated sludge.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 500 μl of culture of purified sheaths corresponding to an optical density at 600 nm of 1 were pelleted by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 30 min), washed in 1 ml of PBS, and then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% (w/v) gelatin as a blocking buffer. The sample was preincubated (1 h, 37 °C), after which antibodies WO1 and Tween 20 were added to a final concentration of 10 nm and 0.05% (w/v), respectively. The sample was incubated (2 h, 37 °C). The primary antibody was removed by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed three times in 400 μl of PBS containing 1% (w/v) gelatin and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The sample was then incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with a 1:256 dilution of the Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgM (μ chain) (Molecular Probes) and 0.025% Tween 20 in PBS containing 1% (w/v) gelatin. Finally, the samples were washed three times as described above but without gelatin in the washing buffer. After the final washing step, the samples were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and stored at 4 °C until microscopy. Images were obtained using a LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an argon ion laser (458 and 488 nm) and two helium-neon lasers (543 and 633 nm). The settings for the CLSM were calibrated using an activated sludge sample containing both amyloid-positive and -negative cells as previously described (30Larsen P. Nielsen J.L. Otzen D. Nielsen P.H. Amyloid-like adhesins produced by floc-forming and filamentous bacteria in activated sludge.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All samples were also prepared in the absence of the primary antibody. These samples served as controls to evaluate unspecific binding of the secondary antibody. FTIR was carried out using a Tensor 27 (Bruker) FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a DTGS Mid-infrared detector and a Golden Gate single reflection diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell (Specac). Purified sheaths or in vitro polymerized sheath proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and dried on the ATR crystal using dry nitrogen. In vitro polymerized sheath proteins were pelleted (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) in a MAX XP Ultracentrifuge (Optima) with a TLA 110 rotor, resuspended in ddH2O, and pelleted again. Pellets were resuspended in a small volume of ddH2O and dried on the ATR crystal. ATR spectra were recorded from 4000–1000 cm−1 using a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1 and 128 accumulations. The resulting spectra were baseline-corrected and interfering signals from H2O and CO2 were removed using the atmospheric compensation filter in the OPUS 5.5 system (Bruker). Different components of the amide I region were identified by second derivative analysis in the OPUS 5.5 system. CD spectra from 250–200 nm were collected on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using 0.2-nm steps, scan speed of 50 nm/min, bandwidth of 2 nm, and a response time of 2 s. A 1-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma) was used, and the temperature was kept constant at 20 °C with a thermostatically controlled cell holder (Jasco PTC 423S). The protein concentration was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml with ddH2O, and all spectra were baseline-corrected with respect to the buffer. To improve the signal to noise ratio, five scans were averaged on each sample. Data points with a HT value higher than 600 V were removed. The results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity. All samples were sonicated in a Bandelin Sonorex Digitec water bath sonicator for 2 min to minimize light scattering and settling of the insoluble amyloids. Fiber diffraction specimens were prepared by suspending 10 μl of 5 mg/ml purified sheaths or 1 mg/ml in vitro fibrillated MspA between two capillary glass tubes. Samples were dried at room temperature resulting in fibers with a length of 2–3 mm. The data were collected using a sealed tube x-ray source (wavelength of 1.5418 Å) in a Compact HomeLab system (Rigaku), equipped with a PILATUS3 R 200K hybrid pixel array detector (Dectris). The sample to detector distance was 60 mm, and an exposure time of 20–30 min was used. The images were evaluated and Bragg distances measured using Adxv 1.9.10. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary Fluorimeter (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) with a built-in Peltier element for temperature regulation. Proteins were dissolved in PBS buffer to a final protein concentration of 50 μg/ml. The final concentration of ThT was 40 μm. The samples were excited at 440 nm, and emission was measured from 450 to 600 nm with a slit with of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. A synthetic M. thermophila PT mspA gene (Mthe_1069), optimized for the E. coli codon usage corresponding to the mature protein (without signal sequence) flanked by XbaI and XhoI restriction sites, were designed using CLC main workbench 6.0 and synthesized by GenScript (Germany). The synthetic gene was cloned into the pET32b(+) vector (Novagen) using the XbaI and XhoI restriction sites. This adds a C-terminal His tag to the construct. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Life Technologies). Protein expression was carried out in 500 ml of LB medium (37 °C, 200 rpm). Induction was done with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at A600 nm = 0.7–1.2, and cells were harvested 3 h after induction by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of extraction buffer (6 m GdmCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and sonicated three times for 1 min using a rod sonicator. The sample was placed 1 min on ice between sonications. The lysate was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min). The His-tagged MspA protein was isolated from the supernatant using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and an elution buffer, corresponding to the extraction buffer, containing 500 mm imidazole. Purified monomers in extraction buffer were desalted using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with ddH2O. Protein concentration was estimated by UV absorbance using the following extinction coefficients for the recombinant MspA from M. thermophila PT: ϵ280 nm = 1.885 cm−1·(g/liter)−1. The proteins were diluted in ddH2O to 1 mg/ml and mixed with an equal amount of 40 mm buffer (see below). 200 μl samples were loaded into a 96-well Nunc optical bottom plate (catalog no. 265301; Thermo Scientific). Immediately afterward, the plate was transferred to a Tecan GENios Pro plate reader and incubated at 37 °C overnight with 30 s of linear shaking at 180 rpm applied every 84 s. The following buffers were used: citric acid (pH 3.0 and 4.0), acetic acid (pH 5.0), MES (pH 6.0), imidazole (pH 7.0), Tris (pH 8.0), and glycine (pH 9.0). All buffers were adjusted to an ionic strength of 60 and 300 mm with NaCl. 5 ml of purified monomers in extraction buffer was d"

Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that ermF, ermFU, and ereD were located within the multiresistance region of the R. anatipestifer genome."
https://openalex.org/W1493913171,"Previous research has revealed that glucose and fructose ingestion differentially modulate release of satiation hormones. Recent studies have begun to elucidate brain-gut interactions with neuroimaging approaches such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the neural mechanism underlying different behavioral and physiological effects of glucose and fructose are unclear. In this paper, we have used resting state functional MRI to explore whether acute glucose and fructose ingestion also induced dissociable effects in the neural system. Using a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we compared resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) strengths within the basal ganglia/limbic network in 12 healthy lean males. Each subject was administered fructose, glucose and placebo on three separate occasions. Subsequent correlation analysis was used to examine relations between rsFC findings and plasma concentrations of satiation hormones and subjective feelings of appetite. Glucose ingestion induced significantly greater elevations in plasma glucose, insulin, GLP-1 and GIP, while feelings of fullness increased and prospective food consumption decreased relative to fructose. Furthermore, glucose increased rsFC of the left caudatus and putamen, precuneus and lingual gyrus more than fructose, whereas within the basal ganglia/limbic network, fructose increased rsFC of the left amygdala, left hippocampus, right parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex and precentral gyrus more than glucose. Moreover, compared to fructose, the increased rsFC after glucose positively correlated with the glucose-induced increase in insulin. Our findings suggest that glucose and fructose induce dissociable effects on rsFC within the basal ganglia/limbic network, which are probably mediated by different insulin levels. A larger study would be recommended in order to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W826039041,"Myopia is a common ocular disorder generally due to increased axial length of the eye-globe. Its extreme form high myopia (HM) is a multifactorial disease leading to retinal and scleral damage, visual impairment or loss and is an important health issue. Mutations in the endocytic receptor LRP2 gene result in Donnai-Barrow (DBS) and Stickler syndromes, both characterized by HM. To clearly establish the link between Lrp2 and congenital HM we inactivated Lrp2 in the mouse forebrain including the neural retina and the retinal and ciliary pigment epithelia. High resolution in vivo MRI imaging and ophthalmological analyses showed that the adult Lrp2-deficient eyes were 40% longer than the control ones mainly due to an excessive elongation of the vitreal chamber. They had an apparently normal intraocular pressure and developed chorioretinal atrophy and posterior scleral staphyloma features reminiscent of human myopic retinopathy. Immunomorphological and ultrastructural analyses showed that increased eye lengthening was first observed by post-natal day 5 (P5) and that it was accompanied by a rapid decrease of the bipolar, photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cells, and eventually the optic nerve axons. It was followed by scleral thinning and collagen fiber disorganization, essentially in the posterior pole. We conclude that the function of LRP2 in the ocular tissues is necessary for normal eye growth and that the Lrp2-deficient eyes provide a unique tool to further study human HM."
https://openalex.org/W1176569914,"The development of novel targeted therapies holds promise for conquering chemotherapy resistance, which is one of the major hurdles in current breast cancer treatment. Previous studies indicate that mitochondria uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) is involved in the development of chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer and lung cancer cells. In the present study we found that lower level of miR133a is accompanied by increased expression of UCP-2 in Doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell cline MCF-7/Dox as compared with its parental cell line MCF-7. We postulated that miR133a might play a functional role in the development of Doxorubicin-resistant in breast cancer cells. In this study we showed that: 1) exogenous expression of miR133a in MCF-7/Dox cells can sensitize their reaction to the treatment of Doxorubicin, which is coincided with reduced expression of UCP-2; 2) knockdown of UCP-2 in MCF-7/Dox cells can also sensitize their reaction to the treatment of Doxorubicin; 3) intratumoral delivering of miR133a can restore Doxorubicin treatment response in Doxorubicin-resistant xenografts in vivo, which is concomitant with the decreased expression of UCP-2. These findings provided direct evidences that the miR133a/UCP-2 axis might play an essential role in the development of Doxorubicin-resistance in breast cancer cells, suggesting that the miR133a/UCP-2 signaling cohort could be served as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of chemotherapy resistant in breast cancer."

New therapeutic strategies are needed to make the action of available drugs more efficient. Our study aimed to explore whether simultaneous targeting of EGFR/VEGF and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may aid the treatment and management of mCRC patients. The dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEE788 and celecoxib were used to inhibit EGFR/VEGFR and COX-2, respectively, in colorectal cancer cells. COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib augmented the antitumoral and antiangiogenic efficacy of AEE788, as indicated by the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest, down-regulation of VEGF production by cancer cells and reduction of cell migration. These effects were related with a blockade in the EGFR/VEGFR signaling axis. Notably, the combined AEE788/celecoxib treatment prevented β-catenin nuclear accumulation in tumor cells. This effect was associated with a significant downregulation of FOXM1 protein levels and an impairment in the interaction of this transcription factor with β-catenin, which is required for its nuclear localization. Furthermore, the combined treatment also reduced the expression of the stem cell markers Oct 3/4, Nanog, Sox-2 and Snail in cancer cells, and contributed to the diminution of the CSC subpopulation, as indicated by colonosphere formation assays. In conclusion, the combined treatment of AEE788 and celecoxib not only demonstrated enhanced anti-tumoral efficacy in colorectal cancer cells, but also reduced colon CSCs subpopulation by targeting stemness-related pathways. Therefore, the simultaneous targeting of EGFR/VEGF and COX-2 may aid in blocking mCRC progression and improve the efficacy of existing therapies in colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1553208607,"Hydrothermal vents in the Southern Ocean are the physiologically most isolated chemosynthetic environments known. Here, we describe Kiwa tyleri sp. nov., the first species of yeti crab known from the Southern Ocean. Kiwa tyleri belongs to the family Kiwaidae and is the visually dominant macrofauna of two known vent sites situated on the northern and southern segments of the East Scotia Ridge (ESR). The species is known to depend on primary productivity by chemosynthetic bacteria and resides at the warm-eurythermal vent environment for most of its life; its short-range distribution away from vents (few metres) is physiologically constrained by the stable, cold waters of the surrounding Southern Ocean. Kiwa tylerihas been shown to present differential life history adaptations in response to this contrasting thermal environment. Morphological adaptations specific to life in warm-eurythermal waters, as found on - or in close proximity of - vent chimneys, are discussed in comparison with adaptations seen in the other two known members of the family (K. hirsuta, K. puravida), which show a preference for low temperature chemosynthetic environments."
https://openalex.org/W1880522608,"Bone tissue is mineralized dense connective tissue consisting mainly of a mineral component (hydroxyapatite) and an organic matrix comprised of collagens, non-collagenous proteins and proteoglycans (PGs). Extracellular matrix proteins and PGs bind tightly to hydroxyapatite which would protect these molecules from the destructive effects of temperature and chemical agents after death. DNA and proteins have been successfully extracted from archaeological skeletons from which valuable information has been obtained; however, to date neither PGs nor glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains have been studied in archaeological skeletons. PGs and GAGs play a major role in bone morphogenesis, homeostasis and degenerative bone disease. The ability to isolate and characterize PG and GAG content from archaeological skeletons would unveil valuable paleontological information. We therefore optimized methods for the extraction of both PGs and GAGs from archaeological human skeletons. PGs and GAGs were successfully extracted from both archaeological human bones and teeth, and characterized by their electrophoretic mobility in agarose gel, degradation by specific enzymes and HPLC. The GAG populations isolated were chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA). In addition, a CSPG was detected. The localization of CS, HA, three small leucine rich PGs (biglycan, decorin and fibromodulin) and glypican was analyzed in archaeological human bone slices. Staining patterns were different for juvenile and adult bones, whilst adolescent bones had a similar staining pattern to adult bones. The finding that significant quantities of PGs and GAGs persist in archaeological bones and teeth opens novel venues for the field of Paleontology."

The biosynthesis of HS involves a series of enzymes, including glycosyltransferases (or HS polymerase), epimerase, and sulfotransferases. N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase isoform 1 (NDST-1) is a critical enzyme in this pathway. NDST-1, a bifunctional enzyme, displays N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activities to convert an N-acetylated glucosamine residue to an N-sulfo glucosamine residue.

Using baculovirus expression in insect cells, we obtained three recombinant proteins: full-length NDST-1 and the individual N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase domains. Structurally defined oligosaccharide substrates were synthesized to test the substrate specificities of the enzymes. We discovered that N-deacetylation is the limiting step and that interplay between the N-sulfotransferase and N-deacetylase accelerates the reaction. Furthermore, combining the individually expressed N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase domains produced different sulfation patterns when compared with that made by the NDST-1 enzyme.

The aim of this study was to test whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in conjunction with MMT can improve treatment retention and reduce opiate use.A total of 240 opiate-dependent patients in community-based MMT clinics were randomly assigned to either weekly CBT plus standard MMT (CBT group, n=120) or standard MMT (control group, n=120) for 26 weeks. The primary outcomes were treatment retention and opiate-negative urine test results at 12 weeks and 26 weeks. The secondary outcomes were composite scores on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and total scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at 12 weeks and 26 weeks.Compared to the control group in standard MMT, the CBT group had higher proportion of opiate-negative urine tests at both 12 weeks (59% vs. 69%, p<0.05) and 26 weeks (63% vs. 73%, p<0.05); however, the retention rates at 12 weeks (73.3% vs. 74.2%, p=0.88) and 26 weeks were not different (55.8% vs. 64.2%, p=0.19) between the two groups. At both 12 and 26 weeks, all of the ASI component scores and PSS total scores in the CBT group and control group decreased from baseline; but the CBT group exhibited more decreases in ASI employment scores at week 26 and more decrease in the PSS total score at week 12 and week 26.CBT counselling is effective in reducing opiate use and improving employment function and in decreasing stress level for opiate-dependent patients in MMT in China.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01144390."
https://openalex.org/W1628414185,"Butterfly wing color patterns are determined during the late larval and early pupal stages. Characterization of wing epithelial cells at these stages is thus critical to understand how wing structures, including color patterns, are determined. Previously, we successfully recorded real-time in vivo images of developing butterfly wings over time at the tissue level. In this study, we employed similar in vivo fluorescent imaging techniques to visualize developing wing epithelial cells in the late larval and early pupal stages 1 hour post-pupation. Both larval and pupal epithelial cells were rich in mitochondria and intracellular networks of endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting high metabolic activities, likely in preparation for cellular division, polyploidization, and differentiation. Larval epithelial cells in the wing imaginal disk were relatively large horizontally and tightly packed, whereas pupal epithelial cells were smaller and relatively loosely packed. Furthermore, larval cells were flat, whereas pupal cells were vertically elongated as deep as 130 μm. In pupal cells, many endosome-like or autophagosome-like structures were present in the cellular periphery down to approximately 10 μm in depth, and extensive epidermal feet or filopodia-like processes were observed a few micrometers deep from the cellular surface. Cells were clustered or bundled from approximately 50 μm in depth to deeper levels. From 60 μm to 80 μm in depth, horizontal connections between these clusters were observed. The prospective eyespot and marginal focus areas were resistant to fluorescent dyes, likely because of their non-flat cone-like structures with a relatively thick cuticle. These in vivo images provide important information with which to understand processes of epithelial cell differentiation and color pattern determination in butterfly wings."

Recently, the presence of fungi in these environments has involved a change of view regarding diversity and ecology. Here, we describe fossilized fungal communities in vugs in subseafloor basalts from a depth of 936.65 metres below seafloor at the Detroit Seamount, Pacific Ocean. These fungal communities are closely associated with botryoidal Mn oxides composed of todorokite. Analyses of the Mn oxides by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy (EPR) indicate a biogenic signature. We suggest, based on mineralogical, morphological and EPR data, a biological origin of the botryoidal Mn oxides. Our results show that fungi are involved in Mn cycling at great depths in the seafloor and we introduce EPR as a means to easily identify biogenic Mn oxides in these environments."
https://openalex.org/W789330304,"Objective Hypophosphatemic rickets (HR) is a heterogeneous genetic phosphate wasting disorder. The disease is most commonly caused by mutations in the PHEX gene located on the X-chromosome or by mutations in CLCN5, DMP1, ENPP1, FGF23, and SLC34A3. The aims of this study were to perform molecular diagnostics for four patients with HR of Indian origin (two independent families) and to describe their clinical features. Methods We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) for the affected mother of two boys who also displayed the typical features of HR, including bone malformations and phosphate wasting. B-lymphoblast cell lines were established by EBV transformation and subsequent RT-PCR to investigate an uncommon splice site variant found by WES. An in silico analysis was done to obtain accurate nucleotide frequency occurrences of consensus splice positions other than the canonical sites of all human exons. Additionally, we applied direct Sanger sequencing for all exons and exon/intron boundaries of the PHEX gene for an affected girl from an independent second Indian family. Results WES revealed a novel PHEX splice acceptor mutation in intron 9 (c.1080-3C>A) in a family with 3 affected individuals with HR. The effect on splicing of this mutation was further investigated by RT-PCR using RNA obtained from a patient’s EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell line. RT-PCR revealed an aberrant splice transcript skipping exons 10-14 which was not observed in control samples, confirming the diagnosis of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemia (XLH). The in silico analysis of all human splice sites adjacent to all 327,293 exons across 81,814 transcripts among 20,345 human genes revealed that cytosine is, with 64.3%, the most frequent nucleobase at the minus 3 splice acceptor position, followed by thymidine with 28.7%, adenine with 6.3%, and guanine with 0.8%. We generated frequency tables and pictograms for the extended donor and acceptor splice consensus regions by analyzing all human exons. Direct Sanger sequencing of all PHEX exons in a sporadic case with HR from the Indian subcontinent revealed an additional novel PHEX mutation (c.1211_1215delACAAAinsTTTACAT, p.Asp404Valfs*5, de novo) located in exon 11. Conclusions Mutation analyses revealed two novel mutations and helped to confirm the clinical diagnoses of XLH in two families from India. WES helped to analyze all genes implicated in the underlying disease complex. Mutations at splice positions other than the canonical key sites need further functional investigation to support the assertion of pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2342290876,"Physiological and electron microscope studies have shown that synapses are functionally and morphologically heterogeneous and that variations in size of synaptic junctions are related to characteristics such as release probability and density of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. The present article focuses on how these morphological variations impact synaptic transmission. We based our study on Monte Carlo computational simulations of simplified model synapses whose morphological features have been extracted from hundreds of actual synaptic junctions reconstructed by three-dimensional electron microscopy. We have examined the effects that parameters such as synaptic size or density of AMPA receptors have on the number of receptors that open after release of a single synaptic vesicle. Our results indicate that the maximum number of receptors that will open after the release of a single synaptic vesicle may show a ten-fold variation in the whole population of synapses. When individual synapses are considered, there is also a stochastical variability that is maximal in small synapses with low numbers of receptors. The number of postsynaptic receptors and the size of the synaptic junction are the most influential parameters, while the packing density of receptors or the concentration of extrasynaptic transporters have little or no influence on the opening of AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W756494397,"Background Mitochondria, as recently suggested, might be involved in iron sensing and signalling pathways in plant cells. For a better understanding of the role of these organelles in mediating the Fe deficiency responses in plant cells, it is crucial to provide a full overview of their modifications occurring under Fe-limited conditions. The aim of this work is to characterize the ultrastructural as well as the biochemical changes occurring in leaf mitochondria of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants grown under Fe deficiency. Methodology/Results Mitochondrial ultrastructure was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron tomography techniques, which allowed a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of cellular structures. These analyses reveal that mitochondria isolated from cucumber leaves appear in the cristae junction model conformation and that Fe deficiency strongly alters both the number and the volume of cristae. The ultrastructural changes observed in mitochondria isolated from Fe-deficient leaves reflect a metabolic status characterized by a respiratory chain operating at a lower rate (orthodox-like conformation) with respect to mitochondria from control leaves. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a 3D reconstruction of plant mitochondria. Furthermore, these results suggest that a detailed characterization of the link between changes in the ultrastructure and functionality of mitochondria during different nutritional conditions, can provide a successful approach to understand the role of these organelles in the plant response to Fe deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W764374545,"Although cognitive decline is very common in elders, age-related cognitive decline substantially differs among elders and the determinants of the differences in age-related cognitive decline are unclear. We investigated our hypothesis that the association between age and cognition was stronger in those with higher serum concentrations of organochlorine (OC) pesticides, common persistent and strongly lipophilic neurotoxic chemicals. Participants were 644 elders aged 60-85, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Six OC pesticides (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodipenyldichloroethylene (DDE), β-hexachlorocyclohexane, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, and heptachlor epoxide) were evaluated. ""Lower cognitive function"" was defined as having a low Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score (<25th percentile of DSST score, cutpoint 28 symbols substituted). Higher levels of β-hexachlorocyclohexane, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, and heptachlor epoxide modified the associations between age and lower cognitive function (Pinteraction<0.01, 0.03, <0.01, and 0.02, respectively). Elders in the 3rd tertile of these chemicals demonstrated a greater risk of lower cognitive function with aging, compared to those in the combined 1st and 2nd tertiles. Among those with highest OC pesticides (3rd tertile), the odds ratio for the risk of lower cognitive function was about 6 to 11 for the highest quintile of age (80-85 years) vs. the first quintile of age (60-63 years), while the association between age and lower cognitive function became flatter in those with lower OC pesticides (combined 1st and 2nd tertiles). Both DDT and DDE showed no interaction, with lower DSST scores for higher age irrespective of serum concentrations of DDT or DDE. Even though DSST score measures only one aspect of cognition, several OC pesticides modified aging-related prevalence of low cognitive score, a finding which should be evaluated in prospective studies."

Effective and stable excitation-contraction coupling critically depends not only on the expression of RyR2, but also on its distribution.

To study the distribution of RyR2 in living cardiomyocytes, we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing a GFP-tagged RyR2 (GFP-RyR2). Confocal imaging of live ventricular myocytes isolated from the GFP-RyR2 mouse heart revealed clusters of GFP-RyR2 organized in rows with a striated pattern. Similar organization of GFP-RyR2 clusters was observed in fixed ventricular myocytes. Immunofluorescence staining with the anti-α-actinin antibody (a z-line marker) showed that nearly all GFP-RyR2 clusters were localized in the z-line zone. There were small regions with dislocated GFP-RyR2 clusters. Interestingly, these same regions also displayed dislocated z-lines. Staining with di-8-ANEPPS revealed that nearly all GFP-RyR2 clusters were co-localized with transverse but not longitudinal tubules, whereas staining with MitoTracker Red showed that GFP-RyR2 clusters were not co-localized with mitochondria in live ventricular myocytes. We also found GFP-RyR2 clusters interspersed between z-lines only at the periphery of live ventricular myocytes. Simultaneous detection of GFP-RyR2 clusters and Ca2+ sparks showed that Ca2+ sparks originated exclusively from RyR2 clusters.

In this process, depolarization of the transverse tubular membrane activates the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel, resulting in a small influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol.

Interestingly, a significant portion of RyR2 clusters (∼20%) was found to be located between z-lines (26Lukyanenko V. Ziman A. Lukyanenko A. Salnikov V. Lederer W.J. Functional groups of ryanodine receptors in rat ventricular cells.J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These RyR2 clusters located in the middle of the sarcomere are thought to play an important role in the propagation of Ca2+ transients (27Subramanian S. Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Lukyanenko V. Györke S. Wiesner T.F. Underlying mechanisms of symmetric calcium wave propagation in rat ventricular myocytes.Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, other studies showed that nearly all RyR2 clusters are co-localized with α-actinin (28Soeller C. Crossman D. Gilbert R. Cannell M.B. Analysis of ryanodine receptor clusters in rat and human cardiac myocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14958-14963Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Jayasinghe I.D. Crossman D.J. Soeller C. Cannell M.B.

Cardiol. 2010; 48: 964-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a marker of the z-line. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. It is important to note that nearly all studies on RyR2 distribution in cardiomyocytes were carried out in fixed and/or permeabilized cells or tissues using immunostaining with anti-RyR2 antibodies. It is unclear whether cell or tissue fixation and/or permeabilization would alter the distribution and organization of RyR2. It is also uncertain whether the anti-RyR2 antibodies used recognize RyR2 unrelated epitopes. These concerns warrant the need to study the distribution of RyR2 directly in a more physiological setting. Information on the distribution of functional groups of RyR2s is also lacking. It is unclear whether the distribution of functional groups of RyR2s correlates with that of RyR2 clusters detected in fixed, permeabilized cardiac cells. Using mitochondria as markers, Lukyanenko et al. (26Lukyanenko V. Ziman A. Lukyanenko A. Salnikov V. Lederer W.J. Functional groups of ryanodine receptors in rat ventricular cells.J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that most of the Ca2+ sparks (functional groups of RyR2s) were detected in regions between mitochondria, where z-lines are thought to be located. However, a significant portion of Ca2+ sparks was also detected in regions near the middle of mitochondria. These indirect studies suggest that functional groups of RyR2s may exist between z-lines in the middle of sarcomere. However, a direct correlation between Ca2+ sparks and RyR2 clusters has yet to be demonstrated. To circumvent these potential problems with respect to antibody specificities or sample handling, we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing a GFP-tagged RyR2. Using confocal fluorescence imaging, we directly determined the distribution of RyR2 clusters in live cardiomyocytes isolated from the GFP-RyR2 mice. We found that nearly all GFP-RyR2 clusters were localized to the z-line zone and associated with transverse, but not longitudinal, tubules. On the other hand, GFP-RyR2 clusters were not co-localized with mitochondria, although they are in close proximity. Co-detection of GFP-RyR2 clusters and Ca2+ sparks revealed that Ca2+ sparks originate exclusively from RyR2 clusters. These studies shed novel insights into the distribution of RyR2 clusters and its functional correlation in living cardiomyocytes. A genomic DNA phage clone containing part of the mouse cardiac ryanodine receptor gene was isolated from the lambda mouse 129-SV/J genomic DNA library (Stratagene) and used to construct the RyR2 GFP knock-in targeting vector. This genomic DNA fragment (∼15 kb) was released from the lambda vector by NotI and subcloned into pBluescript to form the RyR2 genomic DNA plasmid. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate a 660-bp DNA fragment containing the AscI site inserted after residue Thr-1366 using the RyR2 genomic DNA plasmid as a template. The GFP flanked by glycine-rich linkers was inserted into this fragment via the AscI site. A 5.7-kb NotI-BamHI fragment was then subcloned into the targeting vector that contains a neomycin selection cassette flanked by FRT sites using NotI and BamHI to form the 5′ arm. A 5.4-kb SalI-XhoI fragment was inserted into the targeting vector to form the 3′ arm. All PCR fragments used for constructing the targeting vector were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and subsequently electroporated into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. G418-resistant ES clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting using an external probe. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from G418-resistant ES cell clones. ES cell DNA was digested using NcoI, separated on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, and subsequently blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. A DNA probe (∼700 bp) was generated by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using the specific primers 5′-GAGGAAGTACAGATCAGTTCTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCCTAGAGA CTTTCCCTTTCAC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was subsequently radiolabeled using [32P]dCTP by random priming (Invitrogen). DNA blots were hybridized with the radiolabeled probe and visualized by autoradiography. Eight positive homologous recombinants were detected of 780 ES cell clones, two of which were microinjected into blastocysts from C57BL/6J mice to generate male chimeras. Male chimeras were bred with female 129sve mice to generate germ line-transmitted heterozygous GFP-RyR2-neo knock-in mice. GFP-RyR2-neo male mice were bred with female mice that express Flp recombinase to remove the selectable marker (the neomycin-resistant gene, neo). The genotypes from F1 generation without neo were determined by PCR using DNA from tail biopsy specimens using the DNeasy tissue kit from Qiagen and the DNA primers PRIMER1 (5′-ATATCACTCCTAGACATACCCTCA-3′, forward), PRIMER2 (5′-CTTCAGCTCGATGCGGTTCAC-3′, forward) and PRIMER3 (5′-AGACCAGACAAGCCATCACACTA-3′, reverse). Ventricular myocytes were isolated using retrograde aortic perfusion as described previously (30Hunt D.J. Jones P.P. Wang R. Chen W. Bolstad J. Chen K. Shimoni Y. Chen S.R. K201 (JTV519) suppresses spontaneous Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 irrespective of FKBP12.6 association.Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were kept at room temperature in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES (KRH) buffer (125 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 6 mm glucose, and 1.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 20 mm taurine, 20 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, 5 mg/ml albumin, and 0.5–1 mm free Ca2+ until use. A portion of the isolated cells from the same mouse heart was fixed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in Ca2+ free KRH solution for 10 min at room temperature. Excess paraformaldehyde was removed by washing with KRH containing glycine (0.5 m). The fixed cells were kept in KRH buffer and stored at 4 °C until use. Live ventricular myocytes were stained with 3 μm di-8-ANEPPS (Invitrogen) or 2 μm MitoTracker Red-FM (Invitrogen) in KRH buffer containing 0.5–1 mm Ca2+ for 5–20 min at room temperature. The stained cells were washed three times for 5 min each with KRH solution containing 0.5–1 mm Ca2+ and kept at room temperature until use. Fixed ventricular myocytes were permeabilized with 1% (v/v) Triton (EMD Millipore) in KRH solution for 1 h. The permeabilized cells were washed three times and blocked with BlockAid blocking solution (Molecular Probes) overnight at 4 °C. Myocytes were washed again and incubated with primary monoclonal anti-α-actinin antibody (A7811; Sigma) diluted to 250 ng/ml in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times for 10 min each in blocking solution before incubated with a secondary antibody (4 ng/ml), Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated anti-mouse goat IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes), for 45 min at room temperature. After further washes with KRH buffer three times for 10 min each, cells were kept in Ca2+ free KRH at 4 °C until imaging. All imaging of live isolated ventricular myocytes was performed within 4–6 h after cell isolation. Isolated myocytes were placed onto laminin-coated micro glass coverslips (VWR, no. 1). After 5–10 min, unattached myocytes were gently removed via KRH buffer exchange (0.5–1 mm Ca2+). Cells were then staged onto the microscope for confocal imaging. Cell integrity was tested by pacing at 2–3 Hz. Only cardiomyocytes that followed electrical pacing were selected for subsequent live cell imaging. Fixed and permeabilized cardiomyocytes were transferred onto noncoated micro glass coverslips (VWR, no. 1) and allowed to settle to the coverslip for at least 10 min before imaging. Images were acquired with an inverted Nikon A1R scanning confocal microscope system equipped with a Nikon 60×/numerical aperture 1.2 Plan-Apochromat water immersion objective and selective excitation and emission filters. Excitation light was provided by argon (488 nm; Coherent Sapphire), yellow diode (561 nm; Coherent Sapphire), and red diode (635 nm; Coherent Sapphire) lasers to detect GFP (maximum excitation of 488 nm and maximum emission of 510 nm), di-8-ANEPPS (maximum excitation of 488 nm and maximum emission of 630 nm), MitoTracker Red-FM (maximum excitation of 581 nm and maximum emission of 644 nm), and Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibody (maximum excitation of 630 nm and maximum emission of 650 nm). Basic image processing and spectral fluorescence unmixing for co-detection and analysis of GFP and di-8-ANEPPS fluorescence signals were performed using the NIS Elements AR 4.13 software (Nikon). Ventricular myocytes isolated from GFP-RyR2 mice were loaded with Rhod-2 AM (5 μm; Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with KRH buffer three times and transferred onto laminin-coated cover glasses (VWR, no. 1). After mounted onto the detection stage, they were superfused with KRH solution containing 1.8–2 mm free Ca2+ at 35–37 °C. Confocal line scan Ca2+ imaging was performed to record individual Ca2+ release events using the Nikon A1R confocal microscope system equipped with a Nikon 60×/numerical aperture 1.2 Plan-Apochromat water immersion objective. Images of Ca2+ release events were acquired at a sampling rate of 1.8–1.9 ms/line along the longitudinal axis of the myocytes in the line scan mode. Ventricular myocytes were loaded with Rhod-2 AM (2.5–5.0 μm) at 4 °C for 75 min to facilitate loading of Rhod-2 AM to mitochondria as previously described (31Griffiths E.J. Stern M.D. Silverman H.S.

Cytosolic Rhod-2 dye was removed through incubation at 37 °C for 3–4 h until a clear mitochondrial pattern of Rhod-2 labeling was observed. The cells were then superfused with KRH buffer containing 3 mm extracellular Ca2+ and paced at 3 Hz for 30–60 s. The fluorescence signals of GFP and Rhod-2 were co-detected using confocal fluorescence microscopy. For monitoring cytosolic Ca2+ level, the Rhod-2-loaded cells were incubated with Fluo-4 AM (2.5–5 μm) in KRH buffer containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ for 25 min at room temperature. The Fluo-4/Rhod-2-loaded cells were then washed and superfused with KRH containing 3 mm extracellular Ca2+ and paced again at 3 Hz for 30–60 s. The fluorescence signals of Fluo-4, GFP, and Rhod-2 were co-detected using confocal fluorescence microscopy. All image processing and detection methods were implemented using MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Boston, MA). GFP-RyR2 x-y images were processed as follows. First, a histogram-based normalization procedure was applied to the images to adjust the range to the background fluorescence level. The normalization ensured that the resulting images were not affected by outlier pixels in the image. Noise filtering and GFP-RyR2 enhancement was performed by applying a two-dimensional convolution using a Gaussian template with a σ value of ∼1 μm (twice the diameter of the microscope's point spread function). The resulting convolved image was rescaled to the interval [0.1], and all regions above 0.5 were marked as candidates for GFP-RyR2. Regions smaller than 0.1 μm2 were discarded, and regions containing more than one local maxima (because of noise) were smoothed by means of a median filter until left with a single central maxima. Spatial resolution ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 μm. For each detected GFP-RyR2 cluster, cluster size was defined as the distance at which the intensity decays to 80% of its maximum, measured by Gaussian fits to eight cross-sections of the cluster taken in angular increments of 45°. Line scan images were normalized using a time-dependent basal fluorescence level to correct for temporal drifts in the basal fluorescence. Sparks were detected from the normalized images by using a custom watershed segmentation method with a size-dependent stopping rule. Background noise was estimated to filter sparks using amplitude thresholding. Sparks producing a goodness of fit in the exponential decay fit R̂2 < 0.85 were excluded from the analysis. All detected sparks were validated manually. The distance from the spark initiation focus to the nearest RyR2 cluster was measured. All values shown are means ± S.E. unless indicated otherwise. To test for differences between groups, we used unpaired Student's t tests (two-tailed). A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To study the distribution of RyR2 clusters and the correlation of their distribution to function in living cells, we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing a GFP-tagged RyR2 (Fig. 1A). The GFP was inserted into RyR2 after residue Thr-1366 (Fig. 1B). To minimize potential steric hindrance, the GFP sequence was flanked by 10-residue Gly-rich linkers on both sides of the GFP (Fig. 1B). The three-dimensional location of the inserted GFP was mapped previously to subdomain 6 in the “clamp” region of the three-dimensional structure of RyR2 (Fig. 1C) (34Liu Z. Zhang J. Wang R. Wayne Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Location of divergent region 2 on the three-dimensional structure of cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged RyR2 formed caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive functional Ca2+ release channel (34Liu Z. Zhang J. Wang R. Wayne Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Location of divergent region 2 on the three-dimensional structure of cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the insertion of GFP did not grossly alter the structure and function of the RyR2 channel. We also did not observe gross defects in the GFP-tagged RyR2 mice. To determine the distribution of RyR2 in living cells, we isolated ventricular myocytes from GFP-RyR2 mouse hearts in the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ (0.5–1.5 mm) to minimize spontaneous contraction. The GFP fluorescence signal was then detected using a confocal microscope in a line scan mode. As shown in Fig. 2, GFP-RyR2s were clearly detected as highly organized discrete clusters in the interior and at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 2). A majority of these clusters were distributed in highly ordered transverse rows with an average spacing of 1.88 μm (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Some of the GFP-RyR2 clusters were dislocated, particularly within or near the perinuclear region (Fig. 2b) or in other regions of the cell"
https://openalex.org/W820716646,"Background Short-term intermittent hypoxia (IH) is common in patients with acute respiratory disorders. Although prolonged exposure to hypoxia induces atrophy and increased fatigability of skeletal muscle, the response to short-term IH is less well known. We hypothesized that the diaphragm and limb muscles would adapt differently to short-term IH given that hypoxia stimulates ventilation and triggers a superimposed exercise stimulus in the diaphragm. Methods We determined the structural, metabolic, and contractile properties of the mouse diaphragm after 4 days of IH (8 hours per day, 30 episodes per hour to a FiO2 nadir=6%), and compared responses in the diaphragm to a commonly studied reference limb muscle, the tibialis anterior. Outcome measures included muscle fiber size, assays of muscle proteolysis (calpain, ubiquitin-proteasome, and autophagy pathways), markers of oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, quantification of intramyocellular lipid and lipid metabolism genes, type I myosin heavy chain (MyHC) expression, and in vitro contractile properties. Results After 4 days of IH, the diaphragm alone demonstrated significant atrophy (30% decrease of myofiber size) together with increased LC3B-II protein (2.4-fold) and mRNA markers of the autophagy pathway (LC3B, Gabarapl1, Bnip3), whereas active calpain and E3 ubiquitin ligases (MuRF1, atrogin-1) were unaffected in both muscles. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was significantly reduced by IH in both muscles. However, only the diaphragm exhibited increased intramyocellular lipid droplets (2.5-fold) after IH, along with upregulation of genes linked to activated lipid metabolism. In addition, although the diaphragm showed evidence for acute fatigue immediately following IH, it underwent an adaptive fiber type switch toward slow type I MyHC-expressing fibers, associated with greater intrinsic endurance of the muscle during repetitive stimulation in vitro. Conclusions Short-term IH induces preferential atrophy in the mouse diaphragm together with increased autophagy and a rapid compensatory metabolic adaptation associated with enhanced fatigue resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1864210574,"Mechanisms of immune regulation in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are still unclear. The aim of our study was to determine an impact of Th17 / regulatory T (Treg) cells balance and its corresponding cytokine profile on the ALD outcome. Possible gender-related differences in the alcohol-induced inflammatory response were also assessed.147 patients with ALD were prospectively recruited, assigned to subgroups based on their gender, severity of liver dysfunction and presence of ALD complications at admission, and followed for 90 days. Peripheral blood frequencies of Th17 and Treg cells together with IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-23, and TGF-beta1 levels were investigated. Flow cytometry was used to identify T cell phenotype and immunoenzymatic ELISAs for the corresponding cytokine concentrations assessment. Multivariable logistic regression was applied in order to select independent predictors of advanced liver dysfunction and the disease complications.IL-17A, IL-1beta, IL-6 levels were significantly increased, while TGF-beta1 decreased in ALD patients. The imbalance with significantly higher Th17 and lower Treg frequencies was observed in non-survivors. IL-6 and TGF-beta1 levels differed in relation to patient gender in ALD group. Concentrations of IL-6 were associated with the severity of liver dysfunction, development of ALD complications, and turned out to be the only independent immune predictor of 90-day survival in the study cohort.We conclude that IL-6 revealed the highest diagnostic and prognostic potential among studied biomarkers and was related to the fatal ALD course. Gender-related differences in immune regulation might influence the susceptibility to alcohol-associated liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2218963118,"To evaluate the risk of premotor symptoms, namely rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD), constipation, and depression among patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease (PD).A total of 705 PD patients and 2,820 control subjects were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were traced back for a maximum of 14 years to determine the diagnoses of RBD, depression, and constipation. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk of premotor symptoms for PD. Moreover, subgroup analyses were performed by dividing the patients into a middle-age onset group (≤ 64 years) and an old-age onset group (≥ 65 years). The associations between these premotor symptoms and age of PD onset were further examined.An association was found between a history of premotor symptoms and newly diagnosed PD in which a high occurrence of premotor symptoms was identified in PD patients as compared to selected controls (4.3% vs. 1.2% for RBD, 40.4% vs. 24.0% for constipation, and 13.0% vs. 5.1% for depression). The strength of this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders (3.69 fold risk for RBD, 2.36 for constipation, and 2.82 for depression, all p < 0.0001). The average interval between premotor symptoms and PD ranged from 4.5 to 6.2 years. RBD and depression carried higher risks for PD in the middle-age onset group than in the old-age onset group (7.20- vs. 2.24-fold risk for RBD, 6.06 vs. 1.40 for depression).The prevalence of premotor symptoms was higher among the PD patients than in the controls. Premotor symptoms appeared to be associated with a higher risk for PD in subjects with an earlier age of onset."
https://openalex.org/W2270491557,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of neurological disability. In this retrospective study, serum total cholinesterase (ChE) activities were analyzed in 188 patients for diagnostic as well as predictive values for mortality.Within 72 hours after injury, serum ChE activities including both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were measured. Disease severity was evaluated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Glasgow Coma Score, length of coma, post-traumatic amnesia and injury feature. Neurocognitive and functional scores were assessed using clinical records. Of 188 patients, 146 (77.7%) survived and 42 (22.3%) died within 90 days. Lower ChE activities were noted in the non-survivors vs. survivors (5.94±2.19 vs. 7.04±2.16 kU/L, p=0.023), in septic vs. non-infected patients (5.93±1.89 vs. 7.31±2.45 kU/L, p=0.0005) and in patients with extremely severe injury vs. mild injury (6.3±1.98 vs. 7.57±2.48 kU/L, p=0.049). The trajectories of serum ChE levels were also different between non-survivors and survivors, septic and non-infected patients, mild and severely injured patients, respectively. Admission ChE activities were closely correlated with blood cell counts, neurocognitive and functional scores both on admission and at discharge. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve for ChE was inferior to that for either APACHE II or white blood cell (WBC) count. However, at the optimal cutoff value of 5 kU/L, the sensitivity of ChE for correct prediction of 90-day mortality was 65.5% and the specificity was 86.4%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lower ChE activity (<5 kU/L) was more closely correlated with poor survival than higher ChE activity (>5 kU/L) (p=0.04). After adjusting for other variables, ChE was identified as a borderline independent predictor for mortality as analyzed by Binary logistic regression (P=0.078).Lowered ChE activity measured on admission appears to be associated with disease severity and outcome for TBI patients."
https://openalex.org/W1139607813,"Hereditary spherocytosis (HS), a common form of inherited hemolytic anemia, is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defects, and mode of inheritance. Causal mutations in at least five genes have been reported so far. Because multiple genes have been associated with HS, clinical genetic testing that relies on direct sequencing will be a challenge. In this study, we used whole exome sequencing to identify a novel nonsense mutation in ANK1 (p.Q1772X, NM_020476) that resulted in a truncated protein in a Korean patient with HS. Sanger sequencing confirmed the two affected individuals in the patient's family were heterozygous for the mutation. This is the first report of a Korean family that carries an ANK1 mutation responsible for HS. Our results demonstrate that next generation sequencing is a powerful approach for rapidly determining the genetic etiology of HS."
https://openalex.org/W1644998041,"The visual cortex is able to extract disparity information through the use of binocular cells. This process is reflected by the Disparity Energy Model, which describes the role and functioning of simple and complex binocular neuron populations, and how they are able to extract disparity. This model uses explicit cell parameters to mathematically determine preferred cell disparities, like spatial frequencies, orientations, binocular phases and receptive field positions. However, the brain cannot access such explicit cell parameters; it must rely on cell responses. In this article, we implemented a trained binocular neuronal population, which encodes disparity information implicitly. This allows the population to learn how to decode disparities, in a similar way to how our visual system could have developed this ability during evolution. At the same time, responses of monocular simple and complex cells can also encode line and edge information, which is useful for refining disparities at object borders. The brain should then be able, starting from a low-level disparity draft, to integrate all information, including colour and viewpoint perspective, in order to propagate better estimates to higher cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2277480491,"We monitored the number of caiman (Caiman crocodilus yacare) nests in two ranches in the Brazilian Pantanal that cover an area of about 50.000 ha for 28 years (1987-2014). The number of nests was related to combinations of rainfall, water level, and number of days with temperature below 20°C, depending on the area. Most of the variation in number of nests could not be predicted by the environmental variables, but could be represented mathematically by a sine wave. We were not able to identify any external driver and suspect that the regular fluctuations may have resulted from an intrinsic population process. Presently, ranches are used as management units under the legislation for ranching Pantanal caimans. However, although some breeding females were recaptured in the area after periods of up to 21 years, most were not recaptured near nests or in general surveys of the area, suggesting that females are not strongly philopatric and that ranches do not represent isolated demographic units."

Methyl-CpG binding domain protein-enriched genome sequencing (MBD-Seq) method was employed in the detection of the 1,155 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across the entire genome. After validation, we ascertained the genomic DMRs distribution and annotated them regarding genes, transcription start sites (TSS) and CpG islands. We found that global DNA methylation decreased in vaccinated birds, presenting 704 hypomethylated and 451 hypermethylated DMRs, respectively. Additionally, we performed an enrichment analysis detecting gene networks, in which cancer and RNA post-transcriptional modification appeared in the first place, followed by humoral immune response, immunological disease and inflammatory disease. The top four identified canonical pathways were EIF2 signaling, regulation of EIF4 and p70S6K signaling, axonal guidance signaling and mTOR signaling, providing new insight regarding the mechanisms of ILT etiology. Lastly, the association between DNA methylation and differentially expressed genes was examined, and detected negative correlation in seventeen of the eighteen genes."
https://openalex.org/W773325817,"Background Breast cancer survivors have an increased risk of bone fracture. But the risk among young patients with adjuvant therapies remains unknown. This population-based study is aimed to assess the incidence and risk of fracture among young (age of 20 to 39 years) breast cancer patients who received adjuvant therapies. Methods From January 2001 to December 2007, 5,146 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were enrolled from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Patients were observed for a maximum of 6 years to determine the incidence of newly onset fracture. Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk of fracture in young breast cancer patients who received adjuvant treatments. Results Of the total 5,146 young (age of 20 to 39 years) breast cancer patients, the Cox multivariate proportional hazards analysis showed that AIs, radiotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies were significantly associated with a high risk of fracture. Moreover, patients who received AIs for more than 180 days had a high hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 (95% CI = 0.68–4.57), and patients who received more than four radiotherapy visits had a high HR of 2.54 (95% CI = 1.07–6.06). Under the site-specific analysis, young breast cancer patients who received AIs had the highest risk of hip fracture (HR = 8.520, 95% CI = 1.711–42.432, p < 0.04), whereas patients who received radiotherapy had the highest risk of vertebral fracture (HR = 5.512, 95% CI = 1.847–16.451, p < 0.01). Conclusion Young breast cancer patients who are receiving AIs, radiotherapy or monoclonal antibody need to be more careful for preventing fracture events. Breast cancer treatment plans are suggested to incorporate fracture prevention interventions."

In Bavaria, sedentary Greylag geese (Anser anser) are monitored during the winter by two different citizen-based monitoring schemes: the International Waterbird Census [IWC] and hunting bag statistics. We compared the results of both schemes for the seasons 1988/89 to 2010/11 by analysing annual indices calculated using the software TRends and Indices for Monitoring Data—TRIM. Results and Discussion We identified similar, highly significant rates of increase in both data sets for the entire region of Bavaria (IWC 14% [13–15%], bag 13% [12–14%]). Furthermore, in all of the seven Bavarian regions, trends in annual indices of both data sets correlated significantly. The quality of both datasets as indicators of abundances in Greylag geese populations in Bavaria was not undermined by either weaknesses typically associated with citizen based monitoring or problems generally assumed for IWC and bag data. We also show that bag data are, under the German system of collecting bag statistics, a reliable indicator of species’ distribution, especially for detecting newly colonized areas. Therefore, wildlife managers may want to consider bag data from citizen science led monitoring programmes as evidence supporting the decision making processes. We also discuss requirements for any bag monitoring schemes being established to monitor trends in species’ distribution and abundance."

This study applied the Approximate Bayesian Computation algorithm to fit 6 different proposed models to each of the 5 regions of Brazil, then fitted hierarchical models based on the best-fit regional models to the entire country. The best model proposed for most regions was a simple model. Posterior checks found that the model results were more similar to the observed incidence after fitting than before, and that parameters varied slightly by region. Current control programs were predicted to require additional measures to eliminate Hansen's Disease as a public health problem in Brazil."

https://openalex.org/W2213766209,"Therapeutic peptides that target antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) can suppress experimental autoimmune diseases. The heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, with its expression elevated in inflamed tissue, is a suitable candidate antigen because administration of both bacterial and mouse Hsp70 peptides has been shown to induce strong immune responses and to reduce inflammation via the activation or induction of Hsp specific Tregs. Although two subsets of Tregs exist, little is known about which subset of Tregs are activated by Hsp70 epitopes. Therefore, we set out to determine whether natural nTregs (derived from the thymus), or induced iTregs (formed in the periphery from CD4+CD25- naïve T cells) were targeted after Hsp70-peptide immunization. We immunized mice with the previously identified Hsp70 T cell epitope B29 and investigated the formation of functional iTregs by using an in vitro suppression assay and adoptive transfer therapy in mice with experimental arthritis. To study the in vivo induction of Tregs after peptide immunization, we depleted CD25+ cells prior to immunization, allowing the in vivo formation of Tregs from CD4+CD25- precursors. This approach allowed us to study in vivo B29-induced Tregs and to compare these cells with Tregs from non-depleted immunized mice. Our results show that using this approach, immunization induced CD4+CD25+ T cells in the periphery, and that these cells were suppressive in vitro. Additionally, adoptive transfer of B29-specific iTregs suppressed disease in a mouse model of arthritis. This study shows that immunization of mice with Hsp70 epitope B29 induces functionally suppressive iTregs from CD4+CD25- T cells."

We investigated in a swine model of HS the effects of vasopressin infusion along with small-volume fluid resuscitation; with erythropoietin (EPO) and HS severity as additional factors.HS was induced in 24 male domestic pigs (36 to 41 kg) by blood withdrawal (BW) through a right atrial cannula modeling spontaneous bleeding by a mono-exponential decay function. The initial 12 pigs received no fluids; the last 12 pigs received normal saline (NS) half the BW volume. Pigs were randomized 2:1 to receive intraosseously vasopressin (0.04 U/kg·min-1) or vehicle control from minute 7 to minute 210. Pigs assigned to vasopressin were further randomized 1:1 to receive EPO (1,200 U/kg) or vehicle control and 1:1 to have 65% or 75% BW of their blood volume. Shed blood was reinfused at 210 minutes and the pigs recovered from anesthesia.Survival at 72 hours was influenced by vasopressin and NS but not by EPO or % BW. Vasopressin with NS promoted the highest survival (8/8) followed by vasopressin without NS (3/8), NS without vasopressin (1/4), and neither treatment (0/4) with overall statistical significance (log-rank test, p = 0.009) and each subset different from vasopressin with NS by Holm-Sidak test. Vasopressin increased systemic vascular resistance whereas NS increased cardiac output.Vasopressin infusion with small-volume fluid resuscitation during severe HS was highly effective enabling critical hemodynamic stabilization and improved 72 hour survival."
https://openalex.org/W2135224352,"Characterisation of Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the context of multiple HCV exposures is critical to identify broadly protective immune responses necessary for an effective HCV vaccine against the different HCV genotypes. However, host and viral genetic diversity complicates vaccine development. To compensate for the observed variation in circulating autologous viruses and host molecules that restrict antigen presentation (human leucocyte antigens; HLA), this study used a reverse genomics approach that identified sites of viral adaptation to HLA-restricted T-cell immune pressure to predict genotype-specific HCV CD8+ T-cell targets. Peptides representing these putative HCV CD8+ T-cell targets, and their adapted form, were used in individualised IFN-γ ELISpot assays to screen for HCV-specific T-cell responses in 133 HCV-seropositive subjects with high-risk of multiple HCV exposures. The data obtained from this study i) confirmed that genetic studies of viral evolution is an effective approach to detect novel in vivo HCV T-cell targets, ii) showed that HCV-specific T-cell epitopes can be recognised in their adapted form and would not have been detected using wild-type peptides and iii) showed that HCV-specific T-cell (but not antibody) responses against alternate genotypes in chronic HCV-infected subjects are readily found, implying clearance of previous alternate genotype infection. In summary, HCV adaptation to HLA Class I-restricted T-cell responses plays a central role in anti-HCV immunity and multiple HCV genotype exposure is highly prevalent in at-risk exposure populations, which are important considerations for future vaccine design."
