https://openalex.org/W2008667095,"Although primary CD8 responses to acute infections are independent of CD4 help, it is unknown whether a similar situation applies to secondary responses. We show that depletion of CD4 cells during the recall response has minimal effect, whereas depletion during the priming phase leads to reduced responses by memory CD8 cells to reinfection. Memory CD8 cells generated in CD4+/+ mice responded normally when transferred into CD4-/- hosts, whereas memory CD8 cells generated in CD4-/- mice mounted defective recall responses in CD4+/+ adoptive hosts. These results demonstrate a previously undescribed role for CD4 help in the development of functional CD8 memory."
https://openalex.org/W2076534074,"The CD8 + cytotoxic T cell response to pathogens is thought to be CD4 + helper T cell independent because infectious agents provide their own inflammatory signals. Mice that lack CD4 + T cells mount a primary CD8 response to Listeria monocytogenes equal to that of wild-type mice and rapidly clear the infection. However, protective memory to a challenge is gradually lost in the former animals. Memory CD8 + T cells from normal mice can respond rapidly, but memory CD8 + T cells that are generated without CD4 help are defective in their ability to respond to secondary encounters with antigen. The results highlight a previously undescribed role for CD4 help in promoting protective CD8 memory development."

Analyses of Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2 (gin2) mutants define the physiological functions of a specific hexokinase (HXK1) in the plant glucose-signaling network. HXK1 coordinates intrinsic signals with extrinsic light intensity. HXK1 mutants lacking catalytic activity still support various signaling functions in gene expression, cell proliferation, root and inflorescence growth, and leaf expansion and senescence, thus demonstrating the uncoupling of glucose signaling from glucose metabolism. The gin2 mutants are also insensitive to auxin and hypersensitive to cytokinin. Plants use HXK as a glucose sensor to interrelate nutrient, light, and hormone signaling networks for controlling growth and development in response to the changing environment."

To identify genes that mediate the conserved biological outputs of daf-2 /insulin-like signaling, we usedcomparative genomics to identify 17 orthologous genes from Caenorhabditis and Drosophila , each of which bears a DAF-16 binding site in the promoter region. One-third of these DAF-16 downstream candidate genes were regulatedby daf-2 /insulin-like signaling in C. elegans , and RNA interference inactivation of the candidates showed that many of these genes mediate distinct aspects of daf-16 function, including longevity, metabolism, anddevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2049806614,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration are important events in the development of atherosclerosis. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) mediates suppression of SMC migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Here we show that LRP1 forms a complex with the PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Inactivation of LRP1 in vascular SMCs of mice causes PDGFR overexpression and abnormal activation of PDGFR signaling, resulting in disruption of the elastic layer, SMC proliferation, aneurysm formation, and marked susceptibility to cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis. The development of these abnormalities was reduced by treatment with Gleevec, an inhibitor of PDGF signaling. Thus, LRP1 has a pivotal role in protecting vascular wall integrity and preventing atherosclerosis by controlling PDGFR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2008118174,"The mechanisms that establish and maintain the multipotency of stem cells are poorly understood. In neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), the HMG-box factor SOX10 preserves not only glial, but surprisingly, also neuronal potential from extinction by lineage commitment signals. The latter function is reflected in the requirement of SOX10 in vivo for induction of MASH1 and PHOX2B, two neurogenic transcription factors. Simultaneously, SOX10 inhibits or delays overt neuronal differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. However, this activity requires a higher Sox10 gene dosage than does the maintenance of neurogenic potential. The opponent functions of SOX10 to maintain neural lineage potentials, while simultaneously serving to inhibit or delay neuronal differentiation, suggest that it functions in stem or progenitor cell maintenance, in addition to its established role in peripheral gliogenesis."

We show that reversible strain amplitudes comparable to those of commercial piezoceramics can be induced in metals by introducing a continuous network of nanometer-sized pores with a high surface area and by controlling the surface electronic charge density through an applied potential relative to an electrolyte impregnating the pores."
https://openalex.org/W2094494461,"Rapid turnover of the tumor suppressor protein p53 requires the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase, and both interact with p300–CREB-binding protein transcriptional coactivator proteins. p53 is stabilized by the binding of p300 to the oncoprotein E1A, suggesting that p300 regulates p53 degradation. Purified p300 exhibited intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity that was inhibited by E1A. In vitro, p300 with MDM2 catalyzed p53 polyubiquitination, whereas MDM2 catalyzed p53 monoubiquitination. E1A expression caused a decrease in polyubiquitinated but not monoubiquitinated p53 in cells. Thus, generation of the polyubiquitinated forms of p53 that are targeted for proteasome degradation requires the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activities of MDM2 and p300."
https://openalex.org/W2026960083,"Humans and their closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees, differ in ∼1.24% of their genomic DNA sequences. The fraction of these changes accumulated during the speciation processes that have separated the two lineages may be of special relevance in understanding the basis of their differences. We analyzed human and chimpanzee sequence data to search for the patterns of divergence and polymorphism predicted by a theoretical model of speciation. According to the model, positively selected changes should accumulate in chromosomes that present fixed structural differences, such as inversions, between the two species. Protein evolution was more than 2.2 times faster in chromosomes that had undergone structural rearrangements compared with colinear chromosomes. Also, nucleotide variability is slightly lower in rearranged chromosomes. These patterns of divergence and polymorphism may be, at least in part, the molecular footprint of speciation events in the human and chimpanzee lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2123447603,"The emergence of virulent Plasmodium falciparum in Africa within the past 6000 years as a result of a cascade of changes in human behavior and mosquito transmission has recently been hypothesized. Here, we provide genetic evidence for a sudden increase in the African malaria parasite population about 10,000 years ago, followed by migration to other regions on the basis of variation in 100 worldwide mitochondrial DNA sequences. However, both the world and some regional populations appear to be older (50,000 to 100,000 years old), suggesting an earlier wave of migration out of Africa, perhaps during the Pleistocene migration of human beings."
https://openalex.org/W2146008820,"It has been unclear whether the hippocampus is uniquely important for episodic memory (memory for events that are specific to time and place) or whether the hippocampus is also important for learning and remembering facts (semantic memory). In two studies, we assessed the capacity for semantic memory in patients with bilateral damage thought to be restricted primarily to the hippocampal region who developed memory impairment at a known time. Since the onset of their memory impairment, the patients have acquired less factual knowledge than controls. The patients also exhibit temporally limited retrograde amnesia for factual information from the several years preceding the onset of memory impairment. Remote memory for factual knowledge (from 11-30 years before amnesia) is intact. The results show that the hippocampal region supports semantic memory as well as episodic memory and that its role in the acquisition and storage of semantic knowledge is time limited."
https://openalex.org/W1997139942,"During action potential firing, the rate of synapsin dissociation from synaptic vesicles and dispersion into axons controls the rate of vesicle availability for exocytosis at the plasma membrane. Here we show that synapsin Ia's dispersion rate tracks the synaptic vesicle pool turnover rate linearly over the range 5-20 Hz and that the molecular basis for this lies in regulation at both the calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaM kinase) and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/calcineurin sites. Our results show that CaM kinase sites control vesicle mobilization at low stimulus frequency, while MAP kinase/calcineurin sites are critical at both lower and higher stimulus frequencies. Thus, multiple signaling pathways serve to allow synapsin's control of vesicle mobilization over different stimulus frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2057199361,"Mucin hypersecretion is commonly observed in many inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. MUC5AC is generally recognized to be a major airway mucin because MUC5AC is highly expressed in the goblet cells of human airway epithelium. Moreover, it is regulated by various inflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms by which the interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induce MUC5AC gene expression in normal nasal epithelial cells, and the signal molecules involved, especially in the downstream signaling of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, remain unclear. Here we show that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of either ERK or p38 MAP kinase pathway abolished IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MUC5AC gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial cells. Our results also indicate that the activation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) and cAMP-response element-binding protein and cAMP-response element signaling cascades via ERK and p38 MAP kinases are crucial aspects of the intracellular mechanisms that mediate MUC5AC gene expression.

Given that mucin hypersecretion is an uncontrolled mucin expression during inflammation, unveiling of the signal transduction pathway for inflammatory cytokine-induced MUC5AC gene expression would give an important clue to the understanding of airway mucus hypersecretion.It is well documented that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways are thought to be most important in transmitting inflammatory signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (30Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar). After being triggered by growth factors, cytokines, UV rays, or other stress-inducing agents, a signal is delivered down the MAPKKK → MAPKK (in the cases of ERK, JNK, and p38, the signal is delivered through MEK1/2, MKK4/7, and MKK3/6, respectively) to the MAP kinase cascade. The MAP kinases play a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, and the cell cycle (31Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Google Scholar, 38Arther J.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 44-48Google Scholar, 39Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Google Scholar). MSK1 is activated in vitro and in vivo by two different classes of MAP kinases, ERK and p38 MAP kinases (37Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Google Scholar). Moreover, MSK1 is localized in the nuclei of stimulated or unstimulated cells (39Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Google Scholar), and two potential in vivo substrates are the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and the closely related activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) (39Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Google Scholar).Recently, reactive oxygen species were reported to increase the expression of the MUC5AC gene, by activating the ERK MAP kinase pathway (25Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Shim J.J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Google Scholar), and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae was reported to regulate MUC5AC transcription via p38 MAP kinase in human epithelial cells (40Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar). In a study of MUC2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to activate NF-κB through Ras-MAPK-pp90rsk, which led to the increased expression of MUC2, but p38 was not involved in this pathway (41Li J.D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of MUC5AC gene expression during inflammation in normal airway epithelial cells, and the signal molecules involved, especially in the downstream signaling of MAP kinases have not yet been demonstrated.Because MUC5AC hypersecretion during inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of airway diseases, we hypothesized that major inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, up-regulate MUC5AC gene expression by activating specific signal transduction pathways in airway epithelial cells. Here we show that two different MAP kinases, ERK and p38 MAP kinases, are essential for IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MUC5AC gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. We also show that MSK1 mediates the IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of CREB and the transcription of MUC5AC. Furthermore, the cAMP-response element (CRE) in the MUC5AC promoter appears to be important for IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MUC5AC gene expression in NCI-H292 cells. These pathways provide new insights into molecular mucous hypersecretion and may open up novel targets for therapeutic intervention.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PD98059, SB203580, and anti-α-tubulin antibody were purchased from Calbiochem.

Plasmid encoding kinase-deficient MEK1 mutant (pcDNA5-MEK1DN) and p38 mutant (pcDNA3-p38AGF) were kindly provided by Dr. Jian-Dong Li (House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, CA) and Dr. Yoshiyuki Kuchino (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Saitama, Japan), respectively. Wide-type MSK1 and N- and C-terminal kinase dead MSK1 mutant constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Dario Alessi (University of Dundee, Dundee, UK). Reporter construct, the 3.8-kb MUC5AC 5′-flanking region fused to a luciferase reporter gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Carol Basbaum (University of California, San Francisco).Cell Cultures—The culture system used for the normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells was as described previously (42Yoon J.H. Kim K.S. Kim S.S. Lee J.G. Park I.Y. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 2000; 109: 594-601Google Scholar). The human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line (NCI-H292) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1848; Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. For serum deprivation, confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and recultured in RPMI 1640 with 0.2% fetal bovine serum.RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from NCI-H292 cells treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml). cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Roche Applied Science) using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed based on the GenBank™ sequence of MUC5AC (GenBank™ accession number AJ001402, 5′ primer CGACAACTACTTCTGCGGTGC; 3′ primer GCACTCATCCTTCCTGTCGTT). The following PCR conditions used involved 35 cycles: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 30 s. The oligonucleotide primers for β2-microglobulin (used as a control gene for the RT-PCR) were designed based on the GenBank™ human sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM007650, 5′ primer CTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCTGG; 3′ primer GCTTACATGTCTCGATCCCACTTAA). PCR parameters used involved 23 cycles as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were run in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide under a transilluminator.Real Time—PCR Primers and probes were designed with PerkinElmer Life Sciences Primer Express® software and purchased from PE Biosystems. Commercial reagents (TaqMan PCR Universal PCR Master Mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol were applied. An amount of 1 μg of cDNA (reverse transcription mixture) and oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 800 nm of primers and 200 nm of TaqMan hybridization probes were analyzed in a 25-μl volume. The probe of real-time PCR was labeled with carboxyfluoroscein (FAM) at the 5′ end and with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) at the 3′ end. The following primers and TaqMan probes were used: MUC5AC, forward 5′-CAGCCACGTCCCCTTCAATA-3′ and reverse 5′-ACCGCATTTGGGCATCC-3′; TaqMan probe 6FAM-CCACCTCCGAGCCCGTCACTGAG-TAMRA; β2-microglobulin, forward 5′-CGCTCCGTGGCCTTAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAGTACGCTGGATAGCCTCCA-3′; and TaqMan probe 6FAM-TGCTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCTGGC-TAMRA. Real time RT-PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System. The thermocycler (ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System) parameters were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Relative quantity of MUC5AC mRNA was obtained using a comparative cycle threshold method and was normalized using β2-microglobulin as an endogenous control.Western Blot Analysis—NCI-H292 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. After 15 or 45 min of treatment with IL-1β or TNF-α, respectively, the cells were lysed with 2× lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. This blot was then incubated overnight with primary antibody in TTBS (0.5% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). After washing with TTBS, the blot was further incubated for 45 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling) in TTBS and then visualized by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro p38 Kinase Assay—p38 kinase activity was measured using a p38 MAP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, confluent cells were rendered quiescent for 24 h and then incubated with or without 20 μm SB203580 for 1 h prior to being stimulated with IL-1β or TNF-α for 15 min. Cells lysates were scraped off the dish with 500 μl of lysis buffer and 1 mm PMSF, sonicated 4 times for 5 s each on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then transferred to a new tube, and 400 μg of the cell lysates and 20 μl of immobilized phospho-p38 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody were incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with lysis and kinase buffer and then resuspended in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) fusion protein. It was then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and immunoblotted with phospho-ATF2 antibody.Preparation of Inducible Dominant-negative Mutant Stable Cell Lines—Plasmid encoding the kinase-deficient MEK1 mutant (pcDNA5-MEK1DN) was cut with BamHI and ligated with pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This clone was cut with HindIII, filled in with Klenow, cut with SacII (Promega), and then ligated with pTRE vector. Plasmid encoding kinase-inactive p38 mutant (pcDNA3-p38(AGF)) was cut with BamHI, filled in with Klenow, cut with XbaI (Promega, Madison, WI), and then ligated with pTRE vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). NCI-H292 cells were cotransfected with pTet-off (Clontech) regulation vector and pTRE-p38DN or pTRE-MEK1DN (1:20 ratio of regulation vector to expression vector) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Stably transfected cell lines were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), and the medium was replaced with G418 and doxycycline every 3 days.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis (EMSA)—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Pellets were then resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer I (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated for 15 min on ice, and vortexed vigorously. Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer II (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and vigorously vortexed. The nuclear extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at –70 °C. For EMSA, oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus CRE sequences (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′), CRE-specific sequences in the MUC5AC promoter region –878 to –871 (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACTTGAAGAGCTAG-3′), and the CRE mutant sequence (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACTGACAGAGCTAG-3′) were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extract was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with the 32P-labeled CRE probe in binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). DNA-nuclear protein complexes were separated from the DNA probe by electrophoresis through 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA (TBE) buffer. Supershift experiments were conducted using 2 μl of anti-phospho-CREB antibody. The gel was dried and autoradiographed using an intensifying screen at –70 °C.Plamids, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing wide-type MSK1, N-terminal kinase dead MSK1 mutant (D195A), C-terminal kinase dead MSK1 mutant (D565A), CREB DN (S133A), and reporter constructs, and the MUC5AC 5′-flanking region was fused to a luciferase reporter gene using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deletion mutants covering promoter regions of MUC5AC were generated by PCR using pairs of primers bearing specific restriction sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends (Table I) and then were constructed in promoterless pGL3 basic vector. Cells were incubated for 48 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity, using a luciferase assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was also assayed to standardize the transfection efficiency of each sample.Table ISequences of the pairs of oligonucleotides used in PCR to produce deletion mutant covering MUC5AC5′-flanking regionPosition of the DNA fragmentOrientationOligonucleotide used for PCR-929SCGC GAG CTC GTC CAG AGG GTA CTG AGC-776SCGC GAG CTC CAT TTG CCT GGA GGC TGC-486SCGC GAG CTC CTC CCTCCC AGG CAG CCA+4ASCGC AAG CTT GAG GGA CCC AAG GTG GCA Open table in a new tab RESULTSIL-1β and TNF-α Can Induce the Gene Expression of MUC5AC through ERK and p38 MAP Kinases Signaling in NHNE Cells—To determine whether IL-1β and TNF-α can induce MUC5AC gene expression within NHNE cells, we carried out RT-PCR after treatment with IL-1β or TNF-α for 24 h. The results showed that MUC5AC mRNA was significantly increased after treatment with IL-1β or TNF-α in NHNE cells (Fig. 1A). No corresponding change was found in the expression of internal control, β2-microglobulin. As a next step, to determine which MAP kinase signal pathway is activated within NHNE cells stimulated by IL-1β and TNF-α, we performed a Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. ERK and p38 MAP kinases were maximally activated at 15 min, and this effect decreased after 45 min (Fig. 1B). However, no change was detected in the activation of JNK. A549 cells were used as a positive control for JNK activation. It thus appeared that stimulation by IL-1β and TNF-α induced the ERK and p38 MAP kinases pathways in NHNE cells. In order to investigate the possible involvement of ERK and p38 MAP kinases in IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MUC5AC gene expression, 20 μm PD98059, specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, or 20 μm SB203580, p38 inhibitor, were applied before treatment with IL-1β and TNF-α. The Western blot and in vitro kinase assays showed that PD98059 and SB203580 clearly inhibited ERK and p38 MAP kinases, respectively, in NHNE cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Under this experimental condition, we checked the expression level of MUC5AC by performing real time quantitative PCR analysis. These results showed that pretreatment with PD98059 or SB203580 for 1 h inhibited MUC5AC gene expression (Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, the inhibition of either ERK or p38 MAP kinase pathway inhibited MUC5AC mRNA in NHNE cells. Thus, the activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinases appeared to be closely related to the signaling pathways activated by IL-1β or TNF-α.Fig. 2Effect of ERK and p38 MAP kinases on MUC5AC gene expression in NHNE cells. Confluent cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm PD98059 or 20 μm SB203580 and then stimulated for 15 min with IL-1β or TNF-α prior to collection of total proteins for kinase assays. Representative kinase assays show the phosphorylation of ERK by PD98059 (PD) (A) and ATF2 as an exogenous substrate (B) with p38 MAP kinase immunoprecipitated from IL-1β- or TNF-α-treated cells and the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation by SB203580 (SB). Cells were pretreated and stimulated for 24 h with IL-1β or TNF-α prior to collection of total RNA for real time quantitative PCR of MUC5AC (C and D). C, control.

In order to confirm the significance of ERK and p38 kinases upon the cellular level of MUC5AC gene expression, cells stably expressing dominant-negative (DN) mutant under the control of the Tet-off system were generated. The p38 DN mutant was generated by replacing Thr180 and Tyr182 by Ala and Phe, respectively (43Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). This inactive form of p38 MAP kinase binds endogenous substrates, thereby inhibiting signaling by the endogenous p38 MAP kinase pathway. After removing doxycycline to induce MEK1DN, stimulation with IL-1β or TNF-α for 15 min decreased the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 3A). However, no change in ERK expression was observed. Real time quantitative PCR showed a decrease in MUC5AC mRNA after 24 h for IL-1β and TNF-α. In a similar way, we investigated the role of p38 MAP kinase on IL-1β- or TNF-α-induced MUC5AC gene expression using p38DN. An in vitro kinase assay showed that the activation of p38 MAP kinase in this mutant stable cell line was decreased following IL-1β and TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3B). Under this condition, MUC5AC mRNA was decreased 24 h after treatment with IL-1β and TNF-α. These results showed that ERK and p38 MAP kinases are essential for IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MUC5AC gene expression in NCI-H292 cells.Fig. 3MUC5AC gene expression in MEK1 or p38 dominant-negative mutant stable cell lines. Confluent, quiescent MEK1 (A) and p38 (B) dominant-negative mutant stable cells were preincubated for the indicated times to induce dominant-negative mutant protein by removed doxycycline (Dox) and then stimulated for 15 min with IL-1β or TNF-α prior to Western blotting and then for 24 h with IL-1β or TNF-α prior to real time quantitative PCR.

MSK1 is widely distributed in mammalian cells and can be activated by MAPK/ERK and SAPK2a/p38 (37Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Google Scholar, 38Arther J.S. Cohen P.

The result showed that the phosphorylation of MSK1 by IL-1β or TNF-α reached a maximum at 30 min and decreased at 60 min after IL-1β and TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). Pretreatment with 20 μm PD98059 and/or 20 μm SB203580 inhibited IL-1β- or TNF-α- induced MSK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that MSK1 is regulated by ERK and/or p38 MAP kinase(s). Furthermore, to determine whether MSK1 influences MAP kinases, cells were transfected with DNA expression constructs encoding a mutant MSK1 (NT-KD) that the N-terminal kinase domain was inactivating by a point mutation and a further mutant (CT-KD) that the C-terminal kinase domain was inactivating (39Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Google Scholar). Two MSK1 mutants did not affect IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MAP kinases activation (Fig. 4E), indicating that MSK1 appears to be controlled by MAP kinases. These results showed that MSK1 acts as a downstream signaling mediator of ERK and p38 MAP kinases.Fig. 4Effect of ERK and p38 MAP kinases on IL-1β- or TNF-α-induced activation of MSK1.

https://openalex.org/W1986817930,"Neurotoxic insults deregulate Cdk5 activity, which leads to neuronal apoptosis and may contribute to neurodegeneration. The biological activity of Cdk5 has been ascribed to its phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates. However, its roles in the nucleus remain unknown. Here we investigate the mechanism by which Cdk5 promotes neuronal apoptosis. We have identified the prosurvival transcription factor MEF2 as a direct nuclear target of Cdk5. Cdk5 phosphorylates MEF2 at a distinct serine in its transactivation domain to inhibit MEF2 activity. Neurotoxicity enhances nuclear Cdk5 activity, leading to Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of MEF2 function in neurons. MEF2 mutants resistant to Cdk5 phosphorylation restore MEF2 activity and protect primary neurons from Cdk5 and neurotoxin-induced apoptosis. Our studies reveal a nuclear pathway by which neurotoxin/Cdk5 induces neuronal apoptosis through inhibiting prosurvival nuclear machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2141671737,"Ca2+ buffer saturation was proposed as a mechanism of paired pulse facilitation (PPF). However, whether it operates under native conditions remained unclear. Here we show that saturation of the endogenous fast Ca2+ buffer calbindin-D28k (CB) plays a major role in PPF at CB-containing synapses. Paired recordings from synaptically connected interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the mouse neocortex revealed that dialysis increased the amplitude of the first response and decreased PPF. Loading the presynaptic terminals with BAPTA or CB rescued the effect of the CB washout. We extended the study to the CB-positive facilitating excitatory mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse. The effects of different extracellular Ca2+ concentrations and of EGTA indicated that PPF in CB-containing terminals depended on Ca2+ influx rather than on the initial release probability. Experiments in CB knockout mice confirmed that buffer saturation is a novel basic presynaptic mechanism for activity-dependent control of synaptic gain."

There is accumulating evidence that other members of the glucagon family of peptides are also endogenous substrates for this enzyme. To identify candidate substrates for DP-IV, a mass spectrometry-based protease assay was developed that measures cleavage efficiencies (kcat/Km) of polypeptides in a mixture, using only a few picomoles of each substrate and physiological amounts of enzyme in a single kinetic experiment. Oxyntomodulin and the growth hormone-(1–43) fragment were identified as new candidate in vivo substrates.

Immunol. 1990; 31: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interest in DP-IV as a target for type 2 diabetes has arisen due to its role in the proteolytic inactivation of the incretin GLP-1-(7–36)-amide (3Keiffer T.J. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A.

Diabetes. 1997; 105: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Removal of the amino-terminal His-Ala dipeptide by DP-IV generates GLP-1-(9–36)-amide, which is unable to elicit glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the islets (6Knudsen L.B. Pridal L. Eur. J.

One likely candidate is GIP, another incretin in the glucagon family of peptides, which is also regulated by DP-IV in vivo (3Keiffer T.J. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A.

DP-IV has also been implicated in functions beyond glucose homeostasis; specifically, DP-IV-deficient Fischer rats gain less weight than wild type animals on a high fat diet (15Yasuda N. Nagakura T. Yamazaki K. Inoue T. Tanaka I. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and DP-IV-deficient mice are also resistant to diet-induced obesity, 2Bei Zhang, personal communication. 2Bei Zhang, personal communication. suggesting that the enzyme may be involved in the regulation of additional bioactive peptides that control feeding behavior. In this regard, a number of peptides have been shown to be efficiently processed in vitro, including glucagon family peptides, neuropeptides, and chemokines. To better understand the biological role of DP-IV and to determine the potential therapeutic benefit and safety issues that may be associated with DP-IV inhibition, a thorough understanding of endogenous substrate specificity is required. Numerous strategies have been devised to determine protease substrate specificity and provide insight into their biological roles. For serine- and cysteine-type proteases, “positional scanning” combinatorial libraries of peptide substrates are often effective in identifying residue specificities proximal to the scissile amide bond and revealing consensus amino acid sequences for substrate recognition (16Rano T.A.

These data can facilitate the identification of potential substrates from protein sequence databases, although rapid assays to quantitatively measure cleavage efficiencies have been lacking to date. We have been evaluating mass spectrometry (MS) as the method of choice for developing sensitive and quantitative assays of protease activity.

Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6288) Google Scholar) can facilitate quantitative measurements of polypeptide cleavage based upon the specific changes in m/z that accompany each proteolytic event (21Gruninger-Leitch F. Berndt P. Langen H. Nelboeck P. Dobeli H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MS is of particular utility in assays of amino/carboxypeptidase or dipeptidase activity involving the cleavage of only one or two residues, where the quantitation of substrate and product peptides can be limited by the poor resolution and low sensitivity of conventional separation techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Here, we describe a general MS-based approach for screening libraries of bioactive polypeptides against a target protease, measuring specificity constants of cleavage (kcat/Km) from a single kinetic run, and evaluating the effects of genetic ablation (or inhibition) of protease activity on the in vivo metabolism of exogenously administered candidate substrates in mice. These studies have led to the identification of oxyntomodulin and growth hormone-(1–43) as novel in vitro substrates for DP-IV and provide compelling evidence that PACAP38 is regulated by this enzyme in vivo. DP-IV Assay—The panel of 15 hormones and neuropeptides (purchased from Anaspec, Synpep, Bachem, and American Peptide Company) was assayed for DP-IV processing in groups of 5–6 peptides each. A validated physiological DP-IV substrate (GLP-1-(7–36)) was included in each assay as a positive control. Peptide mixtures were compiled so as to avoid any overlap in the mass spectra of prominent charge states for all species present (including potential products of DP-IV-mediated cleavage). A charge state conflict analysis algorithm was implemented using combinatorial optimization to automate the grouping of peptides in each assay while preventing overlaps in their mass spectra with respect to a minimally acceptable mass/charge separation (typically 6 m/z). Equimolar mixtures containing 250 nm of each peptide in assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) were incubated at 37 °C with soluble recombinant human DP-IV (500 pm, corresponding to 0.96 milliunits) in a volume of 2 ml (one unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol/min of 50 μm Gly-Pro-7-amido-4-methyl-coumarin in 100 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5, 37 °C). The kinetic parameters for substrate cleavage by the recombinant enzyme (comprising residues 29–766) were indistinguishable from those of wild type DP-IV. At appropriate intervals (0–120 min after the addition of enzyme), 150-μl aliquots were withdrawn and quenched with 2 μl of 6 n HCl. A 90-μl volume of each quenched aliquot was analyzed by ESI-LC/MS, and kinetic progress curves for each processed peptide were obtained as described below. LC/MS Analysis of in Vitro Substrates—The MS instrumentation consisted of an Agilent 1100 HPLC and autosampler connected to a Thermo Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a standard electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Sample aliquots containing 20–80 pmol of each peptide analyte were injected on a 100 × 1 mm HAISIL 300 C18 column (Higgins Analytical) at a flow rate of 150 μl/min (solvent A = water, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B = acetonitrile, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, initial equilibration at 5% B, linear gradients of 3.75% B/min over 3–15 min and 2.1% B/min over 15–37 min after injection). The flow was diverted to waste for 5.2 min before the column eluate was introduced to the electrospray source. All samples were analyzed in positive ion mode with the source voltage set at 4500 V and the capillary voltage at 5 V. The heated capillary was maintained at 200 °C. Full scan data were collected as centroid spectra (400–1800 m/z). Extracted ion chromatograms (Fig. 1) were generated for each peptidyl species using prominent charge states that were empirically determined for each substrate and product species (typically [M+3H]+3 and/or [M+4H]+4, see Table I). MS acquisition, peak integration, and data analysis were performed using Xcalibur software version 1.2 (Thermo Finnigan).Table IMS parameters and kinetic data for the bioactive peptides investigated in this studyPeptideMolecular weightAmino-terminal sequenceaSite of DP-IV cleavage.Substrate m/z (charge state(s))Product m/z (charge state(s))Response factorkcat/Km, × 105bResults from this study.kcat/Km, × 105cNumber in parentheses represents reference number.DaSlopeM-1 S-1M-1 S-1GHRH-(1-44)5039.7YA ↓ DAIFTN...1260.9 [+4]1202.4 [+4]0.5229.8 ± 3.030 (26Bongers J.

Open table in a new tab Measurement of Response Factors—Quantitative measurements of substrate conversion were made by ratiometric analysis of substrate (S) and product (P) peak areas in the extracted ion chromatograms of each species. For an accurate analysis, instrument response factors were determined for every substrate-product pair. Peptide standards corresponding to the DP-IV cleavage products of each identified in vitro substrate were obtained by incubating the latter (1 μm in 528 μl of assay buffer) with excess enzyme (100 nm, 192 milliunits) at 37 °C for 3 h. The reactions were subsequently quenched with 10 μl of 0.2 n HCl. Under these conditions, even relatively inefficient substrates of DP-IV (kcat/Km < 104m–1s–1) were cleaved to >95% completion. Peptide mixtures containing 20 pmol of each substrate and 20–80 pmol of the corresponding DP-IV product in 100 μl of assay buffer were prepared using a grouping of peptides identical to that of the in vitro screen. Aliquots of these mixtures (90 μl) were analyzed by ESI-LC/MS. The m/z of predominant charge states for each substrate and product peptide (see Table I) was used to generate extracted ion chromatograms from which integrated peak areas were measured. The ratio of the product:substrate peak areas was plotted against the known ratio of product:substrate in the mixtures (see Fig. 2). The slope of the resulting linear plot was used as a response factor to correct the measured peak area of product peptide in the kinetic assays (Pcorr = (Pobs)/(slope)). Calculation of Specificity Constants—Progress curves for the cleavage of individual substrates (see Fig. 3) were generated from extracted ion chromatograms using peak areas of substrate and product, percent conversion = ((Pcorr)/(Pcorr + Sobs)) × 100. For data obtained from repeat assays, the standard error of this measurement was typically <15% of the mean. The specificity constant (kcat/Km) for cleavage of a particular substrate was directly calculated from a first order fit of the enzyme kinetics: kobs = (kcat)/(Km) · Eo, where kobs is the first order rate constant and Eo is the total enzyme concentration (22Meyer-Almes F.-J. Auer M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13261-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In Vivo Metabolism of PACAP38 —Animal procedures were approved by the Merck-Rahway Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (47National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Academy Press, Washington D. C.1996Google Scholar). The generation of DP-IV-deficient (CD26–/–) C57Bl/6 mice has been reported previously (7Marguet D. Baggio L. Kobayashi T. Bernard A.M. Pierres M. Nielsen P.F. Ribel U. Watanabe T. Drucker D.J. Wagtmann N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6874-6879Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These animals were obtained from INSERM, Paris, France. A solution of PACAP38 was prepared in saline (0.4 mg/ml) for intravenous dosing. Two groups of naive 9-week-old male C57Bl/6mice (wild type and DP-IV-deficient, respectively) were administered an intravenous bolus of PACAP38 (2 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected by cardiocentesis after CO2 euthanasia from 4–6 animals at each time point (1–5 min after dose). Blood from individual animals was placed immediately into chilled EDTA-coated tubes containing a DP-IV inhibitor (2S,3S-isoleucyl thiazolidide hemi-fumarate salt, 100 μm, obtained from Heumann Pharma) and aprotinin (0.04 mg/ml, purchased from Sigma) to prevent further degradation of PACAP38 and its metabolites. The samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Plasma was transferred to a 96-deep-well plate and stored at –70 °C until extraction and analysis. Plasma Extraction and Sample Preparation—PACAP38 and related peptides were extracted from mouse plasma using Oasis HLB 10 mg 96-well solid phase extraction plates (Waters). Plasma aliquots (100 μl) were diluted with 100 μl of water, acidified with 100 μl of 0.1 n acetic acid, and loaded on the extraction plate (preconditioned as per the manufacturer's instructions). Plasma samples of known peptide concentrations (for calibration curves) were prepared by spiking mouse plasma with 25 μl of a stock solution containing equimolar mixtures of PACAP-(1–38) and PACAP-(3–38) (synthesized by Invitrogen) in 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After loading all samples, the extraction plate was washed with 0.5 ml of 5% methanol. Peptides were eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2 × 0.25 ml), and the eluate was collected in a 96-well plate. The eluted samples were dried at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen. Recoveries of PACAP-(1–38) and PACAP-(3–38) were typically 65 and 78%, respectively. Dried samples were reconstituted in 190 μl of an aqueous solution containing 5% acetonitrile, 5% 1-propanol, and 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were transferred to 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants (180 μl) were transferred to plastic LC vials, and 45-μl aliquots were analyzed in triplicate by tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitation of Peptides by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Extracted plasma samples were injected on a Symmetry-300 C4 column (2.1 × 50 mm, Waters) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min (solvent A = water, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B = 1:1 acetonitrile:1-propanol, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, initial equilibration at 10% B, linear gradients of 2.2% B/min over 1–10 min and 10% B/min over 12–17 min after injection). The flow was diverted to waste for 4.5 min before introducing the column eluate to the ESI source. All samples were analyzed in positive ion mode (centroid spectra) with the source voltage at 4.5 kV, capillary voltage at 42 V, and capillary temperature at 200 °C. For the analysis of intact PACAP38, the parent ion at m/z 1134.6 (corresponding to [M+4H]+4) yielded three significant fragment ions at m/z 1045.5 (y35+4*), 1049.9 (y35+4), and 1221.6 (y30+3), with 30% relative collision energy (see Fig. 4). For the PACAP-(3–38) metabolite, the parent ion at m/z 1437.7 (corresponding to [M+3H]+3) yielded fragment ions at m/z 1126.4 (y28+3**) and 1431.5 ([M-H2O+3H]+3) with 30% relative collision energy. The total integrated peak area for these major fragment ions was used to quantitate the corresponding peptides, using standard curves generated from plasma samples of known peptide concentrations (see Fig. 5). The standard error for repeat measurements was <15% of the mean.Fig. 5Calibration curves (plotted as mean + S.E., n = 3) for the quantitation of intact PACAP38 (PACAP-(1–38)) and the inactive DP-IV metabolite PACAP-(3–38) in mouse plasma. Plasma samples were spiked with increasing amounts of each peptide (0–6600 ng/ml) and extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The extracted peptides were quantified by LC/MS-MS using the total integrated area of major fragment ions obtained in the MS-MS spectrum of each species (Fig. 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A Multiplexed MS-based Kinetic Assay for Proteases—Endogenous levels of circulating bioactive peptides are generally 3–6 orders of magnitude lower than the micromolar Km values for substrates of typical proteases. At such low concentrations, the rate of proteolysis is determined by the specificity constant (kcat/Km), which represents the apparent second order rate constant for substrate cleavage. Measurement of this kinetic parameter allows substrates to be ranked in order of processing efficiency, with kcat/Km > 105m–1 s–1 being characteristic of efficient cleavage by a particular protease. The in vitro substrate specificity of DP-IV for glucagon family peptides was determined using a mass spectrometry assay that provided a direct measurement of the specificity constant for each substrate. This approach was used to rapidly identify candidate DP-IV substrates for subsequent in vivo analysis. Although MS-based assays of DP-IV activity have been reported previously (23Pauly R.P. Rosche F.

For the glucagon family peptides described in this work, mixtures of 5–6 peptides were assayed simultaneously, allowing automated LC/MS analysis of all 16 peptides to be completed in 36 h. The increased throughput of this method as compared with standard HPLC-based assays is further illustrated by our subsequent screen of a library of ∼150 neuropeptides, hormones, and chemokines, and measurement of kcat/Km for all identified in vitro DP-IV substrates, which was completed in less than a week. 3S. Jagpal, N. A. Thornberry, and R. Sinha Roy, manuscript in preparation. Measurement of Specificity Constants by MS—Since mass spectrometry measures analyze concentrations indirectly, appropriate precautions were taken to ensure that the measured ion signals reflected accurate estimates of substrate turnover. These steps included the measurement of instrument response factors for each substrate-product pair (Fig. 2 and Table I) and operation within the linear dynamic range of the assay (0–10,000 ng/ml). The high sensitivity of ESI-LC/MS allowed kinetic data to be collected at relatively low (nanomolar) concentrations of substrate as compared with the Michaelis constant (Km), which is typically in the high micromolar range for peptides that are cleaved by DP-IV in vitro (14Mentlein R.

Each potential substrate could therefore effectively compete for the enzyme active site without a bias toward high affinity substrates. Under these conditions of low substrate concentrations ([S]< 0.1 Km), the specificity constant for cleavage could be directly calculated from a single progress curve for each substrate (Fig. 3) using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (22Meyer-Almes F.-J. Auer M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13261-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Repeat analyses confirmed that kinetic measurements were unaffected by the composition of peptides in the assay mixture. Identical results were also obtained when substrates were incubated individually with the peptidase.

https://openalex.org/W2049464937,"In the present study, we observed evidence of cross-talk between the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) using a heterologous system. When the two receptors are co-expressed, we observed a major CB1-dependent enhancement of the orexin A potency to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; dose-responses curves indicated a 100-fold increase in the potency of orexin-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. This effect required a functional CB1 receptor as evidenced by the blockade of the orexin response by the specific CB1 antagonist, N-(piperidino-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716), but also by pertussis toxin, suggesting that this potentiation is Gi-mediated. In contrast to OX1R, the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with OX1R. In addition, electron microscopy experiments revealed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level; they are close enough to form hetero-oligomers. Altogether, for the first time our data provide evidence that CB1 is able to potentiate an orexigenic receptor.

In addition, genetically CB1 receptor-impaired mice eat less than wild-type mice in response to food deprivation (26Di Marzo V. Goparaju S.K. Wang L. Liu J. Bastai S. Jarai Z. Fezza F. Miura G.I. Palmiter R.D. Sugiura T. Kunos G. Nature. 2001; 410: 822-825Google Scholar). These data provide strong evidence for the involvement of central CB1 receptors as a physiological regulator of eating and suggest that the use of SR141716 could represent a new approach for the treatment of obesity and appetite disorders in human. However, the mechanisms by which SR141716 reduces weight gain remain to be clarified. Within the brain, CB1 receptor expression is low in the hypothalamus, but higher levels are found in the lateral hypothalamic area (27Tsou K. Brown S. Sañudo-Peña M.C. Mackie K. Walker J.M. Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 393-411Google Scholar). CB1 coupling to G proteins was shown to be remarkably more efficient in the hypothalamus than in other CB1 receptor-rich areas (28Breivogel C.S. Sim L.J. Childers S.R. J. Pharamacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1632-1642Google Scholar). Such particularities may be of interest considering that the hypothalamus plays a key role in the regulation of food intake, body mass, and energy balance (29Bernardis L.L. Bellinger L.L. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1993; 17: 141-193Google Scholar, 30Bernardis L.L. Bellinger L.L. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1996; 20: 189-287Google Scholar). Specifically, the lateral hypothalamic area is involved in the initiation of food intake, whereas the basomedial hypothalamic nuclei are associated with the cessation of consumption (31Beuckmann C.T. Yanagisawa M. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 329-342Google Scholar). Numerous hypothalamic hormones involved in feeding behaviors have been discovered in the past 10 years; they include appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexins A/B, and melanin-concentrating hormone, or galanin and anorexigenic peptides, such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (32Chiesi M. Huppertz C. Hofbauer K.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 247-254Google Scholar). Those peptides act through GPCRs and participate in neural circuits that operate to control feeding behavior. Further supporting the notion that CB1 may be considered as an orexigenic receptor and belongs to the same neural circuitry regulated by orexigenic mediators, it has been shown that hypothalamic endocannabinoids levels are negatively regulated by leptin and that they maintain food intake through the tonic activation of CB1 receptors in that area (26Di Marzo V. Goparaju S.K. Wang L. Liu J. Bastai S. Jarai Z. Fezza F. Miura G.I. Palmiter R.D. Sugiura T. Kunos G. Nature. 2001; 410: 822-825Google Scholar). With this in mind, we hypothesized that SR141716 may mediate its effect on weight gain either by directly blocking the endogenous tone of anandamide and/or through specific cross-talks between CB1 and other receptors. This study is aimed at documenting the latter hypothesis, which has been supported by numerous observations. First, interactions of the CB1 system with different GPCR systems have been recently suggested. For example, Meschler and Howlett (33Meschler J.P. Howlett A.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 918-926Google Scholar) reported signal transduction interactions between CB1 and dopamine receptors in the rat and monkey striatum. An interaction between the cannabinoid and serotonin systems has also been suggested by the modulation of the cannabinoid agonist binding by serotonin in the rat cerebellum (34Devlin M.G. Christopoulos A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1095-1102Google Scholar). Considering food intake control, it was shown that tetrahydrocannabinol-induced hyperphagia was reversed by low doses of naloxone and that the combination of SR141716 and naloxone inhibited food intake elicited by orphanin FQ (35Pietras T.A. Rowland N.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 442: 237-239Google Scholar). Second, SR141716 has recently been shown to interfere by its inverse agonist properties within receptor cross-talk and inhibit the MAPK response mediated by insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors in CHOCB1 cells, whereas the activation of MAPK by fibroblast growth factor b was not altered (19Bouaboula M. Perrachon S. Milligan L. Canat X. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Portier M. Barth F. Calandra B. Pecceu F. Lupker J. Maffrand J.-P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22330-22339Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed potential cross-talk of CB1 with orexigenic receptors. Specifically, we tested whether functional interactions between CB1 and the orexin system occur, and we analyzed the pertinence of this hypothesis using SR141716. Orexins (orexin A and orexin B) are orexigenic mediators selectively expressed in the hypothalamus, within the lateral hypothalamic area neurons (36Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R.S. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.-S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1998; 92: 573-585Google Scholar). Orexin A is implicated in food intake in satiated rats but also in the regulation of drinking behavior (37de Lecea L. Kilduff T.S. Peyron C. Gao X.-B. Foye P.E. Danielson P.E. Fukuhara C. Battenberg E.L.F. Gautvik V.T. Bartlett F.S. Frankel W.N. van den Pol A.N. Bloom F.E. Gautvik K.M. Sutcliff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 322-327Google Scholar), whereas the role of orexin B is not as clear. These neuropeptides bind and activate two closely related GPCRs: orexin 1 receptor, specific for orexin A, and orexin 2 receptor, which is a high affinity receptor for both orexins (36Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R.S. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.-S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1998; 92: 573-585Google Scholar). Taking into account the role of endogenous cannabinoids and orexin A in obesity and given the recently described expression pattern of OX1R, which indicates that CB1 and OX1R receptors are expressed in similar brain regions, specifically in the lateral hypothalamic area (38Hervieu G.J. Cluderay J.E. Harrison D.C. Roberts J.C. Leslie R.A. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 777-797Google Scholar), we explored the possibility of intracellular interactions between CB1 and OX1R. To this aim, we produced a heterologous system where these two receptors are co-expressed. Our results demonstrate a dramatic increase in the orexin response, which is prevented by SR141716. When tested in similar conditions, CB1 and NPYR5 do not interact. These data open up new insights and lead to the hypothesis that anti-obesity effects observed with SR141716 could be related at least in part to the blockade of CB1/OX1R cross-talk. Materials—[γ-33P]ATP (2500 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. PTX was obtained from Sigma. N-(Piperidino-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716A) was synthesized at the Chemistry Department of Sanofi-Synthélabo (Montpellier, France). CP-55,940 was from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Human orexin A was from Bachem AG (Budendorf, Switzerland). Mouse anti-c-Myc antibodies (9E10 clone) were produced by our core facilities as ascites fluids. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p44 (C-16, anti-ERK1) and anti-p42 (C-14, anti-ERK2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-CB1 (N-terminal) antibody was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPKs (Thr202/Tyr204) E10 monoclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free) was from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from various commercial suppliers. Stable Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—CHO cells stably expressing Myc-OX1R were from Sanofi-Synthélabo (Labège, France). Stable CHO cells expressing CB1 were described previously (39Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Duigou A. Oustric D. Barth F. Bouaboula M. Carayon P. Casellas P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047Google Scholar). For stable co-expression of Myc-OX1R and CB1 receptor, a CHO dihydrofolate reductase negative cell line was co-transfected with plasmid p2169-Myc-OX1R and pcDNA3-CB1 receptor using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Selection was imposed 12 days in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) without desoxyribonucleosides or ribonucleosides supplemented with 5% of dialyzed fetal calf serum (FCS) and 300 μg/ml of G418. Individual cell lines were cloned by limiting dilution, and OX1R and CB1 receptor expression was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. CHO cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. CHO-CB1, CHO-Myc-OX1R, and CHO-CB1/Myc-OX1R cell lines were routinely grown in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS, 40 μg/ml l-proline, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 60 μg/ml tylosin, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells stably expressing either CB1 or OX1R or both were grown on glass coverslips pretreated with a 0.1 mg/ml solution of poly-d-lysine. Washed cells were incubated with either 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-c-Myc) or with anti-CB1 rabbit polyclonal antibody or both for1hat4 °C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 1:200 dilution of Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and/or Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 1% in PBS and then directly observed. Fluorescence analyses were performed using a confocal microscope (LSM410, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Detection of the Phosphorylated MAPK—The cells were grown to 80% confluency in 24-well plates then cultured in medium without FCS for 20 h before the assay. After treatment, the cells were washed in cold PBS and directly lysed in 100 μl of 2× Laemmli's loading buffer containing 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue. 20 μl of sample were run on 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nonspecific antibody binding was prevented by incubation in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk. The membranes were incubated with mouse anti-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal antibodies (1:2000) and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:10,000). An enhanced chemiluminescence system was used for Western blot development (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Standardization was achieved using ERK1 and ERK2 measured in the same blots with anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies (1:5000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000). MAPK Assay—MAPK activity was measured as described previously (7Bouaboula M. Poinot-Chazel C. Bourrié B. Canat X. Calandra B. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 637-641Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown to 80% confluency in 24-well plates then cultured in medium without FCS for 20 h before assay. After treatments, the cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C under shacking in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Triton X-100) containing 20 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. 17 μl of solubilized cell extracts were analyzed for MAPK activity. The phosphorylation of MAPK-specific peptide substrate was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min with [γ-33P]ATP by using the Biotrack p42/p44 MAPK enzyme system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Inositol Phosphate Assay—The cells were grown for 24 h in 96-well plates, and then the growth medium was replaced by medium supplemented with [3H]myo-inositol (5 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 20 h, the growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with medium without FCS supplemented with 20 μm LiCl for 15 min before treatment with various concentrations of orexin A for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were added to 200 μl of Dowex, washed with 60 mm sodium formate, 5 mm sodium tetraborate, and the inositol phosphates eluted using 0.2 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formamic acid. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—The cells were washed and fixed for 30 min with 1% formaldehyde in PBS and then washed again. Rabbit anti-CB1 antibody and mouse anti-c-Myc antibody were added for 1 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cell surface-associated antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 6-nm gold beads and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 10-nm gold beads. After two washes, the cells were fixed for 1 h with 4% formaldehyde in PBS buffer and then postfixed for 1 h with 1% OsO4. Finally, the cells were dehydrated with ethanol, propylene, and epoxypropylene. Ultrafine sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate. The micrographs were recorded with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope. To investigate CB1 and OX1R functional interactions, we generated CHO cells stably expressing the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CHO-CB1), the orexin 1 receptor (CHO-OX1R), or both (CHO-CB1/OX1R). The OX1R was tagged at the N terminus with the c-Myc epitope to monitor its expression using mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies, whereas specific rabbit polyclonal anti-CB1 antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain of the human receptor were used to detect CB1. The expression of CB1 and OX1R receptors was examined using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, when expressed alone, CB1 was found at the cell surface as a punctate immunostaining. In CHO-OX1R cells, c-Myc-tagged OX1R was also expressed at the plasma membrane, but the staining appeared more homogeneous (Fig. 1B). In the double expression cell line, CB1 and OX1R were mostly co-localized at the cell surface (Fig. 1C). The specificity of this labeling was verified using CHO-wt cells (data not shown). To characterize the impact of CB1 and OX1R co-expression on both receptor signaling, we examined the effect of either CP55,940, a synthetic cannabinoid agonist, or orexin A. Early signaling events of the two receptors are different in that CB1 and OX1R are coupled to Go/Gi and to Gq/11 heteromeric G proteins, respectively. However, both receptor signaling events converge at the MAPK cascade. To measure the activation of both receptors simultaneously, we chose to assess the MAPK activation using in vitro kinase assays. The time course of MAPK activation induced by CP55,940 in CHO-CB1 or CHO-CB1/OX1R was transient with a maximal activation between 5 and 10 min and returned to a basal level by 30–60 min (Fig. 2A). Comparable kinetics were observed with 50 nm orexin A in both CHO-OX1R and CHO-CB1/OX1R cells (Fig. 2B), except that orexin A-induced MAPK activation remained elevated in CHO-CB1/OX1R compared with CHO-OX1R cells at 60 min (46.0 ± 2.8% versus 23.7 ± 1.7% at 60 min). As a control, CP55,940 did not induce MAPK activation in CHO-OX1R cells, and conversely orexin A did not stimulate CB1 receptors in CHO-CB1 cells (Fig. 2). We further evaluated the potency of these agonists in dose-response curves. In cells expressing CB1 alone or in combination with OX1R, the EC50 values of CP-55,940-mediated MAPK activation were comparable (3 nm) (Fig. 3A). These data were confirmed in Western blot experiments using an anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Fig. 3B). In CHO-OX1R cells, orexin A induced MAPK activation with a EC50 of9nm (Fig. 3C), a result that is consistent with the previously published ones (36Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R.S. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.-S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1998; 92: 573-585Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, co-expression of CB1 and OX1R resulted in a dramatic increase of the potency of orexin-mediated MAPK activation by 100-fold (from EC50 = 9nm to EC50 = 0.1 nm). The hypersensitization of orexin-induced MAPK phosphorylation was confirmed in Western blot experiments (Fig. 3D). A similar shift of EC50 value was reproducibly observed in the three other independent CHO-CB1/OX1R clones tested (data not shown). When tested at their maximal activating doses, the combination of orexin A with CP-55,940 did not show additivity, indicating that the MAPK responses we measured represented a common responding element within the cell where the two receptor signaling converge (data not shown). Altogether these data indicated that when CB1 and OX1R receptors were co-expressed, a major enhancement in orexin A potency to activate MAPK pathway was observed, whereas the efficacy of CP-55,940 to induce the MAPK signaling remained unaffected. To examine whether the synergistic response observed between CB1 and OX1R could be extended to other GPCRs, we selected NPY5R, which is known to play a key role in the regulation of appetite (40Cabrele C. Langer M. Bader R. Wieland H.A. Doods H.N. Zerbe O. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36043-36048Google Scholar) and studied the effect of CB1 and NPY5R co-expression using CHO cells overexpressing NPY5R alone or in combination with CB1. A treatment with increasing concentrations of NPY resulted in a similar dose-dependent response in MAPK activity in both CHO-NPY5R or CHO-CB1/NPY5R cells (EC50 5 nm) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, CP55,940-induced MAPK activation was not different in CHO-CB1/NPY5R when compared with CHO-CB1 (data not shown). Moreover, a treatment with PTX abolished both CP55,940 and NPY responses regardless of the cell line tested (Fig. 4B), consistent with the Gi/Go coupling of CB1 and NPY5R receptors. Thus co-expression of NPY5R with CB1 in CHO cells did not result in a synergistic MAPK response. Inhibition of Orexin A-mediated MAPK Activation by SR141716 —To assess the contribution of each receptor in the hypersensitization of OX1R responses, we examined the effect of the specific CB1 antagonist, SR141716, on CB1-mediated orexin A sensitization. As expected, a treatment of CHO-CB1 or CHO-CB1/OX1R cells with SR141716 completely abrogated the MAPK signal induced by CP55,940 (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas SR141716 did not affect orexin A-mediated MAPK activation in CHO-OX1R (Fig. 5C). By contrast, the molecule completely prevented the shift of EC50 that we previously observed in CHO-CB1/OX1R (Fig. 5D). With SR141716 restoring the initial orexin response, these data suggested that an active CB1 receptor form was required to enhance the MAPK signal induced by orexin. Effect of PTX—Contrasting with OX1R, CB1 is PTX-sensitive. Therefore we assessed the effect of a PTX treatment (50 ng/ml) on the orexin A-induced responses in the different cell lines included in our study. As observed with SR141716, a PTX pretreatment completely abrogated the EC50 shift of orexin-mediated MAPK response in CHO-CB1/OX1R cells (Fig. 6C) and restored the orexin A response identical to that observed for OX1R alone. As a control, a similar PTX pretreatment fully inhibited the CP55,940-mediated response in CHO-CB1 cells and in CHO-CB1/OX1R cells (Fig. 6, A and B) but was inactive in CHO-OX1R cells (Fig. 6D). These data strengthened the implication of an active CB1 receptor in the enhancement of MAPK activation induced by orexin A in CHO-CB1/OX1R cells. To further analyze the effect of CB1 and OX1R co-expression on the OX1R effector systems, we compared the production of inositol phosphate stimulated by orexin A in CHO-OX1R and in CHO-CB1/OX1R cells (Fig. 7). The dose-dependent potency of orexin A to stimulate inositol phosphate production (EC50 = 5 nmversus 3,5 nm) was similar in both cell lines. By contrast, CP55,940 (100 nm) did not stimulate inositol phosphate production in these cell lines (data not shown). The above findings suggested a close interaction of CB1 and OX1R. Therefore, we examined whether these two receptors are closely associated and searched for receptor complexes; we favored microscopic techniques because they do not require cell disruption and avoid biochemical artifacts. As shown by double-label immunofluorescence (Fig. 1), CB1 and OX1R receptors were co-localized at the cell surface of CHO-CB1/OX1R cells. However, the resolution provided by light microscopy limits the conclusions that can be drawn at the molecular level. Thus cell surface expression of CB1 and OX1R receptors was more precisely assessed by electronic microscopy techniques (Fig. 8) using anti c-Myc and anti-CB1 antibodies revealed with 6- and 10-nm immunogold anti-IgG for the detection of OX1R and CB1 receptors, respectively. Bead sizes were in the similar range to guarantee homogenous labeling property of the antibodies and limit physical hampering but are different enough to easily distinguish both receptors. In addition the immuno-electronic microscopy study was performed using prefixed cells to ensure that the receptor distribution was not altered by antibody incubation. The fixation does"
https://openalex.org/W2110798143,"Crystal structures of bacterial CLC proteins were solved recently, but it is unclear to which level of detail they can be extrapolated to mammalian chloride channels. Exploiting the difference in inhibition by 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9-AC) between ClC-0, -1, and -2, we identified a serine between helices O and P as crucial for 9-AC binding. Mutagenesis based on the crystal structure identified further residues affecting inhibitor binding. They surround a partially hydrophobic pocket close to the chloride binding site that is accessible from the cytoplasm, consistent with the observed intracellular block by 9-AC. Mutations in presumably Cl−-coordinating residues yield additional insights into the structure and function of ClC-1. Our work shows that the structure of bacterial CLCs can be extrapolated with fidelity to mammalian Cl− channels."
https://openalex.org/W2149233763,Current views about the organization of human memory make strikingly different predictions about the integrity of remote autobiographical memory following damage to the medial temporal lobe. We have carried out a detailed analysis of narrative content in memory-impaired patients for whom neuropsychological and neuroanatomical information is available. All eight patients were able to recall detailed memories from their early lives. The recollections of the patients and the recollections of 25 matched controls contained the same number of details (+/-5%) and were also similar by several other measures. The results support the view that autobiographical memories eventually become independent of the medial temporal lobe as time passes after learning. A number of other considerations suggest that the neocortex ultimately supports the capacity for recollecting remote autobiographical memory.
https://openalex.org/W2073478172,"Endostatin, a 20-kDa collagen XVIII fragment, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo, but the mechanisms are still unclear. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), a family of extracellular and membrane-associated endopeptidases, collectively digest almost all extracellular matrix and basement membrane components, and thus play an important role in tumor progression. We studied the effects of recombinant human endostatin on human MMP-2, -9, -8, and -13. We found that endostatin inhibited the activation and catalytic activity of pro-MMP-9 and -13 as well as recombinant pro-MMP-2. It prevented the fragmentation of pro-MMP-2 that was associated with reduction of catalytic activity. Endostatin had no effect on MMP-8 as shown by collagenase activity assays. An in vitro migration assay and an in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane intravasation assay with the human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-3 revealed the biphasic nature of endostatin; low endostatin concentrations inhibited intravasation and migration of these cells in a dose-dependent manner, but at increased concentrations, the inhibitory effect was far less efficient. The results show that endostatin blocks the activation and activities of certain tumor-associated pro-MMPs, such as pro-MMP-2, -9, and -13, which may explain, at least in part, the antitumor effect of endostatin. Our results also suggest that endostatin inhibits tumor progression by directly affecting the tumor cells and not just acting via endothelial cells and blockage of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001614757,"Synchronous firing of motor cortex cells exhibiting postspike facilitation (PSF) or suppression (PSS) of hand muscle EMG was examined to investigate the relationship between synchrony and output connectivity. Recordings were made in macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task. Synchronization was assessed with cross-correlation histograms of the activity from 144 pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, while spike-triggered averages of EMG defined the muscle field for each cell. Cell pairs with similar muscle fields showed greater synchronization than pairs with nonoverlapping fields. Furthermore, cells with opposing effects in the same muscles exhibited negative synchronization. We conclude that synchrony in motor cortex engages networks of neurons directly controlling the same muscle set, while inhibitory connections exist between neuronal populations with opposing output effects."

These findings suggest a central role for parkin in maintaining dopaminergic neuronal integrity and strengthen the link between AR-JP and the more common sporadic form of Parkinson's disease."

The invasion by Pharaoh Shoshenq I (Shishak) is a key historical synchronism, approximately 925 B.C.E., mentioned in both Egyptian inscriptions and the Hebrew Bible. The list of places raided by Shoshenq, mentioned at Karnak (Egypt), includes Rehov (Israel). The site yielded a consistent series of radiocarbon dates from the 12th to 9th century B.C.E. Our results (i) suggest a revised Iron-Age chronology; (ii) date an archaeological stratum to Shoshenq's campaign; (iii) indicate the similarity of ""Solomonic"" and ""Omride"" pottery; and (iv) provide correlation with Greece and Cyprus."
https://openalex.org/W2099619660,"C60 fullerides are challenging systems because both the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions are large on the energy scale of the expected narrow band width. We report angle-resolved photoemission data on the band dispersion for an alkali-doped C60 monolayer and a detailed comparison with theory. Compared to the maximum bare theoretical band width of 170 meV, the observed 100-meV dispersion is within the range of renormalization by electron-phonon coupling. This dispersion is only a fraction of the integrated peak width, revealing the importance of many-body effects. Additionally, measurements on the Fermi surface indicate the robustness of the Luttinger theorem even for materials with strong interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2117878127,Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is considered to be a major source of the stratospheric sulfate aerosol during periods of volcanic quiescence. We measured COS at the tropical tropopause and find mixing ratios to be 20 to 50% larger than are assumed in models. The enhanced COS levels are correlated with high concentrations of biomass-burning pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The analysis of backward trajectories and global maps of fire statistics suggest that biomass-burning emissions transported upward by deep convection are the source of the enhanced COS in the upper tropical troposphere.
https://openalex.org/W2024487267,"Transformation of normal cells into malignant tumor cells, a process termed carcinogenesis, depends on progressive acquisition of genetic alterations. These result in activation of protooncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes responsible for the loss of proliferative control in tumor cells and the failure to undergo cellular differentiation. The aim of our study was the identification of molecular regulators of carcinogenesis by studying gene expression during induction of cellular differentiation and quiescence in a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model. Here, we report the discovery of a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 8p21.3-22 near marker D8S254. It is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissue and transiently up-regulated during initiation of cellular differentiation and quiescence in 3D cell culture. In contrast, mRNA expression was not detectable in tissue from pancreatic tumor and the pancreatic tumor cell line MIA PaCa-2. Recombinant expression in the tumor cell line MIA PaCa-2 inhibited proliferation, as shown by a 30% reduction of BrdU uptake after recombinant expression. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions demonstrated a mitochondrial localization for the mature protein. In conclusion, we identified a tumor suppressor gene at chromosome 8p21.3-22, encoding a mitochondrial protein, controlling cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2090343947,"Epidemiological observations indicate that resveratrol, a natural antioxidant stilbene, exerts cardioprotective and chemopreventive effects. Moreover, the molecule induces in vitro cell growth inhibition and differentiation. Using human erythroleukemic K562 cells as model system, we demonstrated that resveratrol induces a remarkable γ-globin synthesis, the erythroid differentiation being linked to impairment of cell proliferation, increased p21Cip1 expression and inhibition of cdk2 activity. The up-regulation of p21Cip1 transcription is prevented by cycloheximide, indicating the requirement of intermediate protein(s), which, in turn, regulate gene expression. The quantitative analysis of some transcription factors involved in the erythroid lineage, namely GATA-1, GATA-2, and Egr1, indicated that resveratrol selectively up-regulates Egr1 by an Erk1/2-dependent mechanism. The presence of an Egr1 consensus sequence in the p21Cip1 promoter suggested the hypothesis that this transcription factor directly regulates the expression of the cdk inhibitor. Transfection studies with deleted gene promoter constructs, as well as EMSA, pull-down, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments substantiated this view, demonstrating that Egr1 binds in vitro and in vivo to the identified consensus sequence of the p21Cip1 promoter. Moreover, an Egr1 phosphorothioate antisense hinders p21Cip1 accumulation and the antiproliferative effects of resveratrol. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration that Egr1 controls p21Cip1 expression by directly interacting with a specific sequence on its gene promoter.

(3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural stilbene endowed with antioxidant properties, synthesized in plants to counteract environmental oxidative stress such as UV irradiation or exposure to ozone (1Hain R.

The molecule, distributed at a significant level in the skin of grapes and in a few other spermatophytes, is functionally classified as an antifungine phytoalexin, which confers resistance to pathogen attack (1Hain R. Bieseler B. Kindl H. Schroder G. Stocker R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 15: 325-335Google Scholar). In the last decade, resveratrol has received wide attention since a number of epidemiological observations suggest that it might reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer (4Sieman E.H. Creasy L.L. Am. J. Enol. Vitic. 1992; 43: 49-52Google Scholar, 5Goldberg D.M. Karamanchin A. Yan J. et al.Am. J. Enol. Vitic. 1995; 46: 159-165Google Scholar). Indeed, the phytoalexin has been reported to prevent atherosclerosis (6Fauconneau B. Waffo-Teguo P. Huguet F. Barrier L. Decendit A. Merillon J.M.

Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Google Scholar) described the ability of resveratrol to inhibit events associated with the initiation, promotion, and progression of cancer. The molecule is able to: (i) induce phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, (ii) cause cell growth arrest, and (iii) inhibit the development of preneoplastic lesions in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands in culture and tumori-genesis in a mouse skin cancer model. The antimutagenic activity of resveratrol against the carcinogen 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-β]indole was also demonstrated by Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium (13Uenobe F. Nakamura S. Miyazawa M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 373: 197-200Google Scholar). Resveratrol exerts in vitro a strong antiproliferative activity on various cell types. When added to cell cultures, the compound reduces the growth rate and DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion (14Elattar T.M. Virji A.S.

It suppresses the proliferation of normal human hepatocytes (16Allen S.W. Mueller L. Williams S.N. Quattrochi L.C. Raucy J. Drug Metab.

Finally, we have recently demonstrated that resveratrol blocks the growth of HL-60 cells at S/G2 phase and induces cell differentiation toward the mielo-monocytic phenotype (27Della Ragione F. Cucciolla V. Borriello A. Della Pietra V. Racioppi L. Soldati G. Manna C. Galletti P. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 53-58Google Scholar). Such an observation suggests that the molecule might cause, in a specific context, hematological differentiation. The molecular mechanisms of the in vivo and the in vitro antitumoral properties of resveratrol have been extensively investigated. The molecule is able to inhibit the hydroperoxidase activity of type 1 cyclooxygenase (12Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V. Thomas C.F. Beecher C.W. Fong H.H. Farnsworth N.R. Kinghorn A.D. Mehta R.G. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 218-220Google Scholar) as well as the expression of type 2 of the same enzyme (28Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Michaluart P. Telang N. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Jang M. Pezzuto J.M. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21875-21882Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports demonstrated that the plant stilbene inhibits ornithine decarboxylase (29Schneider Y. Vincent F. Duranton B. Badolo L. Gosse F. Bergmann C. Seiler N. Raul F. Cancer Lett. 2000; 158: 85-91Google Scholar), DNA polymerase (30Sun N.J. Woo S.H. Cassady J.M. Snapka R.M. J. Nat. Prod. 1998; 61: 362-366Google Scholar), CYP1A, CYP2E1, and CYP3A (31Piver B. Berthou F. Dreano Y. Lucas D. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 125: 83-91Google Scholar) and ribonucleotide reductase (32Fontecave M. Lepoivre M. Elleingand E. Gerez C. Guitter O. FEBS Letters. 1998; 421: 277-279Google Scholar). In this case, resveratrol acts as a radical scavenger by interacting with and destroying the tyrosyl radical of the R2 subunit, which is necessary for the activity of this enzyme (32Fontecave M. Lepoivre M. Elleingand E. Gerez C. Guitter O. FEBS Letters. 1998; 421: 277-279Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that resveratrol, like several other naturally occurring stilbenes, mimics, in some instances, estradiol effects (33Gehm B.D. McAndrews J.M. Chien P.Y. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14138-14143Google Scholar). However, despite the large number of reports, the molecular basis of phytoalexin antiproliferative effects has not been definitively clarified. Several investigations have shown an increased expression of ϵ- and γ-globin genes in human erythroleukemic K562 cells treated with a variety of molecules impairing cell proliferation (34Lozzio B.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 54: 321-334Google Scholar). Therefore, this cell line has been widely used as an excellent in vitro model to evaluate the effects of new antiproliferative drugs (35Erard F. Dean A. Schechter A.N. Blood. 1981; 58: 1236-1239Google Scholar). As resveratrol might cause cell differentiation, we decided to examine its activity on K562 cells. The induced γ-globin expression caused us to investigate the molecular basis of resveratrol effects and to elucidate the possible transduction pathway(s) responsible for erythroid differentiation of K562. This approach provides new insights into the biochemical events leading to cell growth inhibition by resveratrol as well as into novel control mechanisms of the cell division cycle.

K562 Cell Line Treatment and Differentiation and Flow Cytometry Analyses—The K562, HL-60, and LAN-5 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Resveratrol was directly added to cell cultures at the indicated concentrations, while untreated cells contained the solvent alone (dimethyl sulfoxide). In the experiments employing kinase inhibitors, the molecules were added 1 h before the addition of resveratrol. For the analysis of gene expression, the cells were treated, when indicated, with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at 36 μm concentration. K562 cell differentiation was evaluated by determining the expression of γ-globin and GpIIb genes (see below) in cells collected 3 days after the addition of 30 μm resveratrol.

Before amplification with each specific primer pair, an aliquot of the cDNA preparation was amplified using GAPDH primers to determine the integrity of the generated cDNA. Moreover, we used five different cDNA concentrations to assure that signals (both of GAPDH and of the gene under analysis) were proportional to input mRNA. Finally, each experiment was performed at least in triplicate and, in several cases, in quadruplicate.

Particularly, one plasmid contains the full-length (2320 bases, pWWP) p21Cip1 promoter, while the other two plasmids contain either –124 bases (pWP124) or –60 bases (pWP60) of the promoter relative to the transcription start site. Mutagenesis of the Egr1 site in the p21Cip1 promoter region of the pWP124 plasmid (mpWP124) was performed with the QuickChange TM polymerase chain reaction-based method (Stratagene), using the following two primers 5′-AGGCGGGCCCGGGCTTTTCGGTTGTATATCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGATATACAACCGAAAAGCCCGGGCCCCGGT -3′ (from –70 to –38 base position of the promoter), which replaced four guanosine with four thymines (underlined).

The reported gene constructs were transiently transfected in K562 cells (60 ng/1.0 × 106 cells) by using the FuGENE 6 reagent. Five hours following transfection, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium. Each preparation was separated into 12 aliquots. 6 aliquots were treated with 30 μm resveratrol for 24 h, and 6 aliquots represent the relative controls. Luciferase activity was then determined on the cell lysate by using a luciferase kit from Promega. The activity was expressed as luciferase relative units per milligram of protein. The vacant vector pGL2-Basic was purchased from Promega and used for control reporter plasmid. Biotin-Streptavidin Pull-down Assay—Four oligonucleotides, containing biotin on the nucleotide at 5′-position, were used in the pull-down assays. The sequences of these oligonucleotides were as follows: wild-type sense oligo, biotin-5′-AGGCGGGCCCGGGCGGGGCGGTTG-3′ and wild-type antisense oligo, biotin-5′-CAACCGCCCCGCCCGGGCCCGCCT-3′. These sequences correspond to positions –70 to –53 of the human p21Cip1 promoter. Two scramble oligos were synthesized, which contain the same base composition of those reported above, but different sequences. The sequences were: biotin-5′-GGAGCGGTGGCGGTGGCGCGGCCG-3′ (sense) and biotin-5′-CGGCCGCGCCACCGCCACCGCTCC–3′ (antisense). These oligonucleotides were annealed, and 24-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides were gel purified and used. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described in the next paragraph. One microgram of each double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with 300 μg of nuclear proteins for 20 min at room temperature in a binding buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor.

Prior to this step, 300 μl of the original streptavidinagarose bead preparation were preadsorbed with 500 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 50 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 25 °C. The beads were washed three times and resuspended in 300 μl of the binding buffer. The protein-DNA-streptavidin-agarose complex was washed three times with binding buffer and loaded onto a SDS gel. Detection of Sp1 and Egr1 proteins was performed as described under immunoblotting. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and EMSAs—Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Briefly, the cells were suspended in three packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitors (0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and allowed to swell for 10 min on ice. The cells were homogenized, transferred to new tubes, and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The released nuclei were suspended in half the packed cell volume of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture of protease inhibitors), followed by the dropwise addition of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.6 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture of protease inhibitors). The nuclear suspensions were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation, and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants (nuclear extracts) were stored at –80 °C in aliquots. EMSA was performed as described below. Prior to the addition of biotin-labeled double-strand DNA probe (the same employed in the pull-down experiments), 4 μg of K562 nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min on ice in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. Biotin-labeled probe was added (0.5 ng), and the incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with the indicated molar excess of unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides for 20 min on ice. In super-shift experiments, the extracts were preincubated with antibodies (anti-Egr1 or anti-Sp1) for 60 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and observed by the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit following the manufacturer's procedure. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—K562 cells (1.2 × 107 cells) were treated with 30 μm resveratrol for 6 h, collected by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in 1% formaldehyde solution in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 fresh medium. After 15 min of incubation (with occasional inversion), the cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Then, cells were washed with ice-cold TBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), placed on ice and lysed with 1 ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid), containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and phosphatase inhibitors Na3VO4 (0.2 mm), NaF (50 mm), NaPyr (50 mm), and incubated on ice for 1 h. Further disruption of the cells was obtained by passing them through a 21-gauge syringe needle. Cell lysates were then sonicated to yield chromatin fragments of ∼500 bp, as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Insoluble materials were removed by two centrifugations, the first for 5 min and the second for 15 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g and the supernatants transferred to new tubes. 2-mg extracts were precleared by incubating them with 30 μl of packed protein A-agarose beads (pretreated with sheared DNA salmon sperm). After centrifugation for 2 min at 7500 × g, supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Immunoprecipitation was performed by rocking overnight at 4 °C the precleared extracts with the chosen antiserum, and then, by precipitating the immunocomplexes with protein A-agarose also pretreated with sheared DNA salmon sperm. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with 1 ml of RIPA buffer, once with 1 ml lysis buffer and once with 1 ml LiCl/detergent solution (0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Then, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml TBS and centrifuged at 7500g for 2 min. Elution of immunoprecipitates was performed in two steps: the beads were mixed with 100 μl of 1% SDS/TE and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, centrifuged briefly and the eluates transferred to fresh tubes. The beads were then washed with 150 μl of 0.67% SDS/TE, briefly centrifuged and the washes were added to eluates. To reverse the formaldehyde cross-links, the samples were then incubated overnight at 65 °C in the presence of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.05 m. After this step, the samples were treated with 50 μg of proteinase K and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, allowed to air dry, and dissolved in 20 μl of sterile H2O. 5-μl DNA samples were then subjected to amplification by employing primers (5′-GCTGGCCTGCTGGAACTC-3′, sense; 5′-GGCTCCACAAGGAACTGACT-3′, antisense), which amplified the promoter region of p21Cip1 (from –190 to +25 respective to the transcription start). Antisense Experiments—Two phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized. One (5′-TCGGCCTTGGCCGCGGCCAT-3′) was directed against the region (from 0 to 19) of Egr1 mRNA, whereas the other (5′-GCTCGTCCGAGTCGTCCTGC-3′) was the control scramble oligonucleotide. 20 μl of FuGENE 6 were mixed with 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 and then added dropwise to 20 μg of the antisense oligos. The sample was then added to 10 ml of K562 cells (400,000 cells/ml). A control experiment contains only FuGENE 6. After 12 h, 30 μm resveratrol was added, and cell growth continued: (i) for another 8 h after which cells were pelleted and analyzed for Egr1 and p21Cip1 expression or (ii) for another 24 h to evaluate cell growth. Resveratrol Induces Growth Arrest and Differentiation of K562 Cells—When K562 cells were cultured in the presence of different amounts of resveratrol, a remarkable inhibition of the proliferation rate was observed (Fig. 1A). As low as a 30 μm concentration resulted in complete growth impairment, while at higher concentrations (100 μm) the molecule appeared slightly toxic, causing a small decrease in cell number. From these experiments, the estimated resveratrol I50 value was about 10 μm. Incubation of cells with stilbene did not cause a definite commitment toward a non-proliferative state. Indeed, when the cells were incubated for 24 or 48 h with 30 μm resveratrol and, thereafter, the drug was removed, a normal rate of proliferation was restored (data not shown). These results indicated that, under the conditions employed, the growth inhibition was powerful but rapidly reversible, and that the molecule interferes, although not irreversibly, with molecular process(es) required for cell proliferation. In order to rule out the possibility that the cytostatic activity of resveratrol was caused by apoptosis, the resveratrol-treated K562 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results indicated that only at 100 μm concentration a very low percentage of apoptotic cells was detectable (less than 10%) (data not shown). The flow cytometry analysis also indicated a remarkable decrease of G2/M peak and the accumulation of cells in G1/S phases (data not reported). The absence of the apoptotic process was also demonstrated by estimating the cleavage rate of PARP. The lack of PARP cleavage (namely the absence of the 85-kDa fragment in immunoblotting analysis) represents a further proof of"
https://openalex.org/W2019905662,"CD47 is a surface receptor that induces either coactivation or apoptosis in lymphocytes, depending on the ligand(s) bound. Interestingly, the apoptotic pathway is independent of caspase activation and cytochrome c release and is accompanied by early mitochondrial dysfunction with suppression of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Using CD47 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein 19 kDa interacting protein-3 (BNIP3), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a novel partner. Interaction between CD47 and the BH3-only protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation analysis, and CD47-induced apoptosis was inhibited by attenuating BNIP3 expression with antisense oligonucleotides. Finally, we showed that the C-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), but not signal-regulatory protein (SIRPα1), is the ligand for CD47 involved in inducing cell death. Immunofluorescence analysis of CD47 and BNIP3 revealed a partial colocalization of both molecules under basal conditions. After T cell stimulation via CD47, BNIP3 translocates to the mitochondria to induce apoptosis. These results show that the BH3-dependent apoptotic pathways, previously shown to be activated by intracellular pro-apoptotic events, can also be turned on by surface receptors. This new pathway results in a fast induction of cell death resembling necrosis, which is likely to play an important role in lymphocyte regulation at inflammatory sites and/or in the vicinity of thrombosis."

The latter was recently shown to be an evolutionarily conserved, predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase whose presence is required for the final cleavage at site D that converts 20 S pre-rRNA into mature 18 S rRNA. A data base search identified homologs of Rio2p in a wide variety of eukaryotes and Archaea. Detailed sequence comparison and in vitro kinase assays using recombinant protein demonstrated that Rio2p defines a subfamily of protein kinases related to, but both structurally and functionally distinct from, the one defined by Rio1p. Failure to deplete Rio2p in cells containing a GAL-rio2 gene and direct analysis of Rio2p levels by Western blotting indicated the protein to be low abundant. Using a GAL-rio2 gene carrying a point mutation that reduces the kinase activity, we found that depletion of this mutant protein blocked production of 18 S rRNA due to inhibition of the cleavage of cytoplasmic 20 S pre-rRNA at site D. Production of the large subunit rRNAs was not affected. Thus, Rio2p is the second protein kinase that is essential for cleavage at site D and the first in which the processing defect can be linked to its enzymatic activity.

Contrary to Rio1p/Rrp10p, however, Rio2p appears to be localized predominantly in the nucleus. Like their counterparts in other eukaryotes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomes contain four species of rRNA: 5 S, 5.8 S, 18 S, and 25 S rRNAs. The genes encoding these rRNAs are organized on the yeast genome in 150–200 tandem repeats, each of which comprises two transcriptional units separated by non-transcribed spacers. One of these units consists of a 5 S rRNA gene, transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The other unit contains single genes for each of the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs that are separated by internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2, whereas external transcribed spacer regions are present at either end of the unit (see Fig. 1A). After transcription of this polycistronic unit by RNA polymerase I, the spacers are removed from the primary transcript via an ordered series of endo- and exonucleolytic cleavages (see Fig. 1B) (reviewed in Refs. 1Raué H.A. Olson M. The Nucleolus. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar and 2Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 216-311Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The first detectable precursor species is 35 S pre-rRNA, which results from a cleavage at site B0 in the 3′-external transcribed spacer by the yeast RNase III homolog Rnt1p (3Abou-Elela S. Igel H. Ares Jr., M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4Kufel J. Dichtl B. Tollervey D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage at sites A0 and A1 in the 5′-external transcribed spacer first gives rise to 33 S and then 32 S pre-rRNA. The latter is cleaved at site A2 to produce separate 20 S and 27 S A2 precursors for the small and large ribosomal subunit, respectively. The majority (90%) of the 27 S A2 precursor molecules are cleaved endonucleolytically at site A3, followed by exonucleolytic trimming to B1S. The remainder are processed endonucleolytically 1A. W. Faber, J. C. Vos, and H. A. Raué, unpublished data. at site B1L. The resulting 27 S BS and 27 S BL precursors, whose 5′-ends are located 6 nucleotides apart, are then converted into 25 S rRNA and the “short” and “long” forms of 5.8 S rRNA, respectively, in the same manner (5Allmang C.

All of the above processing steps, as well as the concomitant assembly of most of the ribosomal proteins, take place in the nucleolus/nucleoplasm. However, the final step in 40 S subunit biogenesis in yeast occurs after export of the pre-40 S ribosomal subunit to the cytoplasm, where its 20 S pre-rRNA is processed at site D to produce the mature 18 S rRNA (10Moy T.I. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2118-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Vanrobays E. Gleizes P.-E. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Gélugne J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4204-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Pre-rRNA processing in other eukaryotic cells follows a similar pathway, except that maturation of 18 S rRNA is completed in the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm. Although the pre-rRNA processing pathway itself is now well understood, many questions pertaining to its control and its integration with the assembly of the ribosomal proteins remain to be answered. Presently, >100 non-ribosomal proteins or trans-acting factors have been identified that are essential for ribosome biogenesis in S. cerevisiae (1Raué H.A. Olson M. The Nucleolus.

Recent advances in the purification and characterization of large (ribonucleo)-protein complexes have pushed the number of potential trans-acting factors even higher. Moreover, it has become clear that these factors form two largely independent, dynamic processing/assembly machineries for the small and large subunits, respectively (12Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 14Dragon F. Gallagher J.E.G. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.A. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E.

Very little is known as yet about the exact function of any of the parts of these machineries or the manner in which they cooperate. Virtually all of the trans-acting factors presently known to be involved in biogenesis of the yeast 40 S subunit are required for the formation of 20 S pre-rRNA by the early processing cleavages at sites A0, A1, and A2. These factors assemble cotranscriptionally on the pre-rRNA in the nucleolus, together with some of the ribosomal proteins, to form the 80–90 S small subunit pre-ribosome and, at least for the most part, appear to dissociate prior to export of the pre-40 S particle to the cytoplasm (1Raué H.A.

However, a number of trans-acting factors remain associated or join the pre-40 S particle in the nucleoplasm and accompany it upon export to the cytoplasm (18Schäfer T. Strauss D. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). One of these factors is Rrp10p, which is essential for the conversion of 20 S pre-rRNA into mature 18 S rRNA and was identified in a synthetic lethality screen with a mutant of Gar1p (11Vanrobays E. Gleizes P.-E. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Gélugne J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4204-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), one of the core proteins of box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins. Interestingly, Rrp10p, also known as Rio1p (19Angermayr M. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31630-31635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was subsequently shown to be a member of a novel subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases with family members in eukaryotes, Archaea, and prokaryotes (20Krupa A.

Homologs of Rio1p in other organisms have been implicated in cell cycle progression, and it has been reported that depletion of Rio1p in yeast causes arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (21Angermayr M. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The connection between these two functions of Rio1p/Rrp10p and its enzymatic activity remains unclear. In yeast, the open reading frame Ynl207w encodes a protein called Rio2p that has 19% identity and 49% similarity to Rio1p/Rrp10p. The function of Rio2p in yeast cells is unknown, but obviously differs from that of Rio1p/Rrp10p as both proteins are essential. A systematic analysis of several hundreds of yeast protein complexes isolated by tandem-affinity purification (23Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) demonstrated the association of Rio2p on the one hand with a number of proteins required late in 40 S subunits biogenesis such as Trs1p, Rrp12p, and Dim1p and on the other hand with several proteins implicated in cell growth and maintenance (24Gavin A.-C.

After growing the dissected spores on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) plates, haploid transformants containing the inactivated rio2 gene were identified by PCR. The selected haploid strain containing the rio2::kan gene was called YTV101. The pWTR2 plasmid present in the cells was replaced by the pGalR2(HIS3) plasmid or its mutant counterparts by plasmid shuffling. Construction of Plasmid-encoded Wild-type and Mutant RIO2 Genes and RIO2 Fusion Genes—A plasmid-encoded copy of the RIO2 gene under the control of its own promoter was constructed by amplifying the gene including 300 bp of its upstream sequence with the R2B1fw and R2E1rv primers (Table III). The resulting product was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pRS316(URA3) (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pWTR2. The RIO2 gene was fused to the GAL1-10 promoter by first amplifying it using the R2E1fw and R2S1rv primers (Table III). The resulting product was inserted into pTL26(HIS3) (27Lafontaine D. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3469-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites to give the pGalR2 plasmid.Table IIISequences of oligonucleotides used in this work either as probes in Northern hybridization or as primers during construction of the various RIO2 genesProbesSequence1GAAATCTCTCACCGTTTGGAATACG2TGTTACCTCTGGGCCC3GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTAAPrimersR2E1fwAAAAAGAATTCTCAGACTAGAATGAAATTGGATACR2E1rvAAAAAGAATTCGAACAACTTGATTATTTGCGGCR2B1fwAAAAAGGATCCGGCTCACGTTGGTGAATGGCTR2S1rvAAAAAGTCGACAACAACTTGATTATTTGCGGCAva1fwCGAAGTCGTTCCAACTCCCTTGBstefwGGAGCTTATCGAGGGTTACCCBstervCTCCTCATTGGGTAACCCHincrvTCAGTTTCTTTTTGAAGAAACGACGVVICGCGTCATATAGTCGTTAAGGAGCTTATCGAGGGTTACCC (M189K)VVKCGCGTCATATAGTCGTTATTGAGCTTATCGAGGGTTACCC (M189I)GRESCGGTAACACTATTGGTGTTGGTATTGAATCTGACATCTATAAAGTAAG (K105R)GIESCGGTAACACTATTGGTGTTGGTAGGGAATCTGACATCTATAAAGTAAG (K105I)GLIFCDGCAAATAGCGGACTTATCTTTTGTGATTTTAATGAGTTTAATATT (H227F)GLIYCDGCAAATAGCGGACTTATCTATTGTGATTTTAATGAGTTTAATATT (H227Y)GLIHCAGCAAATAGCGGACTTATCCATTGTGCTTTTAATGAGTTTAATATT (D229A) Open table in a new tab Point mutations (see Fig. 2) were introduced into the RIO2 coding region by site-directed mutagenesis via the megabase primer method (28Sambrook J.

The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in Table III. A GST 3The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, myelin basic protein; PAA, polyacrylamide; TAP, tandem affinity purification. -RIO2 fusion was constructed by amplification of the RIO2 gene using the R2N1fw and R2E1rv primers (Table III). The former primer introduces an NcoI site at the ATG start codon of the RIO2 coding region. The PCR product was inserted between the NcoI and EcoRI sites of plasmid pRP261, a derivative of pGEX1 (29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) that fuses the RIO2 and GST coding regions in-frame. This plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli Sure strain (Stratagene), and expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to an exponentially growing culture. After an additional 2 h at 30 °C, cells were collected and broken by sonication in lysis buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove the cell debris. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (400 μl; Amersham Biosciences) were added to the resulting supernatant. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. GST-Rio2p(D229A) was purified in the same manner from cells expressing a derivative plasmid in which the wild-type RIO2 coding region had been replaced by the mutant version. Biochemical Fractionation—20 OD660 units of yeast cells harvested during mid-logarithmic growth were resuspended in buffer A (1 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 30 mm DTT and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells where then pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min at 3000 rpm, resuspended in buffer A containing 3 mm DTT and 0.45 mg/ml zymolyase (Seikagaku), and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The cells were pelleted, washed with ice-cold buffer A, and resuspended in buffer B (15 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm DTT) using a homogenizer with a loose-fitting pestle. The cell suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min and then broken with five strokes of a tight-fitting pestle. The resulting homogenate was separated into a cytoplasmic and a nuclear fraction by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. RNA and Protein Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by resuspending 20 OD660 units of cells in 600 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (w/v) SDS) and 600 μl of water-saturated phenol. After adding 100 μl of glass beads (diameter, 0.5–0.8 mm), the samples were heated at 65 °C for 1 h under continuous stirring. The aqueous phase was re-extracted with phenol and again with 600 μl of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v). RNA was precipitated by adding 40 μl of 3 m NaAc (pH 5.2) and 800 μl of EtOH and redissolved in RNase-free distilled water to a concentration of 0.4 A260/μl. Northern analysis was performed as described previously using the various probes indicated in Fig. 1A (30Venema J. Vos H. Faber A.W. van Venrooij W.J. Raué H.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1660-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein extracts for Western blotting were prepared by lysing the cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT with glass beads (diameter, 0.5–0.8 mm) by vortexing for 5 min. The extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% minigels (Bio-Rad). After blotting onto nylon membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schüll) and incubation with horse radish peroxidase-labeled antibodies against the protein A epitope, bound antibody was visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate coloring reaction. In Vitro Kinase Assays—The auto- and heterophosphorylating activities of recombinant GST-Rio2p were determined by incubating 5 μl of Sepharose-glutathione-bound GST-Rio2p beads in 20 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) either with or without 5 mm MnCl2. To determine the ability of Rio2p to heterophosphorylate a substrate, 4 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAA gel, followed by autoradiography. The amount of GST-Rio2p present in the reaction mixture was assayed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue Rio2p Is a Member of a Distinct Subfamily of Putative Protein Kinases—The S. cerevisiae open reading frame Ynl207w encodes a protein, designated Rio2p (19Angermayr M. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31630-31635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), that shows significant structural similarity to Rio1p/Rrp10p. The latter was found to be essential for endonucleolytic cleavage at site D, the final step in the formation of mature 18 S rRNA (11Vanrobays E. Gleizes P.-E. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Gélugne J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4204-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was characterized as a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase conserved from bacteria to man with a role in cell cycle progression (20Krupa A. Srinivasan N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Angermayr M. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the results of an alignment of Rio1p/Rrp10p and Rio2p, demonstrating that the sequence similarities between the two proteins are predominantly confined to three regions indicated as I, II, and III. 4A detailed alignment is available upon request. Regions I and III contain the putative ATP-binding and kinase domains, respectively (22Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Rio2p also is a protein kinase, but may belong to a subfamily distinct from the one defined by Rio1p/Rrp10p. Using the Rio2p sequence as our starting point, we searched the NCBI Protein Database for homologs of Rio2p in other organisms and identified a number of such homologs in both eukaryotes and Archaea. Alignment of these homologs revealed a pattern of sequence conservation that is distinct from the one between Rio2p and Rio1p (Fig. 2). First, the N-terminal regions of the various Rio2 proteins show marked similarity, but differ considerably from the corresponding region in Rio1p, which is not significantly conserved in the latter subfamily (20Krupa A. Srinivasan N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Second, within the regions that are conserved between Rio1p and Rio2p, conservation within each of the two subfamilies is higher than between the two subfamilies (Fig. 2). From these data, we conclude that Rio2p defines a putative protein kinase subfamily that is related to, but distinct from, the one founded by Rio1p/Rrp10p. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3) adds further support to this conclusion. This analysis clearly shows an early division between Rio1p- and Rio2p-like proteins. Furthermore, a small number of (archae)bacterial Rio-like proteins seem to from a third subfamily. Interestingly, our data base search did not identify any eubacterial members of the Rio2p subfamily. Thus, whereas eukaryotes and Archaea have at least one gene member in both the RIO1 and RIO2 subfamily, the latter seems to be absent from the eubacterial kingdom. This suggests that the two types of subfamily originated from duplication of an ancestral gene that occurred before the split between Archaea and eukaryotes. Because Rio1p and Rio2p are both essential in yeast, the two genes gained different functions. Low Level Expression of Rio2p Is Sufficient to Support Normal Growth—To study the role of Rio2p in yeast in more detail, we constructed a mutant strain that conditionally expresses the protein. As the starting point, we used the diploid strain Y22005 obtained from EUROSCARF. This strain contains a rio2 gene that has been disrupted by insertion of the kanamycin gene on one of its chromosomes. Diploid Y22005 cells were transformed with the centromeric pWTR2(URA3) plasmid carrying a wild-type RIO2 gene under the control of its authentic promoter. Transformants were selected on plates lacking uracil; and after sporulation, tetrads were dissected and spotted on YPD plates. Transformation of Y22005 with an empty vector showed the expected 2:2 segregation of viable and nonviable spores. PCR analysis demonstrated that none of the viable spores contained the disrupted rio2 gene, confirming that RIO2 is an essential gene as previously reported (31Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). In contrast, sporulation of Y22005 cells carrying the pWTR2 plasmid in most cases resulted in four viable spores. The resulting haploid transformants were tested for G414 resistance to ascertain the presence of the disrupted chromosomal rio2 gene as well as for their ability to grow on plates lacking uracil to ensure retention of the plasmid. As a final check, selected cells were analyzed by PCR to ascertain that no recombination had taken place between the plasmid and the genome. This resulted in strain YTV101(pWTR2) (rio2-null), which was found to grow normally. To determine the effect of depletion of Rio2p, we replaced the pWTR2 plasmid with plasmid pGalR2(HIS3), which contains the wild-type RIO2 gene under the control of the repressible GAL1-10 promoter, by plasmid shuffling and determined the effect of a shift from galactose to glucose on growth of the YTV101(pGalR2) transformants. To our surprise, we found no significant change in growth rate after the shift compared with the wild-type control, for which we took cells grown from viable haploid spores of the Y22005 strain that had been transformed with an empty vector. Even after culturing the pGalR2-transformed YTV101 cells for several days on glucose-ba"

https://openalex.org/W2102685783,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the heme oxygenase (HO) pathway could modulate proliferation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) and the mechanism(s) involved in this phenomenon. In cultured human ASM cells, 10% fetal calf serum or 50 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor AB induced cell proliferation, extracellular and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological HO-1 induction (by 10 μm hemin or by 20 μm cobalt-protoporphyrin) and HO inhibition (by 25 μm tin-protoporphyrin or by an antisense oligonucleotide), respectively, reduced and enhanced significantly both cell proliferation and ROS production. Neither the carbon monoxide scavenger myoglobin (5–20 μm) nor the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one could reverse ASM proliferation induced by tin-protoporphyrin, making a role of the CO-cGMP pathway in HO-modulated proliferation unlikely. By contrast, bilirubin (1 μm) and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (1 mm) significantly reduced mitogen-induced cell proliferation, ROS production, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, both bilirubin and N-acetyl-cysteine and the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 significantly reversed the effects of HO inhibition on ASM proliferation. These results could be relevant to ASM alterations observed in asthma because activation of the HO pathway prevented the increase in bronchial smooth muscle area induced by repeated ovalbumin challenge in immunized guinea pigs, whereas inhibition of HO had the opposite effect. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for an antiproliferative effect of the HO pathway in ASM in vitro and in vivo through a bilirubin-mediated redox modulation of phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

Massarella G.R. Anderson J.A. Thorax. 1969; 24: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Moreover, bronchial smooth muscle cells from asthmatic patients have shown abnormal cellular proliferation in vitro (2Johnson P.R.A. Roth M. Tamm M. Hughes J.M. Ge Q. Burgess J.K. King G. Black J.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Therefore, knowing the factors and the mechanisms that modulate ASM proliferation can have important pathophysiological implications. In the last years, various types of mitogens have been shown to induce human ASM proliferation, including growth factors, contractile agonists, and inflammatory mediators, such as ROS (3Ammit A.J. Panettieri R.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Indeed, evidence is growing that in physiological conditions, ROS induce signal transduction leading to gene transcription and cell growth (4Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because ASM can be continuously exposed to large amounts of exogenous or endogenous ROS produced by inhaled agents, inflammatory or ASM cells themselves (5Henricks P.A.J. Nijkamp F.P. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 14: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), redox signaling might be of particular importance in ASM proliferation. A mitogen-induced ROS production leading to cell proliferation via activation of ERK1/2 has been described in ASM (6Brar S.S. Kennedy T.P. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). But, if the oxidant signaling involved in ASM proliferation is well characterized, little is known about involvement of antioxidant systems in the control of muscle proliferation. Heme oxygenase, the enzyme responsible for heme degradation, is a powerful cytoprotective antioxidant system (9Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 10Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Heme degradation produces CO and biliverdin, reduced into bilirubin by the biliverdin reductase. In the airways, HO is expressed in the epithelium, the smooth muscle, macrophages, parasympathic ganglia, and endothelium (11Donnelly L.E. Barnes P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Lim S. Groneberg D. Fischer A. Oates T. Caramori G. Mattos W. Adcock I. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L596-L603Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bilirubin is one of the most powerful antioxidant system in the organism (15Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1997; 235: 1043-1046Crossref Scopus (2938) Google Scholar), mainly known for its cytoprotective effect in oxidative stress models (16Doré S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that bilirubin could also modulate ROS production in guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle in physiological conditions (14Samb A. Taillé C. Almolki A. Mégret J. Staddon J.M. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L596-L603Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this model, bilirubin also modulated oxidant signaled phosphorylation of myosin light chain. This suggests that HO, by the way of its antioxidant properties, could also play a role in the modulation of redox signaling in ASM. Furthermore, HO has shown an antiproliferative effect in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo (17Peyton K.J. Reyna S.V. Chapman G.B. Ensenat D. Liu X.M. Wang H. Schafer A.I. Durante W.

However, no data are available in the current literature investigating the effects of HO on ASM proliferation and the mechanism(s) involved in this phenomenon. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the HO pathway could modulate proliferation of human bronchial smooth muscle cells exposed to two mitogens, PDGF or FCS (6Brar S.S.

We also investigated which of the HO end products, CO and bilirubin, was responsible for the effect of HO. Finally, we evaluated the functional role of the HO pathway on ASM in vivo in a model of airway remodeling secondary to multiple ovalbumin challenge in immunized guinea pigs.

Briefly, human bronchi (internal diameters, 5–15 mm) were obtained from lobes resected during thoracotomy for lung cancer in 11 different patients and dissected from the surrounding parenchyma. The epithelium was removed, and bands of airway smooth muscle were isolated by dissection under binocular microscope and cut into 1-mm2 pieces. These muscular pieces, termed explants, were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, antibiotics (10 mg/ml streptomycin, 10,000 UI/ml penicillin G), and amphotericin B (25 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C as described (19Johnson P.R.

On reaching confluence, the cells were passed by lifting the cells with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA. The cultures from passages 3–5 were used for the experiments. At confluence, cells the exhibited the typical “hill and valley” aspect (20Berger P. Perng D.W. Thabrew H. Compton S.J. Cairns J.A. McEuen A.R. Marthan R. Tunon de Lara J.M. Walls A.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cell characterization was assessed by immunostaining using a monoclonal antibody against α-smooth muscle actin and against the specific smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoform 1 (19Johnson P.R. Armour C.L. Carey D. Black J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L514-L519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wong J.Z. Woodcock-Mitchell J. Mitchell J. Rippetoe P. White S. Absher M. Baldor L. Evans J. McHugh K.M. Low R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L786-L792PubMed Google Scholar). More than 95% of cells from each patient used in the different experiments displayed positive immunohistochemical staining for both antibodies. The general experimental protocol was as follows. The cells were seeded at an initial density of 104/cm2, grown to 70–80% confluence, and serum-deprived (1% FCS) for 24 h. Then they were stimulated with one of two different mitogens, 10% FCS and 50 ng/ml PDGF-AB. Control unstimulated cells were grown on 1% FCS. In some experiments, the cells were incubated with different pharmacological agents and their respective vehicles for the indicated time before the addition of the mitogen. The experiments were carried out in at least three different cell lines, each one derived from a different individual. HO-1 protein expression was measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. For Western blot experiments, the cells were cultured in 75-cm2 plates. Western blot was performed as described previously (21Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 22Wong J.Z. Woodcock-Mitchell J. Mitchell J. Rippetoe P. White S. Absher M. Baldor L. Evans J. McHugh K.M. Low R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L786-L792PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the anti-HO-1 antibody was 1/1000. Detection was performed by a chemiluminescence substrate. Using the same blots, the expression of the housekeeping protein β-actin was evaluated using a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody. Optical densities were measured with a Perfect Image 2.01 image analysis system (Iconix, Courtaboeuf, France). The results were expressed as the ratio of the expression of HO-1 to that of β-actin. For immunohistochemistry, the cells were cultured in a Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described before (24Thabut G. El-Benna J. Samb A. Corda S. Megret J. Lesèche G. Vicaut E. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22814-22821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with a 1/1000 dilution of the anti-HO-1 antibody. The specificity of the immunostaining was evaluated by replacement of the primary antibody by a control isotype antibody at an equivalent protein concentration and by omitting the primary antibody. HO activity was assessed by bilirubin production as already described (23Taillé C. Foresti R. Lanone S. Zedda C. Green C. Aubier M. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in cells grown on 75-cm2 plates. In addition, HO activity was evaluated in situ by immunohistochemistry using the anti-bilirubin IX monoclonal antibody, 24G7 (25Nakayama M. Takahashi K. Komaru T. Fukuchi M. Shioiri H. Sato K. Kitamuro T. Shirato K. Yamaguchi T. Suematsu M. Shibahara S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1373-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This monoclonal antibody specifically recognizes the conjugated and unconjugated forms of bilirubin IX but not other isomers of bilirubin (26Ozawa N. Goda N. Makino N. Yamaguchi T. Yoshimura Y. Suematsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Bilirubin IX is produced by the reduction of biliverdin IX, a product of the HO-1 reaction. Thus, immunohistochemistry with the use of 24G7 allowed us to assess the HO-1-specific heme degradation in situ in fixed cells. The antibody was used at 10 μg/ml concentration. The specificity of the immunostaining was evaluated by replacement of the primary antibody by a control isotype antibody at an equivalent protein concentration and by omitting the primary antibody. The cells were cultured in 24-well plates and stimulated with mitogens for 24 h. For the final 18 h of incubation with the mitogen, 4 μCi/ml of [methyl-3H]thymidine was added to measure DNA synthesis by scintillation counting. The results of individual treatments were obtained in quadruplicate and were expressed as the number of counts/min. Then the percentage of change from the response of 1% FCS for each individual result was calculated. To minimize the influence of variability between tissue donor, the value was calculated from the response of 1% FCS-treated cells from the same 24-well plate. In experiments with the MEK inhibitor PD98056, the control condition was FCS + Me2SO, explaining the lower proliferative response. However, we checked in preliminary experiments that Me2SO does not change the way of proliferative response to mitogens but just decrease by about one-third the absolute value of thymidine incorporation. Cellular toxicity and viability were assessed by three different methods: cell count and trypan blue exclusion, lactate dehydrogenase release in the medium, and incorporation of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide. For propidium iodide incorporation, the cells seeded in 96-well plates were incubated with 5 μm propidium iodide for 30 min and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline before reading at 480–520 nm with a multiwell fluorescence plate reader (Fluorostar BMG). The results are expressed in fluorescent arbitrary units. Intracellular ROS Production: H 2 DCFH-DA Oxidation—The cells were cultured in 96-well plates as described previously. H2DCFH-DA (final concentration in Me2SO, 10 μm) was added 1 h before stimulation. Immediately after the addition of the mitogen, fluorescence was measured every 5 min during a 45-min period with a multiwell fluorescence plate reader at 480–555 nm. Intracellular ROS (especially H2O2 or hydroxyl radical) oxidized dichlorodihydrofluorescein, yielding the fluorescent product dichlorodifluorescein (24Thabut G. El-Benna J. Samb A. Corda S. Megret J. Lesèche G. Vicaut E. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22814-22821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the ratio between fluorescence measured at 45 min and that measured at the first point (27Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). Extracellular Superoxide Anion Release: Cytochrome c Reduction— Ferricytochrome c reduction was measured as previously described (24Thabut G. El-Benna J. Samb A. Corda S. Megret J. Lesèche G. Vicaut E. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22814-22821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in 6-well plates. Before the addition of the mitogen, the medium was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red and incubated in 1 ml of the same buffer with and without 300 units/ml superoxide dismutase. Subsequently, ferricytochrome c was added at a final concentration of 80 μm to the reaction buffer solution, followed by the addition of the mitogens. After 1 h, the buffer was removed, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured immediately. Superoxide anion production was calculated from the differences in the absorbances between samples with and without superoxide dismutase, using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 mm-1 cm-1 for reduced ferricytochrome c. The cells were cultured in 75-cm2 plates. In a first series of experiments, the cells were stimulated for different times with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AB or serum. Then the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and removed in lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (2.5 mm natrium fluoride, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1 mm para-nitrophenol-phosphate). In a second series of experiments, the cells were pretreated with different pharmacological agents before a 10-min stimulation with PDGF or serum. Western blot was performed as already described (14Samb A. Taillé C. Almolki A. Mégret J. Staddon J.M. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Am. J.

The phosphorylated forms of the enzyme were detected with a polyclonal antibody used at 1/1000 dilution. Optical density of the band was measured as described (see below) and compared with β-actin expression. Detection of HO-1 protein in airway smooth muscle was examined in human bronchi. Segments of two bronchi utilized for ASM cells isolation and culture were fixed in formol 10% and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously published (23Taillé C. Foresti R. Lanone S. Zedda C. Green C. Aubier M. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Thabut G. El-Benna J.

The sense/antisense ODNs for HO-1 were directed against the flanking translation initiation codon in the human HO-1 cDNA (28Wagener F.A. Da Silva J.L. Farley T. De Witte T. Kappas A. Abraham N.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 416-423PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense sequence was 5′-CGCCTTCATGGTGCC-3′, whereas the sense sequence was 5′-GGCACCATGAAGGCG-3′. ODNs were phosphorothioated on the first three bases on the 3′ end. The cells were transfected using the Superfect® transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well 24 h before transfection. The proportions used were 1 μg of DNA/5 μl of transfection reagent/well. The cells were incubated for 3 h with the ODNs; then the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% serum. The experiments for proliferation and Western blot were performed 48 h after transfection. Pathogen-free male Hartley guinea pigs (250–300 g of body wt; Charles River) were housed in individual cages in climate-controlled animal quarters and were given water and food ad libitum. As previously described (29Samb A. Pretolani M. Dinh-Xuan A.T. Ouksel H. Callebert J. Lisdero C. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the animals were immunized with 0.5 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (saline) containing 100 mg of ovalbumin, injected subcutaneously on the neck, and with another 0.5 ml intraperitoneally on day 1. On days 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 15, the animals (called OO animals) were challenged in a 5-liter plastic chamber by a 10-min exposure to aerosolized ovalbumin (0.1% ovalbumin in 10 ml of saline) using a Devilbiss nebulizer (Sunrise, Devilbiss Medical, Nantes, France). The time of exposure was determined by the appearance of respiratory distress signs (polypnea, bronchospasm, contraction of accessory respiratory muscles, and cyanose). Another group of animals were immunized to ovalbumin as described above and exposed to aerosolized saline (ON animals). This model is characterized by bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine (measured by pulmonary inflation pressure) and an increased number of polynuclear eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage in OO animals (29Samb A. Pretolani M. Dinh-Xuan A.T. Ouksel H. Callebert J. Lisdero C. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both OO and ON animals were randomly divided into two groups. One group received the inhibitor of HO activity SnPP IX, given intraperitoneally 6 h before the challenge at a dose of 50 μmol/kg on days 8, 10, 13, and 15 (OO-SnPP animals); a second group received the HO-1 inductor, hemin, given intraperitoneally at a dose of 50 mg/kg on days 7, 10, and 13 (OO-Hemin animals). In preliminary experiments we verified that SnPP IX and hemin's vehicle did not modify the parameters measured in the study. We also verified that hemin and SnPP IX significantly increased and decreased HO activity, respectively, by measurement of bilirubin production in lung microsomes, as previously described (23Taillé C. Foresti R. Lanone S. Zedda C. Green C. Aubier M. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last challenge. They were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Nesdonal®, Specia-Rhone-Poulenc, Romainville, France) (50 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneal), and then the lung was inflated through a tracheal canula at 25 cm H2O with 10% formol and fixed in paraffin. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissues sections were examined microscopically, and the smooth muscle area was measured with a microscope (Leitz, Germany) related to a camera (Olympus) and a computerized image analysis system (AnalySIS Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany) as described by Palmans et al. (30Palmans E. Kips J.C. Pauwels R.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The muscular area was determined by delimitating the outer side of the basal membrane and the outer side of the muscular area. We analyzed bronchi with similar diameter and with a ratio of minimal to maximal diameter of more than 0.6. We analyzed five animals in each group and three or four different bronchi for each animal. HO-1 and bilirubin immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (23Taillé C. Foresti R. Lanone S. Zedda C. Green C. Aubier M. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The concentration of the anti-bilirubin antibody was 1 μg/ml. The values are given as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance; the differences between the means were analyzed with the Fisher's protected least significant difference multiple comparison test. The significance for all statistics was accepted at p < 0.05. HO-1 Is Expressed in Human ASM—HO-1 was expressed in unstimulated ASM cells in culture (Fig. 1A). Incubation with the mitogens FCS (10%) or PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 24 h significantly and quite similarly increased HO-1 expression and HO activity (p < 0.05 as compared with 1% FCS; Fig. 1, A and B). CoPP (20 μm) could further potentiate HO activity induced by the mitogens. As attempted, SnPP IX (25 μm) significantly inhibited HO activity (Fig. 1B). HO-1 expression and activity in human ASM cells in culture was further confirmed with immunohistochemical analysis using anti-HO-1 and anti-bilirubin antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1C). No expression was observed with a control isotype antibody. HO-1 was also expressed in ASM in human bronchi (Fig. 1D). The HO Pathway and Bilirubin Modulate Human ASM Cell Proliferation—Mean thymidine incorporation in unstimulated cells was 5448 ± 1228 cpm. ASM cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by 10% FCS and PDGF, being 360 and 372% higher, respectively, than observed with 1% FCS (Fig. 2, A and B, p < 0.05, respectively). HO induction by CoPP significantly decreased the proliferative response to FCS and PDGF. Indeed, in CoPP-treated cells, proliferation induced by 10% FCS and PDGF was only 135 and 155% higher, respectively, than observed with 1% FCS (Fig. 2, A and B, p < 0.05, respectively). Hemin (10 μm), another HO inductor, has a similar effect on ASM proliferation (data not shown). On the other hand, the HO inhibitor SnPP IX induced a 523 and 690% increase in proliferation induced by FCS and by PDGF (Fig. 2, A and B, p < 0.05, respectively). For both mitogenic factors, SnPP IX reversed the antiproliferative effect of CoPP, thus confirming a specific effect of HO activity. Transfection with the HO-1 antisense effectively blocked HO-1 expression (Fig. 3A) and, like pharmacological blockade, enhanced PDGF-induced proliferation (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Effect of cell transfection with HO sense and antisense ODNs. A, effect of HO-1 ODNs on PDGF-induced HO-1 expression. The experimental procedure is the same described for Fig. 1. B, thymidine incorporation in ODN-transfected cells. The cells were stimulated for 24 h with PDGF. [3H]Thymidine incorporation (4 μCi/ml) was measured by scintillation counting. Each condition was done in quadruplicate. The values are the means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus 1% FCS; #, p < 0.05 versus mitogen alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W2165182331,"Binocular simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) are the first cells along the mammalian visual pathway to receive input from both eyes. Two models of how binocular simple cells could extract disparity information have been put forward. The phase-shift model proposes that the receptive fields in the two eyes have different subunit organizations, while the position-shift model proposes that they have different overall locations. In five fixating macaque monkeys, we recorded from 30 disparity-tuned simple cells that showed selectivity to the disparity in a random dot stereogram. High-resolution maps of the left and right eye receptive fields indicated that both phase and position shifts were common. Single cells usually showed a combination of the two, and the optimum disparity was best correlated with the sum of receptive field phase and position shift."

Although the etiology of MS is not completely understood, studies of MS patients suggest that the observed demyelination in the CNS is a result of a T cell-mediated autoimmune response (1Martin R. McFarland H.F. McFarlin D.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). According to one hypothesis (2Liu H. MacKenzie-Graham A.J. Palaszynski K. Liva S. Voskuhl R.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 116: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), T cells may be activated in spleen and lymph nodes, organs that have been found to contain myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA and protein in mouse, rat, and human. In contrast, according to the other view (3Iglesias A. Bauer J. Litzenburger T. Schubart A. Linington C. Glia. 2001; 36: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), T cells may be activated in the CNS periphery by the first encounter with myelin-related autoantigens such as MBP, proteo-lipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. However, after activation, these potentially damaging T cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the CNS where they recognize autoantigens, proliferate, and trigger a broad-spectrum inflammatory cascade, leading to myelin degradation and clinical symptoms (1Martin R. McFarland H.F. McFarlin D.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 4Utz U. McFarland H.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Although the infiltration of neuroantigen-specific T cells into the CNS is a key event in the pathogenesis of MS or experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS (4Utz U. McFarland H.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Chabot S. Yong V.W. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the mechanisms through which neuroantigen-specific T cells play an etiologic role in MS remain unclear. The hallmark of brain inflammation in MS is the activation of glial cells, especially that of microglia that produce a variety of proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors including proinflammatory cytokines. Among proinflammatory cytokines, primary inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β/α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α/β, and IL-6 play a predominant role because they are involved at multiple levels of neuroimmune regulation (6Benveniste E.N. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 7Tyor W.R. Glass J.D. Baumrind N. McArthur J.C. Griffin J.W. Becker P.S. Griffin D.E.

An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients has shown increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with those of normal control, and the levels of those cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients also correlate with disease severity (6Benveniste E.N. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 9Sharief M.K. Hentges R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 10Maimone D. Gregory S. Arnason B.G. Reder A.T. J. Neuro-immunol. 1991; 32: 67-74Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Consistently, the blockade of proinflammatory cytokine synthesis or function by signaling inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies or gene knock-out can also prevent the development of EAE (11Ruddle N.H.

Here we report that neuroantigen-specific T cells induce specifically microglial expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6) through cell-cell contact. Very-late antigen-4 (VLA-4) molecules on T cell surface play an important role in contact-mediated microglial expression of proinflammatory cytokines through the regulation of microglial activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) but not that of NF-κB.

Lymph nodes were collected from these mice, and single cell suspension was prepared in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at a concentration of 4–5 × 106 cells/ml in six-well plates. Cells isolated from MBP-immunized mice were incubated with 50 μg/ml MBP for 4 days. The non-adherent cells were collected and passed through the nylon wool column preincubated for a period of 30 min with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The first 15–20-ml eluant was collected, centrifuged at 500 × g, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium-FBS. Viability and purity of the cells were checked by trypan blue exclusion and FACS analysis, respectively. Approximately 98% cells were found as CD3-positive T cells (14Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These T cell populations were used to stimulate microglial cells. Flow Cytometry—Surface expression of VLA-4 on MBP-primed T cells was checked by flow cytometry as described previously (14Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells suspended in RPMI 1640 medium-FBS were incubated in the dark with appropriately diluted FITC-labeled antibodies to CD49d (integrin α4 chain) (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, cell suspension was centrifuged, washed three times, and resuspended in 500 μl of RPMI 1640 medium-FBS. The cells were then analyzed through FACS (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 cells was accepted for FACS analysis. Cells were gated based on morphological characteristics. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were not accepted for FACS analysis. Isolation of Mouse Primary Microglia—Microglial cells were isolated from mixed glial cultures according to the procedure of Guilian and Baker (15Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On days 7–9, the mixed glial cultures were washed three times with DMEM/F-12 and subjected to a shake at 240 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. The floating cells were washed and seeded onto plastic tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The attached cells were removed by trypsinization and seeded onto new plates for further studies. 90–95% of this preparation was found to be positive for Mac-1 surface antigen. For the induction of TNF-α production, cells were stimulated with MBP-primed T cells in serum-free DMEM/F-12. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells (a kind gift from Virginia Bocchini of University of Perugia) were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as indicated above. Stimulation of Mouse BV-2 Microglial Cells and Primary Microglia by MBP-primed T Cells—Microglial cells were stimulated with different concentrations of MBP-primed T cells under serum-free condition. After 1 h of incubation, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to lower the concentration of T cells. We performed FACS analysis to quantify the amount of T cells removed from microglia by this procedure. Areas under M1 and M2 in Fig. 1 represent autofluorescence and fluorescence attributed to CD3, respectively. Scales for M1 and M2 have been determined from nonconjugated cells. FACS analysis of adherent microglial cells using FITC-labeled anti-CD3 antibodies showed that >80% T cells were removed from microglial cells by this procedure (Fig. 1). Microglial cells then were incubated in serum-free medium for different period time. Assay for IL-1β and TNF-α Synthesis—Concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α were measured in culture supernatants by a high sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instruction as described previously (16Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Clin.

Protein was measured by the procedure of Bradford (19Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Analysis of Different Proinflammatory and Anti-inflammatory Cytokines by Gene Array—BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with MBP-primed T cells (0.5:1 of T cell:microglia), and after 1 h of stimulation, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to lower T cell concentration. BV-2 cells then received serum-free medium, and after 3 h of incubation, the expression of different proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was analyzed in adherent BV-2 cells by a gene array kit (GEArray™, Super-Array Inc.) following manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from stimulated or unstimulated BV-2 microglial cells by using Ultra-spec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.). This RNA was used as a template for [32P]cDNA probe synthesis using [α-32P]dCTP and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The GEArray membrane was prehybridized, hybridized with [32P]cDNA probe, and washed two or three times in solution I (2× SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—After different minutes of stimulation of BV-2 microglial cells by MBP-primed T cells, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to lower T cell concentration. Nuclear extracts then were prepared from adherent BV-2 cells using the method of Dignam et al. (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice, vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were diluted with 20 μl of modified buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at 70 °C until use. Nuclear extracts were used for EMSA using 32P-end-labeled double-stranded (NF-κB, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Promega), and C/EBPβ, 5′-TGC AGA TTG CGC AAT CTG CA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)) oligonucleotides. Double-stranded mutated (NF-κB, 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, and C/EBPβ, 5′-TGC AGA GAC TAG TCT CTG CA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)) oligonucleotides were used to verify the specificity of NF-κB and C/EBPβ binding to DNA. Assay of Transcriptional Activities of NF-κB and C/EBPβ—To assay the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, cells at 50–60% confluence in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of either PBIIX-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (21Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44527-44533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), or pC/EBPβ-Luc, an C/EBPβ-dependent reporter construct (21Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44527-44533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Invitrogen) (22Liu X. Jana M. Dasgupta S.

All of the transfections included 50 ng/μg total DNA of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase used as transfection efficiency control, Promega). After 24 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with MBP-primed T cells (0.5:1 of T cell:microglia). After 1 h of stimulation, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to lower T cell concentration. BV-2 cells then were incubated with serum-free medium for 5 h. Adherent BV-2 cells were analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities according to standard instructions provided in the Dual luciferase kit (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as (firefly luciferase value/Renilla luciferase value) ×10–3. MBP-primed T Cells Induced the Production of IL-1β and TNF-α in BV-2 Microglial Cells—T cells isolated from MBP-immunized mice proliferated in response to MBP, and the maximum proliferation was observed at 50 or 100 μg/ml MBP (14Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, these cells were stimulated with 50 μg/ml MBP. After nylon-wool column purification, MBP-primed T cells were ∼98% pure as obtained by the FACS analysis (14Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We next examined whether these purified MBP-primed T cells can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α in mouse BV-2 microglial cells. MBP-primed T cells were washed and added to BV-2 microglial cells in direct contact. After 1 h of contact, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times to remove MBP-primed T cells. Normal T cells (isolated from normal mice) were unable to induce the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 2A). There was also very little or no induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production when MBP-primed T cells were added to microglial cells at a ratio of 0.1:1 (Fig. 2B). However, the marked induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production was observed at the ratio of 0.2:1 of T cell:microglia (Fig. 2B). The induction of TNF-α production did not further significantly increase at 0.5:1 or 0.7:1 of T cell:microglia (Fig. 2B). However, the induction of IL-1β production increased further at the ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:glia (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, a decrease in IL-1β and TNF-α production was observed at a higher concentration of T cells (1:1). This decrease in cytokine production was the result of the increase in microglial cell death in the presence of a higher concentration of MBP-primed T cells (data not shown). The time-dependent experiment using MBP-primed T cells in the ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia shows that the microglial induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production peaked at 24 h of incubation and decreased at a longer hour of incubation (Fig. 2C). We next examined whether the contact between MBP-primed T cells and microglial cells or the soluble factors produced from activated T cells is necessary to induce the production of IL-1β and TNF-α. First, MBP-primed T cells were placed in a culture insert where they were in close proximity to but not contacting microglia. In contrast to marked induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production by MBP-primed T cell:microglia contact (Fig. 2B), very little cytokine production was observed when MBP-primed T cells were placed within culture inserts (Fig. 2D). Second, a different amount of the conditioned supernatant of MBP-primed T cells was added to microglial cells. 50 μl of supernatant is equivalent to T cells sufficient for the ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia. The induction of both IL-1β and TNF-α production by 50 μl of that of supernatant (Fig. 2E) was very low (<5%) as compared with that by 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia (Fig. 2B). However, higher volumes of supernatants of MBP-primed T cells induced higher amounts of IL-1β and TNF-α in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 2E). These observations strongly suggest that the induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production by MBP-primed T cells primarily depends on the contact between T cells and microglia. To understand whether MBP-primed T cells were able to induce the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in primary cells, we examined the effect of MBP-primed T cells on the induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production in mouse primary microglia (Fig. 2F). Similar to BV-2 cells, MBP-primed T cells were unable to induce the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in primary microglia when added at a ratio of 0.1:1 of T cells and microglia (Fig. 2F). However, the induction of IL-1β and TNF-α production started from the ratio of 0.2:1 of T cell:microglia, reached to the maximum at the ratio of 0.5:1, and decreased at higher concentrations of T cells (Fig. 2F). Effect of MBP-primed T Cells on the Expression of Different Cytokines in BV-2 Microglial Cells—To understand further the mechanism of cytokine production, we examined the effect of MBP-primed T cells on the expression of different cytokines by cytokine gene array analysis using the GEArray kit. After 1 h of stimulation of BV-2 microglial cells by MBP-primed T cells, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to remove any extra or loosely bound T cells. Following 3 h of incubation in serum-free medium, total RNA was isolated from adherent BV-2 microglial cells to perform gene array analysis. This gene array analysis allowed us to study the expression of 23 different proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, lymphotoxin-β, TNF-α, and TNF-β. Normal T cells were unable to induce any of these cytokines in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, MBP-primed T cells in the ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia strongly induced contact-mediated expression of IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6 (Fig. 3, B and C), cytokines that are involved in the pathogenesis of MS (6Benveniste E.N. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 9Sharief M.K. Hentges R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 13Esiri M.M. Gay D. Raine C.S. McFarland H.F. Tourtellotte W.W. Multiple Sclerosis. Clinical and Pathogenetic Basis. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 173-186Google Scholar). This induction of IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6 by MBP-primed T cell contact is specific because under the same condition, MBP-primed T cells did not induce other proinflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. Role of VLA-4 in MBP-primed T Cell-induced Expression of Proinflammatory Cytokines in BV-2 Microglial Cells—Integrins being present on cell surface are mainly involved in integrating cell-cell interaction (24Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). It has been shown that T cells activated by anti-CD3 express more VLA-4 integrin and that VLA-4 plays an important role in T cell contact-mediated activation of microglial cells (25Chabot S. Williams G. Yong V.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether neuroantigen-primed T cells require VLA-4 to induce contact-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. At first, we analyzed the expression of VLA-4 on the surface of MBP-primed T cells by FACS analysis using FITC-labeled antibodies against the α4 chain of VLA-4 antigen. Fig. 4A represents autofluorescence as this was observed in unconjugated normal T cells. As areas under M1 and M2 in Fig. 4 represent autofluorescence and fluorescence because of VLA-4, respectively, there was very little expression of VLA-4 on the surface of normal T cells (Fig. 4B) in contrast to marked expression of VLA-4 on the surface of MBP-primed T cells (Fig. 4C). An analysis of three separate experiments shows that MBP priming induced the expression of VLA-4 by 20.4 ± 3.6-fold. These results suggest that neuroantigen priming induces the expression of VLA-4 on the surface of T cells. To examine whether this VLA-4 is involved in contact-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, we used functional blocking antibodies against CD49d (the α4 chain of VLA-4). It is apparent from Fig. 5A that incubation of MBP-primed T cells with different concentration of antibodies against CD49d inhibited its ability to induce the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in BV-2 microglial cells. Although antibodies against CD49d at a dose of 10 or 20 μg/ml were not effective in blocking the production of IL-1β and TNF-α (data not shown), marked inhibition was observed when antibodies were used at a concentration of 50 or 100 μg/ml. In contrast, control IgG did not block the ability of MBP-primed T cells to induce microglial production of IL-1β and TNF-α (Fig. 5A). Consistently, gene array analysis also showed that antibodies against CD49d but not control IgG at a concentration of 50 μg/ml markedly inhibited the ability of MBP-primed T cells to induce the expression of IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6 in microglial cells (Fig. 5B). These studies suggest that VLA-4 being present on the surface of MBP-primed T cells is involved in contact-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. MBP-primed T Cells Induce the Activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ in BV-2 Microglial Cells—It has been shown that activation of both NF-κB and C/EBPβ is involved in the expression of different proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes and macrophages following inflammatory insult (18Jana M. Dasgupta S. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to ask whether activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ may be responsible for the proinflammatory cytokine release following MBP-primed T cell contact in BV-2 microglial cells. Activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ was monitored by both DNA-binding and transcriptional activities. DNA-binding activities of NF-κB and C/EBPβ were evaluated by the formation of a distinct and specific complex in a gel shift DNA-binding assay. Treatment of BV-2 glial cells with MBP-primed T cells at a ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:glia resulted in the induction of DNA binding activity of NF-κB at different minutes of stimulation (Fig. 6A). This gel shift assay detected a specific band in response to MBP-primed T cells that was not found in the case of mutated double-stranded oligonucleotide, suggesting that MBP-primed T cell microglial contact induces the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. We then tested the effect of MBP-primed T cell on NF-κB-dependent transcription of luciferase in BV-2 glial cells using the expression of luciferase from a reporter construct, PBIIX-Luc, as an assay. Consistently, MBP-primed T cells also induced NF-κB-dependent transcription of luciferase in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 6B). MBP-primed T cells did not induce the activation of NF-κB in BV-2 microglial cells when added at a ra"
https://openalex.org/W2127144515,"The small GTPase Rap1, which is activated by a large variety of stimuli, functions in the control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Here we show that in human megakaryocytes and several other commonly used hematopoietic cell lines such as K562, Jurkat, and THP-1, stress induced by gentle tumbling of the samples resulted in rapid and strong activation of Rap1. This turbulence-induced activation could not be blocked by inhibitors previously shown to affect Rap1 activation in human platelets, such as the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) and various protein kinase C inhibitors. Also inhibition of actin cytoskeleton dynamics did not influence this activation of Rap1, suggesting that this activation is mediated by cell surface receptors. Human platelets, however, were refractory to turbulence-induced activation of Rap1. To determine the consequences of Rap1 activation we measured adhesion of megakaryocytes to fibrinogen, which is mediated by the integrin αIIbβ3, in the presence of inhibitors of Rap1 signaling. Introduction of both Rap1GAP and RalGDS-RBD in the megakaryoblastic cell line DAMI strongly reduced basal adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. This inhibition was partially rescued by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate but not by α-thrombin. From these results we conclude that in megakaryocytes turbulence induces Rap1 activation that controls αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion.

The small GTPase Rap1 is a molecular switch that cycles between an inactive GDP and active GTP-bound conformation. The protein can be activated by a plethora of stimuli (1Franke B. Akkerman J.W.

In general this activation is mediated by second messengers such as cAMP, calcium ions, and diacylglycerol; and a number of guanine nucleotide exchange factors have been identified to mediate this activation (7Bos J.L. de Rooij J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 is prior to platelet activation, suggesting a key role of Rap1 in this process. After platelet activation Rap1 relocalizes to the actin cytoskeleton (8Franke B. van Triest M. de Bruijn K.M. van Willigen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell.

In the control of Rap1 in platelets, RapGAP, which can interact with the active α subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein Gz, plays a role as well (13Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

In a variety of cell lines, Rap1 was found to be involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Rap1 controls T-cell receptor-, CD31-, and CD98-induced activation of αLβ2 (14Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J.

Also T-cells from transgenic mice expressing active Rap1 from a T-cell-specific promoter showed increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion (17Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat.

The mechanism of this activation is still unclear and may involve an increase in both integrin clustering and integrin affinity. In Drosophila, Rap1 was found to control cell morphology polarity (22Asha H. de Ruiter N.D. Wang M.G. Hariharan I.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and, recently, to regulate the even distribution of adherence junctions (23Knox A.L. Brown N.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The role of Rap1 in the regulation of integrins with β1 or β2 subunits raised the question of whether Rap1 may regulate the activation of integrin αIIbβ3. Proper control of this integrin forms a key step in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Because platelets are not suitable for genetic interference studies, we have chosen human megakaryocytes, platelet precursor cells expressing αIIbβ3. In these studies we have noted that these cells are highly sensitive to mild disturbances such as tumbling tubes to mix added growth factors. This turbulence-induced effect was observed in several other hematopoietic cell lines as well. In addition we observed that inhibition of Rap1 strongly reduced cell adhesion to fibrinogen, the counter-receptor of αIIbβ3. This inhibition was partially rescued by treatment with the phorbol ester TPA but not by α-thrombin. From these results we conclude that in megakaryocytes turbulence is a mechanism to activate Rap1 and that Rap1 is involved in the control of αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Materials—The following stimuli and inhibitors were used at the indicated concentrations unless stated otherwise: 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (Biolog Life Science Institute, 1 mm), forskolin (ICN, 20 μm) BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 25 μm), Roche 31-8220 (Biomol, Plymouth, PA, 5 μm), GF 109203X (Biomol, 5 μm), staurosporine (Sigma, 200 nm), jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes, 5 μm), cytochalasin D (Biomol, 5 μm), latrunculin A (Molecular Probes, 5 μm), latrunculin B (Molecular Probes 5 μm), LY294002 (Biomol, 10 μm), wortmannin (Sigma, 100 nm), H-89 (Biomol, 10 μm), PP1 (Biomol, 50 μm), genistein (Biomol, 100 μm), SB 203580 (Biomol, 10 μm), rapamycin (Biomol, 10 nm), thrombin (Sigma, 1unit/ml), and TPA (Sigma, 100 ng/ml). Cell Culture, Cell Lines, and Transfection—MEG-01 cells (24Ogura M. Morishima Y. Ohno R. Kato Y. Hirabayashi N. Nagura H. Saito H. Blood. 1985; 66: 1384-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated (30 min at 56 °C) fetal bovine serum. DAMI cells (25Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. CHRF-288-11 cells (26Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Fischer's medium enriched with 20% heat-inactivated horse serum. The Jurkat T-cell line JHM1 2.2 was provided by Dr. D. Cantrell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) with kind permission of Dr. A. Weiss (University of California at San Francisco). These Jurkat cells were grown as described earlier (14Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). AZU II cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. van de Wetering (Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands). They were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The erythroleukemic K562 cells, a gift from Dr. C. G. Figdor, were grown in 75% RPMI 1640 and 25% Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. THP-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr C. J. Heijnen (Department of Immunology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands) and were maintained like the Jurkat cells but in the presence of 4× 10–4% mercaptoethanol. All cell types were cultured in the presence of 0.05% glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For electroporation, DAMI cells (1.2× 107 cells/ml in 0.4 ml of complete medium) were pulsed at 250 V and 960 microfarad with 5 μg of thymidine kinase-luciferase plasmid DNA, construct plasmid as indicated in the figure legends, and added vector plasmid to keep the DNA amounts constant. Subsequently, 24 h after transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and used 42–48 h after transfection. The constructs used for electroporation have been described previously (19de Bruyn K.M.T. Rangarajan S. Reedquist K.A. Figdor C.G. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29468-29476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Platelet Isolation—Donors claimed not to have taken any medication during the preceding 10 days. After informed consent was obtained, freshly drawn venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected into 0.1 volume of 130 mm trisodium citrate. Citrated blood was centrifuged (150 × g, 15 min at 20 °C), and subsequently the platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with prostaglandin I2 (10 ng/ml) and ACD (2.5 g of trisodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g of d-glucose in 100 ml of distilled H2O) for acidification to pH 6.5, thereby preventing platelet activation during further isolation. Next, platelets were purified from platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation (330 × g, 15 min at 20 °C). The platelet pellet was resuspended in HEPES-tyrode buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 11.9 mm NaHCO2, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm d-glucose at 2× 108 platelets/ml. Turbulence-induced Stimulation—Cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. Next, cells were resuspended at 5× 106 cells/ml (MEG-01) 10× 106 cells/ml (DAMI, CHRF-288-11) or 25× 106 cells/ml (Jurkat, AZU II, K562, THP-1) in medium. 200 μl of cell suspension or 500 μl of platelet suspension (2× 108 platelets/ml) in Eppendorf tubes was incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min. A sample was mixed gently, i.e. five times up and down, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. Subsequently, cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm aprotinin), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at maximal speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Measurement of Activation of Rap1, Ras, and Ral—The GTP-bound form of Rap1 was isolated using RalGDS-RBD as an activation-specific probe and quantified by Western blotting using anti-Rap1 antibody as described previously (1Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Similarly, RasGTP and RalGTP were determined using Raf1RBD and RalBP as activation-specific probes (27de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 28Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Adhesion Assay—Adhesion assays were performed and analyzed as described extensively (14Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase expression construct in the presence or absence of additional expression constructs as indicated. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in TSM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5% BSA at a concentration of 5× 105 cells/ml. Coating of 96-well plates was performed as described previously (19de Bruyn K.M.T. Rangarajan S. Reedquist K.A. Figdor C.G. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29468-29476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Greiner Microlon 96-well plates that had been coated overnight at 4 °C with different concentrations of fibrinogen (Chromogenix AB, Mölndal, Sweden) in sodium bicarbonate buffer (50 μl per well) were washed with TSM buffer and blocked for 30 min at 37 °C with 5% BSA/TSM. After washing the plate again with TSM buffer, 50 μl of 0.5% BSA/TSM was added to each well containing a stimulating agent or not. Subsequently, 50 μl of cell suspension was added per well, after which the cells were spun down for 1 min at 200 rpm in a Heraeus Sepatech Megafuge 1.0. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C, and nonadherent cells were removed with warmed 0.5% BSA/TSM. Adherent cells were lysed and subjected to a luciferase assay as described previously (29Medema R.H. de Laat W.L. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression of transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting of total cell lysates. Bound cells were calculated, and numbers were corrected for transfection efficiency and nonspecific effects of constructs by measuring luciferase activity of total input cells ([counts in cells bound/counts in total input cells]× 100%). Western Blotting—Western blotting of all protein samples was carried out using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The antibodies used for protein detection were rabbit polyclonal anti-Rap1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Ras (Transduction Laboratories). Phosphospecific antibodies against ERK1 and –2, protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt substrate, and S6 were all purchased from Cell Signaling. Turbulence-induced Rap1 Activation—In our analysis of Rap1 activation in MEG-01 cells, we noted that elevated Rap1GTP levels already occurred in the absence of the stimulating agents, solely because of the gentle mixing procedure. This effect was rapid, as it occurred within 30 s after tumbling the tube and was sustained for at least 5 min (Fig. 1a). Addition of the phorbol ester TPA, a strong inductor of Rap1 in platelets, did not induce or hardly induced a further activation of Rap1 (data not shown). Also cAMP-elevating stimuli, like forskolin, which was previously shown to activate Rap1 in MEG-01 cells, did not further increase the Rap1GTP level (data not shown). A similar turbulence-induced activation was observed in a number of other hematopoietic cell lines, such as K562 (erythroleukemia), Jurkat (T-lymphocytes), AZU II (B-lymphocytes), and THP-1 (monocytes) (Fig. 1b). Also, in two other megakaryocytic cell lines, DAMI and CHRF-288-11, turbulence induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 1d). This activation was neither enhanced nor inhibited by forskolin, which is an activator of adenylate cyclase, resulting in elevation of the intracellular cAMP level. However, TPA has an additive effect on CHRF-288-11 cells. Importantly, mixing-induced stress did not induce Rap1 activation in platelets (Fig. 1c). From these results we conclude that in megakaryocytes and in a number of other hematopoietic cell lines, but not in platelets, mild mixing is sufficient to strongly induce Rap1 activation. To investigate the activation pathway responsible for mix turbulence-induced Rap1 activation, we investigated the effect of several pharmacological inhibitors. Most of the inhibitors used had been shown to affect activation of Rap1. In certain cell types, an increase in [Ca2+]i was demonstrated to be necessary or even sufficient to induce Rap1 activation and could be blocked by BAPTA-AM (1Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 4M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of either MEG-01 or DAMI cells with a combination of BAPTA-AM and EGTA did not inhibit turbulence-induced Rap1GTP increase (Fig. 2a). PKC inhibitors (Roche 31-8220, GF 109203X, staurosporine) were described as blocking block Rap1 activation in various cell types (4M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W.

Also PI3K and PKA were implicated in the Rap1 activation processes (8Franke B. van Triest M. de Bruijn K.M. van Willigen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol.

However, inhibitors of PI3K activity (LY294002 or wortmannin) or PKA (H-89) did not interfere with the turbulence-induced activation (Fig. 2c). The contribution of Src and p38 MAPK was proposed (4M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M.

J. 2000; 349: 231-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but inhibitors of these proteins (PP1/genistein and SB 203580, respectively) showed no effect on mixing-induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 2d). Apparently, turbulence-induced Rap1 activation is not mediated by one of these previously described pathways. Finally, we tested whether the effect is direct or mediated by changes in the actin cytoskeleton. However, no role was found for actin cytoskeleton dynamics, as neither actin polymer stabilizing (jasplakinolide) nor dissociating (cytochalasin D, latrunculin A and B) agents seemed to affect this Rap1 activation (Fig. 2e). The effectiveness of the pharmacological inhibitors used was tested in parallel experiments (data not shown). From these results we conclude that stress applied by mixing activates Rap1 rather directly, presumably through a cell surface receptor. Turbulence-induced Activation of Ras and Phosphorylation of Ribosomal Protein S6 —To study whether turbulence induces additional signal transduction pathways, we determined the activation of both the small GTPases Ras and Ral and of ERK in MEG-01 cells (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, Ras was strongly activated but at a later time point than Rap1. Two downstream targets of Ras, Ral and ERK, were not activated. Using a phosphospecific antibody recognizing phosphorylated targets of PKB we observed phosphorylation of several proteins in lysates of mixed MEG-01 cells (Fig. 3b). However, we did not find activation of PKB itself using phosphospecific antibodies (data not shown), but we did observe phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, which was sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3C). This suggests that p70 S6 kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of S6. Rapamycin- and LY294002-sensitive turbulence-induced S6 phosphorylation was also observed in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Interestingly, shear stress-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase was demonstrated previously (32Kraiss L.W. Weyrich A.S. Alto N.M. Dixon D.A. Ennis T.M. Modur V. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1537-H1544PubMed Google Scholar). From these results we conclude that mix stress induces activation of several signaling pathways, one of which is the activation of Rap1. However, activation of Rap1 appears to be a particularly fast response. Inhibition of Rap1 Abolishes αIIbβ3-mediated Cell Adhesion—In contrast to platelets, which do not bind to fibrinogen in the resting state, we observed that DAMI cells adhere spontaneously to fibrinogen (Fig. 4), indicating that the integrin αIIbβ3 is (partially) active. To investigate whether Rap1 is involved in this process, we transfected DAMI cells with two different inhibitors of Rap1 signaling, i.e. Rap1GAP, which lowers the level of Rap1GTP, and RalGDS-RBD, which binds with high affinity to Rap1GTP. Cells were allowed to adhere to 96-well plates coated with different concentrations of fibrinogen, the counter-receptor of αIIbβ3. We observed that the concentration-dependent adhesion is strongly inhibited by Rap1GAP and is significantly inhibited by RalGDS-RBD, indicating that active Rap1 is required for αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion. Introduction of Rap1V12 had little effect on basal level of adhesion, suggesting that the endogenous level of Rap1GTP is already sufficiently high to support cell adhesion. Interestingly, whereas α-thrombin only marginally affects basal level of adhesion, TPA is a strong inductor of cell adhesion. Introduction of Rap1V12 did not significantly increase cell adhesion under these conditions. The reduction in basal adhesion after expression of Rap1GAP and RalGDS-RBD was also observed when cells were stimulated with α-thrombin. However, a much weaker effect of Rap1GAP and RalGDS-RBD was observed after TPA-induced cell adhesion, showing that TPA-induced adhesion is partially independent of Rap1. In this article we show that in a variety of hematopoietic suspension cells, mixing-induced turbulence results in a clear Rap1 activation. The presence of additional stimuli like forskolin, TPA, or thrombin did not accomplish a clear additional increase in the Rap1GTP level (except in CHRF-288-11 cells). The effect was rather dramatic and was observed even when cell suspensions were either tumbled once up and down or gently stirred with a pipette tip. The mechanism by which mix stress activates Rap1 is still unclear, despite our attempts to find a clue about the initial signaling events. We have tried to interfere using a variety of inhibitors previously described to inhibit Rap1 activation, such as the inhibitors for phospholipase C, PKC and PI3K, and chelators of calcium ions. We have also tested inhibitors of the cytoskeleton or integrin-based cell-cell contacts. However, none of the inhibitors tested so far showed an inhibitory effect on mix stress-induced Rap1 activation in either MEG-01 or DAMI cells. Signaling induced by turbulence is probably most similar to signaling induced by mechanical and shear stress, with the first induced by changes in cell shape and the second by a fluid flow. For both stimuli, knowledge of the receptors that trigger the events is still elusive, although cell surface receptors and alterations in the cytoskeleton are most likely involved (33Pavalko F.M.

Both stimuli trigger a variety of signaling pathways, including the activation of Ras and p70 S6 kinase, as we observe for mix stress, resulting in changes in cell structure and function. Previously, activation of Rap1 was observed after stretching adherent fibroblastic L-929 cells (38Sawada Y. Nakamura K. Doi K. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Morita K. Komuro I. De Vos K. Sheetz M. Ichijo H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that activation of Rap1 by external stress is not restricted to hematopoietic suspension cells. One of the most prominent effects of active Rap1 in mammalian cells is the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Adhesion mediated by integrins containing either β1 or β2 subunits has been shown to be regulated by Rap1. This regulation results in an increased binding of integrins to soluble counter-receptors or increased cell adhesion to immobilized receptors. Megakaryocytes, like platelets, express αIIbβ3, which allows binding to the counter-receptor fibrinogen. Interestingly, megakaryocytes already adhere to fibrinogen in the absence of a stimulus, and treatment with α-thrombin, a very potent activator of αIIbβ3 on platelets, only marginally increased the adhesion. This adhesion was dependent on fibrinogen, and increasing the concentration of fibrinogen also increased basal and α-thrombin-induced cell adhesion. Importantly, both basal and thrombin-induced cell adhesion was inhibited by the introduction of Rap1GAP or RalGDS-RBD, inhibitors of Rap1 signaling. This shows that Rap1 is required for αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion and suggests that Rap1 regulates αIIbβ3 activity. The inhibitory effect of Rap1GAP and RalGDS-RBD on basal adhesion indicates that in resting cells a basal level of Rap1 is sufficient to sustain cell adhesion. However, considering the stress induced by plating cells, it is likely that the basal level of Rap1 is elevated by mixing-induced stress and thus contributes to αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion. While this manuscript was in preparation, Bertoni et al. (39Bertoni A. Tadokoro S. Eto K. Pampori N. Parise L.V. White G.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) reported that Rap1 regulates the affinity of αIIbβ3 in primary mouse megakaryocytes. In their study basal adhesion was low and insensitive to expression of Rap1GAP, whereas α-thrombin strongly stimulated cell adhesion, which was further augmented by expression of RapV12 and inhibited by RapGAP (39Bertoni A.

Apparently, these mature megakaryocytes are less sensitive to mix stress-induced Rap1 activation than the DAMI cells, which represents a more immature megakaryoblast. What could be the reason for cells to activate Rap1 in response to extracellular applied stress? The most likely explanation would be that when cells are subject to detaching forces, they respond by increased binding to their support. Alternatively, Rap1 regulates integrin dynamics to allow cells to respond to changes in shape without cell rupture. Interestingly, Rap1 activation is induced by a large variety of stimuli and is thus a very common event. In addition, Rap1 appears to modulate all integrins that have been tested thus far, indicating that Rap1 regulates a process that is required for the activation of all integrins. Elucidation of this process is currently one of the great challenges in cell biology. We thank our colleagues in the Department of Physiological Chemistry for continuous support and discussions."

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers core lipids between HDL and other lipoproteins. It also remodels (A-I)HDL into large and small particles in a process that generates lipid-poor, pre-β-migrating apoA-I. Lipid-poor apoA-I is the initial acceptor of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids in reverse cholesterol transport. The aim of this study is to determine whether lipid-poor apoA-I is also formed when (A-I/A-II)rHDL are remodeled by CETP. Spherical reconstituted HDL that were identical in size had comparable lipid/apolipoprotein ratios and either contained apoA-I only, (A-I)rHDL, or (A-I/A-II)rHDL were incubated for 0–24 h with CETP and Intralipid®. At 6 h, the apoA-I content of the (A-I)rHDL had decreased by 25% and there was a concomitant formation of lipid-poor apoA-I. By 24 h, all of the (A-I)rHDL were remodeled into large and small particles. CETP remodeled ∼32% (A-I/A-II)rHDL into small but not large particles. Lipid-poor apoA-I did not dissociate from the (A-I/A-II)rHDL. The reasons for these differences were investigated. The binding of monoclonal antibodies to three epitopes in the C-terminal domain of apoA-I was decreased in (A-I/A-II)rHDL compared with (A-I)rHDL. When the (A-I/A-II)rHDL were incubated with Gdn-HCl at pH 8.0, the apoA-I unfolded by 15% compared with 100% for the apoA-I in (A-I)rHDL. When these incubations were repeated at pH 4.0 and 2.0, the apoA-I in the (A-I)rHDL and the (A-I/A-II)rHDL unfolded completely. These results are consistent with salt bridges between apoA-II and the C-terminal domain of apoA-I, enhancing the stability of apoA-I in (A-I/A-II)rHDL and possibly contributing to the reduced remodeling and absence of lipid poor apoA-I in the (A-I/A-II)rHDL incubations.

These include their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties as well as their ability to participate in reverse cholesterol transport, the process whereby cholesterol from peripheral cells is transported to the liver for excretion. The first step of reverse cholesterol transport involves the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor or lipid-free pre-β-migrating apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (1Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).The HDL in human plasma are classified on the basis of apolipoprotein composition into those containing apoA-I but not apoA-II, (A-I)HDL, and those containing both apoA-I and apoA-II, (A-I/A-II)HDL (2Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12201-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work from this laboratory has established that substantial amounts of lipid-poor pre-β-migrating apoA-I are generated when either human plasma HDL or spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing apoA-I as the only apolipoprotein are remodeled by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (3Liang H.-Q. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rye K.-A. Duong M.N. Psaltis M. Curtiss L.K. Bonnet D.J. Stocker R. Barter P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12538-12545Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The main aim of this study was to determine whether lipid-poor apoA-I is also formed when (A-I/A-II)HDL are remodeled by CETP. This is an issue of considerable importance given that (A-I/A-II)HDL comprise 50% or more of the HDL in normal human plasma and that under conditions of hypertriglyceridemia and in cases of low HDL states the level of (A-I/A-II)HDL rather than (A-I)HDL is affected (2Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12201-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Brites F.D. Bonavita C.D. De Geitere C. Cloës M. Delfly B. Yael M.J. Fruchart J.-C. Wilinski R.W. Castro G.R. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).To address this question unequivocally, it is important to use HDL that are comparable in all respects with the exception of their apolipoprotein composition. The (A-I)HDL and (A-I/A-II)HDL that are isolated from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography do not fulfil these criteria because they contain several subpopulations of particles that vary in size (2Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12201-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also contain apolipoproteins other than apoA-I and apoA-II as well as multiple types of phospholipids (6Vézina C.A. Milne R.W. Weech P.K. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 573-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Davidson W.S. Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences all have the potential to influence the CETP-mediated remodeling of HDL as well as lipid-poor apoA-I formation.To circumvent these problems well defined, homogeneous preparations of spherical rHDL containing either apoA-I only, (A-I)rHDL, or apoA-I as well as apoA-II, (A-I/A-II)rHDL, were prepared. Because the (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL were identical in size and phospholipid composition and contained comparable proportions of lipids and apolipoproteins, variations in remodeling and lipid-poor apoA-I formation could be attributed unambiguously to their different apolipoprotein contents.When the (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL were incubated with CETP and the phospholipid/triglyceride emulsion, Intralipid®, core lipid transfers were comparable for both of the rHDL preparations. However, the remodeling of the (A-I)rHDL was much greater than that of the (A-I/A-II)rHDL, and apoA-I dissociated only from the (A-I)rHDL. Additional investigations indicated that the reduced remodeling and absence of lipid-poor apoA-I in the (A-I/A-II)rHDL incubations were the result of ionic interactions between the apoA-I and apoA-II on the (A-I/A-II)rHDL surface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of ApoA-I, ApoA-II, Lecithin:Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT), and CETP—HDL were ultracentrifugally isolated from pooled samples of expired autologously donated human plasma (Gribbles Pathology, Adelaide, Australia) and delipidated as described previously (8Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Osborne Jr., J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The apoHDL were applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) (8Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis on a homogeneous 20% SDS-polyacrylamide PhastGel (Amersham Biosciences) and Coomassie Blue staining, the apoA-I and dimeric apoA-II appeared as single bands with respective molecular masses of 28.3 and 17.4 kDa.LCAT was purified from pooled samples of autologously donated human plasma (10Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The purified LCAT appeared as a single band on a silver-stained homogeneous 20% SDS-gel. Its activity was assessed using discoidal rHDL containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) (Sigma), unesterified cholesterol (UC) (Sigma), tracer amounts of [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol ([3H]UC) (Amersham Biosciences), and apoA-I as the substrate (11Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 1040-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear as long as <30% [3H]UC was esterified. The LCAT preparations used in this study generated 1,627–2,250 nmol of cholesteryl esters (CE)/ml LCAT/h.CETP was also purified from pooled samples of human plasma (12Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activity was determined as the transfer of [3H]CE from [3H]CE-HDL3 to ultracentrifugally isolated low density lipoproteins (LDL) (13Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tollefson J.H. Lui A. Albers J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E894-E902PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear as long as <30% [3H]CE was transferred from HDL3 to LDL. The activities of the preparations (expressed in units/ml with 1 unit being the transfer activity of 1 ml of a preparation of pooled human lipoprotein-deficient plasma) varied from 25.4 to 47.0 units/ml.Preparation of Spherical (A-I)rHDL and Spherical (A-I/A-II)rHDL— Discoidal rHDL containing POPC, UC, and either apoA-I or dimeric apoA-II were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (15Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures of spherical (A-I)rHDL and spherical (A-I/A-II)rHDL were prepared by incubating discoidal (A-I)rHDL and discoidal (A-II)rHDL with LDL and LCAT (16Clay M.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9019-9025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting spherical rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation (1.07 < d < 1.21 g/ml), dialyzed against 0.01 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) EDTA-Na2, and 0.006% (w/v) NaN3, and applied to a column containing human apoA-II-specific polyclonal antibodies coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) (16Clay M.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9019-9025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The unbound spherical (A-I)rHDL were collected. The bound spherical (A-I/A-II)rHDL were eluted from the column with 0.1 m acetic acid (pH 2.7). The (A-I/A-II)rHDL were collected into tubes containing 1 m Tris, pH 11.0 (final concentration 0.1 m), dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline and concentrated 5-fold before use.Spectroscopic Studies—The kinetics of the unfolding of apoA-I was assessed by incubating (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL (final apoA-I concentration 30 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 0–24 h with 4.0 m Gdn-HCl at pH 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0. Wavelengths of maximum fluorescence were determined from 300–380-nm emission scans using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The excitation and emission bandpasses were 10 and 5 nm, respectively. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. The excitation wavelength was chosen so that the emission spectra reflected only the environment of the apolipoprotein Trp residues and excluded contributions from Tyr residues. As apoA-II does not contain Trp residues, the emission spectra of the (A-I/A-II)rHDL therefore reported only on the unfolding of apoA-I.Spherical rHDL phospholipid acyl chain and head group packing order was determined by measuring the steady state fluorescence polarization of samples, respectively, labeled with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH) (10Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Lipid-water interfacial hydration was assessed by labeling spherical rHDL with 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene (PRODAN) (10Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Uncorrected fluorescence emission spectra of PRODAN-labeled rHDL were recorded from 390 to 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and respective excitation and emission bandpasses of 5 and 6 nm. Fluorescence intensities were measured at 440 and 490 nm. Polarization values and PRODAN fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 5 °C intervals from 5 to 50 °C. In all of the cases, the molar ratio of rHDL phospholipid/probe was 500:1. The final phospholipid concentration was 0.5 mm. Two-factor ANOVA with repeated measures was used to assess differences between data sets. Significance was set at p < 0.05.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—A Biacore 2000 biosensor was used to measure the ka (association rate constant) of seven unique apoA-I-specific monoclonal antibodies for the rHDL. Saturating amounts of rabbit anti-mouse Fc were immobilized on all four flow cells of a CM5 chip using amine coupling (17Curtiss L.K. Bonnet D.J. Rye K.-A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Injected isotype control or specific monoclonal antibodies were captured by the rabbit anti-mouse Fc at dilutions pre-determined to give 400 response units. This was followed by injection of the rHDL (analyte). The rHDL injections were made on the basis of apoA-I molarity.Data were collected at a high (5 Hz) data collection rate. Evaluation of the data began by synchronizing the injection time and zeroing the base lines of the sensograms. Control antibody sensograms were subtracted from each specific antibody sensogram. Each antibody and rHDL combination was evaluated with a 1:1 (Langmuir) model. Microsoft Excel 2000 was used for statistical analysis. The Student's t test for two-tailed distribution and two-sample unequal variance was used to verify significant differences.Other Techniques—A Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) was used for all of the chemical analyses. Enzymatic kits (Roche Applied Science) were used to measure phospholipid, UC, and total cholesterol concentrations. All of the concentrations were determined in triplicate. CE concentrations were calculated as the difference between the total cholesterol and UC concentrations. ApoA-I and apoA-II concentrations were measured immunoturbidometrically (18Hopkins G.J. Barter P.J. Metab. Clin. Biol. 1982; 31: 78-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using sheep anti-human apoA-I (16Clay M.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol.

The number of apoA-I molecules/(A-I)rHDL was determined by cross-linking (19Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar).Non-denaturing 3–40% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis was used to quantitate rHDL size. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (agarose gel electrophoresis followed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis) was carried out as described previously (20Asztalos B.F. Sloop C.H. Wong L. Roheim P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1069: 291-300Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the rHDL were transferred electrophoretically from the gradient gels to nitrocellulose membranes. ApoA-I and apoA-II were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.).RESULTSPhysical Properties of Spherical (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL (Fig. 1)—The particle size distribution and composition of the spherical (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL are shown in Fig. 1. Both preparations were 9.7 nm in diameter, and they contained comparable proportions of lipids and apolipoproteins. The composition is similar to what has been reported for the (A-I)HDL and (A-I/A-II)HDL in human plasma (21Li Z. Mcnamara J.R. Ordovas J.M. Schaefer E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1698-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As judged by chemical cross-linking, the (A-I)rHDL contained three molecules of apoA-I/particle (data not shown). This is in agreement with previous reports from this laboratory (12Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The composition of the (A-I/A-II)rHDL is consistent with particles that contain two molecules of apoA-I and two molecules of dimeric apoA-II (16Clay M.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9019-9025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).CETP-mediated Core Lipid Transfers between (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL and Intralipid (Fig. 2 and Table I)—The (A-I)rHDL (closed symbols) and (A-I/A-II)rHDL (open symbols) were incubated for 0–24 h with CETP and Intralipid. The composition of the rHDL at each time point is shown in Table I. Transfers of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between the rHDL and Intralipid are shown in Fig. 2. The rate and the magnitude of the core lipid transfers were comparable for both types of rHDL. By 6 h, most of the cholesteryl esters had been transferred from the rHDL to Intralipid. During the first 3 h of incubation, CETP transferred triglycerides from Intralipid to the rHDL. When the incubation was extended beyond 3 h, triglycerides were transferred from the rHDL back into the Intralipid. This progressively decreased the rHDL core lipid content and is in agreement with previous reports from this laboratory (4Rye K.-A. Duong M.N. Psaltis M. Curtiss L.K. Bonnet D.J. Stocker R.

By 24 h, the core lipid content of the (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL had decreased by 55.3 and 60.7%, respectively (Table I).Fig. 2Remodeling of (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL by CETP: Core lipid transfers.

The unprocessed incubation mixtures were electrophoresed on non-denaturing gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The (A-I)rHDL were immunoblotted for apoA-I (panel A). The (A-I/A-II)rHDL were immunoblotted for either apoA-I (panel B) or apoA-II (panel C). Samples of lipid-free apoA-I or lipid-free apoA-II were applied to the gels as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Remodeling of (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL by CETP: Formation of pre-β apoA-I. (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL that had been incubated for 24 h with Intralipid and CETP were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted for apoA-I (panel A). Migration of the rHDL on the agarose gel is indicated at the bottom of panel A. Panel B shows a sample of lipid-free apoA-I that was subjected only to non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The apoA-I content of the ultracentrifugally isolated (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL was also measured. During the first 6 h of incubation, the amount of apoA-I in the (A-I)rHDL decreased by 25% (data not shown). The apoA-I content of the (A-I)rHDL did not decrease further when the incubation was extended to 24 h. Incubation with CETP and Intralipid had no effect on the concentration of either apoA-I or apoA-II in the (A-I/A-II)rHDL (data not shown).To determine whether the loss of apoA-I from the (A-I)rHDL could be explained in terms of the dissociation of lipid-poor apoA-I, aliquots of uncentrifuged incubation mixtures were subjected to non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted for apoA-I (Fig. 4A). The (A-I/A-II)rHDL were also subjected to non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted for apoA-I (Fig. 4B) and apoA-II (Fig. 4C). Lipid-free apoA-I and lipid-free apoA-II were applied to the gels as indicated. The distribution of apoA-I in the (A-I)rHDL was comparable with what is shown in Fig. 3 with small particles predominating at 24 h (Fig. 4A). Lipid-poor apoA-I was apparent at 6, 12, and 24 h. This coincided with the loss of apoA-I from the ultracentrifugally isolated rHDL.The apoA-I in the (A-I/A-II)rHDL partitioned into small particles (Fig. 4B), whereas all of the apoA-II remained associated with the particles that did not change in size (Fig. 4C). Neither lipid-poor apoA-I nor lipid-poor apoA-II dissociated from the (A-I/A-II)rHDL (Fig. 4, B and C).To determine whether the lipid-poor apoA-I that dissociated from the (A-I)rHDL was comparable in size and charge to pre-β apoA-I, the (A-I)rHDL that had been incubated for 24 h with Intralipid and CETP were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. (A-I/A-II)rHDL that had been incubated under the same conditions were also subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5A). Migration of the samples on the agarose gels is indicated in the figure. Lipid-free apoA-I was applied to the gradient gels as a control (Fig. 5B). The apoA-I that dissociated from the (A-I)rHDL (arrow) co-migrated with the lipid-free apoA-I, confirming its identity as pre-β-migrating lipid-poor apoA-I. Pre-β apoA-I did not dissociate from the (A-I/A-II)rHDL.Structural Studies (Figs. 6, 7, 8)—Additional physico-chemical studies were carried out to understand why the CETP-mediated remodeling of (A-I/A-II)rHDL was decreased relative to (A-I)rHDL and why CETP mediated the dissociation of lipid-poor apoA-I from (A-I)rHDL but not from (A-I/A-II)rHDL. One explanation for these results is that the high hydrophobicity of apoA-II reduces the lipid-water interfacial hydration of (A-I/A-II)rHDL, increases the penetration of the apoA-I α-helices into the (A-I/A-II)rHDL surface, and reduces the flexibility of the entire apoA-I molecule. As the number of lipid-associated apoA-I α-helices varies when rHDL change in size (22Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Hefele Wald J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it follows that anything that decreases the flexibility of apoA-I may compromise HDL size changes and inhibit the dissociation of lipid-poor apoA-I.Fig. 6Lipid-water interfacial hydration of (A-I)rHDL and (A-I/A-II)rHDL. (A-I)rHDL (○) and (A-I/A-II)rHDL (•) were labeled with PRODAN.

It is a class II G protein-coupled receptor-activating adenylyl cyclase (AC). The role of the N-terminal extracellular domain of hVPAC1 receptor for VIP binding is now established (Laburthe, M., Couvineau, A. and Marie, J. C. (2002) Recept. Channels 8, 137–153), but nothing is known regarding the cytoplasmic domains responsible for AC activation. Here, we constructed a large series of mutants by substituting amino acids with alanine in the intracellular loops (IL) 1, 2, and 3 and proximal C-terminal tail of the receptor. The mutation of 40 amino acids followed by expression of mutants in chinese hamster ovary cells showed the following. (i) Mutations IL1 result in the absence of expression of mutants, suggesting a role of this loop in receptor folding. (ii) All residues of IL2 can be mutated without alteration of receptor expression and AC response to VIP. (iii) Mutation of residues IL3 points to the specific role of lysine 322 in the efficacy of the stimulation of AC activity by VIP. This efficacy is reduced by 50% in the K322A mutant. (iv) The proximal C-terminal tail is equipped with another important amino acid since mutation of glutamic acid 394 reduces AC response by 50%. The double mutant K322A/E394A exhibits a drastic reduction of >85% in the efficacy of VIP in stimulating AC activity in membranes and cAMP response in intact cells without alteration of receptor expression or affinity for VIP. These data highlight the role of charged residues in IL3 and the proximal C-terminal tail of hVPAC1 receptor for agonist-induced AC activation. Because these charged residues are absolutely conserved in class II receptors for peptides, which are all mediating AC activation, they may play a general role in coupling of class II receptors with the Gs protein.

Peptides. 2002; 108: 165-173Google Scholar). Together with the VPAC2 receptor subtype, they mediate a large array of VIP or PACAP actions on exocrine secretions, release of hormones, relaxation of muscles, metabolism, immune functions, growth control of fetuses and tumor cells, and embryonic brain development (1Laburthe M.

The VPAC1 receptor belongs to the class II subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which includes receptors for peptides structurally related to VIP, receptors for other peptides such as the PTH, calcitonin, or CRF (6Ulrich C.D.

The VPAC1 receptor, a prototypical class II receptor, has been extensively studied by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular chimerism with respect to determination of VIP binding domains (1Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Google Scholar, 2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

These studies showed that the N-terminal extracellular domain of hVPAC1 receptor plays a crucial, although not exclusive, role in VIP binding (12Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Google Scholar). Moreover, microdomains consisting of small clusters of amino acids located in the N-terminal ectodomain (11Du K. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37016-37022Google Scholar) or at the junction of extraloop 1 and TM3 (10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Google Scholar) were characterized as selectivity filters restricting access of VIP-related peptides to the hVPAC1 receptor. A three-dimensional model of the N-terminal ectodomain of hVPAC1 receptor has been recently developed (12Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, nothing is known regarding the regions of the intracellular domain of the hVPAC1 receptor involved in signal transduction e.g. adenylyl cyclase activation. More generally, the current knowledge of the coupling mechanism of class II GPCRs to signal transduction is limited as compared with that of class I GPCRs including the prototypical rhodopsin and β-adrenergic receptors (13Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Google Scholar). Since class II peptide receptors have low overall sequence identity with class I GPCRs and even lack the rigorously conserved residues found in the core of class I receptors including the (D/E)RY sequence, the determination of the class II receptor intracellular domains involved in coupling to signal transduction cannot be simply extrapolated from our current knowledge regarding class I GPCRs. In this context, the present study explores the structure-function relationship of the hVPAC1 receptor for VIP-induced adenylyl cyclase activation. For this purpose, we constructed a large series of mutants by substituting groups of amino acids or individual amino acids with alanine in the intracellular domains of the receptor including IL1, IL2, IL3, and the proximal C-terminal tail. The mutation of as many as 40 amino acids provides evidence that two charged residues in IL3 and the C-terminal tail are mandatory for coupling to adenylyl cyclase activation. Materials—Restriction enzymes and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Eukaryotic expression vector was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). DNA Sequenase kit and radioactive reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Promega. Synthetic VIP was from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). 125I-VIP and 125I-cAMP were prepared and purified in our laboratory as previously described (14Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C.

A receptor construct containing an inserted FLAG sequence between Ala30 and Ala31 and fused in the C-terminal position with the green fluorescent protein (16Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Google Scholar) was used in all studies. It has the same phenotype as the wild-type native receptor with respect to VIP binding and activation of adenylyl cyclase (16Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Google Scholar). Other highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma. Modeler v6.0 (17Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar) software was downloaded from salilab.org/modeler/. Graphical representation of the three-dimensional model of the hVPAC1 receptor was performed with VMD software (www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Site-directed Mutagenesis Experiments—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Google Scholar). Identification of the desired mutations was obtained by direct sequencing of the mutated region (10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Google Scholar). Correct expression of each construction was determined par direct fluorescence of GFP on living transfected CHO cells as described (17Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—Wild-type and mutated hVPAC1 receptors were stably transfected into CHO cells as previously described using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 2 μg of DNA construct. After 48 h, GFP fluorescence was used to check receptor expression, and transfected CHO cells were selected in the presence of Geneticin (G418) at a final concentration of 0.8 g/liter for 5 days, then grown in absence of G418 for 1 week, and used for cAMP measurement or membrane preparation as previously described (14Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Google Scholar). Ligand Binding, Adenylyl Cyclase, and Intracellular cAMP Assays— The binding properties of wild-type and mutated hVPAC1 receptor were determined by competitive inhibition of 125I-VIP binding to transfected cell membranes by unlabeled VIP as in Ref. 10Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Google Scholar. Briefly, membranes (200 μg of protein) prepared from transfected cells were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05 nm125I-VIP in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled VIP. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled VIP (1 μm). The specific binding was calculated as the difference between 125I-peptide totally bound and the nonspecific binding. Binding parameters (Kd and Bmax) were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of native VIP as described (14Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J. Brasseur R. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24003-24012Google Scholar). Dose response curves were fitted, and concentrations of VIP giving half-maximal responses (EC50) were calculated using the Prism Software. The efficacy of VIP in stimulating adenylyl cyclase for mutants is defined as (VIP (10–6m)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity for mutant/VIP (10–6m)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity for wild-type receptor) × 100. Intracellular cAMP was assayed as described (11Du K. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37016-37022Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected CHO cells were grown in 12-well trays, the culture medium was discarded, and adherent cells were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. They were then incubated without or with VIP under continuous agitation in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described (11Du K. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37016-37022Google Scholar). At the end of incubation (30 min at 25 °C) the medium was removed and cells lysed with 1 m perchloric acid. The cAMP present in the lysate was measured by radioimmunoassay as described (11Du K. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37016-37022Google Scholar). Cell number was determined in parallel wells, and data were calculated as pmol of cAMP/106 cells. Internalization of Wild-type Receptor and K322A/E394A Mutant in CHO Cells—Subconfluent CHO cells expressing wild-type receptor or K322A/E394A mutant were grown in 24-well plates. Cells were treated with 5 nm VIP or not (control) for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffer saline and subsequently used for binding or immunofluorescence studies. Binding parameters (Kd and Bmax) were determined by Scatchard analysis. Briefly, intact cells were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.05 nm125I-VIP in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled VIP, washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffer saline, solubilized with 300 μl of 0.25 m NaOH for 10 min at 25 °C, and the amount of radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of bound 125I-VIP in absence and in presence of 1 μm unlabeled VIP. Cell number was determined in parallel wells, and data were calculated as number of sites/cell. The GFP fluorescence in living cells and immunofluorescence studies on stably transfected CHO cells using anti-FLAG antibodies were determined as described (12Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 30 min with the primary FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody and then with the secondary antibody (TRITC-sheep antimouse IgG). Selected fields were examined on a LEICA inverted DM IRB microscope using a (×40) fluor oil immersion objective and the two filters N2.1 (515–590-nm bandpass) and L5 (480–527-nm bandpass) for GFP and TRITC fluorescence, respectively. In the conditions of our studies with nonpermeabilized living cells, the anti-FLAG antibodies, which recognize a FLAG inserted in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor, only bind to receptor constructs expressed at the plasma membrane (12Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Google Scholar, 16Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A.

Molecular Modeling—A three-dimensional model of the hVPAC1 receptor (136–411) consisting of the seven transmembrane domains, three extra- and intracellular loops, and the first 18 amino acids of the C-terminal tail was built by comparative modeling using the recently determined 2.8-Å x-ray structure of rhodopsin as template (18Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar). Briefly, preliminary alignment between the hVPAC1 and rhodopsin primary sequences was performed using a Clustal algorithm (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). In a first step, 53 sequences corresponding to class II receptors including VPAC1, VPAC2, PAC1, secretin, GRF, PTH, CRF, GLP-1, GLP-2, glucagon, GIP, and calcitonin receptors from several species (www.gpcr.org/7tm/) were aligned. In parallel, 83 sequences corresponding to rhodopsin from different species were aligned. These two alignments were used to select five members of class II receptors and opsins sharing the highest conserved residues within each family. The next step consisted of aligning bovine OPSD (PDB 1F88) and human OPSB, OPSG, OPSR, OPSD (NCB accession P03999, P04001, P04000, P08100, respectively) and human VPAC1, VPAC2, secretin, PAC1, GRF receptors (NCB accession P32241, P41587, P47872, P41586, Q02643, respectively). In order to refine this alignment, the HCA (hydrophobic cluster analysis) plots of these sequences were compared using VisualFasta software (Patrick Durand, Paris, France). Briefly, the hydrophobic clusters visualized by a two-dimensional helical plot of the sequences detecting the hydrophobic domains of these proteins were aligned in order to make the seven transmembrane domains coincident. The quality of final alignment between the hVPAC1 receptor and bovine rhodopsin (PDB 1F88) is evaluated by identity score (14%), homology score (61%), and HCA score (64%). The resulting alignment was used as input for Modeler v6.0 (16Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Google Scholar). Two hundred models were generated and ranked according to the Modeler objective function, and only the first model was used. In order to determine the molecular motif(s) responsible for hVPAC1 receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase as many as 40 amino acids were mutated into alanine in the intracellular domains of the receptor as previously defined by the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathicity plots (20Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar). Mutated domains include IL1, IL2, IL3, and the proximal C-terminal tail of the receptor (Fig. 1). Depending on the context, mutations have been carried out per groups of amino acids or individually. Regarding IL1, which is a short loop, two blocks of amino acids were mutated resulting in mutants IL11 and IL12 (Table I). After transfection of CHO cells with the corresponding cDNAs, no binding of 125I-VIP could be detected. Nor was there any ability of VIP to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity whereas CHO cells expressing the wild-type receptor responded nicely to VIP (Table I). Since IL1 is very short in the hVPAC1 receptor, we reasoned that mutations may have grossly altered receptor structure resulting in problems in expression of mutants. Indeed, no GFP fluorescence could be detected after transfection of IL11 and IL12 mutants (not shown) supporting that the mutated proteins are not expressed in transfected cells. Next, substitution of all residues of the IL2 has been performed by constructing three mutants IL21, IL22, and IL23 (Fig. 1 and Table I). All three mutants expressed in CHO cells bound 125I-VIP and Scatchard analysis of binding data revealed affinities similar to that of the wild-type hVPAC1 receptor. It should be also noted that the Bmax of mutants expressed in CHO cells is in the range between 461 and 580 fmol/mg of protein comparing well with the Bmax of the wild-type receptor (Table I). The three mutants were further investigated for their ability to mediate stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by VIP in membrane preparations. The responses were identical to that mediated by the wild-type receptor both in terms of EC50 and efficacy (Table I). These data are consistent with the fact that IL2 is not involved in the functional coupling of hVPAC1 receptor to adenylyl cyclase.Table IBinding parameters and adenylyl cyclase response to VIP for wild-type human VPAC1 receptor and mutants in IL1 and IL2IL1aBold A represents the presence of alanine in the mutated receptors.IL2aBold A represents the presence of alanine in the mutated receptors.169-KHLCTRN-175wt245-AVSFFSERKY-254wt169-AAAATRN-175IL11245-AAAAFSERKY-254IL21169-KLHCAAA-175IL12245-AVSFAAAAKY-254IL22245-AVSFFSERAA-254IL23Mutants125I-VIP bindingVIP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activityKdbKd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”BmaxbKd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”EC50bKd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”EfficacybKd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”nMfmoles/mg of prot.nM%WtcWt, wild type.0.36 ± 0.02561 ± 950.24 ± 0.05100IL11NDdNot detected.NDNDNDIL12NDNDNDNDIL211.05 ± 0.40580 ± 1010.18 ± 0.0790IL220.96 ± 0.29461 ± 930.44 ± 0.1389IL230.86 ± 0.31576 ± 1570.27 ± 0.06100a Bold A represents the presence of alanine in the mutated receptors.b Kd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c Wt, wild type.d Not detected. Open table in a new tab The role of residues present in the intracellular loop 3 was investigated next. This loop is large with 26 amino acids (see Fig. 1). In order to limit the number of mutants, we searched for conserved residues and aligned the amino acid sequences of IL3 from all human Gs-coupled receptors having high (VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors) or very low (PAC1, secretin, and GRF receptors) affinity for VIP (1Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the sequence alignment reveals the presence of eight strictly conserved residues and an arginine versus lysine exchange (Arg341 in the hVPAC1 receptor). These nine amino acids were individually mutated into alanine and the phenotypes of mutants analyzed after transfection in CHO cells (Table II). All mutants are functionally expressed in CHO cells as assessed by their Bmax determined in VIP binding experiments. All mutants but one have a Kd in the nanomolar range like the wild-type receptor (Table II). The notable exception is the K322A mutant, which has a low affinity for VIP (Kd = 23.4 ± 4.0 nm). The adenylyl cyclase assay provided data in agreement with the above described binding data. Indeed, the only mutant that differed from the wild-type receptor was again the K322A mutant, which exhibited an increased EC50 and a significant 50% decrease of the VIP efficacy in stimulating cyclase activity (Table II). For some mutants, a slight decrease in binding affinity was observed as compared with the wild-type receptor but full efficacy and potency was maintained for VIP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Table II). This may be tentatively ascribed to differences in the binding and adenylyl cyclase assays.Table IIBinding parameters and adenylyl cyclase response to VIP for wild-type human VPAC1 receptor and mutants in IL3IL3aSequence alignment of IL3 from human VPAC1, VPAC2, PAC1, secretin, and GRF receptors.

Open table in a new tab Then, we investigated the role of the proximal C-terminal tail of the hVPAC1 receptor in receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase. We substituted alanine in the first 20 residues in this domain. First, four mutants were constructed in which blocks of 3 or 4 amino acids were mutated to alanine residues (Table III). All constructs exhibited binding parameters (Kd and Bmax) that are very similar to those of the wild-type receptor. This is in line with the similar EC50 of VIP in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO cells expressing the four mutants and wild-type receptors (Table III). However a significant alteration of efficacy was observed for the mutant CT1 in which alanine was substituted for the first three amino acids in the C-terminal tail. The efficacy of VIP in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly decreased in CHO cells expressing this mutant as compared with cells expressing wild-type receptor (Table III). Since three amino acids were mutated in the CT1 construct, further mutants were constructed in order to determine which amino acid residue is reponsible for the low efficacy of the adenylyl cyclase response to VIP (Table III). Mutation of glutamate 394 alone (mutant CT11) or of both glutamate 394 and valine 395 (mutant CT12) also resulted in a 50% decrease in the efficacy of VIP highlighting the crucial role of glutamate 394. It is again important to notice that these two latter mutants have binding parameters identical to those of the wild-type receptor, including Bmax (Table III). As a control, we also mutated glutamine 396 alone. The Q396A mutant has clearly the same phenotype as the wild-type receptor with respect to VIP binding and VIP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Table III). Other mutants CT2, CT3, and CT4 exploring other parts of the proximal C-terminal tail did not show any alteration of VIP efficacy (Table III).Table IIIBinding parameters and adenylyl cyclase response to VIP for wild-type human VPAC1 receptor and mutants in proximal C-terminal domainC-terminal domainaBold A represents the presence of alanine in the mutated receptors.394-EVQAELRRKWRRWHLQ-409wt394-AAAAELRRKWRRWHLQ-409CT1394-EVQAAAAAKWRRWHLQ-409CT2394-EVQAELRRAAAAWHLQ-409CT3394-EVQAELRRKWRRAAAA-409CT4394-AVQAELRRKWRRWHLQ-409CT11394-AAQAELRRKWRRWHLQ-409CT12394-EVAAELRRKWRRWHLQ-409Q396AMutants125I-VIP bindingVIP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activityKdbKd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”BmaxbKd, Bmax, EC50, and efficacy were determined as described under “E"
https://openalex.org/W2046075953,"In isolation, a presynaptic terminal generally releases quanta according to Poisson statistics, but in a circuit its release statistics might be shaped by synaptic interactions. We monitored quantal glutamate release from retinal bipolar cell terminals (which receive GABA-ergic feedback from amacrine cells) by recording spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) in their postsynaptic amacrine and ganglion cells. In about one-third of these cells, sEPSCs were temporally correlated, arriving in brief bursts (10-55 ms) more often than expected from a Poisson process. Correlations were suppressed by antagonizing the GABA(C) receptor (expressed on bipolar terminals), and correlations were induced by raising extracellular calcium or osmolarity. Simulations of the feedback circuit produced ""bursty"" release when the bipolar cell escaped intermittently from inhibition. Correlations of similar duration were present in the light-evoked sEPSCs and spike trains of sluggish-type ganglion cells. These correlations were suppressed by antagonizing GABA(C) receptors, indicating that glutamate bursts from bipolar terminals induce spike bursts in ganglion cells."

To understand the molecular basis of this effacement in amebic colitis, we seeded Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites on top of differentiated human Caco-2 cell layers. Western blots of detergent lysates from such cocultures showed proteolysis of the actin-bundling protein villin within 1 min of direct contact of living trophozoites with enterocytes. Mixtures of separately prepared lysates excluded detergent colysis as the cause of villin proteolysis. Caspases were not responsible as evidenced by the lack of degradation of specific substrates and the failure of a specific caspase inhibitor to prevent villin proteolysis. A crucial role for amebic cysteine proteinases was shown by prevention of villin proteolysis and associated microvillar alterations through the treatment of trophozoites before coculture with synthetic inhibitors that completely blocked amebic cysteine proteinase activity on zymograms. Moreover, trophozoites of amebic strains pSA8 and SAW760 with strongly reduced cysteine proteinase activity showed a reduced proteolysis of villin in coculture with enteric cells. Salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli disturb microvilli without villin proteolysis, indicating that the latter is not a consequence of the disturbance of microvilli.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which trophozoites of E. histolytica efface the brush border microvilli of enteric cells. Each microvillus contains ∼20 actin filaments, which are bundled and linked to the plasma membrane by actin-binding proteins such as villin, fimbrin, small espin, ezrin, and brush border myosin I (11Fath K.R.

Villin is a major actin-bundling protein and a member of the family of Ca2+-regulated actin-binding proteins. It consists of two similar domains of 44 kDa and a head piece domain of 8.5 kDa. In vitro, the core domain caps, severs, and nucleates actin filaments in a Ca2+-dependent way, whereas the head piece domain binds actin filaments in a Ca2+-independent way. For bundling, the intact protein is required (15Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. J. Biol.

Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM1:IMSS were grown axenically in TYI-S-33 (7Leroy A. Lauwaet T. De Bruyne G. Cornelissen M. Mareel M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), supplemented with 60 μg/ml G418 for pSA8 (18Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol.

Microbiol. 1995; 42: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Trophozoites were harvested at the end of the logarithmic growth phase (72-h old cultures) by chilling at 4 °C. Salmonella typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 and EPEC strain 0128 K67 were cultured by overnight shaking at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth. Concentration of bacteria was estimated by comparison of culture turbidity with a McFarlands tube (Biomerieux). Cocultures—Trophozoites or bacteria were pelleted at 200 × g for 5 min, washed in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum supplemented or not with inhibitors, and added to the Caco-2 cell layers. Cocultures were incubated at 37 °C for various incubation times. In cocultures for 0 min, trophozoites were seeded on the cell layer and removed immediately thereafter. Washing fluids were collected, and trophozoites were counted. Some cell layers were cocultured with sonicated (3 × 5 s) or heat-inactivated (30 min at 56 °C) trophozoites or with filtered (0.2 μm) conditioned medium from 60-min cocultures. Prior to some cocultures, trophozoites were treated for 2 h in TYI-S-33 supplemented with the following inhibitors: z-FA.fmk; z-FF.fmk; calpain inhibitors I, II, and III; PD 150606; cathepsin B inhibitor II; CA-074-me; and z-VAD.fmk (all were from Calbiochem). β-Lactose and E64 were from Sigma, and pepstatin was from Roche Applied Science. Caco-2 cell layers were treated for 2 h in their own medium. To remove trophozoites from the cell layers following coculture, 200 mm β-lactose was added for 15 min. Alternatively, a 1:1 mixture of human non-decomplemented serum and DMEM was used to selectively kill trophozoites through the alternative complement pathway (23Huldt G. Davies P. Allison A.C. Schorlemmer H.U. Nature. 1979; 277: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Urea Lysates—Cocultures were stopped by washing with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 9 m urea lysis buffer supplemented with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (7Leroy A. Lauwaet T. De Bruyne G. Cornelissen M. Mareel M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Supernatants were taken for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To evaluate protein degradation by proteinases released from the trophozoites during lysate preparations (colysis) (24Moll T. Dejana E. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), lysates of Caco-2 cell layers were mixed with lysates of trophozoites. Western Blot Analysis—Lysates were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond) for immunostaining with a pAb against ezrin (obtained from Dr. Monique Arpin, Curie Institute, Paris, France) or α-catenin (Sigma) or a monoclonal antibody against villin (ID2C3, obtained from Dr. Sylvie Robine, Curie Institute, Paris, France) (25Dudouet B.

The signal was revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and intensity of bands was quantified using the program Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Assays for EhCP Activity—Gelatin zymography was done as described by Hellberg et al. (26Hellberg A. Nickel R. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Trophozoites were lysed by four cycles of freeze-thawing in PBS and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were reduced with 10 mm DTT for 10 min at 37 °C, and equal protein concentrations (4 μg) were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin. After separation, gels were incubated for 1 h in 2.5% Triton X-100 at 37 °C followed by 3 h in substrate buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm DTT) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Spectrophotometrical analysis of EhCP activity was done with the synthetic substrate z-RR.pNA (Bachem) (27Leippe M. Sievertsen H.J. Tannich E. Horstmann R.D. Parasitology. 1995; 111: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Conditioned media or total freeze-thaw lysates of trophozoites, Caco-2 cell layers, or 15-min cocultures were supplemented with 2 mm DTT, and 30 μl was added to 170 μl of 0.1 mm KH2PO4, and 2 mm EDTA, pH7.0, containing 0.1 mm z-RR.pNA. After 1 h at 28 °C, the optical density was measured at 405 nm in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation). The release of p-nitroaniline is proportional to the amount of EhCP activity. Immunocytochemistry—Caco-2 cells were seeded on 1.8-cm2 coverslips and cultured for 3 weeks. Cocultures with 15 × 104 trophozoites or with 2 × 108 bacteria and control Caco-2 cell layers were processed for immunostaining as described by Leroy et al. (7Leroy A. Lauwaet T. De Bruyne G. Cornelissen M. Mareel M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We used rabbit pAb against ezrin and mouse monoclonal antibody against villin (ID2C3). Cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Dialux 20, Leitz) or a confocal microscope (Leica TCS NT, Leica Microsystems). Ezrin microvillar patterns were scored as cauliflower-like or disturbed in 50 fields from three independent experiments by three observers. The Student's t test (p < 0.05) was used for statistics. Caspase Activity—Caspase activity was determined in accordance with Van de Craen et al. (28Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and subsequently lysed for 5 min at room temperature in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glutathione, and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride all at 10 μg/ml. Supernatants were collected and kept on ice. Caspase activity was measured by incubation of lysates for 50 min at 30 °C with 50 μm fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-amc (Peptide Institute) in the same buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm DTT. The release of amc was monitored for 50 min in a fluorometer (Cytofluor, PerSeptive Biosystems) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. Purified recombinant caspase-3 or lysates from apoptotic Jurkat cells were used as positive controls. Specific Proteolysis of Villin in Enterocytes in Direct Contact with Trophozoites—To evaluate the effect of E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS on enteric villin, the lysates of 3-week-old Caco-2 cell layers cocultured or not with 2 × 106 trophozoites for 1–5 min were analyzed on Western blots immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against villin. In lysates of Caco-2 cell layers without trophozoites, the antibody recognized a 92.5-kDa band corresponding with full-length villin (16Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Within 1 min of coculture, villin was proteolysed producing immunopositive bands of 62, 50, 36, 35, and 33 kDa (Fig. 1A). The relationship between the number of trophozoites added and villin proteolysis is shown in Fig. 1B. Western blots of lysates from cocultures with antibodies against ezrin, gelsolin, or α-catenin showed little or no amebic proteolysis (Fig. 1B), suggesting that among actin-binding proteins villin is a specific early target for trophozoites adhering to the apical side of enterocytes. Villin proteolysis not only occured in cocultures with 3-week-old differentiated Caco-2 cell layers but also in cocultures with 1-week-old non-differentiated Caco-2 cell layers and other colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines such as T84 and HCT-8/E11 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Villin proteolysis in coculture as compared with colysis. Villin Western blots of total urea lysates from: A, 1-week-old Caco-2 cell layers, T84 cell layers, or HCT-8/E11 cell layers alone (–) or cocultured with 1 × 106 HM-1:IMSS trophozoites during 15 min (+); B, Caco-2 cell layers alone (–), cocultured during 1 h with 2 × 106 HM-1: IMSS trophozoites (coculture) and Caco-2 cell layers mixed with lysates from 2 × 106 trophozoites (colysis). The intensity of the bands was quantified with the Quantity One program and expressed as the percentage of total band intensity per lane (lower panel). Bands are identified by the squares. Filled squares represent full-length bands, whereas dotted and striped bars represent proteolytic bands. Bands between 33 and 36 kDa were pooled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Amebic Proteolysis of Villin Is Not Attributed to Detergent Colysis—After a 15-min coculture, 80% of seeded trophozoites were still attached to the Caco-2 cell layer at the moment of detergent lysis. Therefore, detergent colysis, an important caveat for conclusions about proteolysis drawn from Western blots (24Moll T. Dejana E. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), might explain the lack of further villin proteolysis during longer coculture. To prevent proteolysis during detergent colysis, 9 m urea was added to the lysis buffer. As a control, lysates of trophozoites and of Caco-2 cell layers were made separately, mixed, and analyzed on Western blot. Villin proteolysis during colysis was much lower (28%) than during coculture (77%) and hardly differed from control cultures without trophozoites (19%) (Fig. 2B). From these results, we conclude that villin proteolysis occurs during coculture and not during detergent lysis. Proteolysis Requires Adhesion of Living Trophozoites to the Enteric Cells—Neither amebic sonicates nor heat-inactivated trophozoites nor conditioned medium of cocultures had an effect on villin. Cocultures in the presence of anti-adhesive concentrations (200 mm) of β-lactose (29Burchard G.D. Prange G. Mirelman D. Parasitol. Res. 1993; 79: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) prevented proteolysis (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the removal of trophozoites following 15-min coculture by 15-min incubation in the presence of 200 mm β-lactose or human serum resulted in the disappearance of villin proteolytic bands. In 60-min cocultures followed by the removal of trophozoites, low amounts of villin proteolytic bands were still present (Fig. 3B). From these results, we conclude that adhesion of living trophozoites to the enterocytes is necessary to initiate and maintain villin proteolysis. Caspases Do Not Participate at Villin Proteolysis—Caspases constitute a family of cysteine proteinases involved in programmed cell death (30Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). Caspase-3-like activation occurs within 30-min coculture of trophozoites with Jurkat cells in vitro (9Huston C.D. Houpt E.R. Mann B.J. Hahn C.S. Petri Jr., W.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible contribution of caspases to the specific and limited proteolysis of villin in Caco-2 cells was assessed. Using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-amc, we were unable to detect any caspase activity in cell lysates derived from cocultures. In three independent experiments, the released fluorescence was even lower in lysates from 15-, 60-, and 180-min cocultures (79, 73, and 77%, respectively) as compared with Caco-2 cell layers alone (100%) and the same was found in cocultures with 1-week-old Caco-2 cell layers. As a readout for caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation, the proteolysis of two substrates was determined, PARP and Bid, respectively. Neither PARP nor Bid was cleaved upon coculture as evidenced by Western blot (data not shown). Neither was villin proteolysis prevented by 100 μm z-VAD.fmk, an irreversible and highly specific caspase inhibitor. Here, we demonstrate that caspases are not activated within 2 h cocultures of Caco-2 cell layers with HM-1:IMSS trophozoites and that caspases are not responsible for villin proteolysis. Villin Proteolysis Is Mediated by Amebic Cysteine Proteinases—Several proteinase inhibitors were tested for their capacity to prevent villin proteolysis in coculture. Caco-2 cell layers and trophozoites were pretreated separately with proteinase inhibitors, and inhibitors were added to cocultures. Villin proteolysis was prevented by the cysteine proteinase inhibitors 200 μm E64, 100 μm z-FA.fmk, and by 20 μm z-FF.fmk (Fig. 4A) but not by 100 μm calpain inhibitor I, II, or III, 1 μm pepstatin, 100 μm PD150606, 100 μm calpeptin, 50 μm cathepsin B inhibitor II, 1 μm cathepsin D inhibitor, nor by 100 μm CA-074-me. None of the modulators was toxic at the concentrations given as assayed by propidium iodide staining. Because 100 μm z-FA.fmk inhibited villin proteolysis most efficiently, it was used in further experiments. To find out whether the proteinase responsible for villin proteolysis was of amebic or of enteric origin, Caco-2 cell layers, trophozoites, or both were pretreated with z-FA.fmk and cocultures were done in the absence of z-FA.fmk. The pretreatment of trophozoites alone with z-FA.fmk was sufficient to inhibit villin proteolysis, whereas no inhibition was observed when only the Caco-2 cell layer was pretreated (Fig. 4B, upper panel), indicating that EhCPs were involved. Villin proteolysis could not be inhibited when 100 μm z-FA.fmk was added to the lysis buffers (Fig. 4C), in agreement with the previous conclusion that villin was not degraded during detergent colysis (see Fig. 2B). To confirm that z-FA.fmk inhibits EhCPs, trophozoites were treated with 100 μm z-FA.fmk and processed for zymography (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Untreated trophozoites show a banding pattern similar to the one published by Hellberg et al. (26Hellberg A. Nickel R. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) where the upper band was identified as EhCP1 (48 kDa) and the lower band identified as EhCP2 (35 kDa). Pretreatment with 100 μm z-FA.fmk abolished all of the EhCP activity (Fig. 4B, lower panel). To substantiate further the participation of EhCPs at villin proteolysis, we used pSA8, a mutant strain of HM-1: IMSS, in which the overall level of EhCP activity is strongly reduced by antisense expression of EhCP5 (18Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and E. dispar SAW760, a non-pathogenic strain that lacks genes encoding orthologues of EhCP5 and EhCP1 (31Bruchhaus I. Jacobs T. Leippe M. Tannich E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Bands representing pSA8 EhCP activity on zymograms were of lower intensity as compared with HM-1:IMSS (Fig. 5A). The zymogram of a lysate from E. dispar shows one band (EdCP3), which is located between EhCP1 and EhCP2 (26Hellberg A. Nickel R. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Western blots of lysates from 15-min cocultures showed a reduced proteolysis of villin by either pSA8 or SAW760 as compared with HM-1: IMSS trophozoites (Fig. 5B). The EhCP activity in cocultures (optical density of 0.396 ± 0.064) with HM-1:IMSS trophozoites was not higher than in suspensions of trophozoites alone (optical density of 0.484 ± 0.004) as was evidenced by spectrophotometric analysis using the synthetic cathepsin B substrate z-RR.pNA. Neither was there an increase in EhCP activity in conditioned medium from cocultures (optical density of 0.144 ± 0.02) as compared with conditioned medium from trophozoites alone (optical density of 0.161 ± 0.01).Fig. 5Villin proteolysis in cocultures with E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS, pSA8, and E. dispar SAW760 trophozoites.

We wondered whether in such cocultures the prevention of villin proteolysis resulted in a better protection of microvilli. Therefore, 3-week-old Caco-2 cell layers were cocultured during 1 h with E. dispar SAW760 or E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS trophozoites pretreated or not with z-FA.fmk and processed for ezrin immunocytochemistry. The microvillar pattern as revealed by ezrin immunostaining was the same as by villin immunostaining but had less cytoplasmic background and, therefore, was easier to score (Fig. 6, A–B). Ezrin and villin immunocytochemistry revealed a homogeneous cauliflower-like pattern on the apical side of 3-week-old differentiated Caco-2 cell layers. Within 1 h of coculture with HM-1:IMSS trophozoites, this pattern changed into a disturbed pattern characterized by few elongated microvilli centrally and remaining microvilli at the cell periphery resembling a honeycomb (Fig. 6, A and B, HM-1). Immunocytochemical patterns correspond with the microvillar patterns seen on SE micrographs (10Martinez-Palomo A. Gonzalez-Robles A. Chavez B. Orozco E. Fernandez-Castelo S. Cervantes A. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Lauwaet T. Oliveira M.J. De Bruyne G. Cornelissen M. Mareel M. Leroy A. Arch. Med. Res. 2000; 31: S124-S125Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of trophozoites in cocultures accelerated these microvillar alterations. Living trophozoites were required because neither heat-inactivated nor sonicated trophozoites caused those alterations. Cauliflower-like and disturbed patterns were scored in 50 fields by three different observers. Fields were either homogeneous for one pattern or heterogeneous. In heterogenous fields, both patterns were scored. In cocultures with SAW760- or z-FA.fmk-pretreated HM-1:IMSS trophozoites, the ezrin microvillar pattern remained predominantly cauliflower-like in contrast to cocultures with HM-1:IMSS trophozoites where patterns were mainly disturbed (Fig. 6, B and C). Disturbance of Microvilli by Other Microorganisms without Villin Proteolysis—We wanted to examine whether villin proteolysis was the consequence of the disturbance of microvilli, regardless its cause. Therefore, we examined villin in cocultures with S. typhimurium and EPEC that are known to disturb microvilli of enteric cells (33Finlay B.B. Falkow S. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34Goosney D.L. Knoechel D.G. Finlay B.B. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The disturbance of microvilli was confirmed in these experiments through ezrin immunocytochemical staining of 1-h cocultures of Caco-2 cells with S. typhimurium, EPEC, or HM-1:IMSS trophozoites (Fig. 7A). Western blots showed no proteolysis of villin from cocultures with bacteria, in contrast to cocultures with amebic trophozoites (Fig. 7B). A comparison of these cocultures suggests that proteolysis of villin is not the consequence of the disturbance of microvilli. Enteric villin is proteolysed in cocultures of Caco-2 cells with E. histolytica trophozoites. This in vitro observation suggests a mechanism for the effacement of microvilli by amebic parasites (10Martinez-Palomo A. Gonzalez-Robles A. Chavez B. Orozco E. Fernandez-Castelo S. Cervantes A. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Lauwaet T. Oliveira M.J. De Bruyne G. Cornelissen M. Mareel M. Leroy A. Arch. Med. Res. 2000; 31: S124-S125Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Proteolysis during preparation of detergent lysates called colysis (24Moll T. Dejana E. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was not responsible for villin proteolysis as revealed by comparative quantitative analysis of Western blots from cocultures and from mixed lysates in matched experiments. Moreover, villin proteolysis could not be prevented by the addition to the lysis buffer of 100 μm z-FA.fmk, an inhibitor that was effective when added to cocultures (see Fig. 4). The finding that ezrin, gelsolin, and α-catenin were not proteolysed in coculture implicates a degree of specificity for villin that is unlikely in the case of colysis. We infer from these observations that villin proteolysis occurs within the first minute of coculture and before detergent lysis. Experiments with conditioned medium from cocultures, sonicated and heat-inactivated trophozoites, indicate that adhesion of living trophozoites is a prerequisite for villin proteolysis as described also for other molecular interactions and final host cell killing (6Leippe M. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Leroy A. Lauwaet T. De Bruyne G. Cornelissen M. Mareel M.

Invest. 1981; 68: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Amebic adhesion to host cells required the Gal/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin as was confirmed by inhibition of adhesion and prevention of villin proteolysis by 200 mm β-lactose. Moreover, the steady-state pattern of villin bands on Western blots necessitates the presence of trophozoites evidenced by the rapid clearance of proteolytic bands by the enterocytes upon the removal of trophozoites. Villin proteolysis was not restricted to cocultures with differentiated Caco-2 cell layers but also occurred with other colonic cell lines (see Fig. 2A) and in ex vivo cocultures with human colonic explants. 2T. Lauwaet, M. Mareel, and A. Leroy, unpublished observation. Caspases have been implicated in apoptotic cell death of Jurkat cells by trophozoites in vitro (9Huston C.D. Houpt E.R. Mann B.J. Hahn C.S. Petri Jr., W.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, these proteinases were not likely to be implicated in villin proteolysis. Caspases were not activated within 2 h of coculture of Caco-2 cells with trophozoites as evidenced by the lack of cleavage of Ac-DVED-amc, a specific caspase substrate (36Vaux D.L. Wilhelm S. Häcker G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6502-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Neither could villin proteolysis be prevented by z-VAD.fmk, an irreversible and highly specific caspase inhibitor that reduced the size of amebic liver abscess in severe combined immunodeficient mice infected intrahepatically with E. histolytica trophozoites (37Yan L. Stanley Jr., S.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7911-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cleavage of PARP and Bid (38Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar, 39Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-j. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar), early events in caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death, did not occur in cocultures of Caco-2 cell layers with trophozoites. The lack of caspase activation in our cocultures might be explained by the different origin, differentiation, and intercellular organization of the enteric Caco-2 cell layers as compared with the T leukemia cells, Jurkat, that were used by others (9Huston C.D. Houpt E.R. Mann B.J. Hahn C.S. Petri Jr., W.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). EhCPs were considered as candidate villin proteinases because of their multifunctional role in host invasion (40Que X. Reed S.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 41Zhang Z. Yan L. Wang L. Seydel K.B. Li E. Ankri S. Mirelman D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We evaluated the role of EhCPs using proteinase inhibitors as well as transfected and non-pathogenic amebic strains. z-FA.fmk (100 μm), an irreversible inhibitor of cathepsin B-like proteinases (42Smith R.E. Rasnick D. Burdick C.O. Cho K. Rose J.C. Vahratian A. Anticancer Res. 1988; 8: 525-529PubMed Google Scholar), prevented Caco-2 cell layer destruction in cocultures, 2T. Lauwaet, M. Mareel, and A. Leroy, unpublished observation. in line with previous observations on BHK cell layers (43Keene W.E. Hidalgo M.E. Orozco E. McKerrow J.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Treatment of cocultures with z-FA.fmk resulted in a reduced villin proteolysis. Concordantly, cocultures with amebic strains bearing a lower EhCP activity than HM-1:IMSS showed less villin proteolysis (see Fig. 5), whereas in coculture with Rahman, an amebic strain bearing comparable EhCP activity as HM-1:IMSS (44Lushbaugh W.B. Hofbauer A.F. Pittman F.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), villin was proteolysed as much as in cocultures with HM-1:IMSS. 2T. Lauwaet, M. Mareel, and A. Leroy, unpublished observation. The amebic origin of the EhCP activity was inferred from pretreatment of trophozoites followed by coculture in the absence of the inhibitor. Villin immunoprecipitated on beads was proteolysed by amebic lysates in the test tube with the formation of the same proteolytic bands as in cocultures, 2T. Lauwaet, M. Mareel, and A. Leroy, unpublished observation. pointing to a direct interaction of EhCPs with villin. It remains to be elucidated how EhCPs signal to villin inside the host cell and where the cleavage sites are located. Alternatively, EhCPs might interact indirectly via a signaling cascade starting from a ligand-receptor interaction at the host cell membrane. We found a positive correlation between the disturbance of microvilli as revealed by ezrin immunocytochemistry and villin proteolysis on Western blots in cocultures with HM-1:IMSS either untreated or treated with 100 μm z-FA.fmk or 200 mm β-lactose or in cocultures with a transfected amebic strain or a non-pathogenic strain. These results demonstrate that villin proteolysis is an efficient way to alter the structure of microvilli and confirm the need for villin in the maintenance of microvilli in vitro (16Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Costa de Beauregard M.-A. Pringault E. Robine S. Louvard D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Effacement of microvilli associated with villin proteolysis has been reported before in the proximal tubule as a result of renal tubular injury (45Zimmerhackl L.B. Leuk B. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 587: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, villin proteolysis is not the only mechanism of effacement of microvilli. Enteric bacterial pathogens such as S. typhimurium and EPEC also efface microvilli when cocultured with enterocytes (46Goosney D.L. de Grado M. Finlay B.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The lack of villin proteolysis in such cocultures indicates that molecular mechanisms associated with the effacement of microvilli vary in different microorganisms (46Goosney D.L. de Grado M. Finlay B.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8799-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Such a comparison also shows that villin proteolysis cannot be considered as the consequence of effacement of microvilli by amebic trophozoites, in line with the kinetics of both phenomena. Villin proteolysis occurred within 1 min of coculture before any microscopical damage to Caco-2 cell layers was observed, and microvilli were only disturbed at least 15 min thereafter. Microvilli are anti-invasive as they maintain the structure and absorptive function of the intestinal barrier (48Hardin J.A. Gall D.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 664: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 49Phillips A.D. Schmitz J. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1992; 14: 380-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, all of the infectious enteric microorganisms have interest in effacing microvilli from the surface of the enterocytes. In conclusion, our experiments propose a new molecular event during the early steps of amebic invasion. Investigation of the phenomena downstream of villin proteolysis may broaden our understanding of cellular microbiology (1Cossart P. Boquet P. Normark S. Rappuoli R. Science. 1996; 271: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) in general and help in further understanding the pathogenesis of amebiasis, including the crucial role of amebic cysteine proteinases.

https://openalex.org/W2111428705,"A mouse protein that interacts with the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit RIalpha (PRKAR1A), named PBR and PKA-associated protein 7 (PAP7), was identified and shown to be involved in hormone-induced steroid biosynthesis. We report the identification of the human PAP7 gene, its expression pattern, genomic structure, and chromosomal mapping to 1q32-1q41. Human PAP7 is a 60-kDa protein highly homologous to the rodent protein. PAP7 is widely present in human tissues and highly expressed in seminal vesicles, pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, renal cortex, enteric epithelium, muscles, myocardium and in steroidogenic tissues, including the gonads and adrenal cortex. These tissues are also targets of Carney complex (CNC), a multiple neoplasia syndrome caused by germline inactivating PRKAR1A mutations (PRKAR1A-mut) and associated with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) and increased steroid synthesis. PAP7 and PRKAR1A expression were studied in PPNAD and in lymphoblasts from patients bearing PRKAR1A-mut. Like PRKAR1A, PAP7 was decreased in CNC lymphocytes and PPNAD nodules, but not in the surrounding cortex. These studies showed that, like in the mouse, human PAP7 is highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues, where it follows the pattern of PRKAR1A expression, suggesting that it participates in PRKAR1A-mediated tumorigenesis and hypercortisolism."
https://openalex.org/W2166223015,"Gamma-secretase cleavage is the final proteolytic step that releases the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) from the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP). Significant evidence indicates that the presenilins (PS) are catalytic components of a high molecular weight gamma-secretase complex. The glycoprotein nicastrin was recently identified as a functional unit of this complex based on 1) binding to PS and 2) the ability to modulate Abeta production following mutation of a conserved DYIGS region. In contrast to the initial report, we find that overexpression of wild-type (WT) nicastrin increases Abeta production, whereas DYIGS mutations (MT) have little or no effect. The increase in Abeta production is associated with an increase in gamma-secretase activity but not with a detectable increase in PS1 levels. Subcellular fractionation studies show that WT but not MT nicastrin matures into buoyant membrane fractions enriched in gamma-secretase activity. These data support the hypothesis that nicastrin is an essential component of the gamma-secretase complex. The finding that WT nicastrin overexpression can increase gamma-secretase activity without altering levels of the presumed catalytic component (PS) of the enzyme may point to a role for nicastrin in facilitating cleavage by regulating substrate interactions with the gamma-secretase complex."

Although electrophysiological approaches to measuring the flow of ions in the open state have contributed profoundly to our understanding of ion permeation and gating, it remains unclear how much the ion-throughput rate decreases upon closure of the ion conduction pore. To address this fundamental question, we expressed the Shaker Kv channel at high levels and then measured macroscopic K+ currents at negative membrane voltages and counted the number of channels by quantifying the translocation of gating charge. Our results show that the conductance of the closed state is between 0 and 0.16 fS, or at least 100,000 times lower than for the open state of the channel, indicating that the flow of ions is very tightly regulated in this class of K+ channels."

https://openalex.org/W1999625286,"Proapoptotic gene transfer to promote death or to augment killing by DNA-damaging agents represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. We have constructed an adenoviral Tet-Off™ vector with tightly controlled expression of Bid (Ad-Bid) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Using the non-small cell lung cancer cell lines H460, H358, and A549, low dose Ad-Bid was shown to induce high levels of full-length Bid as well as caspase-3 and -9 activity. Although only a small fraction of Bid was processed to truncated Bid (a step inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone), Ad-Bid gene transfer resulted in mitochondrial changes consistent with apoptosis (mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release), DNA fragmentation, and a dramatic loss of cell viability. The proapoptotic effects of Ad-Bid were independent of p53 status and were augmented markedly by caspase-8 activators such as the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin. When Ad-Bid and cisplatin were used together, chemosensitivity was restored in p53-null H358 cells, increasing death from 35% following treatment with cisplatin and Ad-LacZ to >90% death with Ad-Bid and cisplatin (Ad-Bid alone induced 50% cell death under these conditions). Ad-Bid can induce apoptosis in malignant cells and enhance chemosensitivity in the absence of p53, suggesting this approach as a potential cancer therapy. Proapoptotic gene transfer to promote death or to augment killing by DNA-damaging agents represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

Ad-Bid can induce apoptosis in malignant cells and enhance chemosensitivity in the absence of p53, suggesting this approach as a potential cancer therapy. Resistance to apoptosis has been proposed to create a platform that is necessary and sufficient for tumor formation (1Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to apoptosis is known to be fundamental for therapeutic responses of malignant cells to cytotoxic immune cells, radiation, and chemotherapy (2Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). One of the most promising strategies in cancer gene therapy is the induction, augmentation, or restoration of apoptotic function through the transfer of proapoptotic genes. Apoptosis proceeds through two programs of caspase activation, known as the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway involves apoptosis-inducing extracellular receptors (such as tumor necrosis factor or Fas) that recruit and activate caspase-8 or -10 and, subsequently, effector caspases including caspase-3, -6, -7, and -9. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is regulated by cytochrome c release (3Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and typically is induced by stress, radiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Cytosolic cytochrome c induces caspase activation through the binding of apoptosis protease activation factor-1 and procaspase-9 to form the “apoptosome” leading to caspase-9 activation and caspase-3 processing. Although the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways can function independently, in most cells they are activated simultaneously and augmented by “cross-talk” of the reciprocal pathway.The Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators is characterized by the presence of Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; tBid, truncated Bid; Ad, adenovirus; Ad-Bid, adenoviral vector expressing Bid; Tet, tetracycline; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer(s); m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DiOC6, 3, 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fmk.1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; tBid, truncated Bid; Ad, adenovirus; Ad-Bid, adenoviral vector expressing Bid; Tet, tetracycline; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer(s); m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DiOC6, 3, 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fmk. domains and is subdivided into three groups comprising the antiapoptotic members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, the proapoptotic Bax-like proteins including Bak and Bax, and BH-3 domain-only proteins including Bid, Bik, Bim, and others. The BH-3 domain is a motif of ∼16 residues forming an amphipathic helix required for dimerization among Bcl-2 family members and for death induction. Dimerization between Bcl-2 family members requires the BH-3 domain of one partner and a groove formed among BH-1, BH-2, and BH-3 domain helices of the other partner (4Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar), although the role of dimerization in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c release remains incompletely resolved (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that BH-3-only domain proteins require at least one Bax-like partner to induce cell death (6Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem.

Bid is one such proapoptotic protein that induces a conformational change in Bax or Bak resulting in a channel-forming complex in mitochondrial membranes (8Zong W.-X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Bid is recognized as an intracellular link connecting the death receptor pathway and mitochondrial death machinery through caspase-8 activation (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). Full-length Bid, normally present in cytosol, is cleaved by activated caspase-8 to form tBid (carboxyl-terminal region of Bid), which translocates to the mitochondria causing cytochrome c release. Although tBid is a potent inducer of apoptosis, recent studies have shown that under some conditions full-length Bid can induce cytochrome c release in the absence of proteolytic cleavage (12Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10073-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Because Bid processing can link the extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways and amplify death receptor signaling, we have proposed Bid overexpression as a potential therapy for the management of cancer. In the present report, we show that a Tet-Off™ adenoviral vector expressing Bid (Ad-Bid) can result in high levels of Bid expression, tBid cleavage, and apoptosis in human NSCLC lines. The proapoptotic effects of Ad-Bid and tBid processing were viral dose-dependent and enhanced by chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or Fas death receptor engagement. Ad-Bid could restore chemosensitivity to cisplatin in the absence of wild-type p53, suggesting Ad-Bid (alone or in combination with chemotherapy or death receptor engagement) as a potential therapy against cancers lacking functional p53.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human NSCLC lines H460 (wild-type p53) and H358 (p53-null) were the generous gifts of Dr. A. Gazdar, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, and were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-activated fetal bovine serum. The human NSCLC line A549 (wild-type p53) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-activated fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were cultured in 10% CO2 at 37 °C.Antibodies—Antibodies against human caspase-8, full-length Bid, DFF45, Bak, and Bax were purchased from Pharmingen. Antibodies against human cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 were purchased from Clontech. Anti-actin was purchased from Sigma. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Antibody against tBid (p15) was purchased from BIOSOURCE International, Inc. (Camarillo, CA).Adenovirus Production—Recombinant Tet-Off™ adenovirus containing human Bid was constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Adeno-X™ Tet-Off™ expression system, Clontech). Human Bid cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Gerhard Wagner (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The construction and characterization of a recombinant adenovirus expressing human p53 (Ad-p53) and Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) were described previously (13Fujiwara T. Grimm E.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Owen-Schaub L.B. Roth J.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2287-2291PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses were propagated in 293 packaging cells; tetracycline was present in the culture medium for Ad-Bid. Viral titer was determined by plaque assay. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well 1 day prior to virus infection. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were infected with adenovirus at a total m.o.i. of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. For Bid-infected cells, the ratio of the two vectors (Ad-Bid and Ad-Tet-Off™) was 1:1.Anti-Fas and Drug Treatment—Anti-Fas (IPO-4, Kamiya, Seattle, WA) and cisplatin (Sigma) were used at a concentration of 1 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. For combination treatments, cells were plated with 5-m.o.i. Ad-Bid or Ad-LacZ for 24 h before adding anti-Fas or cisplatin and were cultured for an additional 24 h before proliferation was determined using the CellTiter96™ proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI).Western Blot Analysis—Cell lines plated 24 h previously in 6-well plates were washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and were harvested by scraping into each well 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (v/v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C), and the protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For cytochrome c detection in the cytosol, mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were separated using the ApoAlert® cell fractionation kit (Clontech). Equal amounts of protein were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies according to the Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescence protocol (Pierce).Flow Cytometric Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential after Ad-Bid or Anti-Fas Treatment—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using DiOC6 (3, 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; final concentration 100 nm, excitation wavelength 488 nm, emission 529 nm) as described (14Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well for 24 h before infection with Ad-Bid and Ad-Tet-Off™ at a m.o.i. of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. As a control, cells also were treated with anti-Fas and cycloheximide at a concentration of 1 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Sixteen h after viral infection or anti-Fas treatment, adherent and floating cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and incubated with DiOC6 for 20 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS on ice, and immediately analyzed with a FACScan (fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan; BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells showing decreased DiOC6 fluorescence represents cells with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis—Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well 1 day prior to infection at a m.o.i. of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. After 48 h, adherent cells and floating cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and fixed in 70% (v/v) ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml RNase for 5 min and then stained with propidium iodide at 50 μg/ml to determine subdiploid DNA content using a FACScan (fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan). Doublets, cell debris, and fixation artifacts were gated out, and sub-G0/G1 DNA content was determined using Cell Quest software, version 3.3.Inhibition and Measurement of Caspase Activity—Caspase-8- and -9-like activity was determined using ApoAlert® caspase colorimetric assay kits (Clontech). Caspase-3-like activity was determined using the ApoTarget® caspase/CPP32 colorimetric assay kit (BIOSOURCE International, Inc.). The -fold increase in protease activity was determined by comparing the levels of caspase activity in treated cells with those in untreated cells or control cells (Ad-LacZ). As a positive control for caspase activity, Jurkat cells were treated with recombinant human soluble SUPERFas™ ligand (50 ng/ml) purchased from Alexis Corporation (San Diego, CA). For caspase inhibition, H460 cells were preincubated with 50 mm zVAD-fmk (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) for 30 min prior to infection. Cells were cultured for 24 h after infection before being harvested for Western blot analysis of Bid cleavage.RESULTSAd-Bid Induces Caspase-mediated Processing of tBid in NSCLC—Using a Tet-Off™ adenoviral system to avoid the potential toxic effects of Ad-Bid on 293 packaging cells and to achieve inducible expression of this proapoptotic gene product, we documented that the NSCLC lines H460, A549, and H358 were transduced efficiently and produced high levels of Bid. As shown in Fig. 1A, full-length and truncated Bid were detectable in all three cell lines by Western blotting in the absence of tetracycline. Bid expression decreased to endogenous levels when tetracycline was present (compare +Tet to the mock controls) (Fig. 1A). Truncated Bid (15kD-) was detectable only when Bid was expressed at relatively high levels (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1B (viral dose titration), tBid was reproducibly detected only at viral multiplicities of infection >5 despite the high levels of full-length Bid detectable at lower multiplicities of infection. The processing of Bid to tBid also correlated with the cleavage of DFF, substantiating apoptosis in infected cells (data not shown). DFF is a heterodimer composed of DFF40 (also known as CAD) and DFF45 (also known as ICAD). During apoptosis, activated caspase-3 cleaves DFF45 and activates DFF40, a DNase that is thought to cleave DNA into nucleosomal fragments. Interestingly, Bid overexpression led to tBid processing in the absence of additional exogenous apoptotic stimuli, suggesting enhanced caspase activation following viral infection or Bid overexpression. Because full-length Bid can translocate to the mitochondrial membrane (12Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10073-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), resulting in cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and processing of tBid, increased caspase activation is expected in Ad-Bid-infected cells irrespective of tBid processing. To determine whether Ad-Bid infection resulted in caspase activation, caspase-3 and -9 activities were measured in H460 cells after infection. In two independent experiments, transduction with Ad-LacZ induced an approximately 2-fold induction of caspase-3 and -9, whereas Ad-Bid consistently induced a 4–5-fold induction of these caspases (Fig. 2A). Using a paired t test, the levels of caspase-3 and -9 were significantly different from mock controls (t = 0.01 and 0.009, respectively). For caspase-3, both Ad-LacZ and Ad-p53 significantly enhanced caspase activity compared with mock controls (t = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively), whereas only Ad-Bid significantly enhanced caspase-9 activity compared with mock controls (using a paired t test, t = 0.2 and 0.1 for Ad-LacZ and Ad-p53, respectively). As a positive control, Jurkat cells treated with soluble Fas ligand are shown in Fig. 2A (5–7-fold increase in caspase-3 and -9, respectively). Caspase-8 activation was not detectable in Ad-Bid-infected cells (data not shown), implying that under these experimental conditions there was little activation of the death receptor pathway. These data suggest that Ad-Bid may activate effector caspases (such as caspase-3 and -9) through a mitochondrial death pathway to enhance Bid processing. In support of this premise, treatment of Ad-Bid-infected cells with the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk inhibited cleavage of Bid to tBid (Fig. 2B), whereas the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk was unable to block this cleavage (data not shown). In addition, zVAD-fmk blocked DNA cleavage in Ad-Bid-infected cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that tBid processing by effector caspases played a crucial role in Ad-Bid-induced apoptosis.Fig. 2Ad-Bid induces caspase activity and caspase-dependent tBid processing in H460 cells. A, cells were infected with Ad-LacZ, Ad-p53, or Ad-Bid at 5 m.o.i. for 24 h before determining caspase-9- and -3-like activities. Data represent the mean -fold increase ± S.E. (n = 2). B, H460 cells were pretreated with zVAD-fmk prior to infection with Ad-Bid at 5 m.o.i. After 36 h, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis of Bid and tBid; actin levels are shown as a control. C, H460 cells were pretreated with zVAD-fmk and then infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-Bid at 5 m.o.i. for 36 h. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by subdiploid DNA content using flow cytometry.

Ross A.J. MacGregor G. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), we examined Bak and Bax expression in the three lung cancer cell lines by Western blotting. Bax was expressed equivalently in all three cell lines (Fig. 3A), whereas Bak expression was considerably more variable with A549 cells expressing low levels as reported (16Pataer A. Fang B. Yu R.

Cells were infected for 24 h with 5 m.o.i. before harvesting for Western blot analysis of cytochrome c and Cox4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether Ad-Bid infection corresponded with changes in mitochondrial permeability, cell lines were treated with the fluorescent dye DiOC6 to target mitochondrial events. As shown in Fig. 3B, Ad-Bid caused a significant reduction in DiOC6 fluorescence, indicating mitochondrial depolarization. The changes elicited by Ad-Bid treatment were more striking than those observed with anti-Fas. These events were accompanied by a sharp increase in cytosolic cytochrome c detectable by Western blotting (Fig. 3C) and seen only in Ad-Bid-treated cells and not in either mock-infected or tetracycline-treated Ad-Bid-infected cells. The mitochondria-associated protein Cox4 is shown as a control. Experiments were repeated three times with similar findings.DNA Fragmentation and Death in Ad-Bid-infected NSCLC—To document that mitochondrial membrane changes were accompanied by the induction of cell death, lung cancer cell lines were examined for sub-G1 DNA content using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry 48 h after Ad-Bid infection. Infection with the Ad-LacZ control resulted in little, if any, DNA fragmentation (range 0.8–7.8%), whereas Ad-Bid infection resulted in a marked increase in sub-G1 DNA content (range 11.0–80.0%) in all three cell lines (Fig. 4A). For the sake of comparison, DNA fragmentation also is shown for Ad-p53, a therapy currently in clinical trials for lung cancer and head and neck cancer (17Clayman G.L. El-Naggar A.K. Lippman S.M.

Ad-Bid was consistently more effective than Ad-p53 in the induction of DNA fragmentation and cell death (Fig. 4) at comparable multiplicities of infection. Such effects were most striking in H460 and A549 cells, where Ad-p53 resulted in ∼20% loss of cell viability 48 h following infection with 5 m.o.i. of virus, whereas Ad-Bid at the same viral dose and time resulted in ∼90% cell death. In H358 cells, which are relatively resistant to Ad-p53-induced apoptosis (∼10% loss of cell viability), Ad-Bid induced >50% cell death. Similar findings were observed in three independent experiments.Fig. 4DNA fragmentation and loss of cell viability in NSCLC lines following Ad-Bid infection.

Because Bid can be processed by caspase-8 activation, we reasoned that enhanced killing might be observed with Ad-Bid in combination with activators of caspase-8. To this end, we examined the combined effects of Ad-Bid and either cisplatin or anti-Fas on tumor cell killing. Both anti-Fas and cisplatin treatment activated caspase-8 in H460 and H358 cells. In H460 cells, anti-Fas induced an approximately 5-fold increase in caspase-8 activity, whereas cisplatin induced a 4–5-fold increase (Fig. 5A). In H358 cells, anti-Fas and cisplatin treatment resulted in a more modest activation of caspase-8 with a 1.5–2-fold activation by anti-Fas and a 2–3-fold activation by cisplatin. As a positive control, caspase-8 activation is shown for both cell lines following treatment with soluble Fas ligand (Fig. 5A). These experiments were repeated twice with similar findings. H358 and H460 cell lines express low levels of Fas and are moderately sensitive to anti-Fas killing (20Owen-Schaub L.B. Zhang W. Cusack J.C. Angelo L.S. Santee S.M. Fujiwara T. Roth J.A.

Fig. 5B shows the loss of cellular viability in Ad-LacZ-infected H460 and H358 treated with anti-Fas antibody; in both cases, anti-Fas treatment resulted in ∼40% cell killing. When Bid was overexpressed, however, both lung cancer cell lines showed a marked enhancement of Fas sensitivity. In the case of H460, Ad-Bid treatment resulted in the death of ∼90% of the cells (consistent with Fig. 4), and the addition of anti-Fas further diminished viable cell counts to <5% of the starting population. In the case of the more resistant cancer cell line H358, Bid overexpression resulted in the death of ∼50% of the cells (consistent with Fig. 4), and the addition of anti-Fas diminished viability to <5% of the starting population. Likewise, when Bid was overexpressed, both cell lines show a marked sensitivity to cisplatin. Ad-LacZ-transduced H460 cells showed ∼60% cell death after treatment with cisplatin, whereas the Ad-Bid and cisplatin combination induced >95% cell death (Fig. 5C). In the H358 lung cancer cells, Ad-LacZ treatment in combination with cisplatin induced ∼35% cell death, whereas the Ad-Bid and cisplatin combination increased killing to ∼90%. These experiments were repeated four times with similar findings. As expected based upon the loss of cellular viability, Ad-Bid in combination with anti-Fas or cisplatin also increased DFF45 cleavage (Fig. 6A) and tBid processing (Fig. 6B) in both cell lines (n = 2). Taken together, these data suggest that agents capable of activating caspase processing of Bid may enhance Ad-Bid-induced tumor cell killing in an additive or superadditive manner.Fig. 5NSCLC lines show increased caspase-8-like activity and cell death following Ad-Bid in combination with cisplatin and anti-Fas treatment. A, H460 and H358 cells were treated for 24 h with anti-Fas (α-FasAb) or cisplatin before determining caspase-8-like activity. Jurkat cells treated with soluble Fas ligand are shown as a positive control; mock-treated cells are negative controls.
