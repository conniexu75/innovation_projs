https://openalex.org/W2281420995,"As breaking news unfolds people increasingly rely on social media to stay abreast of the latest updates. The use of social media in such situations comes with the caveat that new information being released piecemeal may encourage rumours, many of which remain unverified long after their point of release. Little is known, however, about the dynamics of the life cycle of a social media rumour. In this paper we present a methodology that has enabled us to collect, identify and annotate a dataset of 330 rumour threads (4,842 tweets) associated with 9 newsworthy events. We analyse this dataset to understand how users spread, support, or deny rumours that are later proven true or false, by distinguishing two levels of status in a rumour life cycle i.e., before and after its veracity status is resolved. The identification of rumours associated with each event, as well as the tweet that resolved each rumour as true or false, was performed by journalist members of the research team who tracked the events in real time. Our study shows that rumours that are ultimately proven true tend to be resolved faster than those that turn out to be false. Whilst one can readily see users denying rumours once they have been debunked, users appear to be less capable of distinguishing true from false rumours when their veracity remains in question. In fact, we show that the prevalent tendency for users is to support every unverified rumour. We also analyse the role of different types of users, finding that highly reputable users such as news organisations endeavour to post well-grounded statements, which appear to be certain and accompanied by evidence. Nevertheless, these often prove to be unverified pieces of information that give rise to false rumours. Our study reinforces the need for developing robust machine learning techniques that can provide assistance in real time for assessing the veracity of rumours. The findings of our study provide useful insights for achieving this aim."
https://openalex.org/W2292055541,"Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide elaborated by the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. Magnocellular OT neurons of these nuclei innervate numerous forebrain regions and release OT into the blood from the posterior pituitary. The PVN also harbors parvocellular OT cells that project to the brainstem and spinal cord, but their function has not been directly assessed. Here, we identified a subset of approximately 30 parvocellular OT neurons, with collateral projections onto magnocellular OT neurons and neurons of deep layers of the spinal cord. Evoked OT release from these OT neurons suppresses nociception and promotes analgesia in an animal model of inflammatory pain. Our findings identify a new population of OT neurons that modulates nociception in a two tier process: (1) directly by release of OT from axons onto sensory spinal cord neurons and inhibiting their activity and (2) indirectly by stimulating OT release from SON neurons into the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2293619782,"We investigated the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition at presynaptic terminals using halorhodopsin, archaerhodopsin and chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins. Precisely timed activation of both archaerhodopsin and halorhodpsin at presynaptic terminals attenuated evoked release. However, sustained archaerhodopsin activation was paradoxically associated with increased spontaneous release. Activation of chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins triggered neurotransmitter release upon light onset. Thus, the biophysical properties of presynaptic terminals dictate unique boundary conditions for optogenetic manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2289942604,"Antibodies with ontogenies from VH1-2 or VH1-46-germline genes dominate the broadly neutralizing response against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on HIV-1. Here, we define with longitudinal sampling from time-of-infection the development of a VH1-46-derived antibody lineage that matured to neutralize 90% of HIV-1 isolates. Structures of lineage antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-infection, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%), and CH235.12 (week 323, 90%) demonstrated the maturing epitope to focus on the conformationally invariant portion of the CD4bs. Similarities between CH235 lineage and five unrelated CD4bs lineages in epitope focusing, length-of-time to develop breadth, and extraordinary level of somatic hypermutation suggested commonalities in maturation among all CD4bs antibodies. Fortunately, the required CH235-lineage hypermutation appeared substantially guided by the intrinsic mutability of the VH1-46 gene, which closely resembled VH1-2. We integrated our CH235-lineage findings with a second broadly neutralizing lineage and HIV-1 co-evolution to suggest a vaccination strategy for inducing both lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2290082869,"Animals generate movement by engaging spinal circuits that direct precise sequences of muscle contraction, but the identity and organizational logic of local interneurons that lie at the core of these circuits remain unresolved. Here, we show that V1 interneurons, a major inhibitory population that controls motor output, fractionate into highly diverse subsets on the basis of the expression of 19 transcription factors. Transcriptionally defined V1 subsets exhibit distinct physiological signatures and highly structured spatial distributions with mediolateral and dorsoventral positional biases. These positional distinctions constrain patterns of input from sensory and motor neurons and, as such, suggest that interneuron position is a determinant of microcircuit organization. Moreover, V1 diversity indicates that different inhibitory microcircuits exist for motor pools controlling hip, ankle, and foot muscles, revealing a variable circuit architecture for interneurons that control limb movement."
https://openalex.org/W2294690275,"Elucidation of structure–function relationships in the nervous system necessitates biological circuit control with genetic and temporal precision. Here the authors engineer a genetically encoded magnetically sensitive actuator, “Magneto,” and remotely manipulate behavior in live zebrafish and mice. The magnetogenetic control over neural activity promises greater access to previously intractable tissues. Optogenetic and chemogenetic actuators are critical for deconstructing the neural correlates of behavior. However, these tools have several limitations, including invasive modes of stimulation or slow on/off kinetics. We have overcome these disadvantages by synthesizing a single-component, magnetically sensitive actuator, “Magneto,” comprising the cation channel TRPV4 fused to the paramagnetic protein ferritin. We validated noninvasive magnetic control over neuronal activity by demonstrating remote stimulation of cells using in vitro calcium imaging assays, electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the brains of freely moving mice, and behavioral outputs in zebrafish and mice. As proof of concept, we used Magneto to delineate a causal role of striatal dopamine receptor 1 neurons in mediating reward behavior in mice. Together our results present Magneto as an actuator capable of remotely controlling circuits associated with complex animal behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2293446808,"In many vertebrate species, certain individuals will seek out opportunities for aggression, even in the absence of threat-provoking cues. Although several brain areas have been implicated in the generation of attack in response to social threat, little is known about the neural mechanisms that promote self-initiated or 'voluntary' aggression-seeking when no threat is present. To explore this directly, we utilized an aggression-seeking task in which male mice self-initiated aggression trials to gain brief and repeated access to a weaker male that they could attack. In males that exhibited rapid task learning, we found that the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl), an area with a known role in attack, was essential for aggression-seeking. Using both single-unit electrophysiology and population optical recording, we found that VMHvl neurons became active during aggression-seeking and that their activity tracked changes in task learning and extinction. Inactivation of the VMHvl reduced aggression-seeking behavior, whereas optogenetic stimulation of the VMHvl accelerated moment-to-moment aggression-seeking and intensified future attack. These data demonstrate that the VMHvl can mediate both acute attack and flexible seeking actions that precede attack."
https://openalex.org/W2292802465,"The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is initiated by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The BCL-2 family effectors BAX and BAK are thought to be absolutely required for this process. Here, we report that BCL-2 ovarian killer (BOK) is a bona fide yet unconventional effector of MOMP that can trigger apoptosis in the absence of both BAX and BAK. However, unlike the canonical effectors, BOK appears to be constitutively active and unresponsive to antagonistic effects of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Rather, BOK is controlled at the level of protein stability by components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway. BOK is ubiquitylated by the AMFR/gp78 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targeted for proteasomal degradation in a VCP/p97-dependent manner, which allows survival of the cell. When proteasome function, VCP, or gp78 activity is compromised, BOK is stabilized to induce MOMP and apoptosis independently of other BCL-2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2296704298,"The aggregation of Aβ42-peptides and the formation of drusen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are due in part to the inability of homeostatic phagocytic mechanisms to clear self-aggregating Aβ42-peptides from the extracellular space. The triggering receptor expressed in myeloid/microglial cells-2 (TREM2), a trans-membrane-spanning, sensor-receptor of the immune-globulin/lectin-like gene superfamily is a critical component of Aβ42-peptide clearance. Here we report a significant deficit in TREM2 in AMD retina and in cytokine- or oxidatively-stressed microglial (MG) cells. RT-PCR, miRNA-array, LED-Northern and Western blot studies indicated up-regulation of a microglial-enriched NF-кB-sensitive miRNA-34a coupled to a down-regulation of TREM2 in the same samples. Bioinformatics/transfection-luciferase reporter assays indicated that miRNA-34a targets the 299 nucleotide TREM2-mRNA-3’UTR, resulting in TREM2 down-regulation. C8B4-microglial cells challenged with Aβ42 were able to phagocytose these peptides, while miRNA-34a down-regulated both TREM2 and the ability of microglial-cells to phagocytose. Treatment of TNFα-stressed MG cells with phenyl-butyl nitrone (PBN), caffeic-acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), the NF-B-inhibitor/resveratrol analog CAY10512 or curcumin abrogated these responses. Incubation of anti-miRNA-34a (AM-34a) normalized miRNA-34a abundance and restored TREM2 back to homeostatic levels. These data support five novel observations: (i) that a ROS- and NF-B-sensitive, miRNA-34a-mediated modulation of TREM2 may in part regulate the phagocytic response; (ii) that gene products encoded on two different chromosomes (miRNA-34a at chr1q36.22 and TREM2 at chr6p21.1) orchestrate a phagocytic-Aβ42-peptide clearance-system; (iii) that this NF-kB-mediated-miRNA-34a-TREM2 mechanism is inducible from outside of the cell; (iv) that when operating normally, this pathway can clear Aβ42 peptide monomers from the extracellular medium; and (v) that anti-NF-kB and/or anti-miRNA (AM)-based therapeutic strategies may be useful against deficits in TREM-2 receptor-based-sensing and -phagocytic signaling that promote pathogenic amyloidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2288411222,"Complex cognitive processes require sophisticated local processing but also interactions between distant brain regions. It is therefore critical to be able to study distant interactions between local computations and the neural representations they act on. Here we report two anatomically and computationally distinct learning signals in lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and the dopaminergic ventral midbrain (VM) that predict trial-by-trial changes to a basic internal model in hippocampus. To measure local computations during learning and their interaction with neural representations, we coupled computational fMRI with trial-by-trial fMRI suppression. We find that suppression in a medial temporal lobe network changes trial-by-trial in proportion to stimulus-outcome associations. During interleaved choice trials, we identify learning signals that relate to outcome type in lOFC and to reward value in VM. These intervening choice feedback signals predicted the subsequent change to hippocampal suppression, suggesting a convergence of signals that update the flexible representation of stimulus-outcome associations."
https://openalex.org/W2288957736,"Somatic mutation in neurons is linked to neurologic disease and implicated in cell-type diversification. However, the origin, extent, and patterns of genomic mutation in neurons remain unknown. We established a nuclear transfer method to clonally amplify the genomes of neurons from adult mice for whole-genome sequencing. Comprehensive mutation detection and independent validation revealed that individual neurons harbor ∼100 unique mutations from all classes but lack recurrent rearrangements. Most neurons contain at least one gene-disrupting mutation and rare (0–2) mobile element insertions. The frequency and gene bias of neuronal mutations differ from other lineages, potentially due to novel mechanisms governing postmitotic mutation. Fertile mice were cloned from several neurons, establishing the compatibility of mutated adult neuronal genomes with reprogramming to pluripotency and development."

Functional genomics is increasingly being applied to the study of the CNS and neurodegenerative disease (Parikshak et al., 2015Parikshak N.N. Gandal M.J. Geschwind D.H. Systems biology and gene networks in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 441-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Such studies provide inroads into defining the molecular settings of different regions and across different cell types within the CNS. Yet delineation of disease transcriptional signatures, i.e., elucidating which alterations in gene expression contribute to a disease process, remains a challenge. Distinguishing changes in expression that drive disease progression from those that are a result of disease, as well as identifying protective pathways whose activation mitigate disease, are critical for revealing potential therapeutic targets. Among inherited neurodegenerative diseases are those caused by expansion of a CAG nucleotide repeat encoding a stretch of glutamines in the protein, the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. The polyQ neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a lethal, progressive, autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG expansion in the Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) gene (Orr et al., 1993Orr H.T. Chung M.Y. Banfi S. Kwiatkowski Jr., T.J. Servadio A. Beaudet A.L. McCall A.E. Duvick L.A. Ranum L.P. Zoghbi H.Y. Expansion of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). SCA1 patients typically display loss of coordination of the limbs and trunk, unstable gait, dysarthria, and nystagmus (Klockgether, 2011Klockgether T. Update on degenerative ataxias.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2011; 24: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A prominent and consistent SCA1 pathological feature is the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) (Koeppen, 2005Koeppen A.H. The pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia.Cerebellum. 2005; 4: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Several conserved sequence motifs in the ATXN1 protein, as well as cellular molecules that interact with ATXN1, indicate that ATXN1 functions in the nucleus as a regulator of transcription and RNA processing. One such motif is the ATXN1/HBP1 (AXH) domain, residues 567–689 that fold into an OB-fold, forming putative RNA-binding and protein-protein interaction surfaces (Yue et al., 2001Yue S. Serra H.G.

Toward the C terminus from the AXH domain is another stretch of highly conserved overlapping sequence motifs in ATXN1. Among these are a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at amino acids 771–774, the function of which is required for pathogenesis (Klement et al., 1998Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H.

Neurochem. 2009; 110: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and perhaps by decreasing the interaction of ATXN1 with RBM17, a splicing factor (Lim et al., 2008Lim J. Crespo-Barreto J.

While the extent to which an Asp at position 776 mimics phosphorylation is unclear (de Chiara et al., 2009de Chiara C. Menon R.P. Strom M. Gibson T.J. Pastore A. Phosphorylation of S776 and 14-3-3 binding modulate ataxin-1 interaction with splicing factors.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8372Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), placing an Asp at this position enhances ATXN1/RBM17 interaction and PC pathogenesis of ATXN1[82Q] and transforms wild-type ATXN1[30Q] into a pathogenic protein (Lim et al., 2008Lim J.

While mice expressing ATXN1[30Q]-D776 manifest severe ataxia from an early age, i.e., as severe as ATXN1[82Q] animals, disease in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 does not have progressive cerebellar pathology culminating with PC death as seen in ATXN1[82Q] mice. Thus, these mouse models provide a means by which to identify pathways associated with a crucial aspect of SCA1, the progressive loss of PCs from the cerebellar cortex. To elucidate the role alterations in gene expression have in disease progression, we obtained longitudinal RNA sequence (RNA-seq) datasets on poly(A)+ RNA from cerebella of Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] and Pcp2-ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice at three ages representing early, moderate, and late stages of disease. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis revealed one PC-enriched gene module, the Magenta Module, for which an age-dependent downregulation of its eigengene associated with disease in ATXN1[82Q] mice. In addition, we found that expression of the cholecystokinin (Cck) gene was highly upregulated in ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebellar RNA. Moreover, loss of Cck function in ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice enabled manifestation of progressive PC pathology, indicating that elevated Cck expression in ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice is protective against progressive disease. To identify cellular pathways contributing to SCA1-like disease in the cerebellum of ATXN1 transgenic mice, we used RNA-seq to profile expression. Mice utilized had ATXN1 transgene expression directed specifically to PCs using an 850 bp portion of the 5′ upstream region from the Pcp2/L7 gene (Vandaele et al., 1991Vandaele S. Nordquist D.T.

Like ATXN1[82Q] mice, ATXN1[30Q]D776 animals develop severe ataxia from an early age. However, in contrast to the progressive Purkinje cell pathology displayed by ATXN1[82Q] mice, pathology in ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice fails to progress beyond that typical of a mid-stage in ATXN1[82Q] animals. ATXN1[30Q]D776 PC pathology does not advance to cell death. RNA-seq was performed on cerebellar RNA isolated from ATXN1 transgenic and wild-type/FVB/NJ (WT) animals at 5, 12, and 28 weeks of age; ages corresponding to mild, moderate, and severe ataxia, respectively, in ATXN1[82Q] mice but prior to onset of Purkinje cell death (Clark et al., 1997Clark H.B.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7385-7395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of ATXN1[30Q] mice, cerebellar RNA was isolated from 5-week-old animals. Cerebellar RNA samples had RINs ranging from 7.9–9.3 with an average RIN of 8.7 (Table S1). Using three biological replicates/genotype, a total of 1.5 billion paired-end reads were generated with a minimum of 27.5 million reads/genotype at each age. Following data quality control and prepping, the samples were mapped to the UCSC mm10 mouse annotated genome. Between 70%–90% read pairs were correctly mapped, with most samples having a greater than 80% mapping efficiency. As a first step in analysis of the ATXN1 mouse cerebellar RNA-seq data, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 1A). This analysis showed that data tended to cluster into three broad groups correlating with disease status. One large cluster included all samples from 5-week-old ATXN1 transgenic animals (ATXN1[30Q], ATXN1[30Q]D776, and ATXN1[82Q] mice) and WT cerebellar samples at all ages, i.e., samples from all unaffected and mildly affected animals. A second cluster consisted of 12-week samples from moderately affected mice, ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776. The third cluster included samples from severely ataxic 28 week ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice. PCA analysis failed to distinguish changes in gene expression in ATXN1[82Q] mice having a disease with progressive pathology from ATXN1[30Q]D776 animals where disease lacked progressive Purkinje cell pathology (Duvick et al., 2010Duvick L.

We next evaluated RNA-seq data in pairwise comparisons using CuffDiff2 (Trapnell et al., 2012Trapnell C. Roberts A. Goff L. Pertea G. Kim D. Kelley D.R. Pimentel H. Salzberg S.L. Rinn J.L. Pachter L.

Upon comparing ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebellar gene expression data with WT at 5, 12, and 28 weeks of age, similar to previous results (Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010Crespo-Barreto J.

Genet. 2004; 13: 2535-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the majority of ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 significant differences were genes downregulated in comparison to WT (Figure S1A). This was particularly the case for the ATXN1[82Q] versus WT comparisons at 5 and 12 weeks of age. While the absolute number of significant changes in gene expression increased with age in ATXN1[82Q] versus WT mice, the peak absolute number of ATXN1[30Q]D776 expression changes was found in 12-week-old cerebella that decreased considerably in 28-week-old ATXN1[30Q]D776 samples. To assess changes in expression within each genotype as mice aged, we compared expression changes within ATXN1[82Q], ATXN1[30Q]D776, and WT cerebella between 5 and 12, and 28 weeks of age (Figure S1B). Both ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 samples showed a greater number of genes whose expression changed across the three ages than was seen in WT samples. In ATXN1[82Q] mice between 5 and 12 weeks, the number of genes downregulated far out-numbered genes upregulated in expression. This pattern reversed between 12 and 28 weeks in ATXN1[82Q] mice, where an increase in the total number of genes with expression changes led to more genes being upregulated than downregulated. The pattern of gene expression change in ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice between 5 and 12 weeks of age was very similar to that seen in ATXN1[82Q] mice both in terms of the number of genes whose expression changed and with downregulated genes out numbering upregulated genes. In contrast to the gene expression pattern in ATXN1[82Q] cerebella between 12 and 28 weeks, in ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice the overall number of genes whose expression changed was decreased. This was largely due to a dramatic reduction in the number of genes with a downregulated pattern of expression between 12 and 28 weeks. Thus, the overall similarity in the pattern of gene expression changes in the ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice in the 5–12 week age span is consistent with the finding that both ATXN1 mice develop severe ataxia and initial signs of Purkinje cell atrophy during this period. On the other hand, absence of a decrease in downregulated genes between 12 and 28 weeks in ATXN1[30Q]D776 compared to ATXN1[82Q] cerebella correlates with an absence of a progressive PC pathology in ATXN1[30Q]D776. To gain insight into cerebellar transcriptome organization from the ATXN1 mice, we applied Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to RNA-seq data from ATXN1[82Q], ATXN1[30Q], and WT mice at 5, 12, and 28 weeks (Zhang and Horvath, 2005Zhang B. Horvath S. A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2005; 4: e17Crossref Scopus (3342) Google Scholar, Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10265) Google Scholar). This allowed identification of gene sets whose expression significantly correlated with one another across the three ages. Nineteen modules were detected with two, Magenta and Lt Yellow, being highly significantly associated with ataxia (t test, adjusted p values of 8e-09 and 1e-06, respectively) (Figure 1B and Tables S2 and S3). As a means of identifying key genes and pathways in the two ataxia-associated WGCNA modules, we generated connectivity diagrams depicting genes with the highest connectivity (hubs) within each network. For the Magenta Module, all hub genes were downregulated in ATXN1[82] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebella relative to WT. Of the ten most connected hub genes (Figure 2A), all are highly expressed by PCs with nine being expressed exclusively by PCs (Figure S2). Moreover, eight of the most connected hubs encode proteins involved in signal transduction (Table S4). In contrast, Lt Yellow network hub genes included downregulated and upregulated genes (ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebella relative to WT) and included genes encoding proteins with a variety of functions (Figure 2B and below). To further query the ataxia associated WGCNA gene Modules for biological meaning, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA of the Magenta Module revealed ATXN1 to be the most significant (p value of 5.91e-08) upstream regulator of this module (Table S5), indicating that changes in Magenta Module gene expression are linked to ATXN1. IPA further showed that the most significant canonical pathways were all signaling pathways. The two most significant were synaptic long-term depression (p value 1.49e-05) and glutamate receptor signaling (p value 2.7e-04) (Table S2), both of which have previously been implicated in pathogenesis of SCA1 and other ataxias (Serra et al., 2004Serra H.G.

IPA of the ATXN1 mouse cerebellar Lt Yellow Module revealed canonical pathways and upstream regulators not previously implicated in SCA1 or other neurodegenerative diseases (Table S5). The most significant IPA pathway was the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway (p value of 1.45e-04). PCP signaling is a noncanonical pathway in which some members of the Wnt family activate a β-catenin-independent pathway well known for its role in the organization of cell sheets during development, particularly in Drosophila. However, it is becoming evident that PCP signaling also is a critical regulator of neural functions, including axonal guidance, dendrite maturation, stem cell development, and neuron survival (Tissir and Goffinet, 2013Tissir F. Goffinet A.M. Shaping the nervous system: role of the core planar cell polarity genes.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The most significant (p value of 1.123e-04) upstream regulator of the Lt Yellow Module identified by the IPA was the Jun-protooncogene-D transcription factor (JunD). A detailed assessment of the coexpression pattern of RNAs across the two disease-associated mouse SCA1 WGCNA cerebellar modules was summarized with a single representative expression profile, the eigengene (Figure 3). Consistent with earlier work showing that ATXN1 with an expanded polyQ tract largely mediates downregulation of genes (Lin et al., 2000Lin X. Antalffy B. Kang D. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Polyglutamine expansion down-regulates specific neuronal genes before pathologic changes in SCA1.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the Magenta eigengene was lower at all ages in the ATXN1 transgenic lines that develop ataxia, ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776, compared to WT cerebella (Figure 3A). Intriguingly, while the Magenta eigengene remained constant with age in WT and ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebella, in ATXN1[82Q] cerebella the Magenta eigengene decreased substantially from 5 to 12 weeks of age and remained low in 28-week-old ATXN1[82Q] cerebella. Thus, the cerebellar Magenta Module eigengene correlated with a key phenotype difference between ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 mice—the progressive nature of disease in ATXN1[82Q] mice. Moreover, the failure of the Magenta eigengene to decrease with age in ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebellar RNA supports the conclusion that changes in gene expression within this module reflect a progressive disease phenotype. In contrast to the Magenta Module, the Lt Yellow Module eigengene was somewhat higher in ATXN1[82Q] and ATXN1[30Q]D776 cerebellar RNA compared to age matched WT samples (Figure 3B). Moreover, the Lt Yellow eigengene increased with age in ATXN1[82Q] cerebellar RNA and remained essentially constant in ATXN1[30Q]D776 and WT samples. Thus, while the cerebellar Lt Yellow Module eigengene correlated with disease progression in ATXN1[82Q] mice, its change with age in ATXN1[82Q] increased rather than decreased as seen in the Magenta Module, suggesting that the underlying biology encoded by these two disease-associated modules differs. Several lines of evidence indicate that the Magenta Module is enriched for genes preferentially expressed by PCs, while the Lt Yellow Module has a more substantial representation of genes expressed by multiple cerebellar cell types (Table 1). First, the Magenta Module showed highly significant overlap (p value of 4.5e-16) with the cerebellar M6D WGCNA module identified from human brain microarray data (Oldham et al., 2008Oldham M.C. Konopka G. Iwamoto K. Langfelder P. Kato T. Horvath S. Geschwind D.H. Functional organization of the transcriptome in human brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Oldham et al. found that M6D is comprised largely of genes differentially expressed by PCs relative to other cerebellar cell types. Of the ten strongest members of M6D, four genes overlapped with the Magenta Module—including Calb1 (the strongest member of M6D), Itpr1, Plxdc1, and Pcp4. In total, 19 genes overlapped between the human cerebellar M6D network and the mouse Magenta Module (Table 1). Of the 342 genes in the mouse ATXN1 cerebellar Magenta Module, 94 (Table 1) were among RNAs whose translation is enhanced in PCs (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D. Heiman M. Schmidt E.F.

https://openalex.org/W2293614498,"Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the predominant risk factor for glaucoma, and reducing IOP is the only successful strategy to prevent further glaucomatous vision loss. IOP is determined by the balance between the rates of aqueous humour secretion and outflow, and a pathological reduction in the hydraulic conductance of outflow, known as outflow facility, is responsible for IOP elevation in glaucoma. Mouse models are often used to investigate the mechanisms controlling outflow facility, but the diminutive size of the mouse eye makes measurement of outflow technically challenging. In this study, we present a new approach to measure and analyse outflow facility using iPerfusion™, which incorporates an actuated pressure reservoir, thermal flow sensor, differential pressure measurement and an automated computerised interface. In enucleated eyes from C57BL/6J mice, the flow-pressure relationship is highly non-linear and is well represented by an empirical power law model that describes the pressure dependence of outflow facility. At zero pressure, the measured flow is indistinguishable from zero, confirming the absence of any significant pressure independent flow in enucleated eyes. Comparison with the commonly used 2-parameter linear outflow model reveals that inappropriate application of a linear fit to a non-linear flow-pressure relationship introduces considerable errors in the estimation of outflow facility and leads to the false impression of pressure-independent outflow. Data from a population of enucleated eyes from C57BL/6J mice show that outflow facility is best described by a lognormal distribution, with 6-fold variability between individuals, but with relatively tight correlation of facility between fellow eyes. iPerfusion represents a platform technology to accurately and robustly characterise the flow-pressure relationship in enucleated mouse eyes for the purpose of glaucoma research and with minor modifications, may be applied in vivo to mice, as well as to eyes from other species or different biofluidic systems."

Objectives To assess the relationship between health literacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and to investigate the role of sociodemographic and clinical variables as possible confounders. Methods Cross-sectional study of patients with IHD recruited from a stratified sample of general practices in two Australian states (Queensland and South Australia) between 2007 and 2009. Health literacy was measured using a validated questionnaire and classified as inadequate, marginal, or adequate. Physical and mental components of HRQoL were assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF12) questionnaire. Analyses were adjusted for confounders (sociodemographic variables, clinical history of IHD, number of CVD comorbidities, and CVD risk factors) using multiple linear regression. Results A total sample of 587 patients with IHD (mean age 72.0±8.4 years) was evaluated: 76.8% males, 84.2% retired or pensioner, and 51.4% with up to secondary educational level. Health literacy showed a mean of 39.6±6.7 points, with 14.3% (95%CI 11.8–17.3) classified as inadequate. Scores of the physical component of HRQoL were 39.6 (95%CI 37.1–42.1), 42.1 (95%CI 40.8–43.3) and 44.8 (95%CI 43.3–46.2) for inadequate, marginal, and adequate health literacy, respectively (p-value for trend = 0.001). This association persisted after adjustment for confounders. Health literacy was not associated with the mental component of HRQoL (p-value = 0.482). Advanced age, lower educational level, disadvantaged socioeconomic position, and a larger number of CVD comorbidities adversely affected both, health literacy and HRQoL. Conclusion Inadequate health literacy is a contributing factor to poor physical functioning in patients with IHD. Increasing health literacy may improve HRQoL and reduce the impact of IHD among patients with this chronic CVD."

Remarkably, MFSD2A is the first identified major facilitator superfamily member that uniquely transports lipids, implying that MFSD2A harbors unique structural features and transport mechanism. Here, we present three three-dimensional structural models of human MFSD2A derived by homology modeling using MelB- and LacY-based crystal structures and refined by biochemical analysis. All models revealed 12 transmembrane helices and connecting loops and represented the partially outward-open, outward-partially occluded, and inward-open states of the transport cycle. In addition to a conserved sodium-binding site, three unique structural features were identified as follows: a phosphate headgroup binding site, a hydrophobic cleft to accommodate a hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail, and three sets of ionic locks that stabilize the outward-open conformation. Ligand docking studies and biochemical assays identified Lys-436 as a key residue for transport. It is seen forming a salt bridge with the negative charge on the phosphate headgroup. Importantly, MFSD2A transported structurally related acylcarnitines but not a lysolipid without a negative charge, demonstrating the necessity of a negatively charged headgroup interaction with Lys-436 for transport.

NusG/Spt5 is the only elongation factor conserved in all domains of life. Although much information exists about the interactions between NusG/Spt5 and RNA polymerase in prokaryotes, little is known about how the binding of eukaryotic Spt4/5 affects the biochemical activities of RNAPII. We characterized the activities of Spt4/5 and interrogated the structural features of Spt5 required for it to interact with elongation complexes, bind nucleic acids, and promote transcription elongation. The eukaryotic specific regions of Spt5 containing the Kyrpides, Ouzounis, Woese domains are involved in stabilizing the association with the RNAPII elongation complex, which also requires the presence of the nascent transcript. Interestingly, we identify a region within the conserved NusG N-terminal (NGN) domain of Spt5 that contacts the non-template strand of DNA both upstream of RNAPII and in the transcription bubble. Mutating charged residues in this region of Spt5 did not prevent Spt4/5 binding to elongation complexes, but abrogated the cross-linking of Spt5 to DNA and the anti-arrest properties of Spt4/5, thus suggesting that contact between Spt5 (NGN) and DNA is required for Spt4/5 to promote elongation. We propose that the mechanism of how Spt5/NGN promotes elongation is fundamentally conserved; however, the eukaryotic specific regions of the protein evolved so that it can serve as a platform for other elongation factors and maintain its association with RNAPII as it navigates genomes packaged into chromatin.

Although this method of pausing is not known to exist in eukaryotes, x-ray crystal structures of yeast RNAPII in different stages of elongation have generated a model in which the movement of the bridge helix and trigger loop can be coupled to translocation through the non-template strand of DNA (18.Barnes C.O.

This information implies that the nucleic acid scaffold is critical in maintaining active RNAP during elongation. Using a combination of crystal structures, cryo-EM, and model building of archaeal Spt4/5 bound to RNAP, it has been proposed that Spt4/5 closes the “crab claw”-like clamp of RNAP (8.Klein B.J.

Much of what we know about the biochemical activities of eukaryotic Spt4/5 arose from its identification as the DRB-sensitive inducing factor (DSIF) in HeLa cell extracts and was later found to be required to stably pause RNAPII in promoter proximal regions (9.Wada T.

In this latter case, DSIF acts as a negative elongation factor working with the negative elongation factor (22.Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. NELF, a multisubunit complex containing RD, cooperates with DSIF to repress RNA polymerase II elongation.Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Conversion to a positive elongation factor requires the phosphorylation of Spt5 by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (23.Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. Evidence that P-TEFb alleviates the negative effect of DSIF on RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in vitro.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Human Spt5 suppresses the arrest of RNAPII at poly(A) tracts (24.Bourgeois C.F. Kim Y.K. Churcher M.J. West M.J. Karn J. Spt5 cooperates with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat by preventing premature RNA release at terminator sequences.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the zebrafish version of Spt5 stimulated transcription elongation in extracts (25.Guo S. Yamaguchi Y. Schilbach S. Wada T. Lee J. Goddard A. French D. Handa H. Rosenthal A. A regulator of transcriptional elongation controls vertebrate neuronal development.Nature. 2000; 408: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In these two examples, eukaryotic Spt4/5 has been shown to function in a positive manner to support transcription elongation. Because the ability to induce promoter proximal pausing is unique to higher eukaryotes, much of the focus to understand DSIF function has been carried out in metazoans using depleted extracts or crude fractions. What is lacking is a highly defined biochemical reconstitution system to study eukaryotic Spt4/5 that can provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of how it affects RNAPII activity and promotes elongation. Studying yeast Spt4/5 provides an opportunity to understand the positive effect of Spt4/5 on transcription elongation, as yeast lacks promoter proximal pausing. Furthermore, genetic assays indicate that Spt4/5 functions in a purely positive function (3.Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A.

However, the association between fly and human DSIF and RNAPII is facilitated by the emergence of the nascent transcript (28.Missra A. Gilmour D.S. Interactions between DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor), NELF (negative elongation factor), and the Drosophila RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Eukaryotic Spt5 contains an extended C terminus containing five Kyrpides, Ouzounis, Woese (KOW) domains that theoretically can reach anywhere on the surface of RNAPII. KOW domains are generally part of larger Tudor domains that are known to interact with nucleic acids (30.Lasko P. Tudor domain.Curr.

In fact, a crystal structure of an isolated KOW1-linker (K1L1) fragment of Spt5 and biochemical analysis using isolated K1L1 provided evidence that it binds to nucleic acids (32.Meyer P.A. Li S. Zhang M. Yamada K. Takagi Y. Hartzog G.A. Fu J. Structures and functions of the multiple KOW domains of transcription elongation factor Spt5.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 3354-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo cross-linking data conducted on yeast Spt5 revealed that KOW domains 4 and 5 interact with surfaces on RNAPII, including the Rpb4/7 sub-module. Although more information is being gained on the functions of these KOW domains, how they affect RNAPII binding and activity is not clear. Eukaryotic Spt5 also contains an extended intrinsically disordered modifiable C-terminal region (CTR) that has been shown to be phosphorylated during transcription, which in turn recruits elongation and RNA-processing factors (4.Ding B.

Pol II CTD kinases Bur1 and Kin28 promote Spt5 CTR-independent recruitment of Paf1 complex.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3494-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the elongation activity associated with Spt5 may have been delegated to other elongation factors during the course of evolution. The CTR of Spt5 does not contribute to the essential function of the protein because a CTR-less mutant of Spt5 is viable and displays minor phenotypes (36.Liu Y. Warfield L. Zhang C. Luo J. Allen J. Lang W.H. Ranish J. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor Spt5 by yeast Bur1 kinase stimulates recruitment of the PAF complex.Mol. Cell.

Pol II CTD kinases Bur1 and Kin28 promote Spt5 CTR-independent recruitment of Paf1 complex.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3494-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); however, systematic deletion of KOW domains and the linker regions of Spt5 in yeast are lethal and result in reduced affinity for both RNAPI and RNAPII (38.Viktorovskaya O.V. Appling F.D. Schneider D.A. Yeast transcription elongation factor Spt5 associates with RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II directly.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18825-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Spt4/5 likely associates with several regions of RNAPII and nucleic acids in the elongation complex. The consequences of these interactions with polymerase are not well understood. We show that the emerging RNA transcript is critical for the binding of yeast Spt4/5 to the elongation complex. Additionally, eukaryotic specific regions of Spt5 are required for stable binding to RNAPII elongation complexes. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that interaction of the NGN domain of Spt5 with the non-template strand of DNA in the elongation complex is required for Spt4/5 to promote elongation. Together, these findings suggest a eukaryotic specific mode of binding to polymerase but a universally conserved mechanism of action to promote elongation. It also suggests an elongation promoting activity for Spt4/5 different from its ability to encircle the DNA and retain RNAP on DNA. The coding sequences of SPT4 and SPT5 were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with primers that introduced BamHI and BsrGI or BamHI and NgoMIV sites into the ends, respectively. The products were then ligated into the shuttle vectors pST50-N-term-Strep tag (39.Tan S. Kern R.C. Selleck W. The pST44 polycistronic expression system for producing protein complexes in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 40: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and pST66-C-terminal His6 tag. The expression modules were then excised using unique restriction sites and ligated into the pST69 co-expression plasmid (a kind gift from Song Tan). Details are available upon request. The SPT5-HA3 sequence was amplified by PCR from pHQ1494 (a kind gift from Allen Hinnebusch) and then inserted into pRS313 plasmids using the In-fusion cloning method (Clontech). Mutations were constructed using the In-fusion mutagenesis procedure. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Homologous recombination was used to fuse the FRB sequences in-frame with the endogenous SPT5 coding sequence in the anchor-away strain Y40343 (Euroscarf) as described previously (40.Longtine M.S.

The strain, JR1734, genotype is MATα tor1-1 fpr1::NAT RPL13A-2xFKBP12::TRP1 SPT5xFRB::KANMX.

For preparing extracts for Western blotting, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7–0.8; rapamycin was added to 1 μg/ml, and after 1.5 h the cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared using the trichloroacetic acid method (41.Cox J.S.

Whole cell extract was then run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with anti-HA (Pierce) or anti-H2B (Active Motif) antibodies. Signals were detected using chemiluminescence detected on x-ray film. BL21 codon plus cells transformed with a plasmid co-expressing Strep-Spt4 and Spt5-His6 were grown to an OD of 0.4. Spt4/5 was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.3 mm ZnSO4 overnight at 18 °C. Cells were then harvested, washed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 0.010 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol), lysed by adding lysozyme, and sonicated. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and incubated in Talon resin (Clontech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Resin was washed with lysis buffer and then eluted in lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The peak fractions were pooled and diluted to 200 mm salt in heparin buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol). Protein was purified on heparin-agarose using step elution fractions of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted to 100 mm NaCl and then passed over a Q-Sepharose column.

https://openalex.org/W2290921468,"Invadopodia and filopodia are dynamic, actin-based protrusions contributing to cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The force of actin bundles is essential for their protrusive activity. The bundling protein fascin is known to play a role in both invadopodia and filopodia. As it is more and more acknowledged that functionally related proteins cooperate, it is unlikely that only fascin bundles actin in these protrusions. Another interesting candidate is L-plastin, normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, but considered a common marker of many cancer types. We identified L-plastin as a new component of invadopodia, where it contributes to degradation and invasiveness. By means of specific, high-affinity nanobodies inhibiting bundling of fascin or L-plastin, we further unraveled their cooperative mode of action. We show that the bundlers cannot compensate for each other due to strikingly different bundling characteristics: L-plastin bundles are much thinner and less tightly packed. Composite bundles adopt an intermediate phenotype, with fascin delivering the rigidity and strength for protrusive force and structural stability, whereas L-plastin accounts for the flexibility needed for elongation. Consistent with this, elevated L-plastin expression promotes elongation and reduces protrusion density in cells with relatively lower L-plastin than fascin levels."

Inhibition of cell proliferation by C-150 was mediated by affecting multiple targets as confirmed at transcription and protein level. C-150 effectively reduced the transcription activation of NFkB, inhibited PKC-alpha which are constitutively over-expressed in glioblastoma. The effects of C-150 on the Akt/ Notch signaling were also demonstrated in a Drosophila tumorigenesis model. C-150 reduced the number of tumors in Drosophila with similar efficacy to mitoxantrone. In an in vivo orthotopic glioma model, C-150 significantly increased the median survival of treated nude rats compared to control animals. The multi-target action of C-150, and its preliminary in vivo efficacy would render this curcumin analogue as a potent clinical candidate against glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2291917664,"Soil salinization is one of the major problems in global agricultural production. Cotton is a pioneer crop with regard to salt stress tolerance, and can be used for saline-alkali land improvement. The large-scale detection of salt tolerance traits in cotton accessions, and the identification of elite quantitative trait loci (QTLs)/genes for salt-tolerance have been very important in salt tolerance breeding. Here, 43 advanced salt-tolerant and 31 highly salt-sensitive cultivars were detected by analyzing ten salt tolerance related traits in 304 upland cotton cultivars. Among them, 11 advanced salt-tolerance and eight highly salt-sensitive cultivars were consistent with previously reported results. Association analysis of ten salt-tolerance related traits and 145 SSRs was performed, and a total of 95 significant associations were detected; 17, 41, and 37 of which were associated with germinative index, seedling stage physiological index, and four seedling stage biochemical indexes, respectively. Of these associations, 20 SSR loci were simultaneously associated with two or more traits. Furthermore, we detected 117 elite alleles associated with salt-tolerance traits, 4 of which were reported previously. Among these loci, 44 (37.60%) were rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5%, 6 only existed in advanced salt-tolerant cultivars, and 2 only in highly salt-sensitive cultivars. As a result, 13 advanced salt-tolerant cultivars were selected to assemble the optimal cross combinations by computer simulation for the development of salt-tolerant accessions. This study lays solid foundations for further improvements in cotton salt-tolerance by referencing elite germplasms, alleles associated with salt-tolerance traits, and optimal crosses."
https://openalex.org/W2296051588,"The role and responses of the dimeric DJ-1 protein to cardiac oxidative stress is incompletely understood. H2O2 induces a 50-kDa DJ-1 interprotein homodimer disulfide, known to form between Cys-53 on each subunit. A trimeric 75-kDa DJ-1 complex that mass spectrometry shows contained 2-Cys peroxiredoxin also formed and precedes the appearance of the disulfide dimer. These observations may represent peroxiredoxin sensing and transducing the oxidant signal to DJ-1. The dimeric disulfide DJ-1 complex was stabilized by auranofin, suggesting that thioredoxin recycles it in cells. Higher concentrations of H2O2 concomitantly induce DJ-1 Cys-106 hyperoxidation (sulfination or sulfonation) in myocytes, perfused heart, or HEK cells. An oxidation-resistant C53A DJ-1 shows potentiated H2O2-induced Cys-106 hyperoxidation. DJ-1 also forms multiple disulfides with unknown target proteins during H2O2 treatment, the formation of which is also potentiated in cells expressing the C53A mutant. This suggests that the intersubunit disulfide induces a conformational change that limits Cys-106 forming heterodisulfide protein complexes or from hyperoxidizing. High concentrations of H2O2 also induce cell death, with DJ-1 Cys-106 sulfonation appearing causal in these events, as expressionof C53A DJ-1 enhanced both Cys-106 sulfonation and cell death. Nonetheless, expression of the DJ-1 C106A mutant, which fully prevents hyperoxidation, also showed exacerbated cell death responses to H2O2 A rational explanation for these findings is that DJ-1 Cys-106 forms disulfides with target proteins to limit oxidant-induced cell death. However, when Cys-106 is hyperoxidized, formation of these potentially protective heterodimeric disulfide complexes is limited, and so cell death is exacerbated."

The proposed algorithm finds the QRS complex based on the dual criteria of the amplitude and duration of QRS complex. It consists of simple operations, such as a finite impulse response filter, differentiation or thresholding without complex and computational operations like a wavelet transformation. The QRS detection performance is evaluated by using both an MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and an AHA ECG database (a total of 435,700 beats). The sensitivity (SE) and positive predictivity value (PPV) were 99.85% and 99.86%, respectively. According to the database, the SE and PPV were 99.90% and 99.91% in the MIT-BIH database and 99.84% and 99.84% in the AHA database, respectively. The result of the noisy environment test using record 119 from the MIT-BIH database indicated that the proposed method was scarcely affected by noise above 5 dB SNR (SE = 100%, PPV > 98%) without the need for an additional de-noising or back searching process."

Implications of the sodium glucose cotransporter SGLT1 in either pumping water or passively channeling water contrast with its reported water transporting capacity, which lags behind that of aquaporin-1 by 3 orders of magnitude. Here we overexpressed SGLT1 in MDCK cell monolayers and reconstituted the purified transporter into proteoliposomes. We observed the rate of osmotic proteoliposome deflation by light scattering. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy served to assess (i) SGLT1 abundance in both vesicles and plasma membranes and (ii) flow-mediated dilution of an aqueous dye adjacent to the cell monolayer. Calculation of the unitary water channel permeability, pf, yielded similar values for cell and proteoliposome experiments. Neither the absence of glucose or Na(+), nor the lack of membrane voltage in vesicles, nor the directionality of water flow grossly altered pf Such weak dependence on protein conformation indicates that a water-impermeable occluded state (glucose and Na(+) in their binding pockets) lasts for only a minor fraction of the transport cycle or, alternatively, that occlusion of the substrate does not render the transporter water-impermeable as was suggested by computational studies of the bacterial homologue vSGLT. Although the similarity between the pf values of SGLT1 and aquaporin-1 makes a transcellular pathway plausible, it renders water pumping physiologically negligible because the passive flux would be orders of magnitude larger."
https://openalex.org/W2296252208,"Synovial sarcomas are aggressive soft-tissue malignancies that express chromosomal translocation-generated fusion genes, SS18-SSX1 or SS18-SSX2 in most cases. Here, we report a mouse sarcoma model expressing SS18-SSX1, complementing our prior model expressing SS18-SSX2. Exome sequencing identified no recurrent secondary mutations in tumors of either genotype. Most of the few mutations identified in single tumors were present in genes that were minimally or not expressed in any of the tumors. Chromosome 6, either entirely or around the fusion gene expression locus, demonstrated a copy number gain in a majority of tumors of both genotypes. Thus, by fusion oncogene coding sequence alone, SS18-SSX1 and SS18-SSX2 can each drive comparable synovial sarcomagenesis, independent from other genetic drivers. SS18-SSX1 and SS18-SSX2 tumor transcriptomes demonstrated very few consistent differences overall. In direct tumorigenesis comparisons, SS18-SSX2 was slightly more sarcomagenic than SS18-SSX1, but equivalent in its generation of biphasic histologic features. Meta-analysis of human synovial sarcoma patient series identified two tumor–gentoype–phenotype correlations that were not modeled by the mice, namely a scarcity of male hosts and biphasic histologic features among SS18-SSX2 tumors. Re-analysis of human SS18-SSX1 and SS18-SSX2 tumor transcriptomes demonstrated very few consistent differences, but highlighted increased native SSX2 expression in SS18-SSX1 tumors. This suggests that the translocated locus may drive genotype–phenotype differences more than the coding sequence of the fusion gene created. Two possible roles for native SSX2 in synovial sarcomagenesis are explored. Thus, even specific partial failures of mouse genetic modeling can be instructive to human tumor biology."

Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) is a disease associated with missense mutations in the motor domain of this myosin.

Using a recombinant expression system, we have studied homogeneous samples of human motors for the WT and three of the most common FSS mutants: R672H, R672C, and T178I. Our data suggest that the WT embryonic myosin motor is similar in contractile speed to the slow type I/β cardiac based on the rate constant for ADP release and ADP affinity for actin-myosin. All three FSS mutations show dramatic changes in kinetic properties, most notably the slowing of the apparent ATP hydrolysis step (reduced 5–9-fold), leading to a longer lived detached state and a slowed Vmax of the ATPase (2–35-fold), indicating a slower cycling time.

At 15 months, the individual had a higher level of MyHC-peri expression (>20% of all fibers) compared with that of eight “healthy” control samples (0–2% of all fibers) taken at a similar time of development (10–15 months). Samples taken from the same patient at 5 years showed a predominance of type-1/MyHC-β expression with small, scattered type-1 fibers. This suggests that there could be a compensatory effect or a developmental defect that causes MyHC-peri to be expressed later or longer in postnatal development. Tajsharghi et al. (15.Tajsharghi H. Kimber E. Kroksmark A.K. Jerre R. Tulinius M. Oldfors A. Embryonic myosin heavy-chain mutations cause distal arthrogyposis and developmental myosin myopathy that persists postnatally.Arch.

Functional studies on muscle fibers from healthy and FSS individuals with the R672C mutation showed that the mutant fibers had reduced force, prolonged relaxation time, and incomplete relaxation (13.Racca A.W. Beck A.E. McMillin M.J. Korte F.S. Bamshad M.J. Regnier M.

Genet. 2015; 24: 3348-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Embryonic myosin heavy chain is the most abundant during development, when muscles are being formed (6.Schiaffino S. Rossi A.C. Smerdu V. Leinwand L.A. Reggiani C. Developmental myosins: expression patterns and functional significance.Skelet. Muscle. 2015; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because distal muscles are more affected in FSS, it is interesting to note that distal muscles appear to be formed earlier during development than proximal muscles (17.Ontell M.P. Sopper M.M. Lyons G. Buckingham M. Ontell M. Modulation of contractile protein gene expression in fetal murine crural muscles: emergence of muscle diversity.Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They may therefore express embryonic myosin for a longer period of time than proximal muscles. To understand the pathogenesis of FSS, it is necessary to understand the nature of the defect in the mutant myosin motor proteins and how it might be corrected. Both residues involved, Thr178 and Arg672, are highly conserved in all myosin II molecules and located near the ATP binding site close to the P-loop, where the γ-phosphate of ATP binds (Fig. 1). Examination of homologous myosin motor domain structures (subfragment 1 or S1; Fig. 1A) shows that Thr178 is at the end of the fourth strand of the central seven-stranded β-sheet and close to the ATP binding site at the base of the P-loop (Fig. 1B) in a location that can influence ATP binding and hydrolysis. Arg672 is located on the third β-strand with the side chain buried, which interacts with the relay helix, SH1-SH2 domain, and the β-strands on either side, regions that go through major conformational changes during the myosin cross-bridge cycle (18.Preller M.

Structural and functional insights into the myosin motor mechanism.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Notably, the crystal structures show an interaction between Arg672 and Thr178 that may account for the similar phenotypes in the mutants. Due to the difficulty of isolating homogeneous myosin samples from human muscle and the limited ability to obtain samples from FSS patients, we utilized an established recombinant expression approach (20.Resnicow D.I.

To overcome this and standardize our infection, we used an A260 measurement at a 1:100 dilution and a conversion factor of 1 A260 = 1.1 × 1012 viral particles/ml (25.Bottinelli R. Reggiani C. Human skeletal muscle fibres: molecular and functional diversity.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 195-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26.Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. Evaluation of the concentration and bioactivity of adenovirus vectors for gene therapy.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, for an A260 of 0.1, we would infect a 100-mm dish with 10 μl of concentrated virus. When extrapolating to a four-layer cell factory, we took into account the surface areas of a 100-mm dish and a four-layer cell factory. Infected C2C12 cells were incubated for 5 days and frozen into a cell pellet. This was then homogenized in a low salt buffer and centrifuged, and the supernatants were purified by two procedures. For stopped flow, we used nickel affinity chromatography (HisTrap HP 1-ml column). Afterward, the S1 was dialyzed into the low salt stopped-flow buffer (25 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, Fig. 2). From between 1500 and 3000 cm3 of cultured C2C12 cells, we isolated 1–2 mg of purified MyHC with a concentration between 10 and 20 μm. A small amount of endogenous myosin persisted in the S1 sample purified for stopped flow. Using densitometry software (Scion Image) to analyze SDS-polyacrylamide gels, we calculated the contaminate myosin as <5% of the S1 by mass, or a 1:40 molar ratio of myosin/S1. It is possible that the myosin and S1 were bound to actin and so were co-purified. For ATPase measurements, the purification scheme was modified and extended. Nickel affinity chromatography was performed by gravity in a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac column packed with HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Eluates were dialyzed in a low salt/low imidazole buffer. The eluted material was subjected to anionic exchange chromatography (HiTrap HP 1-ml column) and desalted by another buffer exchange into the ATPase assay buffer (see the ATPase method). This gave a higher purity of S1 necessary for ATPase assays. As reported previously (20.Resnicow D.I. Deacon J.C. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Functional diversity among a family of human skeletal muscle myosin motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the recombinant S1 co-purifies with the endogenous mouse light chains (Fig. 2). Essential light chains MLC1A and MLC1F and regulatory light chain MLC2F appear to purify with the recombinant S1 because their bands are much denser than the essential light chain MLC3F and in the correct ratio to the heavy chain. They are the same light chains that have been found to associate with embryonic myosin in tissue (25.Bottinelli R. Reggiani C. Human skeletal muscle fibres: molecular and functional diversity.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 195-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The percentage identity between the human and mouse light chains is 90–95%. Rabbit skeletal actin was prepared as described previously (27.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Purification of muscle actin.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrene at Cys374 (28.Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. The use of actin labelled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide to study the interaction of actin with myosin subfragments and troponin/tropomyosin.Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For steady-state ATPase measurements, we modified the NADH-coupled assay as described (29.Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Modulation of actin affinity and actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase by charge changes in the myosin motor domain.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This assay system couples the ADP production to NADH oxidation to NAD+; therefore, absorbance was read at 340 nm. We used a 96-well format, and the assay buffer used in all experiments was 12 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT at pH 6.8 and 25 °C. Bovine cardiac actin was purified as described previously (27.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Purification of muscle actin.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) and used for ATPase measurements. Once thoroughly and rapidly mixed, the assays were read for 30 min in a Molecular Devices SpectraMax reader to monitor absorbance over time. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fit to the data to determine the maximal activity (Vmax) and the associated actin constant for myosin (Km) using GraphPad Prism. All kinetic experiments were conducted in 20 mm MOPS buffer with 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7, at 20 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Measurements were performed with a High-Tech Scientific SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow system. The concentrations stated are those after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell unless otherwise stated. All stopped-flow traces were analyzed in either software provided by TgK Scientific (Kinetic Studios) or Origin (Microcal). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured by excitation at 295 nm and observed through a WG320 filter. In the absence of actin, the kinetics of S1 and ATP or ADP were interpreted using the seven-step model described by Bagshaw et al. (30.Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. The reversibility of adenosine triphosphate cleavage by myosin.Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1), where the forward rate constants are k+i and the reverse rate constants are denoted k−i. Ki = k+i/k−i representing the equilibrium constant at the ith step in the reaction. In the ADP displacement from S1 assays, the two amplitudes are proportional to the concentration of S1 present as either free S1 or S1-ADP. ADP concentrations determine the amplitudes as follows. Aslow=AmaxADPK5+ADP+Amin(Eq. 1) Afast=AmaxK5ADP+K5+Amin(Eq. 2) When actin was present, the sample was excited at 365 nm, and emission of pyrene-labeled actin was detected after being passed through a KV399 cut-off filter. The binding of S1 to pyrene-labeled actin quenches the fluorescence; therefore, dissociation could be measured by an increase in fluorescence. The interactions between actin-S1 and ATP or ADP were analyzed based on the model in Scheme 2 (22.Bloemink M. Deacon J. Langer S. Vera C. Combs A. Leinwand L. Geeves M.A. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myosin mutation R453C alters ATP binding and hydrolysis of human cardiac β-myosin.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 5158-5167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Following a reversible binding of ATP to actomyosin, there is a rate-limiting isomerization (k′+2) of the complex, leading to rapid actomyosin dissociation. ADP and ATP compete for the nucleotide binding site on the S1, and ADP binding is governed by the dissociation constant K′5 (= k′+5/k′−5). A dissociation reaction can be measured when the pyrene-labeled actin is in a complex with S1 because the complex quenches the pyrene signal. ATP induces the dissociation of S1 from actin, resulting in an increase in fluorescence, allowing the reaction kinetics to be determined. Using Scheme 2, Equation 3 can be used to determine the constants K′1k′+2, k′+2, and 1/K′1. kobs=K1'k+2'ATP1+K1'ATP(Eq. 3) Equation 4 defines the kinetics when ATP and ADP are in rapid competition for binding to the actomyosin complex, and K′1 [ATP] < 1, such that the equation is linear with respect to [ATP]. kobs=K+1'k+2'ATP1+ADPK5'(Eq. 4) If, in the absence of ADP, kobs = k0, then normalizing Equation 4 can make different myosin isoform comparisons easier. krel=kobsk0=11+ADPK5'(Eq. 5) ADP release (k′+5) was determined by the kobs when the saturating ADP was incubated with actin-S1 and rapidly mixed with high concentrations of ATP. To determine the actin affinity, an S1 titration assay was performed as described by Kurzawa and Geeves (31.Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. A novel stopped-flow method for measuring the affinity of actin for myosin head freagment using microgram quantities of protein.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fixing the concentration of pyrene-labeled actin, the amplitude of the ATP-induced dissociating reaction provides an estimate of the fraction of actin bound to S1 at increasing S1 concentrations. The amplitude dependence of the S1 concentration was fitted to the physically significant root of the following quadratic equation. α=M+KD+A0-M+KD+A02-4MA02A0(Eq. 6) In all cases, the data in the figures refer to individual experimental measurements, whereas Table 1 gives mean values of the fitted constant for a minimum of three separate measurements using different protein preparations.TABLE 1Transient kinetic parameters measured for wild type β and embryonic, R672H, R672C, and T178I myosin S1 mutations* KCl concentration 0 mm.a Nag et al.

https://openalex.org/W2292826664,"Postsynaptic responses in many CNS neurons are typically small and variable, often making it difficult to distinguish physiologically relevant signals from background noise. To extract salient information, neurons are thought to integrate multiple synaptic inputs and/or selectively amplify specific synaptic activation patterns. Here, we present evidence for a third strategy: directionally selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) in the mouse retina multiplicatively scale visual signals via a mechanism that requires both nonlinear NMDA receptor (NMDAR) conductances in DSGC dendrites and directionally tuned inhibition provided by the upstream retinal circuitry. Postsynaptic multiplication enables DSGCs to discriminate visual motion more accurately in noisy visual conditions without compromising directional tuning. These findings demonstrate a novel role for NMDARs in synaptic processing and provide new insights into how synaptic and network features interact to accomplish physiologically relevant neural computations."

However, as a multisubunit, multispan, integral membrane protein, even wild type subunits of GABAA receptors fold and assemble inefficiently in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Unassembled and misfolded subunits undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD), but this degradation process remains poorly understood for GABAA receptors. Here, using the α1 subunits of GABAA receptors as a model substrate, we demonstrated that Grp94, a metazoan-specific Hsp90 in the ER lumen, uses its middle domain to interact with the α1 subunits and positively regulates their ERAD. OS-9, an ER-resident lectin, acts downstream of Grp94 to further recognize misfolded α1 subunits in a glycan-dependent manner. This delivers misfolded α1 subunits to the Hrd1-mediated ubiquitination and the valosin-containing protein-mediated extraction pathway. Repressing the initial ERAD recognition step by inhibiting Grp94 enhances the functional surface expression of misfolding-prone α1(A322D) subunits, which causes autosomal dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

https://openalex.org/W2292935807,"This study examines the validity of the assumption that international large-scale land acquisition (LSLA) is motivated by the desire to secure control over water resources, which is commonly referred to as 'water grabbing'. This assumption was repeatedly expressed in recent years, ascribing the said motivation to the Gulf States in particular. However, it must be considered of hypothetical nature, as the few global studies conducted so far focused primarily on the effects of LSLA on host countries or on trade in virtual water. In this study, we analyse the effects of 475 intended or concluded land deals recorded in the Land Matrix database on the water balance in both host and investor countries. We also examine how these effects relate to water stress and how they contribute to global trade in virtual water. The analysis shows that implementation of the LSLAs in our sample would result in global water savings based on virtual water trade. At the level of individual LSLA host countries, however, water use intensity would increase, particularly in 15 sub-Saharan states. From an investor country perspective, the analysis reveals that countries often suspected of using LSLA to relieve pressure on their domestic water resources--such as China, India, and all Gulf States except Saudi Arabia--invest in agricultural activities abroad that are less water-intensive compared to their average domestic crop production. Conversely, large investor countries such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Japan are disproportionately externalizing crop water consumption through their international land investments. Statistical analyses also show that host countries with abundant water resources are not per se favoured targets of LSLA. Indeed, further analysis reveals that land investments originating in water-stressed countries have only a weak tendency to target areas with a smaller water risk."

Free radicals are also known to have correlated with a variety of cognitive disorders (CDs) resulting in neuronal injury and eventually to death. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are such kind of killer CDs that occur due to dysfunction of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. Plant parts of Ginkgo biloba, Bacopa monnieri etc. are being used for the treatment of cognitive disorders in several countries. The present study was aimed to explore the detailed antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase activity of Acaciacatechu leaf (ACL) over CDs. Gas chromatography-Mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were employed to identify the bioactive components present in ACL. Furthermore, the extract was evaluated to check the cytotoxic effects of ACL on normal cells. Amongst several antioxidant assays, DPPH assay, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide radical and hypochlorous acid inhibitory activities were found to be greater in ACL than that of the respective standards while other assays exhibited a moderate or at per inhibitory activity with standards. Total phenolic and flavonoid content were also found to be present in decent amount. In addition, we found, a greater acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity of ACL when compared to other medicinally important plants, indicating its positive effect over CDs. Forty one bioactive components were explored through GC-MS. Of these, gallic acid, epicatechin, catechin, isoquercitrin etc. were found, which are potent antioxidant and a few of them have anti-neurodegenerative properties. Eventually, ACL was found to be nontoxic and safer to consume. Further studies with animal or human model however, would determine its efficacy as a potential anti-schizophrenic drug."
https://openalex.org/W2289311153,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is required for the maintenance of genome stability and protection of humans from several types of cancer. Human MMR occurs in the chromatin environment, but little is known about the interactions between MMR and the chromatin environment. Previous research has suggested that MMR coincides with replication-coupled assembly of the newly synthesized DNA into nucleosomes. The first step in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is CAF-1-dependent histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer deposition, a process that involves ASF1A-H3-H4 complex. In this work we used reconstituted human systems to investigate interactions between MMR and CAF-1- and ASF1A-H3-H4-dependent histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer deposition. We have found that MutSα inhibits CAF-1- and ASF1A-H3-H4-dependent packaging of a DNA mismatch into a tetrasome. This finding supports the idea that MMR occurs before the DNA mismatch is packaged into the tetrasome. Our experiments have also revealed that CAF-1- and ASF1A-H3-H4-dependent deposition of the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers does not interfere with MMR reactions. In addition, we have established that unnecessary degradation of the discontinuous strand that takes place in both DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ)- and DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ)-dependent MMR reactions is suppressed by CAF-1- and ASF1A-H3-H4-dependent deposition of the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers. These data suggest that CAF-1- and ASF1A-H3-H4-dependent deposition of the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers is compatible with MMR and protects the discontinuous daughter strand from unnecessary degradation by MMR machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2292949796,"Pluripotency is maintained in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and is induced from somatic cells by the activation of appropriate transcriptional regulatory networks. Krüppel-like factor gene family members, such as Klf2, Klf4 and Klf5, have important roles in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells as well as in cellular reprogramming, yet it is not known whether other Klf family members exert self-renewal and reprogramming functions when overexpressed. In this study, we examined whether overexpression of any representative Klf family member, such as Klf1–Klf10, would be sufficient for the self-renewal of mouse ES cells. We found that only Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5 produced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-independent self-renewal, although most KLF proteins, if not all, have the ability to occupy the regulatory regions of Nanog, a critical Klf target gene. We also examined whether overexpression of any of Klf1-Klf10 would be sufficient to convert epiblast stem cells into a naïve pluripotent state and found that Klf5 had such reprogramming ability, in addition to Klf2 and Klf4. We also delineated the functional domains of the Klf2 protein for LIF-independent self-renewal and reprogramming. Interestingly, we found that both the N-terminal transcriptional activation and C-terminal zinc finger domains were indispensable for this activity. Taken together, our comprehensive analysis provides new insight into the contribution of Klf family members to mouse ES self-renewal and cellular reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2289872273,"The PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway has been established as a core signaling pathway that is crucial for the integration of neurons into neuronal circuits and the maintenance of the architecture and function of neurons in the adult brain. Akt1–3 kinases are specifically activated by two phosphorylation events on residues Thr308 and Ser473 upon growth factor signaling, which subsequently phosphorylate a vast cohort of downstream targets. However, we still lack a clear understanding of the complexity and regulation of isoform specificity within the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway. We utilized a capillary-based isoelectric focusing method to study dynamics of Akt phosphorylation in neuronal cells and the developing brain and identify previously undescribed features of Akt phosphorylation and activation. First, we show that the accumulation of multiple phosphorylation events on Akt forms occur concurrently with Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation upon acute PI3K activation and provide evidence for uncoupling of Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation, as well as differential sensitivities of Akt1 forms upon PI3K inhibition. Second, we detect a transient shift in Akt isoform phosphorylation and activation pattern during early postnatal brain development, at stages corresponding to synapse development and maturation. Third, we show differential sensitivities of Ser473-Akt species to PTEN deletion in mature neurons, which suggests inherent differences in the Akt pools that are accessible to growth factors as compared with the pools that are controlled by PTEN. Our study demonstrates the presence of complex phosphorylation events of Akt in a time- and signal-dependent manner in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2294267545,"Aberrant T-cell factor (TCF) transcription is implicated in the majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs). TCF transcription induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting a tumor-initiating cell (TIC) phenotype characterized by increased proliferation, multidrug resistance (MDR), invasion and metastasis. The data presented herein characterize topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα) as a required component of TCF transcription promoting EMT. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and protein co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies, we show that TopoIIα forms protein-protein interactions with β-catentin and TCF4 and interacts with Wnt response elements (WREs) and promoters of direct target genes of TCF transcription, including: MYC, vimentin, AXIN2 and LEF1. Moreover, both TopoIIα and TCF4 ChIP with the N-cadherin promoter, which is a new discovery indicating that TCF transcription may directly regulate N-cadherin expression. TopoIIα N-terminal ATP-competitive inhibitors, exemplified by the marine alkaloid neoamphimedine (neo), block TCF activity in vitro and in vivo. Neo effectively inhibits TopoIIα and TCF4 from binding WREs/promoter sites, whereas protein-protein interactions remain intact. Neo inhibition of TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription also correlates with significant antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo, including the reversion of EMT, the loss of TIC-mediated clonogenic colony formation, and the loss of cell motility and invasion. Interestingly, non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα, etoposide and merbarone, were ineffective at preventing TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription. Thus, we propose that TopoIIα participation in TCF transcription may convey a mechanism of MDR to conventional TopoIIα inhibitors. However, our results indicate that TopoIIα N-terminal ATP-binding sites remain conserved and available for drug targeting. This article defines a new strategy for targeted inhibition of TCF transcription that may lead to effective therapies for the treatment of CRC and potentially other Wnt-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2288288966,"High soil salinity negatively influences plant growth and yield. Some taxa have evolved mechanisms for avoiding or tolerating elevated soil salinity, which can be modulated by the environment experienced by parents or offspring. We tested the contribution of the parental and offspring environments on salinity adaptation and their potential underlying mechanisms. In a two-generation greenhouse experiment, we factorially manipulated salinity concentrations for genotypes of Medicago truncatula that were originally collected from natural populations that differed in soil salinity. To compare population level adaptation to soil salinity and to test the potential mechanisms involved we measured two aspects of plant performance, reproduction and vegetative biomass, and phenological and physiological traits associated with salinity avoidance and tolerance. Saline-origin populations had greater biomass and reproduction under saline conditions than non-saline populations, consistent with local adaptation to saline soils. Additionally, parental environmental exposure to salt increased this difference in performance. In terms of environmental effects on mechanisms of salinity adaptation, parental exposure to salt spurred phenological differences that facilitated salt avoidance, while offspring exposure to salt resulted in traits associated with greater salt tolerance. Non-saline origin populations expressed traits associated with greater growth in the absence of salt while, for saline adapted populations, the ability to maintain greater performance in saline environments was also associated with lower growth potential in the absence of salt. Plastic responses induced by parental and offspring environments in phenology, leaf traits, and gas exchange contribute to salinity adaptation in M. truncatula. The ability of plants to tolerate environmental stress, such as high soil salinity, is likely modulated by a combination of parental effects and within-generation phenotypic plasticity, which are likely to vary in populations from contrasting environments."

GAS recruits FH to its cell surface via FH receptors, which are transcriptionally controlled by the two-component cluster of virulence responder-sensor system.

Using GAS strain AP53, which strongly binds host human plasminogen/plasmin (hPg/hPm) directly via an hPg/hPm surface receptor (PAM), we show that both FI-FH and hPm sequentially cleave C3b. Whereas FI-FH proteolytically cleaves C3b into iC3b, PAM-bound hPm catalyzes cleavage of iC3b into multiple smaller peptides. Unlike AP53, GAS strain M23ND weakly binds FH and recruits hPg/hPm to its cell surface indirectly via fibrinogen bound to M-protein, M23. In this case, FH-FI cleaves C3b into iC3b, with negligible degradation of iC3b by hPm that is bound to fibrinogen on the cells.

GAS can cause common illnesses, such as impetigo, pharyngitis, and scarlet fever, and can also cause life-threatening sequelae, such as necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (1.Carapetis J.R.

GAS remains a leading infectious cause of global mortality and morbidity. Of the estimated 700 million infections annually, 18 million prevalent cases are found to be severe, with nearly 2 million virulent new cases reported per year worldwide (3.Bisno A.L. Rubin F.A.

To establish infection, GAS must develop evolutionary strategies to evade initial host innate immune systems, especially complement-mediated elimination of the microbe. The complement system is primarily activated by three distinct pathways that are based on different recognition mechanisms: antigen-antibody complexes (classical pathway); host lectin binding to pathogen carbohydrate patterns (lectin pathway); and small amounts of spontaneously generated complement factor C3b, an opsonin, on microbial cell surfaces (alternative pathway) (6.Dunkelberger J.R. Song W.C. Complement and its role in innate and adaptive immune responses.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 34-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Finally, after a series of cleavage reactions, all three pathways culminate in the formation of an enzyme, C3 convertase, which cleaves the central component, C3, into C3b and C3a. C3b can then either participate in further formation of the C3 convertase, leading to the amplification of complement activation, or deposit on a variety of target surfaces, including pathogenic cells, via covalent thioester binding. This triggers complement-mediated opsonization by phagocytic cells, thus clearing the pathogen from the host (6.Dunkelberger J.R. Song W.C. Complement and its role in innate and adaptive immune responses.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 34-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 7.Kwinn L.A. Nizet V. How group A Streptococcus circumvents host phagocyte defenses.Fut. Microbiol. 2007; 2: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of the complement system can be harmful to the host cells (e.g. anaphylactic response). Therefore, the host maintains several regulatory mechanisms to accelerate the dissociation of C3b convertase on host surfaces and/or promotes the degradation of surface-deposited C3b. More than 10 proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of the complement system (e.g. complement inhibitor factor H (FH) (8.Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Human complement C3b inactivator: isolation, characterization, and demonstration of an absolute requirement for the serum protein β1H for cleavage of C3b and C4b in solution.J. Exp.

The catalytically active serine protease domain of human complement factor I.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6239-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). As an example, when FH recruits FI degradation of C3b to inactivated C3b (iC3b) results in the inactivation of the complement pathway (9.Tsiftsoglou S.A. Willis A.C. Li P. Chen X. Mitchell D.A.

Recent studies showed that the protease, hPm, can also act as complement inhibitor because it cleaves C3b and iC3b at multiple sites in vitro (12.Barthel D. Schindler S. Zipfel P.F.

The ability to avoid the complement system is a key determinant in pathogen virulence. GAS can escape recognition by the complement system by employing various strategies: 1) recruiting host complement inhibitors, such as FH, to the bacterial surface via FH receptors (e.g. M protein, Fba) (14.Horstmann R.D. Sievertsen H.J. Knobloch J. Fischetti V.A. Antiphagocytic activity of streptococcal M protein: selective binding of complement control protein factor H.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2013; 288: 27494-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); 2) secretion of proteases, such as SpeB, that can cleave and inactivate C3b (17.Terao Y. Mori Y. Yamaguchi M. Shimizu Y. Ooe K. Hamada S. Kawabata S. Group A streptococcal cysteine protease degrades C3 (C3b) and contributes to evasion of innate immunity.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6253-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); and 3) production of the hyaluronic acid capsule around the bacterial surface that inhibits complement recognition (18.Moses A.E. Wessels M.R. Zalcman K. Albertí S. Natanson-Yaron S. Menes T. Hanski E. Relative contributions of hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein to virulence in a mucoid strain of the group A Streptococcus.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 64-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial receptors that recruit host complement inhibitors are considered critical to the complement inhibition mechanism, and there is a remarkable variability in the structure and function of these receptors among different GAS strains. For example, in many GAS strains (e.g. M5, M6, M18, M19, M24, and M28), M-protein transcribed from the emm gene is a major binding locus for sequestering host FH (14.Horstmann R.D. Sievertsen H.J. Knobloch J. Fischetti V.A. Antiphagocytic activity of streptococcal M protein: selective binding of complement control protein factor H.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 6899-6904Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In other strains (e.g. AP53) that express a direct hPg/hPm-binding M-protein (PAM), FH does not bind to the M-protein but instead uses a fibronectin-binding protein, Fba, to recruit FH (16.Agrahari G. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A. Balsara R.D. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Complement-mediated opsonization of invasive Group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain AP53 is regulated by the bacterial two-component cluster of virulence responder/sensor (CovRS) system.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27494-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This indicates that complement inhibitors can bind to different receptors in GAS strains. Similarly, whereas hPg binds to PAM directly (20.Berge A. Sjöbring U. PAM, a novel plasminogen-binding protein from Streptococcus pyogenes.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it interacts with other M proteins indirectly, perhaps via fibrinogen (21.Carlsson F. Sandin C. Lindahl G. Human fibrinogen bound to Streptococcus pyogenes M protein inhibits complement deposition via the classical pathway.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The manner in which differential binding of the FH-hPg/hPm to various receptors affects the inactivation of C3b has not been established. In the present study, we examined the inactivation of C3b by the FH-FI complex and by hPm, along with their effects on phagocytosis, and the consequent lethality in mice using GAS strains AP53 and M23ND. These GAS strains express M proteins that interact with the complement system in different manners. The results obtained serve to demonstrate the versatility of GAS in avoiding host immune surveillance through different mechanisms and further link GAS infectivity to conscription of components of the hemostasis system. The isogenic GAS strains (viz. AP53/CovS−, AP53/CovS+, M23ND/CovS−, and M23ND/CovS+) used in this study have been described previously (22.Liang Z. Zhang Y. Agrahari G. Chandrahas V. Glinton K.

GAS strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt-1% yeast (THY) medium at 37 °C to an A600 nm of ∼0.6 (mid-log phase). The cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS, and then used for further experiments. In all GAS experiments, equal numbers of cells were used, as determined by both A600 nm and bacterial counting assays on agar plates (16.Agrahari G. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A. Balsara R.D. Ploplis V.A.

Blood samples were taken by licensed phlebotomists (United States Code of Federal Regulations and International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines on Good Clinical Practices). For this work, approval was obtained from the institutional review board, and all patients signed consent forms in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. For the mouse infection studies, transgenic C57BL/6(hPg(Tg)) mice (provided by Dr. David Ginsburg, Ann Arbor, MI) expressing hPg were utilized (25.Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P.

The mice were injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 4–5 × 108 cells and observed twice daily for survival for up to 10 days. For in vitro C3b/iC3b degradation, the purified proteins, C3b, iC3b, FH, FI (Comptech, Tyler, TX), and hPm (ERL, South Bend, IN), were mixed in equimolar concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and C3b/iC3b bands were detected by Western blotting. Mouse anti-human iC3b antibody (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) that recognizes C3b and iC3b was used as the primary antibody followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) as the secondary antibody. The Clarity Western ECL kit (Bio-Rad) was employed to develop the protein bands in a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). This assay was performed as described (16.Agrahari G. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A.

All GAS strains were grown to A600 nm of ∼0.6, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in gelatin-veronal buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Bacterial cells (∼1 × 108) were incubated with human plasma or hPg-deficient plasma for 60 min at 37 °C. In the case of the serum experiments, cells were incubated with 50% normal human serum (NHS; Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA) or FI-depleted serum (Comptech) for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, bacterial cells were washed twice with 10 mm EDTA in PBS. The bound proteins were eluted from cell surfaces in 60 μl of 4 mm Na2CO3, 46 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.2, for 2 h at 37 °C. The eluted proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the bound C3b/iC3b was detected by Western blotting as described above. The binding of FH to GAS cells was performed in 50% NHS or 50% FH-depleted serum (Comptech) using Western blotting under non-reducing conditions, as described in our previous work (16.Agrahari G. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A. Balsara R.D. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J.

Mouse monoclonal anti-human FH (Thermo Scientific) and HRP-conjugated-anti-mouse IgG were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify the band intensities. Purified FH was included as a positive control. Both AP53/CovS− and M23ND/CovS− cells were cultured in 30 ml of THY medium until an A600 nm of ∼0.6 was obtained. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with sterile PBS. Cells were then resuspended to a final A600 nm of ∼1.0. Aliquots of 400 μl of the suspension were incubated with 200 nm hPg in the absence and presence of 200 nm hFg (ERL). Tubes were then centrifuged, and the pellet was washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in hPg activation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Aliquots of 100 μl of the cell suspension were distributed to individual wells of a protein-nonbinding 96-well plate along with 100 μl of activation buffer that also contained the chromogenic substrate for hPm, S2251 (0.5 mm), and 10 nm SK (24.Chandrahas V.

Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine how C3b is cleaved on the surface of different GAS strains, we chose two different strains, AP53 and M23ND, because of important differences in the mode of generation of hPm. AP53 is a pattern D strain that expresses the emm53 subtype M53 protein (plasminogen binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; PAM) as its primary M-protein (22.Liang Z. Zhang Y. Agrahari G. Chandrahas V. Glinton K. Donahue D.L. Balsara R.D. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 6561-6573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PAM interacts with hPg strongly and directly, resulting in rapid activation of hPg to hPm by SK (Fig. 1A), but shows no direct binding to hFg (26.Bessen D.E. Sotir C.M. Readdy T.L. Hollingshead S.K.

Castellino F.J. Schaller J. Sjöbring U. Kringle 2 mediates high affinity binding of plasminogen to an internal sequence in streptococcal surface protein PAM.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24420-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A second hypervirulent GAS strain was used that expresses the emm23 subtype that activates hPg to hPm rapidly only in the presence of the direct hFg-binding M-protein, M23 (28.Hong K. Characterization of group A streptococcal M23 protein and comparison of the M3 and M23 protein's ligand-binding domains.Curr. Microbiol. 2007; 55: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the two GAS strains display important differences in the manner in which hPm is formed and assembled. In our recently published work (16.Agrahari G. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A. Balsara R.D. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Complement-mediated opsonization of invasive Group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain AP53 is regulated by the bacterial two-component cluster of virulence responder/sensor (CovRS) system.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27494-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we have shown that GAS strain AP53 can bind FH through the Fbp receptor, which is transcriptionally controlled by the two-component cluster of virulence sensor-responder (CovRS) system. Therefore, the overall binding of FH in AP53 can be regulated by the CovRS system. However, the mode of binding and regulation of FH to M23ND is not known. Like PAM, M23, cloned and expressed from M23ND, does not interact with FH, as shown by surface plasmon resonance experiments. 3G. Agrahari, unpublished data. Thus, in both cases, M-proteins PAM and M23 are not FH receptors. In order to assess the ability of FH to bind to M23ND cells, the M23ND/CovS− strain, which contains a natural CovS-inactivating mutation, along with its isogenic M23ND/CovS+ derivative, were compared with AP53/CovS− and AP53/CovS+. We have previously shown that an inactivating mutation in CovS of AP53 leads to the derepression of Fbp receptor expression, thus facilitating enhanced binding of FH on the AP53 surface (16.Agrahari G. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A. Balsara R.D. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Complement-mediated opsonization of invasive Group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain AP53 is regulated by the bacterial two-component cluster of virulence responder/sensor (CovRS) system.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27494-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To expand these observations, GAS cells were incubated in NHS, the FH bound to the cells was stripped, and its levels were measured using Western blotting (Fig. 2). As expected, AP53/CovS− cells show more FH binding, as compared with AP53/CovS+ cells. However, unlike AP53/CovS− cells, both M23ND/CovS− and M23ND/CovS+ cells displayed a very low level of binding of FH (Fig. 2, A and B). This indicated that M23ND does not utilize cell-bound FH in C3b inactivation to the same extent as AP53 and might employ other cofactors. As shown in Fig. 2, ∼25% FH binding was observed in AP53/CovS−/ΔFbp cells, indicating that FH can still retain a small level of binding to the GAS cells in the absence of its primary receptor Fbp. The data also indicate the presence of other (secondary) receptors for FH in GAS cells. To understand the cleavage pattern of C3b on the GAS surface by FI-FH and hPm, we first analyzed the FI-FH- and hPm-catalyzed cleavage products of C3b (Fig. 3A), alone and in combination, using purified proteins. The cleavage products were identified by Western blots using a C3b/iC3b-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). As expected, FI, in the presence of FH, efficiently cleaves C3b into iC3b, as demonstrated by the appearance of the α′ 63 kDa band (Fig. 3B). In contrast, hPm alone only slowly cleaves C3b, as demonstrated by the appearance of the α′ 40 kDa band (Fig. 3, C–E). However, in the presence of the FI-FH complex, hPm rapidly cleaves C3b (Fig. 3, C–E), indicating that FI-FH potentiates the activity of hPm, or hPm may act effectively on iC3b generated by FI-FH, as compared with C3b. Interestingly, incubation of hPm with iC3b shows similar results, suggesting that hPm primarily cleaves iC3b as compared with C3b. Taken together, these results suggest that FI functions in the presence of FH and specifically cleaves C3b, whereas hPm does not require a cofactor and primarily cleaves iC3b to an α′ 40 kDa band. We show that the FI-FH complex catalyzes cleavage of C3b into iC3b, which is further degraded by hPm. As a result, we hypothesize that AP53, which recruits FI via FH binding to Fbp, and recruits hPm through PAM binding, leads to the cleavage of C3b into a Pm-specific α′ 40 kDa band, similar to a cleavage pattern observed in lane 7 of Fig. 3. In addition, we hypothesize that an inactivating mutation in CovS that leads to the derepression of Fbp, without altering PAM expression, will result in the generation of a similar C3b cleavage pattern. To test these hypotheses, cells were incubated with NHS, and the cleavages of C3b by FI-FH and Pm present in serum were analyzed by Western blotting. As expected, incuba"
https://openalex.org/W2289842967,"The muriqui (Brachyteles spp.), endemic to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, is the largest primate in South America and is endangered, mainly due to habitat loss. Its distribution limits are still uncertain and need to be resolved in order to determine their true conservation status. Species distribution modeling (SDM) has been used to estimate potential species distributions, even when information is incomplete. Here, we developed an environmental suitability model for the two endangered species of muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus and B. arachnoides) using Maxent software. Due to historical absence of muriquis, areas with predicted high habitat suitability yet historically never occupied, were excluded from the predicted historical distribution. Combining that information with the model, it is evident that rivers are potential dispersal barriers for the muriquis. Moreover, although the two species are environmentally separated in a large part of its distribution, there is a potential contact zone where the species apparently do not overlap. This separation might be due to either a physical (i.e., Serra da Mantiqueira mountains) or a biotic barrier (the species exclude one another). Therefore, in addition to environmental characteristics, physical and biotic barriers potentially shaped the limits of the muriqui historical range. Based on these considerations, we proposed the adjustment of their historical distributional limits. Currently only 7.6% of the predicted historical distribution of B. hypoxanthus and 12.9% of B. arachnoides remains forested and able to sustain viable muriqui populations. In addition to measurement of habitat loss we also identified areas for conservation concern where new muriqui populations might be found."
https://openalex.org/W2292812764,"Depression is assumed to be both a risk factor for rejection and a result of it, and as such constitutes an important factor in rejection research. Attachment theory has been applied to understand psychological disorders, such as depression, and can explain individual differences in responses to rejection. Research on autonomic nervous system activity to rejection experiences has been contradictory, with opposing strings of argumentation (activating vs. numbing). We investigated autonomic nervous system-mediated peripheral physiological responses (heart rate) to experimentally manipulated ostracism (Cyberball) in 97 depressed patients with organized (n = 52) and disorganized attachment status (n = 45). Controlling for baseline mean heart rate levels, depressed patients with disorganized attachment status responded to ostracism with significantly higher increases in heart rate than depressed patients with organized attachment status (p = .029; ηp2 = .051). These results suggest that attachment status may be a useful indicator of autonomic responses to perceived social threat, which in turn may affect the therapeutic process and the patient-therapist relationship."

This study compares costs of rapid syphilis testing (RST) with laboratory-based rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests in low-prevalence settings in Peru. The RST was introduced in a tertiary-level maternity hospital and in the Ventanilla Network of primary health centers, where syphilis prevalence is approximately 1%. The costs per woman tested and treated with RST at the hospital were $2.70 and $369 respectively compared with $3.60 and $740 for RPR. For the Ventanilla Network the costs per woman tested and treated with RST were $3.19 and $295 respectively compared with $5.55 and $1454 for RPR. The cost per DALY averted using RST was $46 vs. $109 for RPR. RST showed lower costs compared to the WHO standard costs per DALY ($64). Findings suggest syphilis screening with RST is cost-effective in low-prevalence settings."
https://openalex.org/W2295336214,"Kurozu is a traditional Japanese rice vinegar. During fermentation and aging of the Kurozu liquid in an earthenware jar over 1 year, a solid residue called Kurozu Moromi is produced. In the present study, we evaluated whether concentrated Kurozu or Kurozu Moromi could ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in the senescence-accelerated P8 mouse. Senescence-accelerated P8 mice were fed 0.25% (w/w) concentrated Kurozu or 0.5% (w/w) Kurozu Moromi for 4 or 25 weeks. Kurozu suppressed cognitive dysfunction and amyloid accumulation in the brain, while Kurozu Moromi showed a tendency to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction, but the effect was not significant. We hypothesize that concentrated Kurozu has an antioxidant effect; however, the level of lipid peroxidation in the brain did not differ in senescence-accelerated P8 mice. DNA microarray analysis indicated that concentrated Kurozu increased HSPA1A mRNA expression, a protein that prevents protein misfolding and aggregation. The increase in HSPA1A expression by Kurozu was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting methods. The suppression of amyloid accumulation by concentrated Kurozu may be associated with HSPA1A induction. However, concentrated Kurozu could not increase HSPA1A expression in mouse primary neurons, suggesting it may not directly affect neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2293170514,"The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus is an important and serious insect pest in most banana and plantain-growing areas of the world. In spite of the economic importance of this insect pest very little genomic and transcriptomic information exists for this species. In the present study, we characterized the midgut transcriptome of C. sordidus using massive 454-pyrosequencing. We generated over 590,000 sequencing reads that assembled into 30,840 contigs with more than 400 bp, representing a significant expansion of existing sequences available for this insect pest. Among them, 16,427 contigs contained one or more GO terms. In addition, 15,263 contigs were assigned an EC number. In-depth transcriptome analysis identified genes potentially involved in insecticide resistance, peritrophic membrane biosynthesis, immunity-related function and defense against pathogens, and Bacillus thuringiensis toxins binding proteins as well as multiple enzymes involved with protein digestion. This transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for understanding larval physiology and for identifying novel target sites and management approaches for this important insect pest."
https://openalex.org/W2300912716,"The innate immune system critically shapes diabetogenic adaptive immunity during type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis. While the role of tissue-infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages in T1D is well established, the role of their tissue-resident counterparts remains undefined. We now demonstrate that islet resident macrophages (IRMs) from non-autoimmune mice have an immunoregulatory phenotype and powerfully induce FoxP3+ Tregs in vitro. The immunoregulatory phenotype and function of IRMs is compromised by TLR4 activation in vitro. Moreover, as T1D approaches in NOD mice, the immunoregulatory phenotype of IRMs is diminished as is their relative abundance compared to immunostimulatory DCs. Our findings suggest that maintenance of IRM abundance and their immunoregulatory phenotype may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent and/or cure T1D."

https://openalex.org/W2302304474,"The cupuassu tree (Theobroma grandiflorum) (Willd. ex Spreng.) Schum. is a fruitful species from the Amazon with great economical potential, due to the multiple uses of its fruit´s pulp and seeds in the food and cosmetic industries, including the production of cupulate, an alternative to chocolate. In order to support the cupuassu breeding program and to select plants presenting both pulp/seed quality and fungal disease resistance, SSRs from Next Generation Sequencing ESTs were obtained and used in diversity analysis. From 8,330 ESTs, 1,517 contained one or more SSRs (1,899 SSRs identified). The most abundant motifs identified in the EST-SSRs were hepta- and trinucleotides, and they were found with a minimum and maximum of 2 and 19 repeats, respectively. From the 1,517 ESTs containing SSRs, 70 ESTs were selected based on their functional annotation, focusing on pulp and seed quality, as well as resistance to pathogens. The 70 ESTs selected contained 77 SSRs, and among which, 11 were polymorphic in cupuassu genotypes. These EST-SSRs were able to discriminate the cupuassu genotype in relation to resistance/susceptibility to witches' broom disease, as well as to pulp quality (SST/ATT values). Finally, we showed that these markers were transferable to cacao genotypes, and that genome availability might be used as a predictive tool for polymorphism detection and primer design useful for both Theobroma species. To our knowledge, this is the first report involving EST-SSRs from cupuassu and is also a pioneer in the analysis of marker transferability from cupuassu to cacao. Moreover, these markers might contribute to develop or saturate the cupuassu and cacao genetic maps, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2291588292,"Gastrointestinal motility disorders, severe variants in particular, remain a therapeutic challenge in pediatric surgery. Absence of enteric ganglion cells that originate from neural crest cells is a major cause of dysmotility. However, the limitations of currently available animal models of dysmotility continue to impede the development of new therapeutics. Indeed, the short lifespan and/or poor penetrance of existing genetic models of dysmotility prohibit the functional evaluation of promising approaches, such as stem cell replacement strategy. Here, we induced an aganglionosis model using topical benzalkonium chloride in a P0-Cre/GFP transgenic mouse in which the neural crest lineage is labeled by green fluorescence. Pathological abnormalities and functional changes in the gastrointestinal tract were evaluated 2-8 weeks after chemical injury. Laparotomy combined with fluorescence microscopy allowed direct visualization of the enteric neural network in vivo. Immunohistochemical evaluation further confirmed the irreversible disappearance of ganglion cells, glial cells, and interstitial cell of Cajal. Remaining stool weight and bead expulsion time in particular supported the pathophysiological relevance of this chemically-induced model of aganglionosis. Interestingly, we show that chemical ablation of enteric ganglion cells is associated with a long lifespan. By combining genetic labeling of neural crest derivatives and chemical ablation of enteric ganglion cells, we developed a newly customized model of aganglionosis. Our results indicate that this aganglionosis model exhibits decreased gastrointestinal motility and shows sufficient survival for functional evaluation. This model may prove useful for the development of future therapies against motility disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2293038818,"The lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK), also called serine threonine kinase 10 (STK10), is synthesized mainly in lymphocytes. It is involved in lymphocyte migration and polarization and can phosphorylate ezrin, radixin, and moesin (the ERM proteins). In a T lymphocyte cell line and in purified human lymphocytes, we found LOK to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. The first cleavage occurs at aspartic residue 332, located between the kinase domain and the coiled-coil regulation domain. This cleavage generates an N-terminal fragment, p50 N-LOK, containing the kinase domain and a C-terminal fragment, which is further cleaved during apoptosis. Although these cleavages preserve the entire kinase domain, p50 N-LOK displays no kinase activity. In apoptotic lymphocytes, caspase cleavages of LOK are concomitant with a decrease in ERM phosphorylation. When non-apoptotic lymphocytes from mice with homozygous and heterozygous LOK knockout were compared, the latter showed a higher level of ERM phosphorylation, but when apoptosis was induced, LOK−/− and LOK+/− lymphocytes showed the same low level, confirming in vivo that LOK-induced ERM phosphorylation is prevented during lymphocyte apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that cleavage of LOK during apoptosis abolishes its kinase activity, causing a decrease in ERM phosphorylation, crucial to the role of the ERM proteins in linking the plasma membrane to actin filaments.

https://openalex.org/W2290965507,"We describe three recombinant engineered antibodies against three recombinant epitope tags, constructed with divalent binding arms to recognize divalent epitopes and so achieve high affinity and specificity. In two versions, an epitope is inserted in tandem into a protein of interest, and a homodimeric antibody is constructed by fusing a high-affinity epitope-binding domain to a human or mouse Fc domain. In a third, a heterodimeric antibody is constructed by fusing two different epitope-binding domains which target two different binding sites in GFP, to polarized Fc fragments. These antibody/epitope pairs have affinities in the low picomolar range and are useful tools for many antibody-based applications."
https://openalex.org/W2293983812,"Background Kidney transplantation is the therapy of choice for end-stage kidney disease. Graft’s life span is shorter than expected due in part to the delayed diagnosis of various complications, specifically those related to silent progression. It is recognized that serum creatinine levels and proteinuria are poor markers of mild kidney lesions, which results in delayed clinical information. There are many investigation looking for early markers of graft damage. Decreasing kidney graft cortical microcirculation has been related to poor prognosis in kidney transplantation. Cortical capillary blood flow (CCBF) can be measured by real-time contrast-enhanced sonography (RT-CES). Our aim was to describe the natural history of CCBF over time under diverse conditions of kidney transplantation, to explore the influence of donor conditions and recipient events, and to determine the capacity of CCBF for predicting renal function in medium term. Patients and Methods RT-CES was performed in 79 consecutive kidney transplant recipients during the first year under regular clinical practice. Cortical capillary blood flow was measured. Clinical variables were analyzed. The influence of CCBF has been determined by univariate and multivariate analysis using mixed regression models based on sequential measurements for each patient over time. We used a first-order autoregression model as the structure of the covariation between measures. The post-hoc comparisons were considered using the Bonferroni correction. Results The CCBF values varied significantly over the study periods and were significantly lower at 48 h and day 7. Brain-death donor age and CCBF levels showed an inverse relationship (r: -0.62, p<0.001). Living donors showed higher mean CCBF levels than brain-death donors at each point in the study. These significant differences persisted at month 12 (54.5 ± 28.2 vs 33.7 ± 30 dB/sec, living vs brain-death donor, respectively, p = 0.004) despite similar serum creatinine levels (1.5 ± 0.3 and 1.5 ± 0.5 mg/dL). A sole rejection episode was associated with lower overall CCBF values over the first year. CCBF defined better than level of serum creatinine the graft function status at medium-term. Conclusion RT-CES is a non-invasive tool that can quantify and iteratively estimate cortical microcirculation. We have described the natural history of cortical capillary blood flow under regular clinical conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2294727574,"During retinogenesis seven different cell types are generated in distinct yet overlapping timepoints from a population of retinal progenitor cells. Previously, we performed single cell transcriptome analyses of retinal progenitor cells to identify candidate genes that may play roles in the generation of early-born retinal neurons. Based on its expression pattern in subsets of early retinal cells, polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) was identified as one such candidate gene. Further characterization of Plk3 expression by in situ hybridization revealed that this gene is expressed as cells exit the cell cycle. We obtained a Plk3 deficient mouse and investigated changes in the retina’s morphology and transcriptome through immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and gene expression profiling. These experiments have been performed initially on adult mice and subsequently extended throughout retinal development. Although morphological studies revealed no consistent changes in retinogenesis upon Plk3 loss, microarray profiling revealed potential candidate genes altered in Plk3-KO mice. Further studies will be necessary to understand the connection between these changes in gene expression and the loss of a protein kinase such as Plk3."
https://openalex.org/W2295350559,"The paper presents a computationally effective method for fault detection. A system's responses are measured under healthy and ill conditions. These signals are used to calculate so-called signature functions that create a signal space. The current system's response is projected into this space. The signal location in this space easily allows to determine the fault. No classifier such as a neural network, hidden Markov models, etc. is required. The advantage of this proposed method is its efficiency, as computing projections amount to calculating dot products. Therefore, this method is suitable for real-time embedded systems due to its simplicity and undemanding processing capabilities which permit the use of low-cost hardware and allow rapid implementation. The approach performs well for systems that can be considered linear and stationary. The communication presents an application, whereby an industrial process of moulding is supervised. The machine is composed of forms (dies) whose alignment must be precisely set and maintained during the work. Typically, the process is stopped periodically to manually control the alignment. The applied algorithm allows on-line monitoring of the device by analysing the acceleration signal from a sensor mounted on a die. This enables to detect failures at an early stage thus prolonging the machine's life."
