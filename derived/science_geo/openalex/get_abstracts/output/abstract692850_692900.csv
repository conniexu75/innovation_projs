https://openalex.org/W4225248781,"Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is postulated to exert ""top-down control"" on information processing throughout the brain to promote specific behaviors. However, pathways mediating top-down control remain poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about direct prefrontal connections that might facilitate top-down control of hippocampal information processing remains sparse. Here we describe monosynaptic long-range GABAergic projections from PFC to hippocampus. These preferentially inhibit vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons, which are known to disinhibit hippocampal microcircuits. Indeed, stimulating prefrontal-hippocampal GABAergic projections increases hippocampal feedforward inhibition and reduces hippocampal activity in vivo. The net effect of these actions is to specifically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for hippocampal encoding of object locations and augment object-induced increases in spatial information. Correspondingly, activating or inhibiting these projections promotes or suppresses object exploration, respectively. Together, these results elucidate a top-down prefrontal pathway in which long-range GABAergic projections target disinhibitory microcircuits, thereby enhancing signals and network dynamics underlying exploratory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4225081392,"Epidemiological studies reveal that marijuana increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, little is known about the mechanism. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana, binds to cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1/CNR1) in the vasculature and is implicated in CVD. A UK Biobank analysis found that cannabis was an risk factor for CVD. We found that marijuana smoking activated inflammatory cytokines implicated in CVD. In silico virtual screening identified genistein, a soybean isoflavone, as a putative CB1 antagonist. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells were used to model Δ9-THC-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via NF-κB signaling. Knockdown of the CB1 receptor with siRNA, CRISPR interference, and genistein attenuated the effects of Δ9-THC. In mice, genistein blocked Δ9-THC-induced endothelial dysfunction in wire myograph, reduced atherosclerotic plaque, and had minimal penetration of the central nervous system. Genistein is a CB1 antagonist that attenuates Δ9-THC-induced atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3175737276,"Analyzing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly task, particularly for rare abnormalities, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Therefore, artificial intelligence has become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a supportive tool for doctors. However, the machine learning models used to build these tools are highly dependent on the data used to train them. Large amounts of data can be difficult to obtain in medicine due to privacy reasons, expensive and time-consuming annotations, and a general lack of data samples for infrequent lesions. In this study, we present a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, called SinGAN-Seg, to produce synthetic medical images with corresponding masks using a single training image. Our method is different from the traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) because our model needs only a single image and the corresponding ground truth to train. We also show that the synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to produce alternative artificial segmentation datasets with corresponding ground truth masks when real datasets are not allowed to share. The pipeline is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative comparisons between real data and synthetic data to show that the style transfer technique used in our pipeline significantly improves the quality of the generated data and our method is better than other state-of-the-art GANs to prepare synthetic images when the size of training datasets are limited. By training UNet++ using both real data and the synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we show that the models trained on synthetic data have very close performances to those trained on real data when both datasets have a considerable amount of training data. In contrast, we show that synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline improves the performance of segmentation models when training datasets do not have a considerable amount of data. All experiments were performed using an open dataset and the code is publicly available on GitHub."
https://openalex.org/W4225270188,"Recent years have witnessed wider prevalence of vertebral column pathologies due to lifestyle changes, sedentary behaviors, or injuries. Spondylolisthesis and scoliosis are two of the most common ailments with an incidence of 5% and 3% in the United States population, respectively. Both of these abnormalities can affect children at a young age and, if left untreated, can progress into severe pain. Moreover, severe scoliosis can even lead to lung and heart problems. Thus, early diagnosis can make it easier to apply remedies/interventions and prevent further disease progression. Current diagnosis methods are based on visual inspection by physicians of radiographs and/or calculation of certain angles (e.g., Cobb angle). Traditional artificial intelligence-based diagnosis systems utilized these parameters to perform automated classification, which enabled fast and easy diagnosis supporting tools. However, they still require the specialists to perform error-prone tedious measurements. To this end, automated measurement tools were proposed based on processing techniques of X-ray images. In this paper, we utilize advances in deep transfer learning to diagnose spondylolisthesis and scoliosis from X-ray images without the need for any measurements. We collected raw data from real X-ray images of 338 subjects (i.e., 188 scoliosis, 79 spondylolisthesis, and 71 healthy). Deep transfer learning models were developed to perform three-class classification as well as pair-wise binary classifications among the three classes. The highest mean accuracy and maximum accuracy for three-class classification was 96.73% and 98.02%, respectively. Regarding pair-wise binary classification, high accuracy values were achieved for most of the models (i.e., &gt; 98%). These results and other performance metrics reflect a robust ability to diagnose the subjects’ vertebral column disorders from standard X-ray images. The current study provides a supporting tool that can reasonably help the physicians make the correct early diagnosis with less effort and errors, and reduce the need for surgical interventions."

As there are not enough data about the circulating SARS-CoV2 variants in Iran, we sequenced 54 SARS-CoV2 genomes during the 5 waves of pandemic in Iran. Methods After viral RNA extraction from clinical samples collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, next generation sequencing was performed using the Nextseq platform. The sequencing data were analyzed and compared with reference sequences. Results During the 1st wave, V and L clades were detected. The second wave was recognized by G, GH and GR clades. Circulating clades during the 3rd wave were GH and GR. In the fourth wave GRY (alpha variant), GK (delta variant) and one GH clade (beta variant) were detected. All viruses in the fifth wave were in clade GK (delta variant). There were different mutations in all parts of the genomes but Spike-D614G, NSP12-P323L, N-R203K and N-G204R were the most frequent mutants in these studied viruses. Conclusions These findings display the significance of SARS-CoV2 monitoring to help on time detection of possible variants for pandemic control and vaccination plans."
https://openalex.org/W4225120299,"Ripples are brief high-frequency electrographic events with important roles in episodic memory. However, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating ripple-related activity among local and distant neuronal ensembles are not well understood. Here, we define key characteristics of a long-distance projecting GABAergic cell group in the mouse hippocampus that selectively exhibits high-frequency firing during ripples while staying largely silent during theta-associated states when most other GABAergic cells are active. The high ripple-associated firing commenced before ripple onset and reached its maximum before ripple peak, with the signature theta-OFF, ripple-ON firing pattern being preserved across awake and sleep states. Controlled by septal GABAergic, cholinergic, and CA3 glutamatergic inputs, these ripple-selective cells innervate parvalbumin and cholecystokinin-expressing local interneurons while also targeting a variety of extra-hippocampal regions. These results demonstrate the existence of a hippocampal GABAergic circuit element that is uniquely positioned to coordinate ripple-related neuronal dynamics across neuronal assemblies."

https://openalex.org/W4225137603,"Podocyte injury induced by hyperglycemia is the main cause of kidney dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) regulates a diversity of cellular processes in a variety of cell types. Calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, was recently shown to be involved in podocyte injury. In the present study, we sought to determine whether increased SOCE contributed to high glucose (HG)–induced podocyte injury through activation of the calpain pathway. In cultured human podocytes, whole-cell patch clamp indicated the presence of functional store-operated Ca2+ channels, which are composed of Orai1 proteins and mediate SOCE. Western blots showed that HG treatment increased the protein abundance of Orai1 in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, calcium imaging experiments revealed that SOCE was significantly enhanced in podocytes following HG treatment. Furthermore, HG treatment caused overt podocyte F-actin disorganization as well as a significant decrease in nephrin protein abundance, both of which are indications of podocyte injury. These podocyte injury responses were significantly blunted by both pharmacological inhibition of Orai1 using the small molecule inhibitor BTP2 or by genetic deletion of Orai1 using CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus. Moreover, activation of SOCE by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+ pump on the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, significantly increased the activity of calpain, which was inhibited by BTP2. Finally, the calpain-1/calpain-2 inhibitor calpeptin significantly blunted the nephrin protein reduction induced by HG treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that enhanced signaling via an Orai1/SOCE/Calpain axis contributes to HG-induced podocyte injury.

Podocytes are terminally differentiated glomerular visceral epithelial cells, which constitute the outer layer of the glomerular filtration barrier. Adjacent podocyte foot processes are bridged by the porous slit diaphragm that forms the final barrier to prevent albumin leakage (1Blaine J. Dylewski J. Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes.Cells. 2020; 9: 1700Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that podocyte injury is the key contributing factor in the pathogenesis of most inherited and acquired glomerular diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). During the past decade, many studies have demonstrated that diabetes-induced podocyte injury is the primary cause leading to proteinuria and one of the major factors contributing to the occurrence and progression of DN (2Ma Y.

Cell Physiol. 2019; 234: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The DN-associated podocyte injury includes foot process effacement, cell detachment, and slit diaphragm disruption, which are further manifested by the podocyte cytoskeleton disorganization and podocyte phenotype marker protein loss. While the etiology of podocyte injury is likely multifactorial, hyperglycemia is the major pathogenic factor to drive podocytes injury in DN (4Liu W.J. Reiser J. Park T.S. Liu Z. Ishibe S. New insights into diabetic kidney disease: The potential pathogenesis and therapeutic targets.J. Diabetes Res. 2017; 20173945469Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the hyperglycemia-induced podocyte injury are not known with certainty. Podocyte structural integrity is dependent on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In this regard, the importance of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 5 and TRPC6 channels in maintaining podocyte function and structure has been widely studied (5Schaldecker T. Kim S.

Although a recent study by Kim et al. reported a contribution of store-operated calcium channel (SOC) to podocyte injury (11Kim J.H. Hwang K.H. Dang B.T.N. Eom M. Kong I.D.

Commun. 2021; 12: 6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), the function of the channel in podocytes and the downstream mechanism mediating the channel function is, at a large extent, not known. SOC is activated upon depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+. The plasma membrane–localized Orai1 is the pore-forming unit of the classical SOC (i.e., Ca2+ release–activated Ca2+ channel). In addition, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a transmembrane protein located on ER can sense the ER luminal calcium concentration. Once ER calcium is depleted, STIM1s diffusely distributed on the ER membrane are clustered and relocated to the ER–plasma membrane junctions where they interact with Orai1 channel proteins. The Orai1–STIM1 interactions turn on the Orai1 channels and allow Ca2+ to enter the cells (12Deng X. Wang Y. Zhou Y. Soboloff J. Gill D.L.

A. 2006; 103: 9357-9362Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry, termed store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), has been known to be essential for multiple cellular processes (20Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Store-operated calcium channels.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Recently, emerging evidence suggests that the function of SOCE is cell-context and cell-type dependent. For instance, in the proximal tubular epithelial cells Mai et al. reported that blockade of SOCE inhibited TGF-β1-stimulated fibronectin protein expression (21Mai X. Shang J. Liang S. Yu B. Yuan J. Lin Y. et al.Blockade of Orai1 store-operated calcium entry protects against renal fibrosis.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27: 3063-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in glomerular mesangial cells, suppression of SOCE increased fibronectin protein abundance (21Mai X. Shang J. Liang S. Yu B. Yuan J.

Nephrol. 2015; 26: 2691-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Currently, the role of SOCE in podocyte biology and physiology, particularly podocyte injury in the settings of diabetes remains unclear. Calpains belong to the family of Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases, which are mainly activated by increased intracellular Ca2+ (23Metwally E. Zhao G. Wang Q. Zhang Y.Q. Ttm50 facilitates calpain activation by anchoring it to calcium stores and increasing its sensitivity to calcium.Cell Res. 2021; 31: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that calpain overactivation can induce podocyte injury. However, whether and how calpain contributes to DN-associated podocyte injury has not been studied. In the present study, we aimed to determine that high glucose (HG) treatment enhanced SOCE, and this enhancement resulted in podocyte injury by upregulating calpain activity. SOC is an essential Ca2+ entry mechanism in both excitable and nonexcitable cells (20Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Store-operated calcium channels.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). STIM1 and Orai1 are two key components in this channel pathway (12Deng X. Wang Y. Zhou Y. Soboloff J. Gill D.L.

To verify the existence of SOC in podocytes, we performed Western blot and showed that both Orai1 and STIM1 proteins were present in human podocytes (HPCs) (Fig. 1, A and B). CRISPR–CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)/Orai1 lentivirus (Fig. 1A, Orai LV) but not CRISPR-Cas9/control LV (Fig. 1A, CT LV) deleted the Orai1 antibody-detected band, validating the presence of Orai1 protein in podocytes. Also, the STIM1 antibody-detected band in podocytes was at the same size as that in glomerular mesangial cells (Fig. 1B), a cell type known to be rich in STIM1 protein (22Wu P. Wang Y. Davis M.E.

To determine the physiological and pathological relevance of SOC in podocytes, we also measured SOC currents in response to Ang II. As shown in Figure 1, D and E, Ang II treatment (1 μM) evoked robust inward currents. The Ang II-induced currents were significantly, but not completely, blocked by 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) pyrazole (BTP) 2 (10 μM), a SOC blocker, suggesting a component of SOC currents. The residue currents in the presence of BTP2 might be attributed to TRPC channels. Taken together, these data suggest that podocytes express functional SOCs. To explore associations of SOCE signaling in podocytes with DN, we conducted Western blot and evaluated Orai1 protein abundance in response to HG, a known pathogenic factor to trigger podocyte injury and development of DN (31Susztak K.

As shown in Figure 2, A–D, HG treatment significantly increased abundance of Orai1 protein. The HG response occurred as early as 2 h treatment and sustained for at least 12 h (Fig. 2, A and C). Furthermore, HG increased Orai1 protein content in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and D). The Orai1 response in HPCs was specific to HG because this response was not observed in the cells with osmotic CT. STIM1 protein is another essential component of SOCE signaling. We also performed Western blot in cultured HPCs and assessed HG effect on STIM1 protein abundance. Unlike Orai1, STIM1 protein levels were not significantly changed by HG treatment at the same time periods (Fig. 2, E and G) and glucose concentrations (Fig. 2, F and H) as those for Orai1. To evaluate the functional change of the podocyte Orai1 channels in response to HG treatment, we measured the Fura-2 fluorescence-indicated SOCE response using the classic “Ca2+ add-back” protocol described in our previous publications in podocytes with and without HG treatment (25Chaudhari S. Wu P. Wang Y. Ding Y. Yuan J. Begg M. et al.High glucose and diabetes enhanced store-operated Ca2+ entry and increased expression of its signaling proteins in mesangial cells.Am. J. Physiol. Ren.

Physiol. 2018; 314: F855-F863Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3, TG (1 μM) evoked a transient of [Ca2+]i in 0 mM Ca2+ bathing solution in HPCs both with and without HG treatment. This initial response indicates the ER Ca2+ store depletion by TG, which is the trigger of SOC opening. When replacing the Ca2+-free bathing solution with 2 mM Ca2+ solution, [Ca2+]i rose. The amplitude of the [Ca2+]i elevation indicated SOCE (30Ma R. Smith S. Child A. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Store-operated Ca2+ channels in human glomerular mesangial cells.Am. J. Physiol. Ren. Physiol. 2000; 278: F954-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with Western blot results (Fig. 2, A–D), SOCE was significantly increased in HPCs with HG treatment (25 mM for 12 h) compared with HPCs without HG treatment. Thus, the calcium imaging data provided functional evidence supporting that SOCE was enhanced in podocytes exposed to ambient HG. Indications of podocyte injury include loss of podocyte phenotype protein markers, such as nephrin, podocin, and synaptopodin (33Chen Y. Liu Q. Shan Z. Mi W. Zhao Y. Li M. et al.Catalpol ameliorates podocyte injury by stabilizing cytoskeleton and enhancing autophagy in diabetic nephropathy.Front. Pharmacol. 2019; 10: 1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Li C. Siragy H.M. High glucose induces podocyte injury via enhanced (pro)renin receptor-Wnt-beta-catenin-snail signaling pathway.PLoS One. 2014; 9e89233Google Scholar). We therefore examined if HG treatment decreased abundance of those marker proteins and if SOCE was involved in the responses. As shown in Figure 4, HG treatment (25 mM for 24 h) but not the osmotic CT (high osmolarity [HS]) significantly decreased nephrin protein content in HPCs. However, this HG effect was not observed in the presence of BTP2 (4 μM), a selective SOC blocker (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, deletion of Orai1 using CRISPR-Cas9 approach also abolished the HG-induced decrease in nephrin protein abundance (Fig. 4, C and D). We also evaluated HG effects on podocin and synaptopodin, the other two podocyte phenotype marker proteins. However, no significant changes in abundance of the two proteins were observed in HPCs with and without HG treatment (25 mM for 24 h) (Fig. S1). Podocyte function and foot process mobility are highly dependent on the actin cytoskeleton. No matter what the initial cause is, the final pathway for podocyte injury is cytoskeleton dysfunction and rearrangement (1Blaine J. Dylewski J. Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes.Cells. 2020; 9: 1700Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that HG disrupts podocyte cytoskeleton, which is characterized by central stress fiber disorganization and increased assembly of F-actin in cortical regions (34Li C. Siragy H.M. High glucose induces podocyte injury via enhanced (pro)renin receptor-Wnt-beta-catenin-snail signaling pathway.PLoS One. 2014; 9e89233Google Scholar, 35Lv Z. Hu M. Ren X. Fan M. Zhen J. Chen L. et al.Fyn mediates high glucose-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization of podocytes via promoting ROCK activation in vitro.J. Diabetes Res. 2016; 20165671803Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine whether SOCE contributed to the HG-induced impairment of podocyte cytoskeleton, we assessed podocyte F-actin arrangement in response to HG treatment with and without blockade of SOCE. Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin was used to stain F-actin. As shown in Figure 5, F-actins in the podocytes cultured in normal glucose (NG) medium were distributed as homogenous bundles that traversed the cells along the axis of podocytes. HG, but not the osmotic CT (HS) treatment, resulted in loss of central stress fibers and significantly increased formation of cortical F-actin. The cytoskeleton disorganization and increase in cortical F-actin were significantly blunted by BTP2 (4 μM). To further determine the role of Orai1 channels in HG-induced podocyte cytoskeleton disorganization, we constructed orai1 KO HPCs using CRISPR-Cas9 LV (Fig. 5C) and evaluated F-actin organization in response to HG treatment. In agreement with the results presented previously, HG treatment failed to disrupt cytoskeleton and form the cortical F-actins in HPCs infected with Orai1 CRISPR-Cas9 LV, but did in HPCs with CT LV infection (Fig. 5, B and D). These results suggest that SOCE signaling mediated HG-induced podocyte cytoskeleton disruption. Calpains are the family of Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases, which have high sensitivity to Ca2+ and are mainly activated by increased intracellular Ca2+ (23Metwally E. Zhao G. Wang Q. Zhang Y.Q. Ttm50 facilitates calpain activation by anchoring it to calcium stores and increasing its sensitivity to calcium.Cell Res. 2021; 31: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recent studies also showed that calpain activity regulates podocyte cytoskeleton organization and motility (36Farmer L.K. Rollason R. Whitcomb D.J. Ni L. Goodliff A. Lay A.C. et al.TRPC6 binds to and activates calpain, independent of its channel activity, and regulates podocyte cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and motility.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2019; 30: 1910-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Verheijden K.A.T. Sonneveld R. Bakker-van Bebber M. Wetzels J.F.M. van der Vlag J. Nijenhuis T. The calcium-dependent protease calpain-1 links TRPC6 activity to podocyte injury.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2018; 29: 2099-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that activation of calpain signaling was a downstream mechanism for SOCE-induced podocyte injury in the HG condition. To test this speculation, we first examined the podocyte calpain activity with or without HG treatment. As shown in Figure 6A, HG (25 mM D-glucose) but not its osmotic CT (5.6 mM D-glucose + 20 mM L-glucose) significantly increased podocyte calpain activity. To determine if this increased calpain activity by HG treatment was mediated by SOCE activation, we repeated the experiment under condition of SOCE inhibition. In the presence of BTP2, HG treatment failed to increase calpain activity anymore (Fig. 6A). We next examined the direct effect of SOCE on calpain activity. As shown in Figure 6B, TG (1 μM) but not its vehicle CT (dimethyl sulfoxide at 1:1000) significantly increased calpain activity in HPCs. The TG response was significantly blunted by BTP2 (10 μM), suggesting the SOCE mechanism in the TG-activated calpain. Taken together, these results suggest that HG activated calpain signaling through activation of SOCE in HPCs. To further determine if activation of SOCE/calpain pathway mediated HG-induced podocyte injury, we used calpeptin (5 μM), a calpain inhibitor to inhibit calpain activity in the presence of HG and evaluated the resultant effect on the nephrin protein abundance. Consistent with data presented in Figure 4, HG treatment for 24 h, but not its osmotic CT, significantly decreased nephrin protein abundance. However, calpeptin completely blocked the HG-induced response (Fig. 7). In this study, we evaluated the detrimental mechanisms of overwhelming Orai1/SOCE/calpain signaling in ambient HG-induced podocyte injury. Our results suggest that inhibition of SOCE/calpain signaling pathway can protect podocytes against injury induced by HG, a major contributor to the onset and development of DN. The structural and functional integrity of podocytes are dependent on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In this regard, the importance of TRPC6 and TRPC5 Ca2+ channels in maintaining podocyte physiology has been well studied. Gain of function of TRPC6 mutations in podocytes resulted in renal diseases (7Winn M.P. Conlon P.J. Lynn K.L. Farrington M.K. Creazzo T.

We examine changes from just before to during the pandemic in indicators of health and well-being and comprehensive profiles of health and well-being, along with links between covariates and profiles during the pandemic. Participants 1,004 students participated in a longitudinal study that began in November 2019. Methods Latent class analysis identified health and well-being profiles at both waves; covariates were included in relation to class membership. Results Mental health problems increased, whereas substance use, sexual behavior, physical inactivity, and food insecurity decreased. Six well-being classes were identified at each wave. Baseline class membership, sociodemographic characteristics, living situation, ethnicity, coping strategies, and belongingness were associated with profile membership at follow-up. Conclusions COVID-19 has had significant and differential impacts on today’s students; their health and well-being should be considered holistically when understanding and addressing long-term effects of this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4225262591,"Objectives Procalcitonin (PCT) is an acute-phase reactant with concentrations ≥0.5 μg/L indicative of possible bacterial infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). Some with severe COVID-19 develop cytokine storm secondary to virally driven hyper-inflammation. However, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines are also seen in bacterial sepsis. This study aimed to assess the clinical utility of a cytokine panel in the assessment of COVID-19 with bacterial superinfections along with PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods The retrospective analysis included serum cytokines (interleukins; IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα)) measured using Ella™ (Bio-Techne, Oxford, UK) and PCT measured by Roche Cobas (Burgess Hill, UK) in patients admitted with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021. Patients enrolled into COVID-19 clinical trials, treated with Remdesivir/IL-6 inhibitors were excluded. The cytokine data was compared between intensive care unit (ICU) patients, age matched non-ICU patients and healthy volunteers as well as ICU patients with high and normal PCT (≥0.5 vs. &lt;0.5 μg/L). Results Cytokine concentrations and CRP were higher in COVID-19 patients (76; ICU &amp; non-ICU) vs. healthy controls (n = 24), all p&lt;0.0001. IL-6, IL-8, TNFα and were higher in ICU patients (n = 46) vs. non-ICU patients (n = 30) despite similar CRP. Among 46 ICU patients, the high PCT group (n = 26) had higher TNFα (p&lt;0.01) and longer ICU stay (mean 47 vs. 25 days, p&lt;0.05). There was no difference in CRP and blood/respiratory culture results between the groups. Conclusions Pro-inflammatory cytokines and PCT were higher in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission vs. non-ICU admissions despite no difference in CRP. Furthermore, TNFα was higher in those with high PCT and requiring longer ICU admission despite no difference in CRP or rate of bacterial superinfection."

As childhood obesity is influenced by postnatal factors, it is critical to determine whether children born to women with obesity during pregnancy show alterations that are detectable at birth. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation modifications have been proposed to mediate prenatal programming. We investigated DNA methylation signatures in male and female infants from mothers with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) compared to mothers with obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2). BMI was measured during the first prenatal visit from women recruited into the Ontario Birth Study (OBS) at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, ON, Canada. DNA was extracted from neonatal dried blood spots collected from heel pricks obtained 24 hours after birth at term (total n = 40) from women with a normal BMI and women with obesity matched for parity, age, and neonatal sex. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was used to identify genomic loci associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in CpG-dense regions most likely to influence gene regulation. DMRs were predominantly localized to intergenic regions and gene bodies, with only 9% of DMRs localized to promoter regions. Genes associated with DMRs were compared to those from a large publicly available cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; total n = 859). Hypergeometric tests revealed a significant overlap in genes associated with DMRs in the OBS and ALSPAC cohorts. PTPRN2, a gene involved in insulin secretion, and MAD1L1, which plays a role in the cell cycle and tumor suppression, contained DMRs in males and females in both cohorts. In males, KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant overrepresentation of genes involved in endocytosis and pathways in cancer, including IGF1R, which was previously shown to respond to diet-induced metabolic stress in animal models and in lymphocytes in the context of childhood obesity. These preliminary findings are consistent with Developmental Origins of Health and Disease paradigm, which posits that adverse prenatal exposures set developmental health trajectories."

https://openalex.org/W4225289914,"Retractions have been on the rise in the life and clinical sciences in the last decade, likely due to both broader accessibility of published scientific research and increased vigilance on the part of publishers. In this same period, there has been a greater than ten-fold increase in the posting of preprints by researchers in these fields. While this development has significantly accelerated the rate of research dissemination and has benefited early-career researchers eager to show productivity, it has also introduced challenges with respect to provenance tracking, version linking, and, ultimately, back-propagation of events such as corrigenda, expressions of concern, and retractions that occur on the journal-published version. The aim of this study was to understand the extent of this problem among preprint servers that routinely link their preprints to the corollary versions published in journals. To present a snapshot of the current state of downstream retractions of articles preprinted in three large preprint servers (Research Square, bioRxiv, and medRxiv), the DOIs of the journal-published versions linked to preprints were matched to entries in the Retraction Watch database. A total of 30 retractions were identified, representing only 0.01% of all content posted on these servers. Of these, 11 retractions were clearly noted by the preprint servers; however, the existence of a preprint was only acknowledged by the retracting journal in one case. The time from publication to retraction averaged 278 days, notably lower than the average for articles overall (839 days). In 70% of cases, retractions downstream of preprints were due–at least in part–to ethical or procedural misconduct. In 63% of cases, the nature of the retraction suggested that the conclusions were no longer reliable. Over time, the lack of propagation of critical information across the publication life cycle will pose a threat to the scholarly record and to scientific integrity. It is incumbent on preprint servers, publishers, and the systems that connect them to address these issues before their scale becomes untenable."
https://openalex.org/W4224992163,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication of diabetes, but its underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. The multifunctional protein Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) plays an important role in cardiac pathogenesis by regulating cardiac apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and pathological remodeling, whereas its role in chronic DCM requires further investigation. Here, we report that the phosphorylation of YB-1 at serine102 (S102) was markedly elevated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse hearts and in high glucose-treated cardiomyocytes, whereas total YB-1 protein levels were significantly reduced. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that YB-1 interacts with the deubiquitinase otubain-1, but hyperglycemia-induced phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 diminished this homeostatic interaction, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of YB-1. Mechanistically, the high glucose-induced phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 is dependent on the upstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase [RSK]) signaling pathway. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of the ERK pathway using the upstream kinase inhibitor U0126 ameliorated features of DCM compared with vehicle-treated diabetic mice. We demonstrate that ERK inhibition with U0126 also suppressed the phosphorylation of the downstream RSK and YB-1 (S102), which stabilized the interaction between YB-1 and otubain-1 and thereby preserved YB-1 protein expression in diabetic hearts. Taken together, we propose that targeting the ERK/RSK/YB-1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic approach for treating DCM."
https://openalex.org/W4225012129,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across membranes in bacteria, thylakoids, plant mitochondria, and archaea. In most species, the active Tat machinery consists of three independent subunits: TatA, TatB, and TatC. TatA and TatB possess short transmembrane alpha helices (TMHs), both of which are only 15 residues long in Escherichia coli. Such short TMHs cause a hydrophobic mismatch between Tat subunits and the membrane bilayer, although the functional significance of this mismatch is unclear. Here, we sought to address the functional importance of the hydrophobic mismatch in the Tat transport mechanism in E. coli. We conducted three different assays to evaluate the effect of TMH length mutants on Tat activity and observed that the TMHs of TatA and TatB appear to be evolutionarily tuned to 15 amino acids, with activity dropping off following any modification of this length. Surprisingly, TatA and TatB with as few as 11 residues in their TMHs can still insert into the membrane bilayer, albeit with a decline in membrane integrity. These findings support a model of Tat transport utilizing localized toroidal pores that form when the membrane bilayer is thinned to a critical threshold. In this context, we conclude that the 15-residue length of the TatA and TatB TMHs can be seen as a compromise between the need for some hydrophobic mismatch to allow the membrane to reversibly reach the threshold thinness required for toroidal pore formation and the permanently destabilizing effect of placing even shorter helices into these energy-transducing membranes."
https://openalex.org/W4225271273,"A twinning bare bones particle swarm optimization(TBBPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The TBBPSO is combined by two operators, the twins grouping operator (TGO) and the merger operator (MO). The TGO aims at the reorganization of the particle swarm. Two particles will form as a twin and influence each other in subsequent iterations. In a twin, one particle is designed to do the global search while the other one is designed to do the local search. The MO aims at merging the twins and enhancing the search ability of the main group. Two operators work together to enhance the local minimum escaping ability of proposed methods. In addition, no parameter adjustment is needed in TBBPSO, which means TBBPSO can solve different types of optimization problems without previous information or parameter adjustment. In the benchmark functions test, the CEC2014 benchmark functions are used. Experimental results prove that proposed methods can present high precision results for various types of optimization problems."
https://openalex.org/W4225003836,"Topoisomerase II Binding Protein 1 (TOPBP1) is an important activator of the DNA damage response kinase Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), although the mechanism by which this activation occurs is not yet known. TOPBP1 contains nine copies of the BRCA1 C-terminal repeat (BRCT) motif, which allows protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. TOPBP1 also contains an ATR activation domain (AAD), which physically interacts with ATR and its partner ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) in a manner that stimulates ATR kinase activity. It is unclear which of TOPBP1's nine BRCT domains participate in the reaction, as well as the individual roles played by these relevant BRCT domains. To address this knowledge gap, here, we delineated a minimal TOPBP1 that can activate ATR at DNA double-strand breaks in a regulated manner. We named this minimal TOPBP1 ""Junior"" and we show that Junior is composed of just three regions: BRCT0-2, the AAD, and BRCT7&8. We further defined the individual functions of these three regions by showing that BRCT0-2 is required for recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks and is dispensable thereafter, and that BRCT7&8 is dispensable for recruitment but essential to allow the AAD to multimerize and activate ATR. The delineation of TOPBP1 Junior creates a leaner, simplified, and better understood TOPBP1 and provides insight into the mechanism of ATR activation."
https://openalex.org/W4225262070,"We study a deterministic framework for important cellular transport phenomena involving a large number of interacting molecules called the excluded flow of extended interacting objects with drop-off effect (EFEIOD). This model incorporates many realistic features of biological transport process including the length of biological “particles” and the fact that they can detach along the biological ‘tracks’. The flow between the consecutive sites is unidirectional and is described by a “soft” simple exclusion principle and by repelling or attracting forces between neighboring particles. We show that the model admits a unique steady-state. Furthermore, if the parameters are periodic with common period T , then the steady-state profile converge to a unique periodic solution of period T . Simulations of the EFEIOD demonstrate several non-trivial effects of the interactions on the system steady-state profile. For example, detachment rates may help in increasing the steady-state flow by alleviating traffic jams that can exist due to several reasons like bottleneck rate or interactive forces between the particles. We also analyze the special case of our model, when there are no forces exerted by neighboring particles, and called it as the ribosome flow model of extended objects with drop-off effect (RFMEOD), and study the sensitivity of its steady-state to variations in the parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4225264551,"Ultrasound devices are common in muscle physiology laboratories due to their ease of use and validity to assess skeletal muscle characteristics. The current study assessed the reliability of ultrasound skeletal muscle image analysis across multiple raters with limited experience. Vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and first dorsal interosseus (FDI) images were separately analyzed by three novice raters to determine muscle thickness (MT), cross-sectional area (CSA), and echo-intensity (EI). Separate analyses of variance (ANOVA) assessed statistical differences between and within raters. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) between (inter-rater) and within (intra-rater) raters, the standard error of the measurement (SEM) and minimal difference needed to be considered real were calculated. Inter-rater reliability was high for the VL and RF (ICC: 0.984-0.999), while the FDI was lower (0.614-0.962). Further, intra-rater reliability was greater than 0.961 for each rater. SEM values calculated for inter-rater reliability expressed as a percentage of the mean ranged from 0.4-5.8% across variables. Similarly, SEM values for intra-rater reliability were between 0.8-5.8%, 0.6-3.6%, and 0.4-3.2% for Raters 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Despite this, significant differences (p<0.05) between raters were observed for RF MT and EI, VL CSA and EI, and FDI MT, suggesting that potentially more measurement trials or greater practice time may be necessary to reduce systematic error among multiple raters. Post-image acquisition processing is reliable among and within raters as determined through ICCs and SEMs. This study provided consistent results among three separate novice raters given the same training, a unique yet realistic setting in muscle physiology laboratories."

A cross-sectional online pretest-posttest implementation survey was sent to all 2,813 Dutch prenatal counselors. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify associations between counselors’ knowledge and e.g. their professional backgrounds, work experience and attitudes towards NIPT. At T0 and T1 1,635 and 913 counselors completed the survey, respectively. Overall results show an increased mean number of correct answered knowledge questions; 23/35 (66%) items at T0 and 28/37 (76%) items at T1. Knowledge gaps on highly specific topics remained. Work experience and secondary care work-setting were positively associated with a higher level of knowledge. Most counselors (74%) showed positive attitudes towards the blended learning program. The mandatory blended learning, along with learning by experience through implementation of NIPT, has facilitated an increase in counselors’ knowledge and was well received. New implementations in healthcare may benefit from requiring blended learning for healthcare providers, especially if tailored to professionals’ learning goals."

In Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, the tRNA import protein (tRip), is a membrane protein that participates in tRNA trafficking; we show that tRip also functions as an AIMP. We identified three aaRSs, the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ERS), glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS), and methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS), which were specifically coimmunoprecipitated with tRip in Plasmodium berghei blood stage parasites. All four proteins contain an N-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST)–like domain that was demonstrated to be involved in MSC assembly. In contrast to previous studies, further dissection of GST-like interactions identified two exclusive heterotrimeric complexes: the Q-complex (tRip–ERS–QRS) and the M-complex (tRip–ERS–MRS). Gel filtration and light scattering suggest a 2:2:2 stoichiometry for both complexes but with distinct biophysical properties and mutational analysis further revealed that the GST-like domains of QRS and MRS use different strategies to bind ERS.

In unicellular eukaryotes, it is a single polypeptide characterized by a specific structural organization: an N-terminal domain with homology to glutathione transferases (glutathione-S-transferase [GST]–like domain) fused through a poly-lysine linker to a C-terminal endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAPII)–like domain (11Karanasios E.

In T. gondii, the MSC is composed of Tg-p43 and four aaRSs, MRS, ERS, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS), and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRS) , where YRS is the only protein without a GST-like domain (14van Rooyen J.M.

Among the six aaRSs (MRS, QRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS), aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (DRS), tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS), and alanyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS)) and the three AIMPs (MCP1, MCP2, and MCP3) that constitute the T. brucei MSC, MCP1, and MRS contain GST-like domains (15Cestari I.

In the vertebrate MSC, the largest and most intricate MSC, crucial interactions involve GST-like domains and other types of interaction motifs such as leucine-zippers and WHEP domains (9Guo M. Yang X.-L. Architecture and metamorphosis. In aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in biology and medicine.in: Topics in Current Chemistry. 344. Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht2013: 89-118Google Scholar). Two AIMPs (AIMP2 and AIMP3 (p18)) and two aaRSs (MRS and bifunctional glutamyl–prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS)) display GST-like domains. Together with AIMP1 and seven other aaRSs (QRS, DRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS), arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS), isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS), and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS)), they form a bisymmetrical complex (31Kaminska M.

Several crystal structures of MSC subcomplexes involving GST-like domains are available. The GST-like fold consists of two subdomains (34Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R.

The central helix (α5) is mostly composed of hydrophobic residues and exhibits the N-capping box (S/T-X-X-D), which is strictly conserved and crucial for the stability of the fold (36Aceto A.

The dimerization interface 1 involves mainly polar residues within helices α2 and α3 of each GST-like monomer in parallel orientation, similar to what was observed in catalytically active GST enzymes (34Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. X-ray crystal structures of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases. Implications for protein architecture, substrate recognition and catalytic function.Eur. J.

Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Dimerization through interface 2 involves the stacking of two arginines protruding from the α7 helix of each monomer and residues located in the loop connecting the α4 and α5 helices (38Simader H.

In Plasmodium, the protozoan parasite responsible for malaria, a protein named tRNA import protein (tRip) has been identified (43Bour T. Mahmoudi N. Kapps D. Thiberge S. Bargieri D. Ménard R. et al.Apicomplexa -specific tRip facilitates import of exogenous tRNAs into malaria parasites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); it is a fusion protein between a GST-like domain and an EMAPII-like domain, like S. cerevisiae Arc1p, T. gondii Tg-p43, and T. brucei MCP1 (Fig. 1A). However, tRip is an integral membrane protein localized to the parasite plasma membrane. It is implicated in an unprecedented tRNA trafficking pathway and, when the tRip gene is deleted, the development of the blood stage parasite is significantly reduced (43Bour T. Mahmoudi N. Kapps D. Thiberge S. Bargieri D. Ménard R. et al.Apicomplexa -specific tRip facilitates import of exogenous tRNAs into malaria parasites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of both domains (N-terminal GST-like and C-terminal EMAPII-like) of Plasmodium vivax tRip were solved independently (44Gupta S. Chhibber-Goel J. Sharma M. Parvez S. Harlos K. Sharma A. et al.Crystal structures of the two domains that constitute the Plasmodium vivax p43 protein.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2020; 76: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The N-terminal GST-like domain of tRip forms two types of dimers (PDB: 5ZKF). Two monomers interact either through the canonical interface 2 or through an alternative interface 1. In this unusual conformation, α2 and α3 helices of one monomer pack against α2 and α3 helices of the second monomer, but they are oriented perpendicularly to each other (and not parallel as it is the case in a canonical interface 1) (Fig. 1C). This situation is unique among structurally characterized GST-like dimers. Thus, the combination between both its singular homodimeric conformation and its unusual role in tRNA import has raised questions about the implication of tRip in a Plasmodium MSC assembly. In this study, the existence of a tRip--bound MSC in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei was experimentally verified. GST-like domains were used to determine their interaction patterns and infer the organization of the proteins in the parasite MSC. This approach led to an unexpected, novel observation: the interaction network between the different GST-like modules did not allow incorporation of all individual domains into a single MSC but rather led to the formation of two independent MSCs with specific biophysical properties in vitro. tRip and its partners were extracted from P. berghei blood-stage parasites using a purified and specific antibody raised against the C-terminal EMAPII-like domain of Plasmodium falciparum tRip (43Bour T. Mahmoudi N. Kapps D. Thiberge S. Bargieri D. Ménard R. et al.Apicomplexa -specific tRip facilitates import of exogenous tRNAs into malaria parasites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The strong lysis conditions resulting from saponin treatment significantly reduced the number of spectra in the b samples leading to its exclusion from the bioinformatics analysis. An average of 250 P. berghei proteins were thus identified in samples a, c, and d (three WT and three KO). As expected, tRip was found only in the WT samples. After subtraction of background interactions and protein frequency assessment, only four proteins were retained (ERS, MRS, QRS, and a nuclear ribosomal biogenesis regulatory protein) and considered statistically significantly increased in the WT sample, with an adjusted p value < 0.05, a minimum relevant spectral count of 5 (average), and a min Log fold change of 2 (Fig. 2A and Table S1). One candidate, ERS, stood out since its deltaSC and p value parameters were identical to those of tRip. Because of its nuclear localization and lack of detection in sample d, the ribosomal biogenesis regulatory protein was not considered further. Only one protein was significantly increased in the KO parasite (60S ribosomal protein L44, putative) compared to the WT. The sequences of P. berghei tRip, ERS, QRS, and MRS were analyzed using Blast and multisequence alignments (MSAs) (Fig. 2B). ERS, QRS, and MRS are all class I aaRSs characterized by HIGH and KMSKS motifs in their catalytic domains. Compared to their prokaryotic homologs, they contain additional sequences appended to their N- and C-terminal ends and several Plasmodium-specific insertions referred as low-complexity regions (LCRs). The length and composition of LCRs are generally variable between Plasmodium species and strains, but their localization is conserved within homologous proteins (45Frugier M. Bour T. Ayach M. Santos M.A. Rudinger-Thirion J.

Lwin N. Phelan D. Escalante A.A. Battistuzzi F.U. Comparative analysis of low complexity regions in Plasmodia.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 335Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The longest LCRs are mainly observed in P. falciparum proteins and are characterized by long asparagine (N) repeats (47Singh G.P. Chandra B.R. Bhattacharya A. Akhouri R.R. Singh S.K. Sharma A. Hyper-expansion of asparagines correlates with an abundance of proteins with prion-like domains in Plasmodium falciparum.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). P. berghei tRip, ERS, QRS, and MRS sequences were then submitted to the Raptor X web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) (48Källberg M. Wang H. Wang S. Peng J. Wang Z. Lu H. et al.Template-based protein structure modeling using the RaptorX web server.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) for 3D structure prediction. The Raptor X models were consistent with the Blast and the MSA analysis, and the top templates used to model each domain are shown in Table S2. All three aaRSs contained an N-terminal GST-like domain; MRS contained an EMAPII-like domain appended to its C terminus, while QRS had a C-terminal extension that was too short to be considered as an independent domain by Raptor X. Nevertheless, this extension contains many positively charged residues and has the potential to form one or more helices, suggesting RNA-binding properties (49Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R.

The prediction of C-terminal domains with potential tRNA-binding abilities in MRS and QRS led us to test whether these domains could bind tRNAs in vitro. Indeed, the presence of these C-terminal domains increased the interaction of the MRS and QRS anticodon-binding domains toward total human tRNA (Fig. S1, G and H), indicating that their binding were sequence nonspecific. These extensions are also conserved in MRS and QRS from other Apicomplexan parasites such as T. gondii (14van Rooyen J.M. Murat J.-B. Hammoudi P.-M. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Coute Y. Sharma A. et al.Assembly of the novel five-component apicomplexan multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex is driven by the hybrid scaffold protein tg-p43.PLoS One. 2014; 9e89487Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Production of full-length ERS, QRS, and MRS led to low expression, limited solubility, or proteolysis of the recombinant enzymes, and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses revealed that recombinant ERS and QRS lacked their N-terminal GST-like domains. Moreover, none of these purified recombinant proteins interacted with tRip (Fig. S2). We therefore chose to focus specifically on the GST-like domains from each aaRS to investigate their interactions with each other and tRip. From here on, these domains are referred to as ERS-N (ERS1-228), QRS-N (QRS1-208), and MRS-N (MRS1-228). Several constructs with and without a C-terminal 6His (-6H) or SUMO-6His (S-6H) tag were designed (Table S3). The SUMO domain not only slightly improved the solubility of MRS-N and QRS-N, but it also provided proteins of different sizes that could be distinguished one from each other on SDS-PAGE. Each partner was alternatively used as bait or prey in pull-down assays. In these assays, mixture of bacteria expressing (i) the 6His-tagged bait protein and (ii) one or more prey proteins was lysed and the protein extract was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin. This resin binds the bait protein and indirectly captures any prey protein through noncovalent interactions with the bait. After incubation, the resin was washed thoroughly, and the bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. If an interaction occurred, bait and prey proteins appear together in the elution fraction. Pairwise interactions showed that ERS-N associates with the other three domains (Figs. 3A and S3A); that MRS-N interacts with QRS-N and that MRS-N and ERS-N homo-oligomerize. As expected, the C-terminal domain of tRip was dispensable for"

https://openalex.org/W4225130178,"Fatty acid kinase (Fak) is a two-component enzyme that generates acyl-phosphate for phospholipid synthesis. Fak consists of a kinase domain protein (FakA) that phosphorylates a fatty acid enveloped by a fatty acid binding protein (FakB). The structural basis for FakB function has been established, but little is known about FakA. Here, we used limited proteolysis to define three separate FakA domains: the amino terminal FakA_N, the central FakA_L, and the carboxy terminal FakA_C. The isolated domains lack kinase activity, but activity is restored when FakA_N and FakA_L are present individually or connected as FakA_NL. The X-ray structure of the monomeric FakA_N captures the product complex with ADP and two Mg2+ ions bound at the nucleotide site. The FakA_L domain encodes the dimerization interface along with conserved catalytic residues Cys240, His282, and His284. AlphaFold analysis of FakA_L predicts the catalytic residues are spatially clustered and pointing away from the dimerization surface. Furthermore, the X-ray structure of FakA_C shows that it consists of two subdomains that are structurally related to FakB. Analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrates that FakA_C binds FakB, and site-directed mutagenesis confirms that a positively charged wedge on FakB meshes with a negatively charged groove on FakA_C. Finally, small angle X-ray scattering analysis is consistent with freely rotating FakA_N and FakA_C domains tethered by flexible linkers to FakA_L. These data reveal specific roles for the three independently folded FakA protein domains in substrate binding and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W4225154836,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is endemic in more than 100 countries and has the highest incidence among infectious diseases in Malaysia. The increase of dengue fever cases during the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement control order (MCO) highlighted the necessity to assess the dengue preventive practices among the population. Thus, this study aimed to determine the level of dengue preventive practices and its associated factors among residents in a residential area in Johor, Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 303 respondents from a Johor residential area between May and June 2021. A validated self-administered questionnaire was created using google forms and distributed to the respondents via WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: (i) Sociodemographic characteristics and history of dengue fever, (ii) dengue preventive practices, and (iii) six constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM). The association between the dependent and independent variables were examined using multiple logistic regression with a significant level set at less than 0.05.About half of the respondents have a good level of dengue preventive practices. Respondents with a history of dengue fever (aOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.2, p = 0.033), low perceived susceptibility (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.0, p = 0.018), high self-efficacy (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8, p = 0.045), and high cues to take action (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5-4.2, p < 0.001) had higher odds of practicing good dengue preventive measures.This study demonstrated a moderate level of dengue preventive practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a stronger dengue control programme is recommended by focusing on cues to take action, self-efficacy, and recruiting those with a history of dengue fever to assist health authorities in promoting good dengue preventive practices in the community."
https://openalex.org/W4225275270,"Nowadays, a small number of incretin mimics are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their longer half-life. The present study aimed to introduce a novel method for producing the liraglutide precursor peptide (LPP) and developing a potentially new incretin mimic. Here, human αB-crystallin (αB-Cry) was ligated to the LPP at the gene level, and the gene construct was expressed in Escherichia coli with a relatively good efficiency. The hybrid protein (αB-lir) was then purified by a precipitation method followed by anion exchange chromatography. After that, the peptide was released from the carrier protein by a chemical cleavage method yielding about 70%. The LPP was then purified by gel filtration chromatography, and HPLC estimated its purity to be about 98%. Also, the molecular mass of the purified peptide was finally confirmed by mass spectroscopy analysis. Assessment of the secondary structures suggested a dominant α-helical structure for the LPP and a β-sheet rich structure for the hybrid protein. The subcutaneous injection of the LPP and the αB-lir hybrid protein significantly reduced the blood sugar levels in healthy and diabetic mice and stimulated insulin secretion. Also, the hybrid protein exerts its bioactivities more effectively than the LPP over a relatively longer period of time. The results of this study suggested a novel method for the easy and cost-effective production of the LPP and introduced a new long-acting incretin mimic that can be potentially used for the treatment of T2DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W4224939721,"Aberrant activation or suppression of WNT/β-catenin signaling contributes to cancer initiation and progression, neurodegeneration, and bone disease. However, despite great need and more than 40 years of research, targeted therapies for the WNT pathway have yet to be fully realized. Kinases are considered exceptionally druggable and occupy key nodes within the WNT signaling network, but several pathway-relevant kinases remain understudied and ""dark."" Here, we studied the function of the casein kinase 1γ (CSNK1γ) subfamily of human kinases and their roles in WNT signaling. miniTurbo-based proximity biotinylation and mass spectrometry analysis of CSNK1γ1, CSNK1γ2, and CSNK1γ3 revealed numerous components of the β-catenin-dependent and β-catenin-independent WNT pathways. In gain-of-function experiments, we found that CSNK1γ3 but not CSNK1γ1 or CSNK1γ2 activated β-catenin-dependent WNT signaling, with minimal effect on other signaling pathways. We also show that within the family, CSNK1γ3 expression uniquely induced low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 phosphorylation, which mediates downstream WNT signaling transduction. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of CSNK1γ3 alone had no impact on WNT signaling, though cosilencing of all three family members decreased WNT pathway activity. Finally, we characterized two moderately selective and potent small-molecule inhibitors of the CSNK1γ family. We show that these inhibitors and a CSNK1γ3 kinase-dead mutant suppressed but did not eliminate WNT-driven low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 phosphorylation and β-catenin stabilization. Our data suggest that while CSNK1γ3 expression uniquely drives pathway activity, potential functional redundancy within the family necessitates loss of all three family members to suppress the WNT signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4225114710,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer; however, specific prognostic biomarkers have not yet been developed. In this study, we identified dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in TNBC by profiling miRNA and mRNA expression. In patients with TNBC, miR-371b-5p expression was reduced, and miR-371b-5p overexpression significantly mitigated TNBC cell growth, migration, and invasion. In addition, we found that expression of cold shock domain-containing protein E1 (CSDE1), a direct target gene of miR-371b-5p, was upregulated in TNBC cells, and inhibition of CSDE1 expression alleviated TNBC cell growth by regulating RAC1 transcription. Mechanistically, CSDE1, phosphorylated C-terminal domain (p-CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and CDK7 form a complex, and downregulation of CSDE1 leads to weak interaction between RNAPII p-CTD and CDK7, resulting in a decrease in RNAPII p-CTD expression to reduce RAC1 transcript levels in CSDE1-deficient TNBC cells. Our data demonstrate that miR-371b-5p is a tumor-suppressive miRNA that regulates the CSDE1/Rac1 axis and could be a potential prognostic biomarker for TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4225263718,"Minority stress is hypothesized to interfere with sexual orientation disclosure and sexual minority wellbeing. In this study, we investigated whether minority stress is causally linked to reduced disclosure in sexual minorities, and whether emotion regulation, a potentially adaptive form of stigma coping, can intervene to promote disclosure even following exposure to minority stress. Sexual minority adults in the US ( N = 168) were recruited online and randomized to a 2 x 2 between-subjects experimental design, where they: 1) received either emotion regulation instructions that asked them to either distance themselves from an emotionally evocative film clip or immerse themselves in the clip, and then 2) viewed either an affirming or a minority stress film clip. Following the film clip, participants completed a written reflection task in which they reflected on the film clip they viewed, which allowed research assistants to subsequently code for participants’ spontaneous disclosures of sexual orientation. Participants who viewed the minority stress clip were significantly less likely to spontaneously disclose their sexual orientation in the written task compared to those who viewed the affirming film clip, OR = 3.21, 95% CI [1.14, 9.05], p = .03. Although the emotion regulation manipulation was successful, there was no effect on sexual orientation disclosure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal link between minority stress and disclosure in sexual minorities, and thus highlights an important mechanism underlying minority stress’s effects on sexual minority wellbeing. Results demonstrate the importance of interventions that affirm marginalized identities and promote safe sexual orientation disclosure. Future research is needed to determine the circumstances under which effective emotion regulation can buffer against the negative emotional effects of minority stress to promote healthy approach behaviors like disclosure in safe contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4225285717,"The recent increase in dengue virus (DENV) outbreaks and the absence of an effective vaccine have highlighted the importance of developing rapid and effective diagnostic surveillance tests and mosquito-based screening programs. To establish effective control measures for preventing future DENV transmission, the present study was established to identify the main mosquito vector involved in the dengue fever (DF) outbreak in Upper Egypt in 2016 and detect the diversity of dengue virus serotypes circulating in both humans and vectors.We investigated the prevalence of DENV infection and circulating serotypes in the sera of 51 humans clinically suspected of DF and 1800 field-collected Aedes aegypti adult female mosquitoes grouped into 36 pooled samples. Both DENV non-structural protein (NS1) immunochromatographic strip assay and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were used for screening.Overall, the rate of DENV infection in both human sera and pooled mosquito homogenate was 33.3%, as revealed by rapid dipstick immunochromatographic analysis. However, higher detection rates were observed with RT-LAMP assay of 60.8% and 44.4% for humans and vector mosquitoes, respectively. DENV-1 was the most prevalent serotype in both populations. A combination of two, three, or even four circulating serotypes was found in 87.5% of total positive pooled mosquito samples and 83.87% of DENV-positive human sera.The study reinforces the evidence of the reemergence of Aedes aegypti in Upper Egypt, inducing an outbreak of DENV. Mosquito-based surveillance of DENV infection is important to elucidate the viral activity rate and define serotype diversity to understand the virus dynamics in the reinfested area. Up to our knowledge, this is the first report of serotyping of DENV infection in an outbreak in Egypt using RT-LAMP assay."
https://openalex.org/W4224457783,"A major challenge in eukaryotic cells is the proper distribution of nuclear-encoded proteins to the correct organelles. For a subset of mitochondrial proteins, a signal sequence at the N terminus (matrix-targeting sequence [MTS]) is recognized by protein complexes to ensure their proper translocation into the organelle. However, the early steps of mitochondrial protein targeting remain undeciphered. The cytosolic chaperone nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), which in yeast is represented as the two different heterodimers αβ-NAC and αβ'-NAC, has been proposed to be involved during the early steps of mitochondrial protein targeting. We have previously described that the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Sam37 interacts with αβ'-NAC and together promote the import of specific mitochondrial precursor proteins. In this work, we aimed to detect the region in the MTS of mitochondrial precursors relevant for their recognition by αβ'-NAC during their sorting to the mitochondria. We used targeting signals of different mitochondrial proteins (αβ'-NAC-dependent Oxa1 and αβ'-NAC-independent Mdm38) and fused them to GFP to study their intracellular localization by biochemical and microscopy methods, and in addition followed their import kinetics in vivo. Our results reveal the presence of a positively charged amino acid cluster in the MTS of select mitochondrial precursors, such as Oxa1 and Fum1, which are crucial for their recognition by αβ'-NAC. Furthermore, we explored the presence of this cluster at the N terminus of the mitochondrial proteome and propose a set of precursors whose proper localization depends on both αβ'-NAC and Sam37."
https://openalex.org/W4225161008,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and poor prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations play a crucial role in HCC, suggesting epigenetic inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach. Indeed, the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors inhibit the proliferation and invasion of various cancers but still lack a strong mechanistic rationale. Here, we identified the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) in human HCC cell line HepG2 treated with the BET inhibitors, JQ1, OTX015, or ABBV-075. We analyzed the correlation between DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs in common for the three inhibitors based on their expression profiles and performed functional annotation pathway enrichment analysis. Most of these shared DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs, including some novel transcripts, were downregulated, indicating decreased proliferation/adhesion and increased apoptosis/inflammation. Our study suggests that BET proteins play a crucial role in regulating cancer progression-related genes and provide a valuable resource for novel putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC."

https://openalex.org/W4225273081,"This study empirically examines consumer demand for healthy beverages within the hospitality industry. The research investigates sociodemographic and motivational factors that influence consumers' 'willingness to pay a premium' (WTPP) price for healthy beverages using survey data from 1021 consumers in Australia and New Zealand (NZ). Water and juice are rated as representing 'healthy' beverages sold by hospitality businesses. Under 2% of respondents consider sugar free drinks as being healthy. Consumers rate a 'healthy' beverage as having low/no sugar, natural/no additives, or containing vitamins and minerals. Less than 1% of respondents identify 'probiotics' or 'organic' as a healthy beverage. Censored Poisson finds consumers who frequently eat out or are younger have higher WTPP. Healthy eating goals increase WTPP, whereas food economizing goals decreases WTPP. Food hedonism goals reduces consumers' WTPP, and gender differences moderates this relationship. The findings present new insights on consumer behavior and healthy consumption in hospitality."

Considering the economic position of the African continent, which often contributes to high mortality, it has become imperative to investigate cost-effective means of improving the timely detection of prostate cancer. This study, the third developmental phase of a robust Akan tool, aimed at conducting an external pilot survey to investigate the practicability of the tool in studying prostate cancer awareness in women.The study was conducted in one of the biggest markets in Ghana employing a quantitative approach and recruiting 400 females from the age of 18 years. Post-ethical approval and study subjects' consent, the participants randomly responded to the Akan tool and the data was electronically entered in the presence of the participants. The data, entered in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, were analysed with the SPSS software (version 25). The results were presented as frequencies and percentages, with an assessment of the tool's reliability.A Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of 0.9030 was calculated. The majority (83.50%) of the participants belonged to the Akan tribe and were fluent in the Akan language. None of the knowledge items on the signs and symptoms, and risk factors of the disease had correct responses from more than 25.00% and 20.00% of the participants respectively whilst knowledge items on the causes of prostate cancer received varied responses. The participants were aware of the disease and had a positive perception.The pilot survey adequately tested the Akan tool and suggested various modifications to the tool and the study methodology. The tool exhibited acceptable reliability and could be applied to targeted populations to investigate the awareness of prostate cancer in women."

Consistent with the Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), followed by a phase III RCT. The present paper describes the phase III RCT protocol. Methods and analysis This is a multi-centre cluster RCT comparing READY with a group relaxation program (1:1 ratio) in 240 PwMS from eight centres in Italy (trial registration: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN67194859). Both interventions are composed of 7 weekly sessions plus a booster session five weeks later. Resilience (primary outcome), mood, health-related quality of life, well-being and psychological flexibility will be assessed at baseline, after the booster session, and at three and six month follow-ups. If face-to-face group meetings are interrupted because of COVID-19 related-issues, participants will be invited to complete their intervention via teleconferencing. Relevant COVID-19 information will be collected and the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress scale will be administered (ancillary study) at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat to show superiority of READY over relaxation. Longitudinal changes will be compared between the two arms using repeated-measures, hierarchical generalized linear mixed models. Conclusion It is expected that his study will contribute to the body of evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of READY by comparing it with an active group intervention in frontline MS rehabilitation and clinical settings. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at other relevant conferences."
https://openalex.org/W4225009772,"Around the world, many couples have turned to in vitro fertilization as a viable solution to fertility issues. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a protein best known for transporting fat molecules throughout the body, but it has also been shown to protect sperm cells during cryopreservation due to its micellar structure. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate different protocols for the preparation of nanoparticles from egg yolk plasma (EYP) containing LDL to improve the viability of cryopreserved canine semen. EYP was subjected to three distinct treatments: ultrasonification in an ultrasound bath at 40 kHz for 30 min (LDL-B); ultrasonification via an ultrasound probe at 50% amplitude for 30 min (LDL-P); and high-pressure homogenization at 10,000 PSI for six cycles (LDL-H). Sperm quality was assessed after thawing using computer-assisted sperm analysis and flow cytometry. The results revealed that compared to the EYP control, the LDL-P formulation presented significantly higher efficiency (p < 0.05) in maintaining total and progressive sperm motility, sperm membrane integrity and fluidity, and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. The LDL-P nanoparticles had an average size of approximately 250 nm, a PDI value of 0.3, and -1.15 mV of zeta potential, which are very important because it is an indicator of the stability of a colloidal dispersion. Therefore, we conclude that ultrasonication of EYP using a probe is an efficient method for the preparation of LDL nanoparticles that would enhance the cryoprotection of semen during freezing."
https://openalex.org/W4225141529,"Adenomatous polyps of the colon are the most common neoplastic polyps. Although most of adenomatous polyps do not show malign transformation, majority of colorectal carcinomas originate from neoplastic polyps. Therefore, understanding of this transformation process would help in both preventive therapies and evaluation of malignancy risks. This study uncovers alterations in gene expressions as potential biomarkers that are revealed by integration of several network-based approaches. In silico analysis performed on a unified microarray cohort, which is covering 150 normal colon and adenomatous polyp samples. Significant gene modules were obtained by a weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Gene modules with similar profiles were mapped to a colon tissue specific functional interaction network. Several clustering algorithms run on the colon-specific network and the most significant sub-modules between the clusters were identified. The biomarkers were selected by filtering differentially expressed genes which also involve in significant biological processes and pathways. Biomarkers were also validated on two independent datasets based on their differential gene expressions. To the best of our knowledge, such a cascaded network analysis pipeline was implemented for the first time on a large collection of normal colon and polyp samples. We identified significant increases in TLR4 and MSX1 expressions as well as decrease in chemokine profiles with mostly pro-tumoral activities. These biomarkers might appear as both preventive targets and biomarkers for risk evaluation. As a result, this research proposes novel molecular markers that might be alternative to endoscopic approaches for diagnosis of adenomatous polyps."

However, how these cues cause conformational changes in the SF of some K2P channels remains unclear. Herein, we investigate the mechanisms by which extracellular pH affects gating in an alkaline-activated K2P channel, TALK1, using electrophysiology and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that R233, located at the N-terminal end of transmembrane segment 4, is the primary pHo sensor. This residue distally regulates the orientation of the carbonyl group at the S1 potassium-binding site through an interacting network composed of residues on transmembrane segment 4, the pore helix domain 1, and the SF. Moreover, in the presence of divalent cations, we found the acidic pH-activated R233E mutant recapitulates the network interactions of protonated R233. Intriguingly, our data further suggested stochastic coupling between R233 and the SF gate, which can be described by an allosteric gating model.

In TASK3, a protonated H98 at the mouth of the SF guards the narrow entrance of side portals toward the S0 binding site (26Gonzalez W. Zuniga L. Cid L.P. Arevalo B. Niemeyer M.I. Sepulveda F.V.

Compared to other pHo-operated K2P channels, TALK channels are activated at relatively high pHo (12Lesage F. Barhanin J.

Previous studies suggested that this property may be due to high-pKa basic residues such as Arg and Lys in the TM4 acting as the pHo sensor (20Niemeyer M.I. González-Nilo F.D. Zúñiga L. González W.

Furthermore, a recently released structure for TASK2 suggested that a protonated Arg causes dilation of the S1 and S0 sites of SF1 through interaction with E228 and rearrangement of the long extracellular M1P1 loop (28Li B. Rietmeijer R.A. Brohawn S.G. Structural basis for pH gating of the two-pore domain K(+) channel TASK2.Nature. 2020; 586: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the TALK1 channel has a conserved Arg (R233), it lacks a Glu at the position equivalent to TASK2-E228 (i.e., TALK1-A237). Additionally, the low similarity between the M1P1 loops of TASK2 and TALK1 (Fig. 1B) suggests that TALK1 may exhibit a different pHo gating mechanism than TASK2. Interestingly, a recent case report showed that a novel TALK1 mutant, L114P, causes maturity-onset diabetes of the young (29Graff S.M. Johnson S.R. Leo P.J. Dadi P.K. Dickerson M.T. Nakhe A.Y. et al.A KCNK16 mutation causing TALK-1 gain of function is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.JCI Insight. 2021; 6e138057Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TALK1 is abundantly expressed in the pancreatic β cells (9Han J. Kang D. Kim D. Functional properties of four splice variants of a human pancreatic tandem-pore K+ channel, TALK-1.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Girard C. Duprat F. Terrenoire C. Tinel N. Fosset M.

Commun. 2001; 282: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and this gain-of-function L114P mutation was shown to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (29Graff S.M. Johnson S.R. Leo P.J. Dadi P.K. Dickerson M.T. Nakhe A.Y. et al.A KCNK16 mutation causing TALK-1 gain of function is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.JCI Insight. 2021; 6e138057Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since L114 is located near the outer mouth of the SF (Fig. 1A), it is likely to be involved in C-type gating. While these studies provide key pieces of information about the TALK1 gating mechanism, a comprehensive model has not been developed. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of pHo sensitivity in TALK1 channels by combining mutagenesis, electrophysiology, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on our findings, we generated a model to describe the allosteric mechanisms of pHo gating in TALK1. Briefly, we found that the peripheral sensor, R233, stochastically regulates the C-type gate by flipping the carbonyl group of the S1 K+-binding site in SF1. Our model further predicts the behavior of heterodimeric R233 mutants, especially for the hybrid activation of heterodimeric K2P channels comprised of channel subtypes with distinct gating properties. To investigate the pHo-sensitivity of TALK1, we transfected pCDNA3.1 hTALK1 variant 3 into COS-7 cells and recorded whole-cell currents under a range of pHo values (pHo 5–10). The current-voltage plot of TALK1 WT showed typical outward-rectification under 2 mM [K+]o/150 mM [K+]i, and the currents were augmented by alkaline conditions with a pK1/2 of 7.6 ± 0.1 and Hill coefficient (nH) of 0.52 ± 0.05 (Fig. 1, C and D) (9Han J. Kang D. Kim D. Functional properties of four splice variants of a human pancreatic tandem-pore K+ channel, TALK-1.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For other pHo-sensitive K2P channels, a single basic amino acid located either at the M1P1 loop, P2M4 loop, or the N-terminal TM4 domain has been shown to be the pHo sensor (18Rajan S. Wischmeyer E.

Sequence alignment of these pHo-sensitive K2P channels suggested four candidate pHo sensors, K84, K226, H227, and R233 (Fig. 1B). To evaluate whether any of these basic residues is the TALK1 pHo sensor, we mutated each residue to Ala and examined the resultant pHo sensitivities. All the mutant channels exhibited stereotypical outward-rectification under 2 mM [K+]o/150 mM [K+]i (Fig. S1, A–D). Moreover, the TALK1-K84A and K226A mutants displayed comparable alkaline activation characteristics. The K84A mutant exhibited a pK1/2 of 7.9 ± 0.2 and nH of 0.48 ± 0.10, while the K226A mutant had a pK1/2 of 7.3 ± 0.1 and nH of 0.57 ± 0.08 (Fig. 1D, red and purple curves). Although the TALK1-H227A mutant also displayed alkaline activation, with pK1/2 of 7.8 ± 0.6 and nH of 0.40 ± 0.20, its span of current intensity was significantly reduced (Fig. 1D, magenta curve). By contrast, although the TALK1-R233A exhibited comparable current densities as the WT, its pHo sensitivity was completely abolished (Fig. 1D, blue circle). This result strongly suggests that R233 is the principal pHo sensor. Substituting R233 with other neutral amino acids such as Cys or Val also abolished the pHo sensitivity (Fig. 1E). Moreover, conservative mutation preserved the pHo sensitivity, as the pK1/2 values were 5.16 ± 1.17 for R233H and > 10 for R233K, which are close to the pKa for His (6.0) and Lys (10.5), respectively (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, the TALK1 R233E mutant displayed acidic activation rather than alkaline activation (Fig. 1G). Since R233 is located at the N-terminal part of TM4, far from the K+ permeation pathway (Fig. 1A), it cannot directly block K+ flow via electrostatic repulsion, as demonstrated for the pHo-sensing mechanism of TASK3 (26Gonzalez W. Zuniga L. Cid L.P. Arevalo B. Niemeyer M.I. Sepulveda F.V. An extracellular ion pathway plays a central role in the cooperative gating of a K(2P) K+ channel by extracellular pH.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 5984-5991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate how R233 might control the pHo sensitivity of TALK1, we compared MD simulations of protonated R233 (R233+) and deprotonated R233 (R2330). The dihedral angles of the 108T-I-G-Y-G112 residues lining the SF displayed greater variability in the MD simulations for R223+ than those for R2330. In particular, the backbone dihedral of Y111 lining the SF (ΨY111) rotated by ∼180° in 20% (replicates 1, 8, 11, and 16) of the R233+ simulations (Fig. 2A, top left and S2A), but this phenomenon was absent in the R2230 simulations (Fig. 2A, top right and S2B). This flip coincided with the loss of coordination between the Y111 carbonyl oxygen and K+ at the S1 binding site (Fig. 2B). Of note, the Ψ angle of I109 at the S3 binding site was also highly dynamic, but there was no observable difference in this angle between the R2330 and R233+ simulations (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Therefore, although there are two locations (S1 and S3) in TALK1 that may contribute to C-type gating, only S1 is likely to be dependent on the protonation status of R233. The pHo-dependent C-type gating of TASK2 involves the dilation of the S0 and S1 K+ binding sites in SF1 (28Li B. Rietmeijer R.A. Brohawn S.G. Structural basis for pH gating of the two-pore domain K(+) channel TASK2.Nature. 2020; 586: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, the kinetics of voltage-dependent K2P channels involves a slow rearrangement of the SF (31Schewe M. Nematian-Ardestani E. Sun H. Musinszki M. Cordeiro S.

Such a slow rearrangement differs from the rapid flipping of the carbonyl groups of the K+ binding sites (4Miranda W.E. DeMarco K.R. Guo J. Duff H.J. Vorobyov I.

Moreover, an alkaline extracellular solution would be expected to expedite the voltage-dependent process, but it may not affect the rapid gating by flipping the carbonyl group. As expected, elevating pHo accelerated the voltage-dependent activation of the TASK2-WT (48.41 ± 17.14 ms at pHo 7.4, 21.80 ± 10.44 ms at pHo 9.0) but not the pHo-insensitive TASK2-R224A mutant (41.57 ± 5.81 ms at pHo 7.4, 34.90 ± 8.07 ms at pHo 9.0) (Figs. S3, A and B, 2E). By contrast, varying pHo had no effect on the voltage-dependent activation of either pHo-sensitive TALK1-WT (0.19 ± 0.11 ms at pHo 7.4, 0.44 ± 0.73 ms at pHo 9.0) or pHo-insensitive TALK1-R233A (2.97 ± 1.65 ms at pHo 7.4, 3.04 ± 2.1 ms at pHo 9.0) (Fig. 2, C–E). These results imply that TALK1 and TASK2 may utilize distinct gating mechanisms even though their pHo sensors and corresponding gates are located at the equivalent position. Comparison of the structures between S1 normal and flipped forms shows that the side chains of R233 (at the TM4 N-terminus) and L114 (positioned halfway between the R233 and the SF) were rotated (Fig. 3A), suggesting extensive interactions might connect R233 at TM4 to L114 near the SF. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction partners of R233 and L114 during the R2330 and R233+ simulations. The positively charged R233+ side chain did not have a stable partner during the R233+ simulations; its most stable hydrogen bond was with the S97 side chain, which occurred in only 20 to 30% of the total simulation time (Fig. 3B). In the presence of the R233+/S97 hydrogen bond, R233+ rotated toward the L114 side chain (R233+/L114 distance ∼ 5.5 − 6.5 Å in Figs. 3C and S2A, Pearson coefficient = −0.628, Fig. 3F). We noticed that sometimes, but not always, the shortening of the R233+/L114 distance preceded the ΨY111 rotation (Fig. S2A, flipped; replicate 5, 6, 7,10 and 14 in non-flipped), implying the R233+-induced ΨY111 rotation is a stochastic process. Moreover, we also observed stronger van der Waals interactions for L114/F100 (-1.5 to -1.0 kcal/mol, Figs. 3D and S2A) and L114/Y111 (−2.0 to −2.5, Figs. 3E and S2A) in the closed conformation (S1 flipped). These stable van der Waals interactions of L114/F100 and L114/Y111 only occurred after the ΨY111 shifted to ∼1000 (Fig. S2A, flipped), suggesting a strong coupling between Y111/L114/F100 and the ΨY111 rotation (Fig. 3F). In contrast, R2330 occasionally formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone of V220 (occupancy of 37%) but the interactions with S97 became unstable (occupancy of 5%) (Figs. 3B and S2B). Most importantly, in all R2330 simulation replicates, R233 never came in close contact with L114 (R233+/L114 distance > 6.5 Å, Figs. 3C and S2B), and the F100-L114-Y111 interactions that linked the SF to R233 became infrequent (Figs. 3, D and E, S2B). Overall, these observations suggest that multiple transient interactions connect R233+ to the conformational changes of the S1 binding site. To further establish a dynamic link between R233+ and the SF, we carried out a series of simulations in which the R233-Cζ and L114-Cγ distance was constrained to the shortest observed in the unconstrained simulations (R233(Cζ)---L114(Cγ) = 5.3 Å). In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed more frequent rotation of ΨY111 in these simulations (13/20, 65%) as compared with unconstrained R233+ simulations (Fig. 2A, top left and 3G; 4/20, p < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test). To confirm the predicted role of the R223–PH1-L114 interaction in channel activation, we generated S97G, F100I, and L114P mutants and examined their pHo sensitivities. As expected, TALK1-S97G had an attenuated activation at high pHo and an acidic-shifted pK1/2 (Fig. 3, H and I). TALK1-F100I exhibited weakened proton inhibition with elevated current densities (Fig. 3, H and I). The electrophysiological recording of TALK1-L114P mutants revealed a disruption of pHo sensitivity and a 15-fold increase in current density (Fig. 3, H and I), in agreement with the previous study (29Graff S.M. Johnson S.R. Leo P.J. Dadi P.K. Dickerson M.T. Nakhe A.Y. et al.A KCNK16 mutation causing TALK-1 gain of function is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.JCI Insight. 2021; 6e138057Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast to positively charged Arg, Glu is a negatively charged at physiological pH; therefore, we predicted that the R233E mutation would exhibit different sensitivity to pHo. Indeed, TALK1-R233E showed an acidic activation (Fig. 1G). Based on the modeled structure of R233E, we then hypothesized that residues R233E, D94, and S97 could form a binding pocket for divalent cations (dications) such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which would inhibit TALK1-R233E currents in alkaline conditions (pHo > 5.0), mimicking R233+ (Fig. 4A). To test this hypothesis, we recorded TALK1-WT and TALK1-R233E currents in a dication-free extracellular solution (Ca2+ and Mg2+-free plus 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). This dication-free solution at pHo 7.4 could activate TALK1 R233E (fold increase =16.23 ± 9.15, n = 9) but not WT (fold increase =1.12 ± 0.84, n = 6) (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, although both Ca2+ and Mg2+ could inhibit TALK1-R233E, Ca2+ was twice as potent as that of Mg2+ at the same concentration (1 mM) (Fig. S4, A–E). To further test our hypothesis, we examined the acidic activation of a double mutation, R233E + D94A. If D94 is involved in the acidic activation of the R233E mutant, this double mutant could abolish this acidic activation. We first confirmed that D94A single mutant exhibited normal pHo sensitivity (Fig. S4F). As expected, acidic activation was lost in TALK1-R233E + D94A (Fig. 4D). This result further suggested that R233E and D94 could form a dication-binding pocket. We then tested the ability of these acidic residues to capture a Ca2+ by creating three different starting conformations for MD simulations of the TALK1-R233E mutant in which a Ca2+ ion was placed close to either E233 or D94. These simulations revealed that Ca2+ tightly bound the carboxylates of E233 and D94. S97 could also coordinate Ca2+, but the interaction was more sporadic (Fig. S4G). Therefore, inhibition of TALK1-R233E at high pHo might result from a mimicking of the R233+–PH1 interaction. Together, the electrophysiological experiments and MD simulations suggested an allosteric pHo-gating model for TALK1 (Fig. 5A). We proposed that the protomeric TALK1 can adopt various conformations, including R2330 (P1), R233+ with normal SF (P2), and R233+ with flipped SF (C). Both P1 and P2 represent K+-permeable conformations, whereas the C represents a nonconductive conformation. At low pHo, the R2330 (P1) will be protonated (R233+). KDn represents the proton dissociation constant of R233, and n denotes proton sensitivity. Because R233+ does not always induce a conformational change in the SF, we included a stochastic component α, an equilibrium constant between normal and flipped SF. Based on our model (Fig. 5A), the K+ permeation probability (Pp) of protomer can be calculated byPp=1+([H+]KD)n1+([H+]KD)n+α([H+]KD)n(1) where [H+] denotes the concentration of protons. Since a functional TALK1 channel is a dimer, the pHo-dependent Po relative to pHo 10 can be calculated byPoPo(pH10)=(1+([H+]KD)n1+([H+]KD)n+α([H+]KD)n)2/(1+(10−10KD)n1+(10−10KD)n+α(10−10KD)n)2(2) Here, we assume that the protonation of R233 in one subunit is independent of protonation in the other subunit due to the distance between residues. We then refitted the pHo sensitivity curve of TALK1-WT with Equation 2 (Fig. 5B) and obtained values for the parameters α, pKD, and n (Table 1). We found a mild acidic shift of pKD compared to pK1/2 estimated by the Hill equation. Also, the value of n was slightly smaller than that of nH. Of note, the value of α would yield a residual current around 15% at the extreme low pHo. This value is considered to be the TALK1 residual current that has been reported previously (33Kang D. Kim D.

Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus) is an important subsistence species for Alaska's Arctic Indigenous communities, yet little is known about life history diversity, migration patterns, and freshwater habitat use. Using laser ablation Sr isotope otolith microchemistry, we analyzed Colville River Broad Whitefish 87Sr/86Sr chronologies (n = 61) to reconstruct movements and habitat use across the lives of individual fish. We found evidence of at least six life history types, including three anadromous types, one semi-anadromous type, and two nonanadromous types. Anadromous life history types comprised a large proportion of individuals sampled (collectively, 59%) and most of these (59%) migrated to sea between ages 0-2 and spent varying durations at sea. The semi-anadromous life history type comprised 28% of samples and entered marine habitat as larvae. Nonanadromous life history types comprised the remainder (collectively, 13%). Otolith 87Sr/86Sr data from juvenile and adult freshwater stages suggest that habitat use changed in association with age, seasons, and life history strategies. This information on Broad Whitefish life histories and habitat use across time and space will help managers and conservation planners better understand the risks of anthropogenic impacts and help conserve this vital subsistence resource."
https://openalex.org/W4225273974,"The distribution of the newly developed vaccines presents a great challenge in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Policy makers must decide which subgroups should be vaccinated first to minimize the negative consequences of the pandemic. These decisions must be made upfront and under uncertainty regarding the amount of vaccine doses available at a given time. The objective of the present work was to develop an iterative optimization algorithm, which provides a prioritization order of predefined subgroups. The results of this algorithm should be optimal but also robust with respect to potentially limited vaccine supply.We present an optimization meta-heuristic which can be used in a classic simulation-optimization setting with a simulation model in a feedback loop. The meta-heuristic can be applied in combination with any epidemiological simulation model capable of depicting the effects of vaccine distribution to the modeled population, accepts a vaccine prioritization plan in a certain notation as input, and generates decision making relevant variables such as COVID-19 caused deaths or hospitalizations as output. We finally demonstrate the mechanics of the algorithm presenting the results of a case study performed with an epidemiological agent-based model.We show that the developed method generates a highly robust vaccination prioritization plan which is proven to fulfill an elegant supremacy criterion: the plan is equally optimal for any quantity of vaccine doses available. The algorithm was tested on a case study in the Austrian context and it generated a vaccination plan prioritization favoring individuals age 65+, followed by vulnerable groups, to minimize COVID-19 related burden.The results of the case study coincide with the international policy recommendations which strengthen the applicability of the approach. We conclude that the path-dependent optimum optimum provided by the algorithm is well suited for real world applications, in which decision makers need to develop strategies upfront under high levels of uncertainty."

Here, we demonstrate that in mouse sperm, within the first minutes of exposure upon capacitating conditions, the activity of RHOA/C and RAC1 is essential for LIMK1 and COFILIN phosphorylation. However, we observed that the signaling pathway involving RAC1 and PAK4 is the main player in controlling actin polymerization in the sperm head necessary for the occurrence of AR. Moreover, we show that the transient phosphorylation of COFILIN is also influenced by the Slingshot family of protein phosphatases (SSH1). The activity of SSH1 is regulated by the dual action of two pathways. On one hand, RHOA/C and RAC1 activity promotes SSH1 phosphorylation (inactivation). On the other hand, the activating dephosphorylation is driven by okadaic acid—sensitive phosphatases. This regulatory mechanism is independent of the commonly observed activating mechanisms involving PP2B and emerges as a new finely tuned modulation that is, so far, exclusively observed in mouse sperm. However, persistent phosphorylation of COFILIN by SSH1 inhibition or okadaic acid did not altered actin polymerization and the AR.

In mammalian species, the male gamete must reside in the female tract for a period of time to acquire its fertilizing ability. To achieve that, sperm undergo a series of biochemical and structural modifications, collectively called capacitation (1Austin C.R.

From a molecular point of view, signaling pathways leading to AR are complex and temporarily, they can be divided in two groups: (i) those that take place during capacitation and prepare the cell to respond to the appropriate AR agonist; (ii) those that occur after a given stimuli promoting the initiation of the exocytotic process. Examples of signaling pathways in the first group are the membrane potential hyperpolarization (7Zeng Y. Clark E.N. Florman H.M.

In this group, these signaling pathways become activated by molecules in the female reproductive tract that are not fully established. Thus, the actin cytoskeleton, as it does in other exocytotic events, plays a crucial role in priming the cell for exocytosis and later, once it was triggered, in regulating fusion steps occurring in a timely and orderly manner. Several studies describe changes in actin dynamics during sperm capacitation in numerous mammalian species (16Brener E. Rubinstein S. Cohen G. Shternall K. Rivlin J. Breitbart H.

We previously showed that actin polymerization/depolymerization in the head of mouse sperm is mainly regulated by RHOA/C and RAC1, two members of the Rho-family of small GTPases (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Activation of RHOA/C and RAC1 promotes LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) phosphorylation and its consequent activation (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). LIMKs are activated through downstream protein kinases of Rho-family GTPases, such as Rho-associated activated kinases (ROCKs) and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (23Ha B.H. Morse E.M. Turk B.E.

We described that ROCK1, a common downstream effector of RHOA/C, is expressed in mouse sperm and contributes to LIMK1 phosphorylation (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RAC1-dependent LIMK1 activation is controlled by PAKs, but their expression and function in mouse sperm remains unclear. In this regard, it was recently reported that RAC1 inhibition alters capacitation and AR and specifically regulate F-actin formation in the apical region of the guinea pig acrosome (a commons site of AR initiation) (25Ramírez-Ramírez D. Salgado-Lucio M.L. Roa-Espitia A.L. Fierro R. González-Márquez H. Cordero-Martínez J. et al.Rac1 is necessary for capacitation and acrosome reaction in Guinea pig spermatozoa.J. Cell Biochem. 2020; 121: 2864-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/COFILIN family comprises three proteins that are expressed in mice: ADF (also known as destrin), COFILIN-1, and COFILIN-2. ADF/COFILIN-1/2 (mentioned collectively as COFILIN) are the only known substrates of LIMKs so far (26Bamburg J.R. Wiggan O.P. ADF/cofilin and actin dynamics in disease.Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of COFILIN in Ser3, carried out by phosphorylated LIMK1 (pLIMK1), inhibits its actin severing activity promoting the formation of F-actin. While LIMK1 phosphorylation occurs gradually over the course of the first 60 min of incubation under capacitating conditions, COFILIN displays a transient increase in Ser3 phosphorylation during the first 10 min followed by a rapid return to the basal level (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the COFILIN phosphorylation status is controlled by other enzymes such as Ser/Thr phosphatases. In somatic cells, Slingshot family of protein phosphatases (SSHs; composed of SSH1, SSH2, and SSH3 in mammals) specifically dephosphorylate and reactivate Ser3-pCOFILIN (27Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Control of actin reorganization by slingshot, a family of phosphatases that dephosphorylate ADF/cofilin.Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 28Ohta Y. Kousaka K. Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohashi K. Muramoto A. Shima Y. et al.Differential activities, subcellular distribution and tissue expression patterns of three members of Slingshot family phosphatases that dephosphorylate cofilin.Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that COFILIN is subject to a dual regulation by LIMKs and SSHs in mouse sperm to control its actin-depolymerizing activity. In the present work, we investigated the participation of PAK4 and SSH1 phosphatase in the signaling pathway leading to actin remodeling during mouse sperm capacitation. In mouse sperm, we previously demonstrated that both RHOA/C and RAC1 small GTPases are necessary for LIMK1 activation. LIMK1 is gradually phosphorylated on Thr508 during capacitation reaching a maximum at 30 min (Figs. 1A and S1A). In the case of the RHOA/C signaling pathway, we found that ROCK1 is expressed in mouse sperm and participates in the phosphorylation of LIMK1. However, the kinase responsible for RAC1-mediated phosphorylation was not established. The possible participation of PAK1, one of six members of the PAK family of serine/threonine kinases, although expressed in sperm, has been previously excluded (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have now explored the involvement of PAK4, another member of the PAK family. By immunoblotting, it was determined that PAK4 is expressed in mouse sperm, and a single band of the expected molecular size (68 KDa) was observed (Fig. 1B). To study whether PAK4 phosphorylates LIMK1, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions in the presence of increasing concentrations of PAK4-specific inhibitor PF-3758309 (29Murray B.W. Guo C. Piraino J. Westwick J.K. Zhang C. Lamerdin J. et al.Small-molecule p21-activated kinase inhibitor PF-3758309 is a potent inhibitor of oncogenic signaling and tumor growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of LIMK1 was significantly reduced in the presence of PAK4 inhibitor (Fig. 1C), indicating that this kinase is required for the capacitation-associated LIMK1 activation. Next, the localization of PAK4 in mouse sperm was evaluated. As shown in Figure 1D, immunofluorescence studies revealed the localization of PAK4 mainly along the flagellum midpiece as well as in the head of mouse sperm. Interestingly, PAK4 exhibited three different staining patterns in the sperm head: (1) septum (Fig. 1D, white arrows; Fig. 1E, pattern S), (2) acrosomal (Fig. 1D, white asterisk; Fig. 1E, pattern A), or (3) absent (Fig. 1E, pattern ND). To further understand whether the localization of PAK4 is associated with the acrosomal status, a double staining with peanut agglutinin lectin (PNA) and PAK4 antibody was used in noncapacitating conditions. Sperm displaying the septum pattern (60.60 ± 2.99 % of total cells) mainly presented an intact acrosome (91.55 ± 2.73 %; Fig. 1, E and F, pattern S, NC); while the acrosomal pattern (19.67 ± 1.28 % of total cells) was linked with a more diffuse PNA staining (97.80 ± 1.06 %; Fig. 1, E and F, pattern A, NC). This last type of staining has been associated with intermediate stages of AR (30Ito C. Toshimori K. Acrosome markers of human sperm.Anat. Sci. Int. 2016; 91: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, the absence of PAK4 staining (19.73 ± 1.89 % of total cells) was associated with the lack of acrosome (68.96± 12.38 %; Fig. 1, E and F, pattern ND, NC). After 60 min of capacitation, the expected increase in spontaneous AR was accompanied by changes in the PAK4 patterns, showing that their association with the acrosomal status was maintained: the 87.82 ± 5.75 % of the septum pattern (53,92 ± 5,34 % of total cells) was linked to acrosome intact sperm; the 87.70 ± 8.48 % of the acrosomal pattern (14,19 ± 3.87 % of total cells) was linked to the diffuse PNA staining; and the 86.37 ± 4.13 % of sperm with no PAK4 staining in the head (31,89 ± 3.54 % of total cells) was linked to acrosome reacted sperm (Fig. 1F, CAP). Taken together, these results indicate that PAK4 localization in the sperm head is related with different stages of AR development. The binding of COFILIN to actin is regulated through its phosphorylation on Ser3 by LIMK1, which inhibits its actin-severing activity (31Bamburg J.R. Proteins of the ADF/cofilin family: Essential regulators of actin dynamics.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In mouse sperm incubated under capacitating conditions, while LIMK1 increases its activity gradually over time, the phosphorylated form of COFILIN (pCOFILIN) reaches a transient maximum at 10 min followed by a rapid decrease to the levels comparable to those observed at the beginning of the incubation (Figs. 2A; S1, B and C). These results reveal that COFILIN is subject to a dual modulation in a complex signaling pathway that may involve other regulatory elements. In previous results, we observed that both RHOA/C and RAC1 small GTPases contribute to LIMK1 and COFILIN phosphorylation (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since we identified PAK4 as the kinase acting downstream RAC1, we aimed to elucidate the specific contribution of RHOA/C-ROCK1 and RAC1-PAK4 on COFILIN phosphorylation. For this purpose, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions in the presence or absence of either PAK4 inhibitor (PF-3758309; 10 μM), RHOA/C inhibitor (esterified C3 transferase, also known as C4; 1 μg/ml), or a combination of both (Fig. 2, B–D). None of the two inhibitors used in these studies impaired sperm viability (Fig. S2, A and C, PF and C4, respectively). The phosphorylation status of LIMK1 and COFILIN was evaluated by immunoblotting. Two time points, 10 min and 40 min, were specifically chosen to study the maximum levels of pCOFILIN and pLIMK1, respectively. As shown in Figure 2, B and C, phosphorylation of LIMK1 was significantly reduced by PAK4 inhibition, whereas no differences were observed in pCOFILIN maximum at 10 min (Fig. 2D; PF). On the other hand, inhibition of RHOA/C resulted in lower levels of pCOFILIN, whereas pLIMK1 was not significantly affected (Fig. 2, C and D; C4). However, combined treatment resulted in a more pronounced decrease in phosphorylation levels of both proteins (Fig. 2, C and D; PF+C4). The latter result indicates that PAK4 and RHOA/C are implicated in this phosphorylation cascade. Inhibition of COFILIN by Ser3-phosphorylation, driven by RHOA/C or RAC1, results in a shift of the equilibrium toward polymerization (32Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. et al.Regulation of actin dynamics through phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinase.Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 33Blanchoin L. Robinson R.C. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Phosphorylation of Acanthamoeba actophorin (ADF/cofilin) blocks interaction with actin without a change in atomic structure.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To study the role of PAK4 in actin polymerization, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions in the presence of RHOA/C or PAK4 inhibitors, fixed, and stained with phalloidin-TRITC to observe F-actin filaments. As shown in Figure 3, A and B, in the presence of 10 μM PF-3758309 (29Murray B.W. Guo C. Piraino J. Westwick J.K. Zhang C. Lamerdin J. et al.Small-molecule p21-activated kinase inhibitor PF-3758309 is a potent inhibitor of oncogenic signaling and tumor growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), F-actin levels were significantly lower compared to those observed in control condition, evidencing that PAK4 activity is necessary to properly stimulate actin polymerization. Finally, transgenic mouse sperm expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in their acrosomes (34Hasuwa H. Muro Y. Ikawa M. Kato N. Tsujimoto Y. Okabe M. Transgenic mouse sperm that have green acrosome and red mitochondria allow visualization of sperm and their acrosome reaction in Vivo.Exp. Anim. 2010; 59: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were used to study the impact of PAK4 inhibition on AR. By flow cytometry, we found that inhibition of PAK4 resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of sperm that underwent AR (Fig. 3, C and D; PF). These findings are in agreement with previous results by Romarowski et al., where a decreased actin polymerization, caused by a disruption of the Rho GTPase pathway, inhibited AR (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RHOA/C inhibition (Fig. 3C; C4), despite its strong effect on COFILIN phosphorylation (see Fig. 2, B and D), did not significantly affect AR. Further, combined treatment with PAK4 and RHOA/C inhibitors (Fig 3C; PF+C4) inhibited AR at levels comparable to those obtained by 10 μM PF-3758309 alone. This observation, and the fact that PAK4 inhibition had the major effect on actin polymerization in the sperm head, place this kinase as an essential player in AR. We have previously described that RAC1 contributes to the phosphorylation of LIMK1 (22Romarowski A. Battistone M.A. La Spina F.A. Puga Molina L. del C. Luque G.M. et al.PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 and Cofilin is essential for mouse sperm acrosomal exocytosis.Dev. Biol. 2015; 405: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sperm incubation in the presence of RAC1 inhibitor (CAS 1177865–17–6; 5 μM) did not affect pCOFILIN levels (Fig. 4A). However, it significantly reduced actin polymerization (Fig. 4B) and abrogated AR (Fig. 4C), without impairing viability (Fig. S2B, CAS). These results are similar to those obtained with PAK4 inhibitor PF-3758309, suggesting that PAK4 may be the downstream effector of RAC1. This possibility needs to be explored in future investigations. As previously shown, phosphorylation of LIMK1 on Thr508 increases gradually during capacitation (Fig. 1A), while phosphorylation of COFILIN on Ser3 reaches a maximum at 10 min and then returns to baseline levels (see Fig. 2A). These results suggest the participation of an alternative player implicated in the regulation of COFILIN phosphorylation. In somatic cells, dephosphorylation and consequent activation of pCOFILIN is mediated by SSH1 phosphatase (27Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T.

Sarcevic B. et al.Interplay between components of a novel LIM kinase–slingshot phosphatase complex regulates cofilin.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of SSH1 in mouse sperm was analyzed by immunoblotting using a specific antibody against the phosphorylated form of this protein (pSSH1). As shown in Figure 5A, a single band of the expected size for pSSH1 (116 kDa) was observed. Furthermore, we found that 14-3-3, a scaffold protein implicated in SSH1 regulation (36Soosairajah J. Maiti S. Wiggan O. Sarmiere P. Moussi N. Sarcevic B. et al.Interplay between components of a novel LIM kinase–slingshot phosphatase complex regulates cofilin.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), is also expressed in mouse sperm (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation of SSH1 on Ser978 is known to inhibit its phosphatase activity (35Huang T.Y. Dermardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Cofilin phosphatases and regulation of actin dynamics.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In order to study the phosphorylation status of SSH1 during capacitation, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions, and the levels of pSSH1 at different times of incubation were analyzed. As shown in Figure 5C, SSH1 is phosphorylated within the first 10 min of incubation, remains sustained until 30 min, and then decays to the levels observed at the beginning of the incubation. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the localization of pSSH1 mainly along the principal piece of the flagellum as well as in different regions of the sperm head (Fig. 5, D and E): perforatorium (Fig. 5E, PER), acrosomal (Fig. 5E, ACR), septum (Fig. 5E, SEP), and postacrosomal region (Fig. 5E, PAR). These four patterns were found alone or combined, being the most representative the perforatorium together with the acrosomal, as shown in Figure 5D. To study the localization of pSSH1 during capacitation, the time points 0, 10, and 40 min were chosen. Two of the patterns, the SEP and the PAR, exhibited a specific dynamic within the first 10 min of capacitation (Fig. 5E, SEP and PAR patterns). The septum pattern significantly decreased with 10 min of capacitation, whereas the postacrosomal showed a tendency to increase. Given that the decrease in pSSH1 is coincident with the diminish in pCOFILIN levels, these results suggest that SSH1 could be the phosphatase responsible for pCOFILIN dephosphorylation. To investigate this possibility, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions in the absence or presence of a SSH1-specific inhibitor sennoside A (37Lee S.Y. Kim W. Lee Y.G. Kang H.J. Lee S.-H. Park S.Y. et al.Identification of sennoside A as a novel inhibitor of the slingshot (SSH) family proteins related to cancer metastasis.Pharmacol. Res. 2017; 119: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 6A, the highest concentration of this inhibitor resulted in persistent COFILIN phosphorylation at 40 min of incubation. In this condition, sperm viability was not compromised (Fig. S2A, SeA). Surprisingly, sennoside A did not affect actin polymerization (Fig. 6B) or AR (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that capacitation-associated actin polymerization and the AR depend on early phosphorylation of COFILIN but not on its subsequent dephosphorylation. Several studies in somatic cells have shown that pCOFILIN dephosphorylation is a Ca2+-induced event mediated by PP2B (also known as calcineurin)-dependent activation of SSH1 (38Wang Y. Shibasaki F.

To investigate if the phosphatase PP2B controls SSH1 activity by regulating its phosphorylation in Ser978, sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions in the absence or presence of PP2B-specific inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA; 5 μM). As shown in Figure 7A, CsA did not prevent the phosphorylation decrease observed in SSH1 at 40 min, indicating that activation of SSH1 is independent of PP2B. As expected, pCOFILIN levels were also unaffected in the presence of CsA (Fig. 7B). Okadaic acid (OA)–sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, were reported to participate in the regulation of crucial events that occur during sperm capacitation (40Krapf D. Arcelay E.

The infectious nature of the disease has led to significant changes in social interactions in everyday life. The present study examined how older adults’ patterns of everyday momentary social interactions (i.e., with no one, partner, family, and friends) and their affect varied across the early stages of the pandemic and whether the magnitude of affective benefits associated with social interactions changed across time. A total of 188 adults aged 50 or above (M age = 62.05) completed momentary assessments in early March, late March, May, and July 2020. Overall, older adults spent more time in solitude and less time interacting with their friends after the declaration of the pandemic. Further, negative affect (NA) spiked after the pandemic declaration and then returned to pre-pandemic level. Finally, momentary interactions with close social ties were consistently associated with higher positive affect (PA) and lower NA whereas momentary solitude was associated with lower PA, but not related to NA. The magnitude of associations between specific social interactions (or solitude) and affect varied across time, and the onset of the pandemic appeared associated with this variation. During the presumably most stressful period, solitude was not associated with lower PA and family interaction was not associated with higher PA as they were at other times. Further, interactions with friends seemed to have diminished affective benefits following the onset of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4225162043,"Grapholita molesta (Busck) is a major pest in orchards of apple, peach, and plum. For better rearing in the laboratory, we compared the life history characteristics of G. molesta by providing larvae with either punctured or unpunctured apple fruits. The development time of immatures and the fecundity of adult females were similar between punctured and unpunctured apples. However, the overall survival rate of G. molesta (larvae to adult emergence) was 1.7 times higher on punctured apples than unpunctured ones, resulting in a higher intrinsic rate of population increase. Therefore, punctured apples would be a better food source for rearing of G. molesta."
https://openalex.org/W4225262018,"We take the stock prices as a dynamic system and characterize its movements by a newly derived dynamic model, called the new Price Reversion Model (nPRM), for which the solution is derived and carefully analyzed under different circumstances. We also develop a procedure of applying the nPRM to real daily closing prices of a stock index. This proposed procedure brings a different perspective to the study of stock prices based on thermodynamics, and the time varying coefficients in the nPRM offer economic meanings of the stock movements. More specifically, the average of smoothed historical data A in the nPRM, analogous to the environment temperature in the Newton’s law of cooling, represent an implied equilibrium price. The heat transfer coefficient κ is adapted to be either negative or positive, which illustrates the speed of convergence or divergence of stock prices, respectively. The empirical study of ten Asian stock indexes shows that the nPRM accurately characterizes and forecasts the market values."
https://openalex.org/W4225262691,"The detection of surface parameters of pressure vessel welds guarantees safe operation. To address the problems of low efficiency and poor accuracy of traditional manual inspection methods, a method for welding morphological parameters combined with vision and structured light is proposed in this study. First, a feature point extraction algorithm for weld parameters based on deep convolution was proposed. An accurate extraction method of weld image feature point coordinates was designed based on the combination of the loss function via seam undercut feature recognition and weld feature point extraction network structure. Second, a training data enhancement method based on the third-order non-uniform rational B-spline ( NURBS ) curve was proposed to reduce the amount of data collection for training. Finally, a pressure vessel measurement device was designed, and the feature point extraction performance of the deep network and common feature point extraction networks, DeepLabCut and HR-net, proposed in this study were compared to analyze the theoretical accuracy of the surface parameter measurement. The results indicated that the theoretical accuracy of the parameter measurements was within 0.065 mm."
https://openalex.org/W4225264596,"St. Augustinegrass is a warm-season grass species widely utilized as turf in the southeastern U.S. It shows significant variation in plant growth and morphological characteristics, some of which are potentially associated with drought tolerance. However, the genetic basis of these variations is not well understood. Detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with morphological traits will provide a foundation for the application of genetic and molecular breeding in St. Augustinegrass. In this study, we report QTL associated with morphological traits, including leaf blade width (LW), leaf blade length (LL), canopy density (CD), and shoot growth orientation (SGO) in a St. Augustinegrass 'Raleigh' x 'Seville' mapping population containing 115 F1 hybrids. Phenotypic data were collected from one greenhouse and two field trials. Single and joint trial analyses were performed, finding significant phenotypic variance among the hybrids for all traits. Interval mapping (IM) and multiple QTL method (MQM) analysis detected seven QTL for CD, four for LL, five for LW, and two for SGO, which were distributed on linkage groups RLG1, RLG9, SLG3, SLG7, SLG8 and SLG9. In addition, three genomic regions where QTL colocalized were identified on Raleigh LG1 and Seville LG3. One genomic region on Seville LG3 overlapped with two previously reported drought-related QTL for leaf relative water content (RWC) and percent green cover (GC). Several candidate genes related to plant development and drought stress response were identified within QTL intervals. The QTL identified in this study represent a first step in identifying genes controlling morphological traits that might accelerate progress in selection of St. Augustinegrass lines with lower water usage."
https://openalex.org/W4225265415,"The objective of this study was to investigate the nutritional quality of bovine colostrum and whey mixtures. Five whey with bovine colostrum formulations were prepared (90:10; 80:20; 70:30; 60:40 and 50:50 whey:colostrum v:v) to be subjected to low-temperature pasteurization (63°C to 65°C for 30 minutes) and freeze-drying. The samples underwent chemical composition characterization, fatty acid profile analysis, determination of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae, pH, and Dornic acidity measurements before and after vat pasteurization. The amount of protein, fat, total solids, defatted dry extract, Brix and density increased as the bovine colostrum concentration increased. The level of saturated fatty acids and the thrombogenicity and atherogenicity indices reduced, while unsaturated fatty acids increased as the level of added bovine colostrum increased. The low-temperature pasteurization of the formulations was possible and effective, eliminating contamination by Enterobacteriaceae in the samples. Mixing bovine colostrum and whey reduced the colostrum viscosity, allowing a successful pasteurization procedure. Due to colostrum composition, the formulations yielded a higher nutritional value when compared to whey alone. The parameters applied in the formulation of mixtures of bovine colostrum and whey resulted in valuable ingredients for preparing novel dairy products."
https://openalex.org/W4225268941,"The aim of the present preregistered study was to examine whether expressive writing can help teacher students to develop functional expected teaching-related emotions. In a variation of James W. Pennebaker´s expressive writing paradigm, 129 teacher students were randomly assigned to write on three consecutive days either about the future teaching-related events that personally trigger the greatest fear and joy (treatment group: n = 67) or about a walk in a forest and a city park (control group: n = 62). In both groups, expected teaching-related positive emotions increased and expected teaching-related negative emotions decreased with increased writing sessions. After the writing sessions, the treatment group reported a stronger change in their view about their future professional life as a teacher, a more active personal involvement with their future professional life, and an increased motivation to use expressive writing in the future. These results demonstrate that expressive writing is a promising tool to promote teacher students’ expected teaching-related emotions."
https://openalex.org/W4225281118,"Open source software (OSS) has become one of the modern software development methods. OSS is mainly developed by developers, volunteers, and users all over the world, but its reliability has been widely questioned. When OSS faults are detected, volunteers or users send them to developers by email or network. After the developer confirms the fault, it will be randomly assigned to the debugger who may be a developer, a volunteer, or a user. These open source community contributors also have the phenomenon of learning when removing faults. When the detected faults are removed, the number of introduced faults decreases gradually. Therefore, this study proposes a software reliability model with the decreasing trend of fault introduction in the process of OSS development and testing. The validity of the proposed model and the accuracy of estimating residual faults are verified by experiments. The proposed model can be used to evaluate the reliability and predict the remaining faults in the actual OSS development and testing process."
https://openalex.org/W4225894895,"Introduction Vision is critical for children’s development. However, prevalence of visual impairment (VI) is high in students with special educational needs (SEN). Other than VI, SEN students are prone to having functional deficits. Whether visual problems relate to these functional deficits is unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of vision on visual processing functions and balance in SEN students through a community service. Methods Visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity were measured in a total of 104 (aged 14.3±4.3) SEN students as the visual outcomes, followed by retinoscopy. Visual processing function assessment included facial expression recognition by card matching examiner’s facial expression matching, and visual orientation recognition. Dynamic balance, by Timed Up and Go test, and static standing balance (postural sway in double-legged standing with feet-together and tandem-stance for open-eye and closed-eye conditions) were assessed. Static balance was presented in terms of the maximal medial-lateral and antero-posterior sways. Results Of the 104 students, 62 (59.6%) were classified as visually impaired according to WHO classification of visual impairment based on presenting distance acuity. Ocular problems (e.g. optic nerve anomaly, uncorrected/ under-corrected refractive errors) and neurological anomalies were the major causes of vision loss. VA was positively associated with visual processing functions (all p ≤ 0.01), as SEN students with better vision tended to perform better in visual orientation and facial expression recognition tasks, as well as dynamic balance function (p = 0.04). For the static balance, postural sway and VA showed a positive relationship under open-eye and tandem stance conditions. However, the relationship between postural sway and VA became negative under closed-eye and tandem stance conditions. Conclusion This study found a high prevalence of SEN students with visual impairment, in which many of them were undetected. Optometric examination is important to improve their visual function to minimize the effect of vision on functional performance. Vision is critical in visual processing as well as playing an important role in maintaining balance in SEN students."
