https://openalex.org/W2022545034,"1) Three indices of global climate have been monitored in the record of the past 450,000 years in Southern Hemisphere ocean-floor sediments. 2) Over the frequency range 10(-4) to 10(-5) cycle per year, climatic variance of these records is concentrated in three discrete spectral peaks at periods of 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years. These peaks correspond to the dominant periods of the earth's solar orbit, and contain respectively about 10, 25, and 50 percent of the climatic variance. 3) The 42,000-year climatic component has the same period as variations in the obliquity of the earth's axis and retains a constant phase relationship with it. 4) The 23,000-year portion of the variance displays the same periods (about 23,000 and 19,000 years) as the quasi-periodic precession index. 5) The dominant, 100,000-year climatic [See table in the PDF file] component has an average period close to, and is in phase with, orbital eccentricity. Unlike the correlations between climate and the higher-frequency orbital variations (which can be explained on the assumption that the climate system responds linearly to orbital forcing), an explanation of the correlation between climate and eccentricity probably requires an assumption of nonlinearity. 6) It is concluded that changes in the earth's orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of the succession of Quaternary ice ages. 7) A model of future climate based on the observed orbital-climate relationships, but ignoring anthropogenic effects, predicts that the long-term trend over the next sevem thousand years is toward extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation."

These observations confirm the basic mechanism, proposed in 1958, that type III radio emissions are produced by intense electron plasma oscillations excited in the solor corona by electrons ejected from a solar flare."

These decreases are at- tributable to the sympathetic denervation which necessarily accompanies the operative procedure. Myocardial histamine levels in survivors of this operation were not significantly different from those of normal dogs.
https://openalex.org/W2003149889,"A landlocked lake of sodium-mixed-anion type in lower Taylor Valley has a salinity ranging from 1/35 to 1/5 that of sea water. The lake seems to be chemically stratified into three distinct layers. Several possible sources are postulated for the dissolved salts. The chemical zonation may have been initiated by past climatic variation; however, a thermal or magmatic origin for some of the waters is also indicated. No single origin for the lake waters or the stratification seems likely."

https://openalex.org/W2030436412,"Large numbers of black metallic spherules ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to over 800 micrometers are raining into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and adjacent areas of western Florida. The composition of the flux, its association with glass spherules and coky particles, and its magnitude point to industrial pollution, probably coal- and coke-burning facilities around the perimeter of the gulf, as the source. Since metallic particles represent only a small fraction of most fly ash, such an influx of large numbers of black magnetic spherules must be symptomatic of a much higher rate of sedimentation of fly ash. The internal microstructures and the general appearance of spherules derived from industrial processes are similar to those of particles derived from cosmic sources. Because of the high potential for contamination in micrometeorite studies, a complete compositional verification of each ""cosmic"" particle may be necessary."

https://openalex.org/W1998738154,"All males of the weevil Pissodes terminalis Hopp. are heterozygous for an autosomal fusion (cc â†’ C); all females are homozygous (CC). A mechanism is operative whereby union of like gametes gives rise to females and of unlike gametes gives rise to males, and union of half-alike gametes is totally excluded. The perpetuation of this sexual dimorphism of karyotypes following crossing implicates P. yosemite Hopk. in the hybrid origin of P. terminalis.."
