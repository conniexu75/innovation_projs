Our data show that incorporation of n-3 fatty acids (but not other polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acids) into articular cartilage chondrocyte membranes results in a dose-dependent reduction in: (i) the expression and activity of proteoglycan degrading enzymes (aggrecanases) and (ii) the expression of inflammation-inducible cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1α and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2), but not the constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase COX-1. These findings provide evidence thatn-3 fatty acid supplementation can specifically affect regulatory mechanisms involved in chondrocyte gene transcription and thus further advocate a beneficial role for dietary fish oil supplementation in alleviation of several of the physiological parameters that cause and propogate arthritic disease.

Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 2.Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Dewitt D.L. J. Biol.

Parenthetically, clinical studies on dietary supplementation withn-3 (omega-3) fatty acids (the principle long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oils) have also demonstrated modulation of inflammatory symptoms involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis (3.Volker D. Garg M. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 1996; 20: 83-87Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4.Kremer J.M. Lipids. 1996; 31: S243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ariza-Ariza R. Mestanza-Peralta M. Cardiel M.H. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 27: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Such epidemiological observations have been largely anecdotal, because they did not investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby dietary n-3 fatty acid supplementation might affect the metabolism of cells within articular joint tissues and thereby provide relief to arthritic symptoms. Significantly, however, dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids elicits antiinflammatory effects in neutrophils and monocytes by inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase pathway responsible for metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes (6.Lee T.H. Hoover R.L. Williams J.D. Sperling R.I. Ravalese J. Spur B.W. Robinson D.R. Corey E.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, n-3 fatty acid supplementation can also suppress phospholipase C-mediated signal transduction (7.Sperling R.I. Benincaso A.I. Knoell C.T. Larkin J.K. Austen K.F. Robinson D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating additional molecular mechanisms whereby n-3 fatty acids can specifically affect cell metabolism. One of the key pathological features common to degenerative joint diseases (arthritis) is the loss of cartilage proteoglycan (aggrecan), which precedes subsequent cartilage erosion. Catabolism of aggrecan is mediated by the proteolytic activity of aggrecanases (8.Sandy J.D. Flannery C.R. Neame P.J. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9.Hughes C.E. Little C.B. Büttner F.H. Bartnik E. Caterson B. J. Biol.

Aggrecanase activity is up-regulated by cartilage exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α, and model cartilage explant and chondrocyte culture systems stimulated with IL-1 or TNF-α mimic the degradative processes involving aggrecan catabolism which occur during arthritis (14.Sandy J.D.

Tortorella M.D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1998; 6: 214-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, exposure to these inflammatory mediators propogates the autocrine synthesis of cartilage cytokines, which contribute to the chronic progression of arthritis. Furthermore, cytokine-induced degradative activities in synovial joint tissues can be potentiated via the biosynthesis of inflammatory eicosanoids by the cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 (1.Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 2.Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Dewitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues, is responsible for key aspects of eicosanoid biosynthesis, which are important in maintaining homeostasis during normal cellular metabolism (19.Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, COX-2 expression and activity is induced during inflammation, and it is this enzyme that is selectively involved in inflammatory aspects of arthritic disease (20.Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. McGarity K.L. Bremer M.E. Isakson P.C. Gregory S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 21.Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Ristimaki A.P. Sano H. Remmers E.F. Epps H.R. Hla T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Consequently, modulation of COX-2 activity has been a major target of pharmaceutical companies for intervention in the pathogenesis of arthritis (22.Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Moreno J. de Toro F.J. Galdo F. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 1366-1373PubMed Google Scholar). To determine a molecular basis for potential therapeutic properties associated with dietary intake of fish oils, we investigated the effects of different classes of fatty acids on the expression and activity of cartilage aggrecanases, cytokines (IL-1α and TNF-α) and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). The results of these in vitro studies reveal that exposure of articular chondrocytes ton-3 fatty acids can specifically modulate, at the level of gene transcription, key factors involved in articular cartilage degradation. Bovine articular cartilage was obtained from the metacarpo- and metatarsophalangeal joints of 7-day-old calves. Cartilage tissue slices were dissected under sterile conditions and subjected to standard Pronase and collagenase digestion to isolate the chondrocytes as described previously (9.Hughes C.E. Little C.B. Büttner F.H. Bartnik E. Caterson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures were established in 60-mm diameter culture dishes by plating 1 ml/dish of a suspension of 6 × 106 chondrocytes/ml of DMEM (∼2 × 105 cells/cm2). Cultures were maintained for 8 h in the absence or presence (10–100 μg/ml) of polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (α18:3 linolenate, 2Approved nomenclature (trivial names) for fatty acids is as recommended by the IUPAC-IUB. 20:5 eicosapentaenoate or 22:6 docosahexaenoate), a polyunsaturatedn-6 fatty acid (18:2 linoleate), a saturated fatty acid (16:0 palmitate), or a monounsaturated fatty acid (18:1 oleate). All fatty acids were minimum 99% purity from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Poole, United Kingdom. Prior to their addition to culture media, fatty acids were incubated as described (23.Sicard B. Lagarde M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 53: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for 16 h at 37 °C in Tyrode-HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 3.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine albumin (Fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) at a ratio of 3:1 fatty acid:albumin. The culture medium was removed and then replaced with fresh medium (without fatty acid) supplemented with or without 10 ng/ml IL-1α. Chondrocyte cell layers were harvested using a rubber policeman and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml deionized water and sonicated for 30 min in an ultrasonic water bath. Once complete lysis of the cells had been achieved, extraction of the lipids was performed (24.Garbus J. DeLuca H.F. Loomans M.E. Strong F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 59-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of cell lysate was mixed with 3.75 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) and incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. Following the addition of 1.25 ml of chloroform and 1.25 ml of Garbus solution (2 m KCl, 0.5 m KPO4, pH 7.4), the chloroform phase of all mixtures was dried down in a stream of nitrogen. Generation of fatty acid methyl esters was achieved by addition of H2SO4 (2.5%) in anhydrous methanol (1%). As an internal standard an appropriate quantity of pentadecaenoic acid (15:0) was added. After sealing, the tubes were heated for 2 h at 70 °C. The tubes were then cooled and 2.5 ml of 5% NaCl was added. The methyl esters were extracted three times with 3 ml of petroleum ether, dried down in a stream of nitrogen, and then redissolved in chromatographically pure petroleum ether. The methyl esters were analyzed using gas chromatography, with the yields of fatty acid being calculated from the known amount of internal standard. Cellular DNA content of all chondrocyte cultures was measured using the Hoechst 33258 dye DNA assay (25.Kim Y.-J. Sah R.L.Y. Doong J.-Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Proteoglycan synthesis was measured by radiolabeling cultures for 96 h with [35S]sulfuric acid (20 μCi/ml). Unincorporated radiolabel was removed from the culture media and cell layer extracts using a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and total counts/min in the void volume measured. The concentration of lactate in culture media was measured using a commercial lactate assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). The expression of mRNAs for two genes which are characteristic of the chondrocyte phenotype (i.e. aggrecan and collagen type II) was assessed by RT-PCR as described below. To detect the occurrence of aggrecanase or matrix metalloproteinase activity in the monolayer cultures, portions of conditioned media containing an equivalent quantity of proteoglycan metabolites (measured by dimethylmethylene blue assay (26.Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar)) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described previously (9.Hughes C.E. Little C.B. Büttner F.H. Bartnik E. Caterson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, after deglycosylation with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), keratanase and keratanase II (Seikagaku/AMS Biotechnology, Abingdon, UK), aggrecan fragments were separated on 4–12% gradient gels (Novex, Frankfurt, Germany) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were then probed using monoclonal antibody BC-3 (which specifically recognizes the aggrecanase-generated neoepitope N-terminal sequence 374ARGSV … on aggrecan metabolites) or monoclonal antibody BC-14 (which specifically recognizes the matrix metalloproteinase-generated neoepitope N-terminal sequence 342FFGVG … on aggrecan metabolites) (9.Hughes C.E. Little C.B. Büttner F.H. Bartnik E. Caterson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bovine chondrocyte monolayer cultures were extracted by direct addition of Tri-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Following the addition of chloroform (0.2 ml/1 ml of Tri-Reagent) and centrifugation for 20 min at ∼16,000 ×g, total RNA from the aqueous phase of all extracts was isolated using Rneasy mini-columns and reagents (Qiagen, Crawley, Ltd., Crawley, UK). Because spectrophotometric analyses revealed a reasonable, but relatively low, yield of total RNA (approximately 20 μg/60-mm culture dish), we utilized RT-PCR methods to examine chondrocyte gene transcription. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription and PCR amplification was performed as described (27.Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Caterson B. Hughes C.E. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to cDNA sequences for aggrecan (CGCTACGACGCCATCTGCTAC and GCCTGCTGTGCCTCCTCAAA; GenBankTM accession number M55172), collagen II-αI (TGCCTGGTGCTCCTGGTCTGA and CTTCTCCCTTCTCGCCGTTAG; GenBankTM accession number X16711), aggrecanase-1 (ACCACTTTGACACAGCCATTC and ACCCCCACAGGTCCGAGAGCA; GenBankTMaccession number AF148213), aggrecanase-2 (TGTGCTGTGATTGAAGACGAT and GACTGCAGGAGCGGTAGATGG; GenBankTM accession numberAF142099), COX-1 (GCCCAACACTTCACCCATCAG and CCAGGAAGCAGCCCAAACACT; GenBankTM accession number AF004943), COX-2 (GCTCTTCCTCCTGTGCCTGAT and CATGGTTCTTTCCCTTAGTGA; GenBankTMaccession number AF004944), IL-1α (AAGGAGAATGTGGTGATGGTG and CAGAAGAAGAGGAGGTTGGTC; GenBankTM accession numberM37210), TNF-α (CTCAAGCCTCAAGTAACAAGC and GCAATGATCCCAAAGTAGACC; GenBankTM accession number Z48808), and GAPDH (TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCAT and GTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGAAGTC; GenBankTM accession number X01677). PCR products were separated on 3% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and their nucleotide sequences verified using an Applied Biosystems 310 Genetic Analyzer. The cDNA sequences obtained for bovine aggrecanase-1 and aggrecanase-2 have been deposited to GenBankTM under accession numbers AF192770 and AF192771. In this study, articular cartilage chondrocytes were exposed in culture to fatty acids at concentrations which cover the typical range (50–70 μg/ml) for free fatty acid levels in human plasma (28.Bang H.O. Dyerberg J. Nielsen A.B. Lancet. 1971; 1: 1143-1146Abstract PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The results for measurements of the lipid content of chondrocytes supplemented without or with a polyunsaturated n-3 (α18:3 linolenate) or a saturated (16:0 palmitate) fatty acid are shown in Table I. Exposure to the n-3 fatty acid markedly changed the overall lipid composition profile of the chondrocyte with major changes occurring in the supplemented fatty acid (e.g. α18:3 linolenate), with a concomitant reduction in other polyunsaturated fatty acids. Similarly, supplementation with 16:0 palmitate markedly altered the level of this fatty acid in the chondrocyte lipid composition profile, again at the expense of polyunsaturated fatty acid components. Replicate cultures, with or without prior fatty acid supplementation, were then cultured for a further 96 h in the absence or presence of IL-1α. Proteoglycan synthesis, as measured by [35S]sulfate incorporation, was decreased in chondrocyte cultures treated with IL-1α compared with controls as has been reported previously (29.Tyler J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, prior addition of fatty acids to the cultures had no effect on these changes in proteoglycan synthesis or in cell numbers, DNA content or morphology, nor in levels of lactate secreted into the medium (results not shown), thus demonstrating that fatty acid supplementation was not toxic to the chondrocytes. Furthermore, unaltered expression of mRNAs for aggrecan and collagen type II confirmed maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype in the experimental cultures (results not shown).Table IFatty acid analysis of chondrocyte membranes from cultures treated with (+) or without (−) 100 μg/ml n-3 polyunsaturated or saturated fatty acidsPercentage of total fatty acids in membranesFatty acid measuredn-3 fatty acid-treated (α18:3 linolenate)Saturated fatty acid-treated (16:0 palmitate)−+−+α18:3 linolenateaPolyunsaturated fatty acid.NDbND, none detected.14.0NDNDγ18:3 linolenateaPolyunsaturated fatty acid.6.13.19.35.018:2 linoleateaPolyunsaturated fatty acid.13.210.410.13.220:4 arachidonateaPolyunsaturated fatty acid.2.81.24.11.616:1 palmitoleatecMonounsaturated fatty acid.7.05.49.79.318:1 oleatecMonounsaturated fatty acid.32.831.232.335.816:0 palmitatedSaturated fatty acid.21.519.618.631.718:0 stearatedSaturated fatty acid.16.515.116.113.4Data are the mean values for cells harvested from two different animals.a Polyunsaturated fatty acid.b ND, none detected.c Monounsaturated fatty acid.d Saturated fatty acid. Open table in a new tab Data are the mean values for cells harvested from two different animals. The effect of fatty acid supplementation on chondrocyte aggrecanase activity was then investigated (Fig. 1). There was no evidence for aggrecanase activity in conditioned medium from control cultures supplemented with either n-3 (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2) or saturated fatty acids (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). Exposure to IL-1, as expected (8.Sandy J.D. Flannery C.R. Neame P.J. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), did induce aggrecanase activity in these conditioned media (Fig. 1, A and B,lane 3, respectively). However, addition of then-3 fatty acid α18:3 linolenate abolished this IL-1-induced aggrecanase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6). In contrast, supplementation with 16:0 palmitate had no effect on aggrecanase activity (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). In replicate studies, no evidence for matrix metalloproteinase-mediated aggrecan cleavage was observed for cultures maintained in the absence or presence of either n-3 or saturated fatty acids (results not shown). In keeping with the observed loss of aggrecanase-mediated proteolytic activity in IL-1-treated chondrocyte conditioned medium, there was also a decrease in the levels of mRNA transcripts for aggrecanase-1 and aggrecanase-2 in response to n-3 fatty acid supplementation (Fig. 2). Aggrecanase-1 mRNA was detected in IL-1-treated, but not control, cultures, whereas mRNA for aggrecanase-2 was detected both in the presence and absence of IL-1 (Fig. 2, A and B,lanes 1 and 2). However, addition of then-3 fatty acid α18:3 linolenate caused a decrease in both aggrecanase-1 and aggrecanase-2 transcript levels (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3–5). In contrast, cultures supplemented with 16:0 palmitate expressed aggrecanase-1 and aggrecanase-2 mRNAs at all concentrations of fatty acid tested (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5). The addition of the vehicle for fatty acid supplementation (fatty acid-free albumin) had no effect on either aggrecanase-1 or -2 expression in the control or IL-1-treated cultures (results not shown). Expression of GAPDH was used to normalize the amount of mRNA present in all samples.Figure 2Effect of fatty acid supplementation on expression of chondrocyte aggrecanase-1 and aggrecanase-2 mRNAs. Cultures were supplemented with or without increasing amounts of n-3 α18:3 linolenate (A) or 16:0 palmitate (B) and subsequently treated with (+) or without (−) IL-1. Total RNA was extracted and amplified by RT-PCR. The size of PCR products (in base pairs) relative to the migration of DNA size standards is indicated to the right of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the effect of supplementation with n-3 fatty acids versus other fatty acids on COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression and on the expression of IL-1α and TNF-α mRNAs in chondrocyte cultures exposed to exogenous IL-1 (Fig.3). Chondrocyte COX-1 mRNA was present in all culture systems, with or without fatty acid supplementation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–5). However, chondrocyte COX-2 expression was detected in IL-1-treated, but not control, cultures (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2). Significantly, COX-2 mRNA expression in IL-1-treated cultures was decreased by n-3 fatty acid (α18:3 linolenate) supplementation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5). In contrast, addition of a saturated fatty acid (16:0 palmitate) had no such effect on IL-1-induced COX-2 expression (data not shown). Examination of chondrocyte-derived cytokine expression revealed that the mRNAs for IL-1α and TNF-α were absent in control cultures (Fig. 3 B, lane 1), but these were detected following exposure to exogenous IL-1α (Fig.3 B, lane 2). However, expression of chondrocyte IL-1α and TNF-α mRNAs was decreased in n-3 fatty acid-treated cultures (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5), but not in cultures supplemented with saturated fatty acids (data not shown). Identical results to those shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 were obtained when two other n-3 fatty acids found in fish oils (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) were added to the culture systems, and no effects were observed when either an n-6 fatty acid (linoleic acid) or a monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) were supplemented (data not shown). These results conclusively indicate that the observed effects on the expression of chondrocyte aggrecanases, COX-2, and autocrine cytokines are specific to supplementation withn-3 (omega-3) fatty acids. Collectively, these data provide informative novel information on the biological and molecular mechanisms whereby dietary fish oil supplementation can reduce inflammatory and degradative aspects of articular joint disease and thus modulate disease progression. The balance of dietary n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is well known to affect inflammatory responses (30.Okuyama H. Kobayashi T. Watanabe S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 409-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-6 series, such as linoleic acid, are intimately involved in the production of inflammatory eicosanoids (31.Griswold D.E. Adams J.L. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 181-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can interfere with this process at, for example, the desaturation steps or by producing alternative eicosanoids with different activities (32.Gurr M.I. Harwood J.L. Lipid Biochemistry: An Introduction. 4 th Ed. Chapman and Hall, London1991Google Scholar). On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests thatn-3 fatty acids can regulate gene expression via activation of transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α or by affecting expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (33.Kim H.-J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25892-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Whereas such mechanisms remain to be investigated in chondrocytes, our current findings demonstrate thatn-3 fatty acid supplementation can specifically affect molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of catabolic factors involved in articular cartilage degradation and thus further advocate a beneficial role for dietary fish oils in alleviation of several of the physiological parameters that cause and propogate arthritic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2121210640,"We describe the characterization of siglec-8, a novel sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin that is expressed specifically by eosinophils. A full-length cDNA encoding siglec-8 was isolated from a human eosinophil cDNA library. Siglec-8 is predicted to contain three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail of 47 amino acids. Thesiglec-8 gene mapped on chromosome 19q13.33–41, closely linked to genes encoding CD33 (siglec-3), siglec-5, siglec-6, and siglec-7. When siglec-8 was expressed on COS cells or as a recombinant protein fused to the Fc region of human IgG1, it was able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding to human erythrocytes and to soluble sialoglycoconjugates. Using specific monoclonal antibodies, siglec-8 could be detected only on eosinophils and hence appears to be the first example of an eosinophil-specific transmembrane receptor.

Using specific monoclonal antibodies, siglec-8 could be detected only on eosinophils and hence appears to be the first example of an eosinophil-specific transmembrane receptor. sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin Chinese hamster ovary cells complement receptor type 1 expressed sequence tag biotinylated polyacrylamide Galβ1,4Glc coupled to PAA monoclonal antibody myelin-associated glycoprotein the three extracellular domains of siglec-8 coupled to the Fc part of human IgG1 3 SL-PAA, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc coupled to PAA 6 SL-PAA, NeuAcα2,6 Galβ1,4Glc coupled to PAA the three extracellular domains of siglec-8 coupled to the Fc part of human IgM polymerase chain reaction red blood cells enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay fluorescence-activated cell sorter fetal calf serum natural killer cells Sialic acid binding Ig-likelectins (siglecs)1 are type 1 membrane proteins that constitute a distinct subset of the Ig superfamily and are characterized by their sequence similarities and abilities to bind sialic acids in glycoproteins and glycolipids (1.Crocker P.R.

Apart from MAG, which is found exclusively in the nervous system, all siglecs characterized to date are expressed on discrete subsets of hemopoietic cells and can provide useful lineage-restricted markers. Thus, CD22 is present only on mature B cells (16.Dorken B. Moldenhauer G. Pezzutto A. Schwartz R. Feller A. Kiesel S. Nadler L. J.

These expression patterns indicate discrete functions among hemopoietic cell subsets, but apart from CD22, a well characterized negative regulator of B cell activation (reviewed in Ref. 19.Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 509-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the biological functions of siglecs expressed in the hemopoietic system are unknown. Proposed functions include cell-cell interactions through recognition of sialylated glycoconjugates on other cells. However, a number of studies have also shown that cell-cell adhesion mediated by siglecs can be modulated bycis-interactions with sialic acids present in the host plasma membrane; this is particularly striking for CD22, CD33, and siglec-5, whose binding activities can be greatly increased if host cells are pretreated with sialidase to remove thecis-competing sialic acids (4.Freeman S.D.

In addition to potential roles in cellular interactions, there is growing evidence that, similar to CD22, the more recently characterized siglecs are involved in signaling functions. Falco and colleagues (9.Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp.

The cytoplasmic tails of CD33/siglec-3 and siglec-5, -6, and -7 have two well conserved tyrosine-based motifs that are similar to signaling motifs in other leukocyte receptors (21.Gergely J. Pecht I. Sarmay G. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residues of CD33 and siglec-7 can be phosphorylated, leading to recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in the case of CD33 (14.Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and SHP-1 in the case of siglec-7 (9.Falco M. Biassoni R.

In this study, we describe the characterization of siglec-8, a new member of the siglec family. This protein is able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding to cells and soluble glycoconjugates either when expressed on COS cells or as a recombinant protein immobilized on plastic. Using two mAbs raised to the extracellular region of siglec-8, we demonstrate that this protein is expressed specifically on eosinophilic granulocytes, indicating a specialized role of siglec-8 in eosinophil biology. Unless indicated otherwise, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose, protein G-Sepharose, dextran T70, and Percoll were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,Vibrio cholerae sialidase from Calbiochem, and125I-labeled streptavidin (20–40 mCi/mg) and ECLTM detection kits from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protran nitrocellulose paper was from Schleicher & Schuell. Biotinylated polyacrylamide (PAA) glycoconjugates carrying either NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc (2,3 SL-PAA), NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4Glc (2,6 SL-PAA), or lactose (L-PAA) were purchased from Syntesome (Munich, Germany). These conjugates have a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa and contain 20% mol of saccharide and 5% mol of biotin. Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD16 mAb was purchased from Serotec (Kidlington, UK). Anti-CD16 mAb-coupled magnetic microbeads were from Miltenyi Biotech (Bisley, UK). Streptavidin-coupled to horseradish peroxidase was from Vector (Peterborough, UK). 4–12% gradient gels were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA). The NHS-Sulfo-Biotin was from Pierce. Immulon 3 microtiter plates were from Dynatech Laboratories Inc. (Chantilly, VA). The pIGplus plasmid was purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and pcDNA3 plasmid was from British Biotechnology (Oxford, UK). The IgM-Fc plasmid was generously provided by Dr. E. Kawasaki (Procept Inc., Cambridge, MA). A cDNA encoding full-length complement receptor type I (CR1) in the pcDM8 vector was kindly provided by Professor D. Fearon (Cambridge, UK). Using the amino acid sequence of CD33, a specific homology search was performed against a data base containing more than one million expression sequence tags (ESTs) obtained from over 700 different cDNA libraries. A full-length clone in pSPORT1 (Life Technologies Inc.) encoding one of the CD33-like sequences identified in the search was isolated from a human eosinophil library and designated pHEONN73. A computer search of nucleotide and protein sequences was carried out using the Blast GeneSearch (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Manipulations of sequences and alignments were performed using Baylor College of Medicine molecular biology software available on the internet (Human Genome Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). A 826-base pair XhoI fragment, corresponding to the last 347 bases of the coding sequence and the first 479 bases of 3′ untranslated sequence from pHEONN73, was labeled with 32P by random priming using the Ready-To-Go DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and two human multiple tissue Northern blots from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized according to the manufacturers' instructions. The blots contained approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from the following tissues: peripheral blood leukocytes, colon, small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. The chromosomal localization of the siglec-8 gene was determined by single-copy gene fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH) to human male metaphase chromosome spreads as described (6.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant chimeras containing the entire extracellular region of siglec-8 fused to either the Fc region of human IgG1 (siglec-8-Fc) or the Fc region of human IgM (siglec-8-Fc-IgM) were generated by PCR using pHEONN73 as template. For siglec-8-Fc, the following forward and reverse primers were used (5′-3′): ACAAGCTTGCGCCTTCAAACCCAGACATG and ACTCTAGATTGTGATACAGGTCTTGAGGT. The PCR product was cloned in-frame into the pIGplus vector, which encodes a Factor Xa cleavage site between the extracellular region and the hinge region of the Fc portion of human IgG1. For siglec-8-Fc-IgM protein, the same forward primer and the reverse primer (5′-3′) ACGGATCCTTGTGATACAGGTCTTGAGGT were used; the PCR product likewise was cloned in-frame into the IgM plasmid. Plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells by DEAE-transfection, and Fc-proteins were purified from the conditioned supernatants as described for IgG-based chimeras or by affinity chromatography on anti-IgM-Sepharose in the case of siglec-8-Fc-IgM. For binding assays to siglec-8 expressed in COS cells, a SalI-NotI fragment containing the entire cDNA insert from pHEONN73 was blunted and cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with this plasmid, and binding assays with RBC carried out 48 h later as described (5.Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. de Bellard M.E.

For solid-phase binding assays, untreated or sialidase-treated RBC were added to wells of microtiter plates that had been coated with Fc-proteins via anti-human Fc IgG (5.Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R.

COS cells were transfected transiently with full-length cDNAs encoding either siglec-8 or human CR1 (CD35) as a control. After two days the COS cells were treated with V. cholerae sialidase as described (5.Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. de Bellard M.E. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A. Bradfield P.

Wells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 125I-labeled streptavidin in the same buffer at 0.5 μCi/ml for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, bound radioactivity was solubilized by adding 0.1 m NaOH and counted using a Beckman γ-counter. The percentage of COS cells expressing the transfected cDNAs was between 20 and 30% as determined by FACS analysis. Purified recombinant siglec-8-Fc was cleaved with Factor Xa (6.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the purified extracellular region was used to immunize a group of three female BALB/C mice, using 2 μg of protein/injection following a standard procedure (22.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-243Google Scholar). The mice were boosted intravenously with 10 μg of siglec-8-IgM-Fc and given a final injection 2 weeks later with 10 μg of intact siglec-8-Fc. Fusions were carried out 4 days later using the SP2 myeloma as described (22.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-243Google Scholar). Supernatants containing anti-siglec-8 mAbs were screened by ELISA using siglec-8-Fc bound to plastic wells as described above for the adhesion assay. Positive hybridomas were cloned three times by limiting dilution. Immunoprecipitations from lysates of surface biotinylated cells were carried out as described (22.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-243Google Scholar). The Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cell Production Service provided the following cell lines: COS-1, 293T, U251MG, A2780, HL-60, U937, THP-1, Daudi, Jurkat, K562, and KG1b. The Copeletti and H71b cell lines were from Dr. A. Prescott, SySy5y, HeLa, and MRC-5 lines from Dr. S. Ponnambalam, and HaCat cells were provided by Dr. B. Lane. Stable CHO cell lines expressing CD33 and siglec-5, -7, and -8 were generated as described (8.Nicoll G. Ni J. Li D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.-G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), and CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium with 5% FCS. Other cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 or 10% FCS. Human red blood cells (RBC) were obtained from healthy donors and stored at 4 °C in Alsever's solution for up to 2 weeks. Human blood leukocytes were obtained from whole blood by sedimentation of RBC in 6% dextran T70. Granulocytes were enriched on Percoll step gradients as described (23.Haslett C. Condliffe A. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. IV. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1997: 157.1-157.12Google Scholar), and eosinophils were isolated from the enriched cells by negative selection on a MACS magnetic column using anti-CD16 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This selection resulted in a population of cells that contained 91–95% eosinophils as assessed by staining of cytospins with 1% aqueous eosin and Mayer's hematoxylin. Single and double labeling were performed using standard protocols (24.Kantor A.B. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. II. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1997: 49.1-49.13Google Scholar). Following staining, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FacScan with CellQuest software. Granulocytes were stained with anti-siglec-8 mAb followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse F(ab′)2. After a 5-min incubation in Kimura's stain, which labels eosinophils green and basophils cerise (25.Kimura I. Moritani Y. Tanizaki Y. Clin. Allergy. 1973; 3: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the stained cells were analyzed for the presence of siglec-8 using a combination of light and fluorescence microscopy. The percentages of eosinophils and basophils expressing siglec-8 were determined from counts of more than 100 cells in each of three independent experiments. pHEONN73, a clone derived from a human eosinophil cDNA library, was identified as an EST sharing a high degree of sequence similarity with human CD33 cDNA. Examination of its full-length sequence of 2930 base pairs revealed a single long open reading frame encoding a type 1 transmembrane protein of 431 amino acids belonging to the Ig superfamily. Based on its sequence similarity with other siglecs and its ability to bind sialic acid (see below), this protein has been designated siglec-8 (Fig.1). The extracellular region of siglec-8 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide and three Ig-like domains consisting of an N-terminal V-set domain and two C2-set domains. There are three potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Following the transmembrane region, there is a cytoplasmic tail of 47 amino acids. In data base searches, the closest matches were, in rank order, siglec-7, OBBP-like, CD33, siglec-5, and siglec-6. In the extracellular region, these proteins were, respectively, 71, 68, 62, 54, and 52% identical. However, the cytoplasmic tail of siglec-8 was only partially similar to those of the above mentioned siglecs, extending for 31 amino acids and lacking the conserved tyrosine-based motifs present in the related proteins (Fig.1). Because the region of homology in the cytoplasmic tail ended abruptly at a position corresponding to the end of an exon in the gene encoding OBBP-like protein (Fig. 1), we considered the possibility that the truncated cytoplasmic tail in siglec-8 was due to alternative splicing. However, PCR experiments, using a human eosinophil cDNA library as template and primers that flank the potential truncation site, failed to reveal evidence for alternative splicing. Under the conditions used, a single fragment was amplified that was indistinguishable in size from that amplified using pHEONN73 cDNA as template (data not shown). The two N-terminal Ig-like domains of siglec-8 contain the characteristic structural features of the siglec subgroup of Ig superfamily proteins (Fig. 1). There is precise conservation of the unusual pattern of cysteines found in these proteins (15.May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), as well as the key amino acids involved in sialic acid binding, in particular the critical arginine at position 125 and the two conserved aromatic residues at positions 27 and 133 on the A and G strands of the V-set domain (Fig. 1). The gene encoding siglec-8 was mapped by in situhybridization on chromosome 19q13.33-q13.41 (data not shown), closely linked to the genes encoding human CD33, siglec-5, siglec-6, siglec-7, and OBBP-like protein (6.Cornish A.L.

When human multiple tissue Northern blots were hybridized with an 0.8-kilobase probe corresponding to the coding and 3′ untranslated sequences, no specific bands were observed. This finding suggests that the mRNA is either poorly expressed or is expressed by rare cell type(s) at a level below that required for detection by Northern blotting. All siglecs so far characterized are able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding to human RBC either when recombinant proteins are immobilized on plastic or following transient expression on the surface of COS cells (4.Freeman S.D.

Accordingly, immobilized siglec-8-Fc bound RBC in a concentration- and sialic acid-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). However, when siglec-8 was expressed in COS cells, only very occasional cells bound RBC, but, similar to other siglecs, this could be enhanced if the transfected cells were treated with sialidase before addition of the RBC (data not shown). To investigate the sialic acid linkage preference of siglec-8, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding siglec-8 or CR1 as a negative control. Following sialidase treatment of the COS cells to remove potentially cis-inhibitory sialic acids, binding assays were carried out using biotinylated polyacrylamide, derivatized with 3′- or 6′-sialyllactose or with lactose (Fig.2 B). Siglec-8 showed a clear preference for 3′- over 6′-sialyllactose-conjugated PAA. No siglec-8-dependent binding was observed with lactose-conjugated PAA used as a control. To examine the cellular expression of siglec-8, two monoclonal antibodies, 6B11 and 7C9, were generated to recombinant forms of the protein. FACS analyses with a panel of CHO cells expressing CD33 (siglec-3), siglec-5, siglec-7, and siglec-8 showed that both mAbs reacted only with siglec-8 (data not shown). Furthermore, in immunoprecipitations with stably transfected CHO cells expressing siglec-8, a single band was observed at ∼45 kDa under reducing conditions and at 89 kDa under nonreducing conditions (data not shown); this suggests that, similar to CD33 (18.Peiper S.C. Leboeuf R.D. Hughes C.B. Prasthofer E.F. Borowitz M.J. Dambuyant C.D. Katz D.R. Walker W.S. Ashmun R.A. Look T.A. Knapp W. Dorken B. Gilks W.R. Rieber E.P. Schmidt R.E. Stein H. van der Borne A.E.G. Leucocyte Typing IV : White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1989: 814-816Google Scholar) and siglec-5 (6.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), siglec-8 exists as a dimer at the cell surface. Because the related siglecs are expressed by hemopoietic cell subsets, we initially focused our attention on peripheral blood leukocytes. Using either mAb, FACS analysis showed that siglec-8 was absent from lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils but could be detected on the CD16-negative eosinophils that constitute 1–5% of the granulocyte fraction (Fig. 3). Specific expression of siglec-8 on eosinophils was found with 10 different healthy donors in 15 independent experiments. Direct evidence that siglec-8 is expressed on eosinophils was obtained from FACS analyses of eosinophils that had been purified by negative selection with anti-CD16 magnetic beads (Fig.4). Interestingly, siglec-5, which is expressed by neutrophils (6.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was absent from the eosinophils (Fig. 4), showing that siglec-5 and -8 are expressed reciprocally on granulocyte populations. Because basophils are closely related to eosinophils, it was important to determine whether basophils also expressed siglec-8. Using Kimura's stain (25.Kimura I. Moritani Y. Tanizaki Y. Clin. Allergy. 1973; 3: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) to distinguish the two cell types, 92 ± 14% of eosinophils and 0 ± 0% basophils (means ± S.D.) were found to express siglec-8 by immunofluorescence analysis, thereby showing that siglec-8 was absent from basophils. Finally, several hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic human cell lines were screened by FACS to investigate siglec-8 expression. These included HL-60 (myelomonocytic), U937 (promonocytic), THP-1 (monocytic), Daudi (B lymphoblastoid), Jurkat (T lymphoblastoid), HUT78 (T cell), Mono-Mac-6 (monocytic), K562 (erythro-myeloid), KG1b (early myeloid), Copeletti (eye lens epithelium), U251MG (glioma), SySy5y (neuronal), HaCat (keratinocyte), HeLa (epithelial), A2780 (ovarian cancer), MRC-5 (fibroblast), H71b (corneal), 293T (kidney fibroblast), and MCF-7 (breast cancer). In no case was staining observed when using either mAb to siglec-8 (data not shown). In conclusion, the results of these studies show that, among mature hemopoietic cells, siglec-8 is expressed specifically by eosinophils and is absent from a wide range of hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cell lines. The siglecs represent an expanding family of sialic acid binding receptors that are largely expressed on discrete subsets of hemopoietic cells. Remarkably, siglec-8, whose cDNA was isolated from an eosinophil library, appears to be expressed specifically by eosinophils. Although the expression of siglec-8 on other cell types cannot be excluded, several lines of evidence presented here indicate that this molecule is normally only expressed by eosinophils. Of approximately 2 million ESTs derived from more than 700 cDNA libraries, siglec-8 has only been represented once, unlike other siglecs for which multiple ESTs have been identified. 2J. Ni, unpublished observations. Also, on multiple tissue Northern blots, no specific bands could be detected. Although eosinophils are potentially long-lived cells present in many tissues, the lack of detectable mRNA from all 10 tissues examined may reflect the relative paucity of these cells in tissues and/or low level transcription of the siglec-8 gene in mature eosinophils. Further studies are required to determine whether siglec-8 is expressed on tissue eosinophils at levels equivalent to those observed on resting, circulating eosinophils. It was not possible to investigate this in the present study because the epitope(s) recognized by the anti-siglec-8 mAbs was unusually sensitive to commonly used alcohol- and aldehyde-based fixatives needed for preserving tissue architecture. 3H. Floyd, unpublished observations. Finally, in a wide screen of cell lines of both hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic origins, siglec-8 was undetectable at the cell surface. Even basophils, a cell type closely related to eosinophils, failed to express siglec-8. Interestingly, siglec-8 appears to be the only siglec characterized thus far that is expressed on eosinophils, suggesting that the protein may serve a nonredundant role in eosinophil biology. Eosinophils are thought to be important cells in a variety of inflammatory reactions because they possess a wide array of functional responses that can cause tissue damage, both to foreign invaders as well as host tissues (reviewed in Ref. 28.Boyce J.A. Allergy Asthma Proc. 1997; 18: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, they have long been considered an important component of host defenses to certain parasitic diseases, such as those caused by helminthic parasites, but their presence can be detrimental in certain autoimmune diseases such as asthma. Although further studies are needed to investigate the potential functions of siglec-8 in eosinophil biology, the ability of this receptor to bind sialic acids suggests a potential role in cellular interactions, as proposed for the other siglecs. For example, CD22 on B cells has recently been shown to be involved in bone marrow endothelial cell interactions, leading to selective homing of B cells to this tissue (29.Nitschke L. Floyd H. Ferguson D.J. Crocker P.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether, in an analogous manner, siglec-8 can bind sialylated ligands on endothelial cells, thereby providing an additional, eosinophil-specific mechanism for transendothelial migration. It is also possible that siglec-8 can bind other, non-carbohydrate ligands, as has been shown recently with siglec-6, which shows low but significant affinity for the cytokine leptin (7.Patel N. Linden E.C. Altmann S.W. Gish K. Balasubramanian S. Timans J.C. Peterson D. Bell M.P. Bazan J.F. Varki A. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22729-22738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Besides their postulated involvement in cell-cell interactions, several siglecs have been implicated in signaling functions. CD33 (siglec-3) and siglec-5, -6, and -7 possess highly conserved tyrosine-based motifs in their cytoplasmic tails. Where studied, the tyrosine residues can be phosphorylated, leading to recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in the case of CD33 (14.Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and SHP-1 only in the case of siglec-7 (9.Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is striking that siglec-8, despite being highly related in the extracellular region, lacks these tyrosine-based motifs. Thus, if siglec-8 is involved in signaling functions on eosinophils, this would be expected to be through a different mechanism than that used by the related siglecs.

Through a terminal oxidase, reduced plastoquinone would be oxidized in chlororespiration. However, isolated Ndh complex has low activity with plastoquinone and no terminal oxidase has been found in chloroplasts, thus the function of Ndh complex is unknown. Alternatively, thylakoid hydroquinone peroxidase could oxidize reduced plastoquinone with H2O2. By immunoaffinity chromatography, we have purified the plastid Ndh complex of barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) to investigate the electron donor and acceptor specificity. A detergent-containing system was reconstructed with thylakoid Ndh complex and peroxidase which oxidized NADH with H2O2 in a plastoquinone-dependent process. This system and the increases of thylakoid Ndh complex and peroxidase activities under photooxidative stress suggest that the chlororespiratory process consists of the sequence of reactions catalyzed by Ndh complex, peroxidase (acting on reduced plastoquinone), superoxide dismutase, and the non-enzymic one-electron transfer from reduced iron-sulfur protein (FeSP) to O2. When FeSP is a component of cytochrome b 6·fcomplex or of the same Ndh complex, O2 may be reduced with NADH, without requirement of light. Chlororespiration consumes reactive species of oxygen and, eventually, may decrease their production by lowering O2 concentration in chloroplasts.

Western assays with appropriate antibodies and microsequencing indicated (15.Sazanov L. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that the NADH complex contains ndh encoded NDH polypeptides (Ndh complex).1 By analogy with mitochondria, in chlororespiration, the plastid Ndh complex would transfer electrons from NADH to a quinone (presumably plastoquinone, PQ) whose reduced form would in turn be oxidized by oxygen by a terminal oxidase. Lower PQ reduction in mutant tobacco plants defective in ndh genes (11.Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 16.Kofer W. Koop H.-U. Wanner G. Steinmüller K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) points that the Ndh complex is responsible for PQ reduction. However, due to problems of solubility of substrate, plastid Ndh complex can hardly be assayed with PQ (15.Sazanov L. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, commonly assayed by reduction of ferricyanide (FeCN) with NADH. Moreover, there are doubts as to whether the plastid Ndh complex is involved in cyclic electron transport in chloroplasts, in chlororespiration, or both processes (15.Sazanov L. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). While non-photosynthetic parasitic plants lack both genes for proteins of the photosynthetic machinery and ndh genes (17.de Pamphilis C.W. Palmer J.D. Nature. 1990; 348: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18.Haberhausen G. Zetsche K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), no plant has been found containing ndh genes but lacking genes for photosynthetic machinery, which suggests that the function ofndh gene products is related to photosynthesis. Until now, only the black pine, a photosynthetic plant with plastid genes for photosynthetic machinery, lacks functional ndh genes (19.Wakasugi T. Tsudzuki J. Ito S. Nakashima K. Tsudzuki T. Sugiura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9794-9798Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no clear terminal oxidase has been found in chloroplasts (20.Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 59-66Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which raises further questions regarding chlororespiration and the role of ndh genes and the Ndh complex. The level of the NDH-A polypeptide, encoded by thendhA gene, increased in thylakoid when barley leaves received high irradiances or were incubated under high oxygen concentrations (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which suggested that ndh genes and the Ndh complex may be involved in the protection against photooxidative stress. Most photosynthetic O2 uptake by drought-stressed leaves (a condition which produces photooxidative stress) is due to a one-electron transfer to O2 forming superoxide anion radical (O⨪2) (21.Biehler K. Fock H. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The subsequent action of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) converts O⨪2 to H2O2, which is finally consumed in a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction. Hydroquinone peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7) have been identified in chloroplasts (22.Laloue H. Weber-Lofti F. Lucau-Danila A. Guillemaut P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 341-346Google Scholar, 23.Zapata J.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Phytochem. 1998; 48: 1119-1123Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A peroxidase solubilized from barley thylakoid with Triton X-100 (23.Zapata J.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Phytochem. 1998; 48: 1119-1123Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) oxidizes the reduced form of plastoquinone (PQH2). Thus, the catalytic activities of Ndh complex, peroxidase (acting on PQH2), and SOD and the non-enzymic one-electron transfer from a reduced iron-sulfur protein (FeSP) to O2 could be responsible for electron transport from NADH to O2 in chlororespiration. In the dark, O2 may be reduced with NADH if FeSP is a component of the cytochrome b 6·f complex or of the same Ndh complex. To provide biochemical support for this hypothesis, we have reconstructed, with immunopurified Ndh complex and peroxidase isolated from barley thylakoid, an in vitro system which (in a detergent-containing medium) oxidizes NADH with H2O2 in a PQ-dependent reaction. The properties of this in vitro system and the effects of different treatments of leaves on enzyme activities described herein suggest that chlororespiration may protect against photooxidative stress and could regulate the proportion of reduced and oxidized forms of the intermediates of cyclic electron transport to optimize cyclic photophosphorylation. Barley plants (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Hassan) were grown on vermiculite at 23 °C under a 16-h photoperiod of 100 μmol of photon m−2 s−1 white light as described (24.Casano L.M. Martı́n M. Sabater B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, in the present work, we have used primary leaves of 14-day-old plants. Photooxidative stress was induced by incubating leaf segments in higher irradiance (300 μmol of photon m−2 s−1) in the presence of either 21 or 100% O2. PQ and other chemicals were from Sigma. Intact chloroplasts were isolated as described (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pellet of chloroplasts was washed with buffer E (50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm l-ascorbic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.33 m sorbitol, pH 7.5) (10 ml/1 g of original leaves) to obtain a preparation of chloroplasts free from soluble or mitochondrial fractions (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10.Catalá R. Sabater B. Guéra A.

To obtain high percentages (>80%) of intact chloroplasts, all steps from leaf segments to pellet of washed chloroplasts were performed at 0–5 °C in no more than 45 min. The chloroplast pellet was resuspended for osmotic shock in buffer E without sorbitol (buffer H) at 0–4 °C with gentle shaking during 6 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4,500 × g. The thylakoid pellet was resuspended to approximately 2 mg of protein/ml in buffer H and used for solubilization of thylakoid-bound NADH dehydrogenase or peroxidase activities. The membranous fraction was washed with Triton X-100 (0.2 mg of detergent/mg of protein) and gently stirred for 15 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, NADH dehydrogenase was solubilized from the pellet, which was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, by adding 10% (w/v) Triton X-100 to make a final concentration of 2% (5 mg of detergent/mg of protein) and gently stirred for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant (around 4 mg of protein/ml, about 40% of original thylakoid proteins) was the NADH dehydrogenase-solubilized fraction. Peroxidase was solubilized from the thylakoid membranous fraction by adding 10% (w/v) Triton X-100 to make a final 1.5% solution and gently stirred for 45 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (around 0.9 mg of protein/ml) contained the peroxidase solubilized from thylakoid. In other experiments, NADH dehydrogenase activities were assayed in whole leaf extracts obtained as follows: 10 3-cm leaf segments were homogenized with a mortar and pestle in 2 ml of buffer H and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. Triton X-100 was added to supernatant to make a final 2% (w/v) solution (5 mg of detergent/mg of protein) and gently stirred for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants contained 0.7 to 1.3 mg of protein/ml. All the solubilization procedures were performed at 4 °C. Antibodies against NDH-A protein (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were purified from rabbit antiserum by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column (25.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) and then covalently coupled to an Affi-Gel hydrazide-agarose gel according to the manufacturer (Bio-Rad) and packed into a 5-ml column. Five to six ml of the NADH dehydrogenase-solubilized fraction were passed through the immunoaffinity column three times. After washings (25.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar), the Ndh complex was eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v), and 0.15 m NaCl. Fractions (1 ml each) were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. As described (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), antibodies against NDH-A do not react with any mitochondrial protein. Native PAGE was carried out at 5 °C (usually with 50–100-μg protein samples) in a linear gradient gel of 3–10% polyacrylamide (2.5% bisacrylamide) in the same way as SDS-PAGE with the exception that gels contained 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 instead of SDS (26.Kuonen D.R. Roberts P.J. Cottingham I.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analyses, after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immunocomplex with antibody prepared against the NDH-A polypeptide encoded by the ndhA gene (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was detected with the peroxidase Western blotting analysis system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In other experiments, after native PAGE, the immunopurified Ndh complex band was electroeluted and polypeptides were separated by denaturating SDS-PAGE in a linear gradient gel of 12–16% polyacrylamide. After membrane blotting, the presence of NDH-A polypeptide was determined by antibody against the NDH-A polypeptide encoded by the ndhA gene (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For zymograms, NADH dehydrogenase activity was detected by incubation of gel slices for 20–30 min at 30 °C in darkness in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mmNa2-EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, and 0.5 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium. In controls without NADH, no color developed. Bands were scanned with a UVP Easy Digital Image analyzer to comparatively quantify activity values which were expressed as percentages of the reference activity (usually that of 7-day-old plants). NADH:FeCN oxidoreductase activity was assayed at 30 °C by measuring the reduction of FeCN at 420 nm (extinction coefficient: 1.03 mm−1 cm−1) and the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (extinction coefficient: 6.22 mm−1 cm−1) in a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer. The reaction mixture, with a final volume of 1.0 ml, included 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm FeCN, and variable enzyme preparations. The rate was determined from linear absorbance decrease between 45 and 240 s. Control values, obtained without protein, were subtracted. No detectable transformation of one substrate was observed in controls without the other substrate. In assays with PQ (usually 0.4 mm) as electron acceptor, preincubation and detergent treatments were performed as described under “Results.” The spectrophotometric assay of peroxidase was performed at 30 °C in a 1.0-ml assay volume containing 0.5 mm p-dihydroxybenzene (hydroquinone, HQ), 0.1 mmH2O2, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. After mixing, the enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of enzyme. The oxidation of HQ was recorded as the increase in absorbance at 250 nm (extinction coefficient: 19 mm−1 cm−1) over a time period of 2 min. The absorbance increases were always linear with respect to time. Appropriate controls were subtracted (23.Zapata J.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Phytochem. 1998; 48: 1119-1123Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Specific activities are expressed as micromoles of NADH or HQ consumed per min/mg of protein. Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford method (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) with a Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All reported results were reproduced at least three times. When appropriate, standard deviations are indicated by bars in figures. NADH dehydrogenase preparations solubilized from barley thylakoid still contained about 18% peroxidase activity. To obtain a peroxidase-free preparation, the above fraction was purified with a column containing antibody against NDH-A covalently bound to agarose. Most of the protein eluted with washing solutions, and the protein retained by immunoaffinity was subsequently eluted with an acid solution as shown in Fig. 1. Fractions 10 to 12 were pooled and were found to be almost free of peroxidase activity (<0.3%). When assayed as NADH:FeCN oxidoreductase, the specific activity of pooled fractions (about 5.5 μmol min−1 mg of protein−1) was in the range of the purified plastid and mitochondrial complex I (15.Sazanov L. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). With regard to the fraction resuspended from thylakoid with Triton X-100, immunoaffinity achieved 100-fold purification of the activity with a recovery of 22%. The activity of purified fractions on NADPH was only 3.6% of their activity on NADH, which is in accordance with previous results for the activities investigated in barley (14.Quiles M.J. Albacete M.E. Sabater B. Cuello J. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 1134-1142Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and pea (15.Sazanov L. Burrows P.A. Nixon P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and indicates that the NADH dehydrogenase activity of pure thylakoid Ndh complex was essentially NADH-specific, although crude thylakoid preparations also contain NADPH dehydrogenase activities (14.Quiles M.J. Albacete M.E. Sabater B. Cuello J. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 1134-1142Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase activity of purified Ndh complex was 100% inhibited after 30 min incubation with NDH-A antibody, confirming that the activity of purified fraction was due to the Ndh complex that includes the NDH-A polypeptide. After native electrophoresis, zymograms of whole leaf extract and protein solubilized from thylakoid showed several NADH dehydrogenase bands (Fig. 2 A), while immunopurified Ndh complex showed a single activity band co-migrating with first thylakoid and second whole extract low migrating bands. Western assays showed that immunopurified Ndh complex and the co-migrating bands of whole leaf extract and thylakoid contained the NDH-A polypeptide (Fig. 2 B). At least 9 polypeptide bands (sizes ranging between 17 and 70 kDa) were detected with Coomassie staining (not shown) after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of immunopurified Ndh complex. Western assay after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C) indicated that only a polypeptide of 35 kDa of the Ndh complex reacted with NDH-A antibody. It must be noted that, of several NADH dehydrogenase bands detected in thylakoid and whole leaf extract, a single (low migrating and high activity) band contained the NDH-A polypeptide (Fig. 2 A, lane Thylak). The identification of the low migrating NADH dehydrogenase activity band corresponding to thylakoid Ndh complex allows us to comparatively quantify this activity from zymograms of whole leaf extracts with NADH and nitro blue tetrazolium. According to Fig. 2 A, activity of Ndh complex accounts for about two-thirds of the whole NADH dehydrogenase activity solubilized from washed thylakoid (about 50 nmol of NADH oxidized min−1 mg of protein−1, assayed as NADH:FeCN oxidoreductase). Immunoblots (not shown) with antibody against the 70-kDa NDH-F polypeptide (10.Catalá R. Sabater B. Guéra A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) produced similar results to those shown in Fig. 2, B and C, for NDH-A antibody, indicating that our purified Ndh complex also included NDH-F polypeptide. Although band intensities in Fig. 2, A and B,roughly agree with the amount of protein loaded and Ndh purity in each fraction, quantitative conclusions cannot be deduced by comparing leaf, thylakoid, and purified Ndh complex bands, because NADH-DH lane signal was saturating and stability of activity (and probably of the same Ndh complex) was lower in purified and thylakoid fractions than in whole leaf fraction. In standard spectrophotometric assays, without detergent added to the incubation mixture, the activity of purified Ndh complex with PQ as electron acceptor is only 5% of the activity with FeCN as electron acceptor (both measured as the rate of NADH oxidation). The activity with PQ increased to 45% of the activity with FeCN when the reaction mixture containing 0.2% (w/v) deoxycholate was preincubated during 10 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of NADH. Measurements of absorbance changes at 262 nm due to PQ reduction (extinction coefficient 18.9 mm−1 cm−1) indicated an equimolar reaction between NADH and PQ. Activities with PQ were lower after preincubation with higher or lower deoxycholate concentrations. Apparently, hydrophobic detergent-containing particles include the Ndh complex in a state accessible enough to NADH and PQ, and provide an efficient system to assay NADH:PQ oxidoreductase activity. Hydroquinone peroxidase activity in the Triton X-100-solubilized fraction of thylakoid changed during the development of the primary leaf of barley. It reached a maximum (about 0.3 μmol of HQ oxidized min−1 mg of thylakoid protein−1) around 14 days after sowing (Fig.3), at the beginning of senescence soon after full expansion. When Ndh complex activity was quantified after zymographic assays with whole leaf extract it also reached a maximum in 14-day-old primary leaves, although changes were less pronounced than for peroxidase. For comparison, NADH dehydrogenase activity due to Ndh complex (see Fig. 2 A and discussion therein) is about 35 nmol of NADH oxidized min−1 mg of thylakoid protein−1 in 14-day-old leaves (220% in Fig. 3). To investigate the possible role of the Ndh complex and peroxidase activities in the protection against photooxidative stress, activity levels were measured in response to photooxidative treatments of leaf segments in both 7-day-old expanding leaves and 14-day-old fully expanded leaves. A typical zymogram of the NADH dehydrogenase activity of Ndh complex is shown in Fig.4 A. When compared with the levels in freshly detached leaf segments (To) or leaf segments incubated during 20 h with growth light (100 μmol of photon m−2 s−1), Ndh complex activity of leaf segments incubated for 20 h with relative photooxidative light (PhL) (300 μmol of photon m−2 s−1) increased approximately 100% in 14-day-old leaves and approximately 30% in 7-day-old leaves (Fig. 4, A and B). With relative photooxidative light under a 100% oxygen atmosphere, Ndh complex activity increased up to 3.5-fold in 14-day-old leaves and almost 2-fold in 7-day-old leaves. Photooxidative treatments also increased peroxidase activity (Fig. 4 C) but, in contrast to the Ndh complex, the relative increases of peroxidase were higher in 7-day-old leaves than in 14-day-old leaves. Western assays with antibody against NDH-A (8.Martı́n M. Casano L.M. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed increases of NDH-A polypeptide similar to those of Ndh complex activity (Fig. 4, A andB) in response to the same photooxidative treatments. The low solubilities of PQ and PQH2 make it difficult to assay them as substrates of, respectively, Ndh complex and peroxidase. Additionally, PQH2, which is obtained by reduction of commercial PQ with dithionite, is unstable. Although indirect estimations suggested that the barley thylakoid peroxidase uses PQH2 as substrate (23.Zapata J.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Phytochem. 1998; 48: 1119-1123Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), measurements of this activity were difficult to reproduce. To overcome these difficulties, we developed an assay system designed to detect whether the PQH2 produced by reduction of PQ (with NADH in the reaction catalyzed by Ndh complex) is oxidized by H2O2 in the reaction catalyzed by peroxidase. Essentially, the system measures NADH oxidation by H2O2 dependent on the presence of Ndh complex, PQ, and peroxidase according to the sequence of reactions,NADH+H++PQ →Ndh complex NAD++PQH2Equation 1 H2O2+PQH2 →Peroxidase 2 H2O+PQEquation 2 In chloroplasts, the Ndh complex, PQ·PQH2 and peroxidase are immersed in the hydrophobic environment of thylakoid membrane, thus their functions are hardly reproducible in water mixtures commonly used for spectrophotometric assays. We have stated above that a 10-min preincubation at 4 °C of the reaction mixture of Ndh complex (including 0.2% deoxycholate and PQ but not NADH) increased the rate of PQ oxidation approximately 9-fold. In order to test appropriate controls, we carried out a partial purification of the peroxidase. When solubilized from thylakoid membrane by 1.5% Triton X-100, the peroxidase preparation contained 10% of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Taking advantage of the low stability of Ndh complex activity, a fraction of Triton-solubilized peroxidase between 40 and 70% (NH4)2SO2 was desalted with a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon). The resulting peroxidase preparation showed a specific activity of 3.8 μmol of HQ oxidized min−1 mg of protein−1, which was essentially free of NADH dehydrogenase activity (<0.1%). As found for non-purified fraction (23.Zapata J.M. Sabater B. Martı́n M. Phytochem. 1998; 48: 1119-1123Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), partially purified peroxidase showed a single HQ peroxidase activity band in zymograms and was free of other peroxidase or oxidase activities. Preincubation of partially purified peroxidase at 4 °C with 0.2% deoxycholate did not significantly affect the activity of the enzyme in standard assays with HQ and H2O2 as substrates. The complete system reconstructed in vitro was assayed as follows: 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, H2O to make a final volume of 1.0 ml in the reaction mixture, 2 mg of deoxycholate, 4 μg of purified Ndh complex, 11 μg of partially purified peroxidase (resuspended in buffer H containing 1.5% Triton X-100), and variable concentrations of PQ were preincubated during 10 min at 4 °C. The reaction was started by adding NADH to make a final concentration of 0.2 mm (0.1 ml of a 2 mm solution) and 20 μl of pure water (controls) or 10 mm H2O2. The final concentrations of PQ were: 0, 0.04, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mm. In the absence of H2O2 (left side of Fig. 5) but with PQ in the assay mixture, absorbance decreas"

The difference between spectra recorded in the presence and absence of agonist from the nAChR reconstituted into 3:1:1 egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/DOPA/Chol membranes exhibits positive and negative bands that serve as markers of the structural changes associated with the resting to desensitized conformational change. These markers are absent in similar difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes lacking both Chol and DOPA, indicating that the nAChR cannot undergo conformational change in response to agonist binding. When low levels of either Chol or DOPA up to 25 mol % of the total lipid are included in the EPC membranes, the markers suggest the predominant stabilization of a conformation that is a structural intermediate between the resting and desensitized states. At higher levels of either Chol or DOPA, the nAChR is stabilized in a conformation that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced desensitization, although DOPA appears to be required for the nAChR to adopt a conformation fully equivalent to that found in native and 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes.

Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 2.McNamee M.G. Fong T.M. Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Lipid Domains and the Relationship to Membrane Function. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 43-62Google Scholar). In native membranes, the nAChR transiently gates open a cation-selective ion channel across the postsynaptic membrane in response to the binding of agonists such as acetylcholine and carbamylcholine (Carb). Prolonged exposure to either agonist or a variety of noncompetitive antagonists leads to the stabilization of a channel inactive/desensitized (D) state. In reconstituted membranes, the ability of the nAChR both to conduct cations across the membrane and to undergo the resting to desensitized (R→D) conformational transition is highly sensitive to the composition of the surrounding lipid membrane. The molecular details of how lipids modulate the ability of the nAChR to undergo agonist-induced conformational change, however, remain unclear. The original studies of Fong and McNamee (3.Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 26: 3871-3880Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) suggested that although the nAChR reconstituted into a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) membrane is not functional, the addition of both cholesterol (Chol) and an anionic lipid, such as dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA), to the reconstituted DOPC membrane restores the ability of the nAChR both to conduct cations and undergo agonist-induced desensitization. The recovery of function in the presence of Chol and DOPA was attributed to both the formation of a lipid bilayer with an optimal membrane fluidity and a specific structural requirement of the nAChR for each lipid. The latter was proposed to result from the binding of each to distinct sites on the nAChR with the consequent formation of specific secondary structural features (3.Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 26: 3871-3880Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5.Butler D.H. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1150: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6.Bhushan A.

Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4065-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has led to contradictory conclusions regarding the additional lipids that are required in a reconstituted DOPC membrane for the nAChR to adopt a functional conformation. McCarthy and Moore (8.McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that anionic lipids are sufficient to stabilize a functional nAChR based on chemical labeling and α-bungarotoxin rate binding studies of the nAChR in membranes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and DOPA. Their work also found that when reconstituted into membranes composed of either EPC/Chol or EPC alone the nAChR adopts a predominantly D conformation (8.McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding kinetics of ethidium bromide suggest that mixtures of DOPA/Chol support a functional nAChR whereas in either DOPC/DOPA or DOPC alone the nAChR is essentially “locked” in an R conformation (9; see also Ref. 10.Raines D.E. Krishnan N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1374: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectra are consistent with the data of McCarthy and Moore (8.McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that they suggest that the nAChR in EPC alone is desensitized (11.Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24590-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to both studies, the FTIR data show that the presence of small amounts of either neutral or anionic lipids in an EPC membrane is sufficient to stabilize a fraction of the nAChRs in a functional conformation that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational change. The FTIR data led to the suggestion that lipids modulate the relative number of nAChRs in the R and D states in the absence of agonist. The apparent ability of a variety of structurally diverse neutral and anionic lipids to modulate the equilibrium between the R and D conformations suggests further that lipids influence nAChR conformational equilibria via an indirect effect on some physical property of the membrane. Mixtures of a variety of structurally diverse neutral and anionic lipids in DOPC membranes all support nAChR cation flux (12.Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recent FTIR studies have also been unable to detect any of the changes in nAChR secondary structure which were reported previously in the presence of neutral and/or anionic lipids (13.Méthot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15142-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The contradictory conclusions in the literature regarding the specific lipid requirements of the nAChR may reflect a variety of factors including the fact that the functional status of the nAChR in most studies has been assessed in reconstituted DOPC or EPC membranes with the additional lipid of interest found at a single molar percentage of the total membrane lipids (usually 25% or less). In many cases, functional data have also been interpreted in terms of the stabilization of either a fully functional or a nonfunctional conformation. Both approaches ignore the possibility that lipids modulate the equilibria between different conformational states. The relative level of a given lipid in a reconstituted phosphatidylcholine membrane may be an important factor in determining the relative percentage of nAChRs stabilized in a functional conformation and/or the kinetics of nAChR conformational change. To gain a more conclusive picture of the specific lipid requirements of the nAChR and to test the above noted hypothesis regarding a lipid-dependent modulation of nAChR conformational equilibria, we have examined the ability of the nAChR to undergo the Carb-induced R→D conformational change in EPC membranes with varying levels of either DOPA or Chol. We find that increasing levels of either lipid in an EPC membrane increasingly stabilizes a larger proportion of nAChRs in a conformation(s) that is(are) capable of undergoing Carb-induced desensitization. However, only high levels of DOPA were found to stabilize a structure of the nAChR which is fully equivalent to that found in native and 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes. These results suggest that the presence of either DOPA or Chol in a reconstituted EPC membrane can influence the equilibrium between the R and D conformational states but that anionic lipids are required for the nAChR to adopt a fully functional conformation. EPC and DOPA were purchased from Avanti Polar lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and the Chol was from Sigma. FrozenTorpedo californica electric tissue was from Marinus (Long Beach, CA). The [13C]acetylcholine was synthesized from choline bromide and [13C]acetylchloride (both from Sigma) and purified according to Damle et al. (14.Damle V.N. McLaughlin M. Karlin A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The infrared spectrum of the synthesized [13C]acetylcholine was superimposable on a similar spectrum of commercially available [13C]acetylcholine (15.Williamson P.T. Grobner G. Spooner P.J. Miller K.W. Watts A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2J. E. Baenziger, K. W. Miller, and K. J. Rothschild, unpublished observations. The nAChR was affinity purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Affi-Gel 102 column (Bio-Rad) and then reconstituted into membranes composed of EPC with varying levels of either DOPA or Chol, as described by McCarthy and Moore (8.McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases except for the 9:1 molar ratios of EPC/DOPA and EPC/Chol, each reconstitution was performed between two and five times. FTIR samples were prepared by spreading 250 μg of the nAChR protein in 1H2O buffer on the surface of a 50 × 20 × 2-mm germanium attenuated total reflectance (ATR) internal reflection element (Harrick; Ossining, NY). After evaporating the bulk solvent with a gentle stream of N2 gas, the ATR crystal was installed in an ATR liquid sample cell (also from Harrick) and the nAChR film re-hydrated with excess Torpedo Ringer buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0). FTIR spectra were acquired using the ATR technique on an FTS-40 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. Spectra were recorded at 8 cm−1 resolution using 512 scans, which took roughly 7 min/spectrum. For the difference measurements, two consecutive R state spectra of the nAChR film in the absence of Carb were recorded with TorpedoRinger buffer flowing continuously through the sample compartment of the ATR cell at a rate of ∼1.5 ml/min. The flowing solution was then switched to an identical one containing 50 μm Carb. After 1 min, a spectrum of the D state was recorded. The difference between both the two R state spectra (absence of Carb; control spectra) and the consecutive R and D (presence of Carb) state spectra were calculated, stored, and the flowing buffer switched back to buffer without Carb. After a 20-min washing period to remove Carb from the film and convert the nAChR back into the R conformation, the process was repeated many times. Each experiment was repeated on several new films prepared from each affinity purification/reconstitution. All difference spectra were base line corrected between 1800 and 1000 cm−1 and were interpolated to an effective resolution of 4 cm−1. For more details see Ryan and Baenziger (16.Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The difference between infrared spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of Carb (referred to as a Carb difference spectrum) exhibits a complicated pattern of positive and negative vibrational bands. These difference bands reflect changes in the vibrations of those amino acid residues in the nAChR whose structures and/or surrounding environments change upon Carb binding. The pattern of difference bands provides a spectral map of the Carb-induced structural changes that occur in the nAChR. Specifically, this map includes features indicative of: 1) the vibrations of Carb bound to the nAChR (identified by arrows in the top trace of Fig. 1 A); 2) vibrational changes associated with the formation of direct physical interactions between Carb and binding site residues (e.g. hydrogen bonds, cation π-electron interactions, etc.); and 3) vibrational changes associated with the R→D conformational change. The conformational change probed in a typical Carb difference spectrum is shown schematically in Fig. 1 B, scheme i. Carb difference spectra recorded from affinity-purified nAChR reconstituted into membranes composed of 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol, a membrane that gives rise to a strong Carb-induced cation flux (3.Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 26: 3871-3880Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), are similar to those recorded from the nAChR in native membranes and thus illustrate the pattern of difference bands expected for a functional nAChR (top trace in Fig. 1 A). Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes lacking neutral and anionic lipids are similar but exhibit a number of band intensity variations (middle trace in Fig.1 A). These variations reflect subtle membrane-induced changes in the structure/conformation of the nAChR and include a marked decrease in the intensity of five positive bands centered near 1663, 1655, 1547, 1430 and 1059 cm−1. The decrease in intensity of a positive band near 1663 cm−1 gives rise to the apparent increase in intensity of the overlapping negative band near 1668 cm−1 (see Fig. 3 and text in Ref. 16.Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the individual bands in the Carb difference spectra remain to be assigned to specific residues, it is significant that the above noted changes in intensity are all observed in Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes maintained in continuous contact with desensitizing local anesthetics, such as dibucaine (Fig. 1 A, bottom trace). In addition, relatively low concentrations of the anesthetic tetracaine, which stabilize the nAChR in an R-like as opposed to a D conformation, lead to an increase, as opposed to a decrease, in the intensities of the same five difference bands. Both observations suggest that the five noted positive difference bands reflect changes in vibrational intensity which occur as a consequence of the R→D conformational transition itself (for a detailed discussion, see Ref. 16.Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The absence of these five bands in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes indicates that the nAChR in this membrane environment does not undergo the R→D conformational transition upon the binding of Carb (Fig. 1 B, scheme ii). This result is consistent with photoaffinity labeling studies, which show that the nAChR in EPC is stabilized in the D state (8.McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the marked band intensity changes discussed above, more subtle lipid-sensitive spectral changes may occur between 1750 and 1700 cm−1, 1580 and 1520 cm−1, and 1400 and 1100 cm−1. Changes in band intensity in the 1700–1750 cm−1 region are difficult to monitor because of the overlapping Carb vibration at 1720 cm−1 (Fig.2 A). To circumvent this problem, difference spectra were recorded using isotopically labeled acetylcholine (13C label on the carbonyl carbon) instead of Carb to induce the R→D conformational transition (Fig.2 B). The resulting [13C]acetylcholine difference spectra exhibit a clear window in the 1750–1700 cm−1 region for viewing underlying protein vibrations. [13C]Acetylcholine difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in EPC/DOPA/Chol exhibit both a weak negative and positive difference band centered near 1740 and 1720 cm−1, respectively, which could reflect changes in the vibrational intensity and/or frequency of either a protonated carboxyl or a lipid ester carbonyl. The 1740 cm−1 vibration is absent in [13C]acetylcholine difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes (Fig. 2 C). Potential variations in intensity between 1520 and 1580 cm−1 and between 1400 and 1100 cm−1 are difficult to assess because of the possibility of temperature-sensitive base-line fluctuations that can occur in these regions and/or the relatively weak intensities of the difference bands. Comparisons of potential spectral changes in these regions with those observed in spectra recorded in the presence of desensitizing local anesthetics are also complicated because negative local anesthetic bands due to Carb-induced displacement of local anesthetics from the neurotransmitter binding site appear in the latter spectra (Fig.2 A, bottom trace). It is thus difficult to assess both whether or not these spectral changes are present and, if present, whether the putative spectral changes are associated with the R→D conformational change. Current discussion will thus focus mainly on the six lipid-sensitive bands that are noted above near 1740, 1663, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1. Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into membranes composed of EPC with increasing molar proportions of the anionic lipid DOPA exhibit a DOPA-dependent increase in positive intensity at the five noted conformationally sensitive band frequencies centered near 1663, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1 (Fig.3). In general, the increases in intensity at these five frequencies are modest at low levels of DOPA up to the EPC/DOPA molar ratio of 3:1 whereas at higher levels of DOPA they are more substantial. The intensities of all five conformationally sensitive bands in the Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in EPC/DOPA at both the 3:2 and 1:1 molar ratios approach those observed in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes. In addition, the [13C]acetylcholine difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in 3:2 EPC/DOPA membranes exhibit a relatively strong negative and positive band near 1740 and 1720 cm−1, respectively. The difference spectra thus indicate that the nAChR in EPC/DOPA at both the 3:2 and 1:1 molar ratios recovers its ability to undergo the R→D conformational transition and thus must be stabilized predominantly in a functional R conformation. In terms of our technique, high levels of DOPA in an EPC membrane appear to be sufficient to stabilize the nAChR in a functional conformation that is equivalent to that found in 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes, even in the absence of Chol. Assuming that the nAChR in EPC membranes is stabilized in a D state (see “Discussion”), our data are consistent with a gradual shift in the equilibrium toward the R state with increasing levels of DOPA. A close examination of the data reveals that the effects of DOPA may be more complex than the modulation of a simple two-state conformational equilibrium. The difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in both the EPC/DOPA 3:1 and 9:1 membranes exhibit large positive intensities near 1655 and 1430 cm−1 relative to the intensities of the bands in spectra recorded from the nAChR in EPC (see Figs.5 A and 6). In contrast, the intensities of the two vibrations near 1059 cm−1 and 1663 cm−1remain weak and are similar to the intensities of the two bands in the Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in EPC membranes completely lacking DOPA. This pattern of band intensity variations suggests that a large percentage of the conformationally sensitive residues in the nAChR which contribute intensity to the difference band near 1655 and 1430 cm−1 adopt an R-like conformation in 3:1 EPC/DOPA membranes, whereas the majority of the residues that contribute intensity to the difference bands near 1663 and 1059 cm−1 adopt a D-like conformation. The EPC/DOPA 9:1 and 3:1 membranes thus appear to stabilize a conformation that is a structural intermediate between the R and D states. Note that this same intermediate pattern of band intensities has been observed in Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes, but while the nAChR is maintained in the presence of concentrations of desensitizing local anesthetics where binding occurs exclusively to the noncompetitive blocker site located near the ion channel pore (16.Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of band intensities variations is also observed in Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in both 3:1 EPC/phosphatidylserine and 3:1 EPC/squalene membranes (11.Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

In both panels, the 0% and 100% values correspond to the intensities of these two bands in Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC and 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes, respectively. The measured values are sensitive to both base-line fluctuations and spectral scaling. They are estimated to be accurate within less than ±10%. For a given percentage of either DOPA or Chol, the relative changes in intensity at the two reported frequencies have a much higher accuracy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes with increasing proportions of the neutral lipid Chol are similar to those recorded from the nAChR in EPC membranes with increasing levels of DOPA. There is a Chol-dependent increase in the intensities of four of the five noted conformationally sensitive bands near 1663, 1655, 1547, and 1430 cm−1 (Fig.4). The intensities of these four bands in the difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in 3:2 EPC/Chol approach the intensities of those recorded from the nAChR in 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol, suggesting that the nAChR has, for the most part, adopted an R-like conformation. The 3:1 EPC/Chol membranes also appear to stabilize a conformational intermediate between the R and D states as indicated by the relatively large positive intensity near 1655 cm−1 versus the relatively weak intensity near 1663 and 1059 cm−1 (Fig.5 B). There are, however, subtle variations between the Carb difference spectra recorded in the presence of increasing proportions of DOPA and Chol which suggest differences in the abilities of these two lipids to modulate conformational equilibria of the nAChR. First, at equivalent levels of either DOPA or Chol in the EPC membranes, the presence of DOPA leads to a greater intensity of the conformationally sensitive bands near 1663, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1, implying that DOPA is slightly more effective at shifting the equilibrium toward the R conformation (Fig.6). This result is in agreement with the labeling studies of McCarthy and Moore, which suggest that the nAChR in 3:1 EPC/Chol (25%) is predominantly in the D state, whereas in 3:1 EPC/DOPA it is predominantly in the R conformation (8.McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, increasing proportions of Chol have weak if any effect on the intensity of the difference band centered near 1059 cm−1. At all levels of Chol, the intensity near 1059 cm−1remains essentially the same as the intensity of the band in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in EPC alone. In contrast, the intensity of this band doubles in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in either 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol, 3:2 EPC/DOPA, or 1:1 EPC/DOPA (right panel of Fig. 3). The presence of Chol also does not lead to difference spectra with negative intensity near 1740 cm−1 comparable to that observed in spectra recorded from the nAChR in both 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/Chol and 3:2 EPC/DOPA membranes (Fig.2). The lack of an effect of Chol on the intensities of these two vibrations may indicate that there are subtle structural differences between the nAChR in EPC membranes either with or without anionic lipids (see “Discussion”). Finally, the difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into 1:1 EPC/Chol are similar to those recorded from the nAChR in EPC/Chol 3:1 (Fig. 6). In other words, the pattern of increasing intensity at each of the conformationally sensitive difference bands near 1663, 1655, 1547, and 1430 cm−1 with increasing Chol is reversed at very high levels of Chol. This reversal in the pattern of difference band intensity changes suggests that the ability of Chol to stabilize the nAChR in an R-like conformation is weakened at very high levels of Chol. A similar reversal in trend is observed with the peptide 1H/2H exchange kinetics of the nAChR upon reconstitution into EPC membranes with increasing levels of Chol (23.Baenziger J.E. Darsaut T.E. Morris M.-L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4905-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The main goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that the nAChR requires neutral and anionic lipids in its surrounding membrane environment in order to adopt a functional conformation that will undergo agonist-induced conformational change. We have shown previously that the difference between FTIR spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of Carb exhibits positive and negative bands that serve as markers of the ability of the nAChR to undergo the R→D conformational transition (11.Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24590-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16.Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These markers are absent in Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes. The absence of both neutral and anionic lipids from a reconstituted EPC membrane thus leads to a receptor that cannot undergo Carb-induced conformational change. In contrast, these markers are present with increasing intensity in Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes with increasing levels of either DOPA"

IF2, together with IF3, helps the 30 S subunit to select the initiator tRNA over other tRNAs (7.Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Gold L.

Assembly of the 70 S initiation complex is accompanied by IF2-dependent hydrolysis of GTP and release of IF2 from the 70 S complex, a step that is essential for the first peptide bond formation (8.Luchin S.

IF2 is suspected to participate in the activation of transcription of the rrnB operon (10.Travers A.A. Debenham P.G. Pongs O.

Molecular chaperones form a class of polypeptide-binding proteins that are implicated in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation or degradation after stress, and the control of protein-protein interactions. They can distinguish native proteins from their non-native forms, owing to the specificity of their peptide binding site, and they catalyze protein folding and renaturationin vitro (reviewed in Refs. 21.Ellis R.J.

In the present study, we show that EF-G and IF2, in a manner similar to that of molecular chaperones, increase the refolding of unfolded proteins, protect proteins against thermal denaturation, and form complexes with unfolded proteins. We propose that, in addition to their role in translation, EF-G and IF2 might assist in protein folding and renaturation in the cytoplasm. Citrate synthase (from porcine heart), α-glucosidase (from yeast), BPTI, R-CMLA, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, lysozyme, and all other chemicals, including GTP, GDP, and GTPγS, were from Sigma and were reagent grade. DEAE-Sephacel and thiol-Sepharose resins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was from Bio-Rad. EF-G was purified by covalent chromatography on thiol Sepharose (24.Dantas Caldas T. El Yaagoubi A. Kohiyama M. Richarme G.

EF-G was purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography with column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and elution with a linear 0–0.35m NaCl gradient in the same buffer, followed by covalent chromatography on thiol Sepharose with column buffer (20 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and elution with a gradient of 0–10 mm cysteine in the same buffer. The purified protein was dialyzed for 3 h against 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated by ultrafiltration. EF-G was more than 98% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Initiation factor 2 was purified according to Luchin et al. (8.Luchin S. Putzer H. Hershey J.W.B.

Denaturation and renaturation reactions were carried out at 25 °C. For both proteins, renaturation was initiated by pouring the renaturation solvent onto the unfolded protein, under vortex agitation, in Eppendorf polyethylene tubes. Citrate synthase was denatured at a concentration of 10 μm in 8 murea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0 for 50 min. Renaturation was initiated by a 100-fold dilution in 40 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmpotassium acetate, pH 8.0. The enzymatic activity of citrate synthase was measured as described (28.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Citrate synthase renaturation in the presence of nucleotides was done as described above (unless otherwise indicated) in the presence of 150 μm GDP, GTP, or GTPγS and 200 μm MgCl2. The effect of nucleotides alone on citrate synthase renaturation was low (GTP and GTPγS) or negligible (GDP) and was subtracted. The native enzyme (80 μm) was diluted 100-fold in 40 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmpotassium acetate, pH 8.0 at 43 °C in the absence of added proteins or in the presence of DnaK, EF-G, or IF2. Citrate synthase aggregation was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm as described in Ref. 28.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

For binding assays of R-CMLA and unfolded BPTI to EF-G, IF2, and DnaK, gel permeation columns (Bio-Gel P-200 from Bio-Rad for studies with R-CMLA or Sephadex G-75 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech for studies with BPTI (300-μl bed volume of each)) were equilibrated with column buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2 for studies with R-CMLA and pH 7.4 for studies with BPTI), 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reaction mixtures containing EF-G, IF2, or DnaK and radiolabeled native BPTI, unfolded BPTI, or R-CMLA at indicated concentrations were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C in column buffer without serum albumin and applied to the column at room temperature.

Citrate synthase and α-glucosidase, whose refolding is facilitated by several chaperones such as GroEL, DnaK, hsp90, and small hsps (28.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

They were unfolded in the presence of 8m urea, and allowed to refold upon dilution of the denaturant, in the absence or in the presence of EF-G (protein folding in the presence of DnaK was studied in parallel). Under our experimental conditions, the refolding yield of 0.1 μmcitrate synthase was increased from 7% in the absence of added proteins to 21% in the presence of 5 μm EF-G and 31% in the presence of 3 μm DnaK (Fig.1 A). The dependence of citrate synthase reactivation on the concentration of EF-G is shown in Fig.1 B. The maximal recovery of citrate synthase activity reaches 24% in the presence of 10 μm EF-G, and half-maximal reactivation occurs at 2 μm EF-G, a concentration slightly higher than that of DnaK (around 1 μm) required for half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase in similar conditions (not shown and Ref. 34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The EF-G concentration required for half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase is somewhat higher than the concentration of citrate synthase but is lower than the concentrations of EF-G in the cytoplasm (around 20 μm) (3.Kurland C.G.

C.1995: 979-1004Google Scholar, 35.Weijland A. Harmark K. Cool R.H. Anborgh P.H. Parmeggiani A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As reported previously (34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), other proteins such as ovalbumin and lysozyme were unable to stimulate citrate renaturation, whereas serum albumin could stimulate it to some extent (not shown). In similar experiments, the refolding of 0.1 μm α-glucosidase was increased from 6% in the absence of added protein to 18% in the presence of 2 μm EF-G and 26% in the presence of 2 μm DnaK (not shown). These results suggest that, like molecular chaperones, EF-G interacts with unfolded proteins and increases their productive folding. Elongation factor G belongs to the GTPase superfamily of proteins whose functional cycle includes at least four major conformational states, the nucleotide-free state, the GDP complex, the GTP complex, and the GTPase state. The stimulation of citrate synthase renaturation by EF-G in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of GDP or GTPγS was 2.6-, 2.4-, and 1.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the nucleotide-free form and the GDP form of EF-G are more active in citrate synthase renaturation than its GTPγS form. We obtained similar results for citrate synthase renaturation by elongation factor Tu (18.Caldas T.D. El Yaagoubi A. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11478-11482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the presence of GTP the level of renaturation of citrate synthase is intermediate between those observed in the presence of GDP and GTPγS (Fig. 2 A). However, if the concentration of EF-G is reduced to 0.1 μm during the renaturation of 0.1 μm citrate synthase, GTP produces a significant stimulation of citrate synthase renaturation, which rises from 1.3-fold in the presence of EF-G alone (1.4-fold in the presence of EF-G and GDP) to 1.9-fold in the presence of EF-G and GTP (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions, GTP alone did not stimulate citrate synthase renaturation. This suggests that the GTPase activity of EF-G can stimulate its chaperone activity and that this stimulation is apparent when EF-G is added in limiting amounts. A stimulation by GTP of the EF-Tu/EF-Ts-dependent rhodanese renaturation has been observed by others (17.Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to the stimulation by GTP of the EF-G-dependent citrate synthase renaturation, the GTPase activity of EF-G can be stimulated by the permanently unfolded protein R-CMLA. In the absence of ribosomes, EF-G promotes very little GTP hydrolysis (kcat lower than 0.002 min−1 at 30 °C). The EF-G GTPase is efficiently stimulated by ribosomal particles (kcat = 20 min−1) and, to a lesser extent, by several aliphatic alcohols such as 2-propanol (kcat = 0.03 min−1 in the presence of 20% 2-propanol) (31.De Vendittis E. Masullo M. Bocchini V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4445-4450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R-CMLA is a permanently unfolded protein that maintains an extended conformation without any stable secondary structure in the absence of denaturant (36.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 383-392Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar). It interacts with chaperones, and it stimulates their ATPase activity (23.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 383-392Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar). R-CMLA stimulates 10-fold the GTPase activity of EF-G (Fig.3), whose kcat at 25 °C (calculated from the results shown in Fig. 3) rises from 0.002 min−1 in the absence of added protein, to 0.02 min−1 in the presence of 15 μm R-CMLA. TheK a of the stimulation of the EF-G GTPase by R-CMLA is around 5 μm. The stimulation of the EF-G GTPase by an unfolded protein is reminiscent of that of the DnaK ATPase, whose kcat rises from 0.04 min−1 in the absence of a peptide substrate to 0.16 min−1 in its presence (37.Burkholder W.F. Panagiotidis C.A. Silverstein S.J. Cegielska A. Gottesman M.E. Gaitanaris G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242 (367): 374Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We investigated the function of EF-G under heat shock conditions. As reported previously (28.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), citrate synthase loses its native conformation and undergoes aggregation during incubation at 43 °C. The addition of EF-G (3 μm) or DnaK (2 μm) partially reduces citrate synthase (0.8 μm) aggregation, whereas both 5 μm DnaK and 8 μm EF-G suppress citrate synthase aggregation (Fig.4). In contrast, the addition of up to 35 μm bovine serum albumin (Fig. 4), ovalbumin, or lysozyme (not shown and Ref. 34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) does not protect citrate synthase from thermal aggregation. Thus, EF-G is nearly as efficient as DnaK and other chaperones (28.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in protecting citrate synthase from thermal denaturation and is much more efficient than other proteins such as bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, or lysozyme. Furthermore, the concentration of EF-G required for an efficient thermal protection of citrate synthase (around 5 μm) is severalfold lower than its cellular concentration (around 20 μm). One characteristic of molecular chaperones is their preferential interaction with unfolded proteins (21.Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22.Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C.

R-CMLA, a permanently unfolded protein that maintains an extended conformation without any stable secondary structure in the absence of denaturant, strongly interacts with several chaperones, including DnaK (34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 383-392Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Complex formation between R-CMLA (20,000 Da) and EF-G (82,000 Da) was analyzed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-200 column. When R-CMLA (2 μm) is filtered in the presence of EF-G (10 μm), 14% of R-CMLA fractionates as a higher molecular weight complex than R-CMLA alone (Fig.5). The interaction between EF-G and R-CMLA is not significantly different from that observed between R-CMLA and DnaK; 10 μm DnaK binds 33% of R-CMLA (not shown). Thus, EF-G seems to interact strongly with R-CMLA in a manner similar to that of DnaK. Unfolded BPTI is known to interact with chaperones, including DnaK (34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38.Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 22: 14491-14496Google Scholar). Complex formation between 1 μmunfolded BPTI (6,000 Da) and 10 μm EF-G (82,000 Da) was studied by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column; a significant percentage (39%) of unfolded BPTI fractionates as higher molecular weight material than unfolded BPTI alone (Fig.6). In similar conditions 4 μm DnaK retained 27% of unfolded BPTI (Fig. 6). In contrast, when 1 μm native BPTI and 10 μmEF-G were loaded on the gel permeation column, native BPTI did not elute as a high molecular weight complex (Fig. 6). When similar experiments were carried out with bovine serum albumin (30 μm) or ovalbumin (30 μm), unfolded BPTI did not elute as a high molecular weight complex (not shown). Thus, EF-G, like molecular chaperones, interacts preferentially with unfolded proteins.Figure 6Gel permeation chromatography of EF-G·unfolded BPTI complexes. 1 μm3H-labeled unfolded BPTI was incubated either alone (○) or in the presence of 10 μm EF-G (●) or 10 μm DnaK (▪). 10 μm EF-G was also incubated with 1 μm3H-labeled native BPTI (▵).

The refolding yield of 0.1 μm citrate synthase was increased from 6% in the absence of IF2 to 20% in the presence of 1 μm IF2 (Fig.7 A). Half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase occurs at 0.15 μm IF2 (Fig.7 A). Thus, IF2 stimulates the refolding of citrate synthase with a similar efficiency as EF-G and is efficient at lower concentrations. In similar experiments, the refolding of 0.1 μm α-glucosidase was increased from 7% in the absence of added protein to 15% in the presence of 1 μm IF2 (not shown). We investigated the ability of IF2 to protect citrate synthase from irreversible aggregation during thermal stress under conditions similar to those described for the experiment represented by Fig. 4 for EF-G. IF2 (3 μm) reduces citrate synthase (0.8 μm) aggregation at 43 °C with an efficiency that is similar to that of 3 μm EF-G (compare Figs. 7 Band 4). We also studied the interaction of IF2 with unfolded proteins. The interaction of IF2 with unfolded BPTI is shown in Fig. 7 C. Complex formation between 1 μm unfolded BPTI (6,000 Da) and 5 μm IF2 (97,000 Da) was studied by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column, under conditions similar to those described for the experiment represented by Fig. 6. A significant percentage (32%) of unfolded BPTI fractionates as higher molecular weight material than unfolded BPTI alone (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, when 1 μm native BPTI and 5 μm IF2 were loaded on the gel permeation column, native BPTI did not elute as a high molecular weight complex (not shown). Similar experiments with IF2 and the permanently unfolded protein R-CMLA showed a strong interaction between the initiation factor and R-CMLA (not shown). Thus, IF2, like EF-G and molecular chaperones, interacts preferentially with unfolded proteins. We have shown that R-CMLA can stimulate the GTPase activity of EF-G. IF2 possesses a GTPase activity that has been reported to be totally dependent on the presence of the ribosome (5.Hershey J.W.B. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 613-647Google Scholar, 8.Luchin S. Putzer H.

We measured the GTPase activity of IF2 in the presence of several concentrations of R-CMLA (in the absence of ribosomes). The IF2 GTPase activity, which is undetectable in the absence of ribosomes, as reported by others, is stimulated by R-CMLA with a K a around 15 μm and a kcat of 0.4 min−1 at 25 °C (calculated from the results shown in Fig. 7 D). This activity is similar to that of IF2 in the presence of ribosomes (kcat = 0.8 min−1 at 37 °C). In accordance with the stimulation of the IF2 GTPase by an unfolded protein, the renaturation of 0.1 μm unfolded citrate synthase by 0.1 μm IF2 was stimulated 1.7-fold by 1 mm GTP (not shown). We present biochemical evidence suggesting that EF-G and IF2 play a chaperone-like function in protein folding, protection against thermal denaturation, and interaction with unfolded proteins. EF-G and IF2 increase approximately 3-fold the yield of citrate synthase and α-glucosidase renaturation, as do molecular chaperones. The stimulation factors of protein renaturation (more than 3-fold) and EF-G or IF2 concentrations required for half-maximal protein renaturation (2 μm and 0.15 μm, respectively) are not significantly different from those obtained with DnaK, hsp90, or small hsps (this study and Refs. 28.Jakob U.

Notably, the concentrations of EF-G and IF2 used in this study (in the micromolar range) are lower than their estimated concentration in the bacterial cytoplasm (around 20 and 4 μm, respectively) (3.Kurland C.G.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1432-1457Google Scholar). At micromolar concentrations, EF-G and IF2 protect citrate synthase from thermal denaturation. These concentrations are similar to those of DnaK and of small hsp (expressed as monomers) required for a similar protection (28.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They are in the same range as the cytoplasmic concentrations of EF-G and IF2. Furthermore, other proteins tested (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and lysozyme) do not protect citrate synthase efficiently (34.Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Like DnaK and other chaperones (32.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U.

EF-G and IF2 interact with unfolded BPTI but not with native BPTI and thus appear to discriminate between unfolded and native proteins. EF-G·GDP appears more active in binding unfolded proteins than EF-G·GTPγS. Interestingly, the conversion of EF-G·GTP to EF-G·GDP is accompanied by an increase in binding of the hydrophobic fluorescent probe anilino-naphtalenesulfonate (39.Arai N. Arai K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 243-246PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that EF-G·GDP exposes a hydrophobic surface that might interact with unfolded proteins (hydrophobic interactions occur between chaperones and unfolded proteins) (21.Ellis R.J.

GTP stimulates the EF-G- and IF2-dependent citrate synthase renaturations, under conditions where these translation factors are limiting, suggesting that they use their GTPase activity to catalyze protein folding. Similarly, the renaturation of rhodanese by EF-Tu, in the presence of EF-Ts, is stimulated by GTP (17.Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The stimulation of the GTPase activity of EF-G and of IF2 by the permanently unfolded protein R-CMLA is reminiscent of that of the ATPase activity of the DnaK and GroEL chaperones by unfolded proteins (21.Ellis R.J.

Our results suggest that EF-G itself can display chaperone properties, because it interacts specifically with the unfolded proteins citrate synthase, α-glucosidase, and R-CMLA and unfolded BPTI, similar to classical chaperones. The recent results concerning the chaperone properties of ribosomes and elongation factors support the hypothesis of a cotranslational folding of nascent proteins (45.Hardesty B. Tsalkova T.

The efficient protection of citrate synthase from thermal denaturation afforded by EF-G and IF2 suggests that during heat shock these translation factors might contribute to a reservoir of chaperones and chaperone-like molecules that serve as a chaperone-buffer in preventing the aggregation of non-native proteins until permissive renaturation conditions are restored.

The effect of diazoxide on native and reconstituted sarcolemmal channels in the presence of quasi-cytosolic [Mg-ATP] is negligible in comparison with stimulation by both cromakalim and pinacidil (1.Edwards G.

This suggests diazoxide can bind to SUR2s in agreement with the stimulation of SUR2B/KIR6.2 channels (17.Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J.

By exchanging segments between SUR1 and SUR2A, D'Hahan et al.(18.D'Hahan N. Jacquet H. Moreau C. Catty P. Vivaudou M. Mol.

We have used matched human SUR1-SUR2A chimeras, previously employed to define the segments critical for SUR isoform-specific ATP-inhibitory gating (20.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and high-affinity tolbutamide inhibition (21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), to validate the requirement of TMD12–17 of SUR2 for stimulation by cromakalim or pinacidil and to demonstrate that TMD6–11 and NBF1 control the responsiveness to diazoxide in the presence of Mg-ATP. The human SUR1, SUR2A, and KIR6.2 cDNAs have been described previously (22.Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), as have the cDNAs encoding chimeric SUR I through VI, IX through XIV (20.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and XVII (21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1,left panel). These chimeras were constructed initially to allow swapping of seven major domains of SUR using existing restriction sites in human SUR1 and SUR2A and, when missing, by engineering matching restriction sites. The new chimeras, XIX through XXIV, were constructed by swapping the indicated segments (Fig. 1). The co-transfection with SUR and KIR6.2 and the cultivation of COSm6 cells was done as described (15.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recording of currents from inside-out patches was done at 22–24 °C as described previously (15.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) at a holding potential of −40 mV. Pipettes were filled up with the K+-rich external solution containing (in mm) 145 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (KOH). The Mg2+-free internal solution was (in mm) 140 KCl, 5 EDTA, 5 HEPES, 10 KOH, pH 7.2 (KOH), whereas the Mg2+-containing “intracellular” solution was (in mm) 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 10 KOH, pH 7.2 (KOH). Pinacidil was from Lilly Research Laboratories, and ATP (ultra-pure, di-sodium salt) and other compounds were from Sigma. The free Mg2+ concentration in all Mg2+-containing internal solutions was maintained at a quasi-cytosolic level of ∼0.7 mm, as described previously (15.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Tolbutamide (200 mm stock solution in 0.1 N KOH) was added to the nucleotide-free internal solution to a final concentration of 200 μm. Diazoxide, cromakalim, or pinacidil (100 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide, Me2SO) were added to the 0.1 mm ATP- and Mg2+-containing internal solution. The final concentrations were 300 μm diazoxide (0.3 volume % Me2SO), 200 μm cromakalim, or 100 μm pinacidil. Bathing solutions were applied using a programmable rapid solution changer (RSC-200, Biologic Inc, Claix, France). The relative NPo, used as a measure of channel activity in the presence of a test compound, was estimated as described previously (15.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) after applying corrections for run-down and for reactivation by Mg-ATP. Addition of 0.3 volume % Me2SO to the ∼0.1 mm Mg-ATP containing internal solution induced a small, 1.25 ± 0.26- and 1.27 ± 0.28-fold, increase in the NPo values of β-cell and cardiacK ATP channels, respectively (mean ± S.D.). The latter estimate was used to define the lower limit for a significant increase in the averaged NPo values, expressed as mean ± S.D., in the presence of either KCO (see Fig. 1). The differences in NPo values with p < 0.05 (unpaired Student'st test) were considered significant. In agreement with our original demonstration (8.Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), the SUR1/KIR6.2 and SUR2A/KIR6.2 channels display differences in sulfonylurea sensitivity and in responsiveness to diazoxide and cromakalim (Fig. 1). The SUR1/KIR6.2 channel currents, activated upon excision of an inside-out patch into nucleotide-free internal solution, are inhibited by ∼60% by 200 μm tolbutamide, a concentration which saturates the high-affinity binding site (21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the SUR2A/KIR6.2 channels are inhibited by ∼15% (15.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) as a result of low-affinity interaction(s) (21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). With ∼0.1 mmMg-ATP in the internal solution to ensure maximal binding of KCOs (11.Dickinson K.E. Bryson C.C. Cohen R.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and pre-inhibit channel activity, a supra-pharmacological concentration of diazoxide, 300 μm, sufficient to half-maximally saturate SUR1 and SUR2 (13.Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dorschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), significantly attenuated nucleotide-inhibition of SUR1/KIR6.2, but not SUR2A/KIR6.2, channels. A concentration of cromakalim, sufficient to saturate SUR2A, almost completely antagonized the inhibition of SUR2A/KIR6.2 channels by 0.1 mmATP but did not stimulate SUR1/KIR6.2 channels. In the absence of either, or both, nucleotides and Mg2+(∼10−9m free Mg2+ in the Mg2+-free internal solution), stimulation by diazoxide was undetectable and stimulation by cromakalim or pinacidil was reduced ∼10-fold (not shown). The remaining nonphysiologic effect of cromakalim in the absence of Mg-ATP was not examined further. Comparison of the stimulation of chimeric SUR/KIR6.2 channels by diazoxide and cromakalim demonstrated all four possible types of channels including those differentially responsive to the two compounds, those that failed to respond to either drug and those that responded to both drugs. Analysis of six pairs of matched chimeric SURs (Fig. 1, underlined) suggested that stimulation by cromakalim was determined by the presence of TMD12–17 from SUR2 in the chimeric receptor (chimeras V through XII), whereas matched channels lacking this segment were not stimulated by cromakalim. Stimulation by diazoxide was correlated with the presence of either NBF1 and TMD6–11 from SUR1 (chimeras I through III and XII through XIV, and XI, respectively). Chimeras II and XII, containing both NBF1 and TMD6–11 of SUR1 conferred the maximal response to diazoxide, whereas chimera XI, containing TMD6–11 of SUR1 and NBF1 of SUR2, specified a lower efficacy response. Analysis of three additional pairs of chimeras with reciprocally exchanged single segments reinforces the conclusion that TMD12–17 of SUR2 confers a selective interaction with either cromakalim or pinacidil, whereas TMD6–11 and NBF1 of SUR1 contribute additively to diazoxide responsiveness. Substitution of TMD6–11 and NBF1 of SUR1 into SUR2A (chimera XXIV) was essential for maximal response to diazoxide. The separable nature of the segments that specify the selective responses of K ATP channel isoforms to the two KCOs is demonstrated by the generation of channels that are stimulated by both the “β-cell specific” and “cardiovascular” KCOs (chimeras XII, XIX through XXI, and XXIV) versus those that are not stimulated by either KCO (chimera IV and chimera XVII). The inhibition (∼60%) of these KCO-insensitive currents by 200 μm tolbutamide ensured that TMD12–17 was functionally coupled to KIR6.2 (21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A direct comparison of currents through the channels responding to both types KCOs suggests a slower off-rate for the benzothiadiazine or pyridine versusbenzopyran KCOs. The results show that two separate regions in SURs are necessary to determine the selective effects of diazoxide versuscromakalim or pinacidil. We propose that segment(s) of SUR2, from the glutamate-rich motif following NBF1 through the intracellular segment preceding NBF2 (red tones in Fig.2), confer sensitivity to the benzopyran and pyridine derivatives, whereas TMD6–11 and NBF1 of SUR1 specify a β-cell channel-like response to the pyrimidine KCO, diazoxide. Our demonstration that TMD12–17 of SUR2 is required for cromakalim stimulation of human K ATP channels complements the observation of D'Hahan et al. (18.D'Hahan N. Jacquet H. Moreau C. Catty P. Vivaudou M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that transfer of TMD12–17 from rat SUR2A into hamster SUR1 is sufficient for SR47063-responsiveness of chimeric SUR/KIR6.2 channels and complements the report by Uhde et al. (19.Uhde I. Toman A. Gross I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28079-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that smaller segments, Thr1059-Leu1087 and Arg1218-Asn1320, of rat SUR2 confer specific binding of [3H]P1075, displaceable by pinacidil and levcromakalim, when placed in a hamster SUR1 background. These results imply, but do not prove, that TMD12–17 is essential to form a KCO binding pocket. D'Hahan et al. (18.D'Hahan N. Jacquet H. Moreau C. Catty P. Vivaudou M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) used a limited number of chimeras and were unable to delineate a region critical for the selective action of diazoxide, while Uhde et al. (19.Uhde I. Toman A. Gross I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28079-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) assumed TMD12–17 was sufficient to determine the response to different KCOs and did not examine the effects of diazoxide. Using a matched set of SUR chimeras, we show the action of diazoxide requires more than TMD12–17. The demonstration that stimulation by diazoxide involves domains of SUR1 other than TMD12–17 suggests these domains either couple diazoxide binding at TMD12–17, or at another segment, to the KIR6.2 gating mechanism or form an additional KCO-binding site. Consistent with a coupling mechanism, diazoxide can displace [3H]P1075 from SUR2B, and [3H]glibenclamide from SUR1, yielding similar apparent KD values for both SUR1 and SUR2 isoforms (13.Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dorschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and can stimulate bothK ATP channel isoforms (16.D'Hahan N. Moreau C. Prost A.L. Jacquet H. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Vivaudou M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The results are compatible with a minimal model in which different classes of KCOs, including diazoxide, occupy the same site in TMD12–17 and that this site, in SUR1, is in close proximity to sulfonylurea binding pocket (19.Uhde I. Toman A. Gross I. Schwanstecher C. Schwanstecher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28079-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The proximity of these sites implies the potential for negative allosteric interactions. We infer that multiple regions of SUR contribute to coupling KCO-occupied site(s) with the KIRgating machinery. In SUR1/KIR6.2 channels, efficient coupling of diazoxide binding requires TMD6–11 and NBF1, whereas the C terminus is important in SUR2B/KIR6.2 channels. The involvement of NBF1 in stimulation by diazoxide suggests nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis could contribute to the efficacy of this compound. This would be consistent with diazoxide stimulation of SUR2A/KIR6.2 channels under conditions which may saturate ADP binding (16.D'Hahan N. Moreau C. Prost A.L. Jacquet H. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A.

Babenko, unpublished data. Based on four lines of evidence that 1) the analogous TMD12–17 segment of MRP, a structurally related transport ATPase, is important for conferring drug-resistance (25.Stride B.D. Cole S.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22877-22883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 2) substrates are known to activate the ATPase activity of transport ATPases, 3) hydrolyzable Mg-ATP is required for KCO action, and 4) K ATP channel stimulation is regulated by changes in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio, we hypothesize that KCOs increase an ATPase activity of SUR and/or stabilize Mg-ADP on NBF2 of SUR (24.Ueda K.

Within this framework, the requirement of Mg-ATP for KCO binding could reflect an ordered ATP hydrolytic mechanism and suggests KCOs may be transported. This suggests that drug binding to TMD12–17 and cooperative binding (24.Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Contribution of separate domains to coupling the energy of binding to re-configurations of the channel gate show the molecular mechanism of action of these drugs cannot be understood simply in terms of drug binding sites. Recent studies (13.Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dorschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J.

The relative currents in the presence of ∼0.1 mm Mg-ATP and 200 μm cromakalim (see also Ref. 18.D'Hahan N. Jacquet H. Moreau C. Catty P. Vivaudou M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) are higher than expected if KCOs “uncouple” SUR from KIR6.2 and thus eliminate the ability of SUR to increase the sensitivity of KIR6.0 to ATP, judged by comparing the IC50(ATP) of heteromeric versus homomeric channels (14.Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 27.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J.

The data argue that KCOs have a netstimulatory effect, beyond the ∼9-fold and ∼33-fold decrease in IC50(ATP) induced by SUR2A and SUR1, respectively (20.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We propose that there is no requirement for a decrease in the affinity of the putative ATP-inhibitory site on KIR6.0 or need for dissociation of ATP for KCOs to open K ATPchannels. Our finding that the first half of the N terminus of KIR6.2 “couples” high-affinity sulfonylurea- but not diazoxide-binding to SUR1 with KIR gate (21.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) implies there are at least two parallel pathways through which SURs can converse with the KIR6.0 pore gate.

https://openalex.org/W2162700367,"Holo-(acyl carrier protein) synthase (AcpS) post-translationally modifies apoacyl carrier protein (apoACP) via transfer of 4'-phosphopantetheine from coenzyme A (CoA) to the conserved serine 36 gamma-OH of apoACP. The resulting holo-acyl carrier protein (holo-ACP) is then active as the central coenzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis. The acpS gene has previously been identified and shown to be essential for Escherichia coli growth. Earlier mutagenic studies isolated the E. coli MP4 strain, whose elevated growth requirement for CoA was ascribed to a deficiency in holoACP synthesis. Sequencing of the acpS gene from the E. coli MP4 strain (denoted acpS1) showed that the AcpS1 protein contains a G4D mutation. AcpS1 exhibited a approximately 5-fold reduction in its catalytic efficiency when compared with wild type AcpS, accounting for the E. coli MP4 strain phenotype. It is shown that a conditional acpS mutant accumulates apoACP in vivo under nonpermissive conditions in a manner similar to the E. coli MP4 strain. In addition, it is demonstrated that the gene product, YhhU, of a previously identified E. coli open reading frame can completely suppress the acpS conditional, lethal phenotype upon overexpression of the protein, suggesting that YhhU may be involved in an alternative pathway for phosphopantetheinyl transfer and holoACP synthesis in E. coli."

Hypo or hyperosmotic stress causes water influx or efflux, respectively, from the cell, thereby changing its hydration, volume, and/or turgor pressure. As a response, cells have developed a variety of effective mechanisms to overcome water stress. Osmoregulation is thus a biological phenomenon of fundamental significance, e.g. salinity tolerance in plants, kidney physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and microbial biotechnology. It is necessary for the survival and growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms in their native habitats. The most widely distributed strategy of response to hyperosmotic stress is the uptake and/or biosynthesis of osmoprotectants, also called compatible solutes,e.g. glycine betaine, proline, ectoine, or trehalose (1.Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To optimally adapt the response of the cell to the extent of osmotic stress, the transporters and biosynthetic enzymes involved in the stress response are regulated on the level of expression and activity. Signal transduction pathways exist that originate from the osmotic challenge of the cell and ultimately lead to the immediate (activity regulation) and long-term (expression regulation) responses of the cell. The very first step in signal transduction necessarily is related to osmosensing mechanisms at the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our work on BetP of Corynebacterium glutamicum focuses on osmosensing processes at the cell membrane.C. glutamicum, a GC-rich Gram-positive soil bacterium, is extensively used in amino acid production (3.Krämer R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 75-93Crossref Google Scholar). It is equipped with four secondary carriers for the uptake of the compatible solutes betaine, proline, and ectoine (4.Peter H. Weil B. Burkovski A. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of them, BetP and ProP, are regulated by the external osmolality both on the level of activity and expression, EctP is constitutively synthesized but osmoregulated on the level of activity, and PutP is an anabolic proline carrier not involved in osmoregulation. The high affinity, Na+-coupled glycine betaine uptake system BetP was biochemically analyzed in detail (5.Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 177: 4690-4695Crossref Google Scholar, 6.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the corresponding gene has been characterized (7.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BetP is predicted to be a typical 12-transmembrane segment transporter carrying cytoplasmically exposed domains of 50–60 amino acids at its N- and C-terminal parts. Specific deletions in both terminal domains of BetP led to modulation of its response to osmotic stress and resulted in the uncoupling of the sensory form of the catalytic function,i.e. transport (6.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted in terms of BetP comprising both functions of an osmosensor and an osmoregulator. This concept was first proposed for theEscherichia coli proline transporter ProP (8.Milner J.L. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Culham D.E. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Whereas immediate response and long-term adaptation to osmotic stress is relatively well characterized in several microorganisms,e.g. in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Bacillus subtilis (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 11.Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), the mechanisms related to sensing osmotic stress are not well understood (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This also holds true for eukaryotic cells, in which many osmolatory genes, proteins, and signal cascades have been identified, whereas the mechanisms by which the extracellular osmolality is sensed remains largely obscure (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Strange K. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 146-147Google Scholar, 13.Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This in particular concerns both the physical parameters that may be actual stimuli in osmosensing as well as their interaction with the osmosensory proteins. In view of the well characterized properties of BetP and the possibility to discriminate between sensory and catalytic function of this carrier at least to some extent, BetP seems to be a suitable candidate to study the kind of signals that are sensed by the membrane-embedded transporter.In view of the complex situation within the intact cell while sensing osmotic stimuli and transducing the corresponding signals, to be able to define the putative stimulating parameters it is desirable to reduce this complexity. The suitability of a reconstituted system for this purpose has recently been shown for the osmoregulated ProP fromE. coli (14.Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Jung H. Bacon M. Cairns M.T. Ferguson S.M. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. White G. Hallett F.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes are an attractive approach for this goal mainly because of two aspects. First, putative additional components or factors can more easily be recognized in a system consisting of a single purified protein and a defined lipid bilayer. Second, in proteoliposomes the three different spaces surrounding BetP, namely both the external and internal hydrophilic space as well as the hydrophobic membrane surroundings, are freely accessible to experimental variation. In particular the latter aspect,i.e. to define the sites of signal input of osmotic stress to the membrane-inserted carrier protein, was the main goal of this study.Here we report the reconstitution of purified BetP from C. glutamicum in proteoliposomes, where it retained its basic functional properties. For transport activity it needed the presence of an appropriate driving force (membrane potential and/or Na+gradient). It was significantly stimulated by osmotic upshifts, which, to some extent could be mimicked by insertion of the membrane-active local anesthetic tetracaine. Most interestingly, the setpoint of osmodependent regulation was modulated by the kind of phospholipid comprising the surrounding membrane. These results demonstrate that purified BetP, when integrated into liposomal membranes, is both an osmosensor and an osmoregulator, and at least a major input of the osmotic stimulus occurs directly via the surrounding membrane.DISCUSSIONPurification of strep-tagged BetP from C. glutamicumwas achieved after heterologous expression of the strepbetPgene in E. coli. Both the isolation and reconstitution procedures were optimized, resulting in highly active BetP-mediated betaine uptake with a V max of 2.3 mmol/mg of protein/min. The reconstituted carrier protein fully retained its functional properties with respect to substrate specificity and affinity toward its substrates betaine and Na+. Furthermore, after homologous expression in C. glutamicumthe N-terminal tag was shown to have no significant influence on the regulatory properties of BetP.The main topic studied in this paper concerns the characterization of the modulating influences of osmolality and lipid surroundings on the membrane-inserted BetP protein. Thus, the mechanisms of osmosensing by an osmoregulated carrier protein are directly addressed. Analysis of the transport activity regulation by changes in the composition of the external medium demonstrated that BetP fully retained its regulatory properties in proteoliposomes. Activation because of increasing external osmolality was observed both after addition of NaCl and sorbitol, whereas an equivalent addition of the membrane-permeable solute glycerol did not lead to significant activation of BetP. The difference in stimulation by NaCl as compared with sorbitol can putatively be attributed to the difference in the action of these solutes. Whereas an increase in external sorbitol leads to an osmotic stress only (transmembrane osmolality difference), in addition to osmotic stress, NaCl induces ionic stress (change in ionic strength). Interestingly, this difference seems to be abolished at higher osmolalities. The fact that glycerol, which freely equilibrates across the proteoliposomal membrane, did not lead to a similar response of BetP indicates that a symmetric increase of the concentration of a neutral solute on both sides of the liposomal membrane does not affect betaine transport. Consequently, anhydrotic stress does not seem to play a role for reconstituted BetP (37.Umaprasad G. Gowrishankar J. J. Genet. 1998; 77: 1-11Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar).In view of the results obtained previously with BetP in intact C. glutamicum and E. coli cells (5.Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 177: 4690-4695Crossref Google Scholar, 6.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it is interesting to note that BetP in liposomes is active already at zero transmembrane osmotic gradient, although only to a low extent. This was not observed for reconstituted E. coli ProP in the only study available that uses a comparable approach (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is too preliminary, however, to speculate why and to what extent BetP may be active without the presence of an osmotic stress. However, this result illuminates the fact that at least in this respect, the situation in intact cells is not directly comparable with that of proteoliposomes. Intact cells do have an osmotic gradient across the plasma membrane because of the turgor pressure that is necessary to maintain the cell's viability and growth. This is not the case in proteoliposomes. Thus, the “zero values” are principally different in the two cases, i.e. a true zero transmembrane osmotic gradient in the case of proteoliposomes and the physiologically turgor-related transmembrane osmotic gradient in the intact cell. Further studies with extended variations of internal and external solute concentration and composition, and correlation of these data with the situation in intact cells are necessary to fully elucidate the significance of this difference.A series of different primary signals can, in principle, be made responsible for modulating the activity of an osmoregulated membrane-inserted carrier system, irrespective of the kind of cell in which osmoregulation takes place (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 13.Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although this complexity is significantly reduced in the liposomal system because of the lack of both a cytoplasm and a cell wall, it is still a question of whether this signal input is related to the change in the external compartment, the transmembrane gradient, or whether the input is via the membrane directly. We addressed this question by adding the local anesthetic tetracaine, which, when added in low concentrations, is known to change the intrinsic phase behavior of lipid membranes directly (30.Auger M. Jarell H.C. Smith I.C.P. Siminovitch D.J. Mantsch H.H. Wong P.T.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6086-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31.Shimooka T. Shibata A. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32.Lambert C. Erdmann A. Eikmanns M. Krämer R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although not to a large extent, addition of tetracaine in concentrations below 1 mm increased transport activity mediated by the reconstituted BetP, as observed previously in intact cells (6.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The optimum stimulation in the two largely different surroundings was found to be surprisingly similar, particularly in view of the fact that only the lower part of the titration experiment,i.e. the course of increasing activity due to activity stimulation, is significant. The consecutive decrease was previously shown to be related to a damaging effect of tetracaine on the membrane stability and should thus be significantly different in a simple proteoliposomal bilayer as compared with the complex ensemble of bilayer-structured cell wall and plasma membrane of C. glutamicum. Nevertheless, the observation of an activity modulation by addition of tetracaine indicates that at least part of the primary signal transferred to BetP comes directly from the membrane.When the regulatory properties of C. glutamicum BetP were studied in the heterologous host E. coli, a shift in the optimum of stimulation by the increase of external osmolality was observed from 1.3 osmol/kg (C. glutamicum) down to 0.5 osmol/kg (E. coli) (7.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation can be attributed either to the different membrane surroundings of BetP in the two different organisms or to the difference in turgor pressure betweenE. coli and C. glutamicum. The liposomal system offers the possibility to test at least the second alternative. Because it was, unfortunately, not possible to prepare stable liposomes from lipid extracts of C. glutamicum, presumably due to the mycolic acid contaminants from the bilayer-containing C. glutamicum cell wall (35.Nikaido H. Kim S.H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 36.Lichtinger T. Burkovski A. Niederweis M. Krämer R. Benz R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15024-15032Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we used pure phosphatidyl glycerol, which represents 87% of phospholipids of the C. glutamicumplasma membrane, to mimic the conditions in C. glutamicum. The analysis of osmotic stimulation of BetP in proteoliposomes prepared from different mixtures of phosphatidyl glycerol and E. colilipids, which mainly consist of phosphatidyl ethanolamine, revealed a similar difference in the optimum of stimulation as previously found when comparing BetP inserted in intact E. coli and C. glutamicum cells (7.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More conclusively, this shift in the observed optimum was linearly related to the increase in the content of phosphatidyl glycerol in the E. coli lipids. This indicates that the observed alteration in BetP function was not due to the simple presence of phosphatidyl glycerol but to its share in the bilayer membrane. This argument is strengthened by the fact that E. coli lipids naturally contain 15% phosphatidyl glycerol and 5% diphosphatidyl glycerol. Consequently, the regulatory pattern of BetP seems to be, at least to a significant extent, directly related to properties of the surrounding membranes. These properties are obviously not local effects, e.g. direct interaction of a particular phospholipid species with the inserted protein, rather global effects related to the state of the surrounding membrane must be assumed.In principle, two models may be put forward to explain these results. The difference may be either related to the difference of the two lipids in (surface) charge or to their difference in bilayer-forming capacity. Phosphatidyl ethanolamine, the major E. colilipid, is a typical non-bilayer lipid (38.Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), whereas phosphatidyl glycerol is well known for its bilayer forming capacity (39.Seddon J.M. Cevc G. Cevc G. Phospholipid Handbook. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 404-454Google Scholar). The result, that the optimum of stimulation is independent of whether the neutral sorbitol or the ionic NaCl is used in high concentrations, which, in the latter case would lead to a marked decrease of the surface potential in the direct neighborhood of BetP, weakens the argument of the surface charge being the major reason for the observed shift in activation. Furthermore, the significant content of negatively charged lipids in the E. coli lipid extract (20% negatively charged phospholipids; see above) argues against this explanation.Taken together, the analysis of factors influencing osmoregulated betaine uptake catalyzed by membrane-inserted BetP in proteoliposomes led to the following conclusions. BetP alone is fully sufficient for the regulatory response in transport activity to osmotic stress exerted by a rise in external osmolality. A similar conclusion was drawn recently for the reconstituted and osmoregulated ProP from E. coli (12.Strange K. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 146-147Google Scholar). At least a major factor modulating BetP activity originates via the surrounding membrane directly, as demonstrated by both the influence of tetracaine and the phospholipid composition of the membrane. A possible contribution of turgor to this regulation cannot be tested directly in the reconstituted system, because proteoliposomes do not have a turgor pressure. However, in view of the fact that effective regulation of BetP proved to be preserved in the liposomal system, turgor does not seem a good candidate for regulating BetP in intact cells.A series of widely different parameters have theoretically been made responsible as osmosensor stimuli, including influences originating from the composition and physical state of the cell wall or the plasma membrane, respectively, as well as from direct interactions with external solutes or internal compounds (solutes and macromolecules). Although included in this summary of hypothetical effectors, to our knowledge this is the first time that the phospholipid composition of the membrane has experimentally been related to the mechanism of osmosensing. It should be taken into account that the different putative regulatory parameters tested in this study seem to act on different levels. We have no indication so far that BetP could be activated by a particular lipid surrounding itself; in contrast, the lipid membrane seems to basically determine the possible range of activation for BetP in case it becomes activated. On the other hand, the event triggering the activation seems to be directly related, at least to a significant extent, to membrane changes caused by osmotic and ionic stress at or across the membrane bilayer. Osmotic stress is a common challenge encountered by mammals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Hypo or hyperosmotic stress causes water influx or efflux, respectively, from the cell, thereby changing its hydration, volume, and/or turgor pressure. As a response, cells have developed a variety of effective mechanisms to overcome water stress. Osmoregulation is thus a biological phenomenon of fundamental significance, e.g. salinity tolerance in plants, kidney physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and microbial biotechnology. It is necessary for the survival and growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms in their native habitats. The most widely distributed strategy of response to hyperosmotic stress is the uptake and/or biosynthesis of osmoprotectants, also called compatible solutes,e.g. glycine betaine, proline, ectoine, or trehalose (1.Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To optimally adapt the response of the cell to the extent of osmotic stress, the transporters and biosynthetic enzymes involved in the stress response are regulated on the level of expression and activity. Signal transduction pathways exist that originate from the osmotic challenge of the cell and ultimately lead to the immediate (activity regulation) and long-term (expression regulation) responses of the cell. The very first step in signal transduction necessarily is related to osmosensing mechanisms at the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our work on BetP of Corynebacterium glutamicum focuses on osmosensing processes at the cell membrane. C. glutamicum, a GC-rich Gram-positive soil bacterium, is extensively used in amino acid production (3.Krämer R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 75-93Crossref Google Scholar). It is equipped with four secondary carriers for the uptake of the compatible solutes betaine, proline, and ectoine (4.Peter H. Weil B. Burkovski A. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of them, BetP and ProP, are regulated by the external osmolality both on the level of activity and expression, EctP is constitutively synthesized but osmoregulated on the level of activity, and PutP is an anabolic proline carrier not involved in osmoregulation. The high affinity, Na+-coupled glycine betaine uptake system BetP was biochemically analyzed in detail (5.Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 177: 4690-4695Crossref Google Scholar, 6.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the corresponding gene has been characterized (7.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BetP is predicted to be a typical 12-transmembrane segment transporter carrying cytoplasmically exposed domains of 50–60 amino acids at its N- and C-terminal parts. Specific deletions in both terminal domains of BetP led to modulation of its response to osmotic stress and resulted in the uncoupling of the sensory form of the catalytic function,i.e. transport (6.Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted in terms of BetP comprising both functions of an osmosensor and an osmoregulator. This concept was first proposed for theEscherichia coli proline transporter ProP (8.Milner J.L. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Culham D.E. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whereas immediate response and long-term adaptation to osmotic stress is relatively well characterized in several microorganisms,e.g. in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Bacillus subtilis (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 11.Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), the mechanisms related to sensing osmotic stress are not well understood (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This also holds true for eukaryotic cells, in which many osmolatory genes, proteins, and signal cascades have been identified, whereas the mechanisms by which the extracellular osmolality is sensed remains largely obscure (2.Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Strange K. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 146-147Google Scholar, 13.Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This in particular concerns both the physical parameters that may be actual stimuli in osmosensing as well as their interaction with the osmosensory proteins. In view of the well characterized properties of BetP and the possibility to discriminate between sensory and catalytic function of this carrier at least to some extent, BetP seems to be a suitable candidate to study the kind of signals that are sensed by the membrane-embedded transporter. In view of the complex situation within the intact cell while sensing osmotic stimuli and transducing the corresponding signals, to be able to define the putative stimulating parameters it is desirable to reduce this complexity. The suitability of a reconstituted system for this purpose has recently been shown for the osmoregulated ProP fromE. coli (14.Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Jung H. Bacon M. Cairns M.T. Ferguson S.M. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. White G. Hallett F.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes are an attractive approach for this goal mainly because of two aspects. First, putative additional components or factors can more easily be recognized in a system consisting of a single purified protein and a defined lipid bilayer. Second, in proteoliposomes the three different spaces surrounding BetP, namely both the external and internal hydrophilic space as well as the hydrophobic membrane surroundings, are freely accessible to experimental variation. In particular the latter aspect,i.e. to define the sites of signal input of osmotic stress to the membrane-inserted carrier protein, was the main goal of this study. Here we report the reconstitution of purified BetP from C. glutamicum in proteoliposomes, where it retained its basic functional properties. For transport activity it needed the presence of an appropriate driving force (membrane potential and/or Na+gradient). It was significantly stimulated by osmotic upshifts, which, to some extent could be mimicked by insertion of the membrane-active local anesthetic tetracaine. Most interestingly, the setpoint of osmodependent regulation was modulated by the kind of phospholipid comprising the surrounding membrane. These results demonstrate that purified BetP, when integrated into liposomal membranes, is both an osmosensor and an osmoregulator, and at least a major input of the osmotic stimulus occurs directly via the surrounding"

In addition to the ability to suppress the effects of act1-1 andsec14-1 mutations, a variety of perplexing additional phenotypes have been attributed to yeast strains containing an assortment of mutations in the SAC1 gene (sac1-1 to sac1-29,mds1-sac1) (1.Novick P.

These include disruption to the localization of the actin cytoskeleton and chitin deposition, reminiscent of the act1-1 phenotype (1.Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D.

New insight as to the function of Sac1p became possible during the cloning of the presynaptic inositol-5-phosphatase synaptojanin-1 (7.McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) when a region of considerable homology between this protein and Sac1p was identified. The synaptojanins are phosphatidylinositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatases that remove phosphate from the d-5-hydroxyl position of phosphatidylinositol phosphates. They are members of a large group of 5-phosphatases (reviewed in Ref. 8.Woscholski R. Parker P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that also include the type I and II 5-phosphatases. All 5-phosphatases contain a 5-phosphatase domain; the type II 5-phosphatases additionally contain a type II domain; and the synaptojanin-like proteins, in addition to the type II domain, contain a region of homology to Sac1p, the Sac domain (see Fig. 1). Synaptojanin-1 represents one member of a family of Sac domain-containing inositide phosphatases (8.Woscholski R. Parker P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that also include the yeast proteins Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p (also called Sjl1p Sjl2p, and Sjl3p) (9.Stolz L.E.

A 400-base pair HpaI fragment from these two constructs, containing codon 246, was ligated into the other construct to producesac1 mutants with only one of the two mds1-sac1mutations, pRS313.SAC1F97L and pRS313.SAC1L246P.NcoI-SalI fragments containing wild-type and mutant SAC1 genes from the pRS313 constructs were ligated into the GST-tagged protein expression vector pGEX-KG to produce pGEX.SAC1, pGEX.SAC1F97L, pGEX.SAC1L246P, and pGEX.MDS1, which were used to produce full-length bacterial GST-Sac1 proteins. These pGEX constructs were cut with DraIII-HindIII, releasing a 900-base pair fragment that was replaced with a 500-base pair DraIII-HindIII fragment from pRSET.SAC1.sacdom to allow the production of truncated Sac1p proteins from the vectors pGEX.SAC1.sacdom, pGEX.SAC- 1F97L.sacdom, pGEX.SAC1L246P.sacdom, and pGEX.MDS1.sacdom. Authenticity of constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, and recombinant protein was expressed in yeast grown in SD/raffinose medium with galactose to induce protein expression. Yeast cells were disrupted to extract the protein using a Bionebuliser (Glas-Col) as described previously (17.Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H.

Mutant sac1-deleted cells were labeled for lipid extraction, deacylation, and separation with [14C]inositol as described above.

The ghosts were then diluted to 1.5 ml, and perchloric acid was added to 1 mbefore incubation on ice to precipitate protein. The samples were neutralized with 2 m KOH and 0.5 m Hepes and again incubated on ice for 30 min before pelleting at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove potassium perchlorate and protein. HPLC of GroPInsPs was performed on a Partisphere 5-μm strong-anion exchange column (250 × 40 mm) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using the following gradient separation: 0 min, 0% solvent B; 5 min, 0% solvent B; 15 min, 2% solvent B; and 100 min, 2% solvent B (solvent A = H2O and solvent B = 1.25m (NH4)2HPO4 (pH 3.8)). The phosphatase activity of proteins was determined using colorimetric or radioactive assays. Activity for yeast 5-phosphatase (Inp52p) was determined by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.125 mm lipid phosphoinositide, 0.25% (w/v) octyl glucoside, 4 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4). The released phosphate was then assessed colorimetrically as described before (20.Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 20-μl assay was stopped by adding 25 μl of malachite green/molybdate reagent, followed by 80 μl of water. The reaction was allowed to take place for 30 min before measurements were taken at 610 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices). Basal phosphate contents were determined by adding the enzyme after termination of the reaction with the malachite green/molybdate reagent. The phosphatase activity of the Sac1p phosphatases was assessed in the presence of 10 μm lipid phosphoinositide, 0.25% (w/v) octyl glucoside, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 37 °C using radioactively labeled substrate that was prepared as described below. Phosphatidylinositol monophosphates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using PtdIns 3- and 4-kinases with PtdIns as a substrate (21.Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PtdIns(5)P was incubated in the presence of a 4-fold excess of phosphatidylethanolamine with phosphoinositide 3-kinase to produce PtdIns(3,5)P2. The 32P-labeled lipids were separated by TLC (16.Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purified, and supplemented with unlabeled lipids (Echelon) before assay (21.Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The assay (50 μl) was stopped by adding 0.4 ml of methanol/CHCl3 (1:1), followed by 0.2 ml of 1 n HCl and 10 μl of Folch bovine brain extracts (Sigma) as carrier lipid (17.Cooke F.T. Dove S.K.

After phase separation, both phases were dried down under vacuum. The water phase was directly counted (scintillation), whereas the CHCl3 phase was subjected to TLC (17.Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1219-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After development, PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 spots were scrapped and counted in scintillant. In both types of assay, phosphoinositides (Echelon) and phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) were first repurified by chloroform extraction according as described (22.Folch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently quantified by ashing the lipids, followed by a colorimetric phosphate assay (23.Petitou M. Tuy F. Rosenfeld C. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We had previously demonstrated that the mds1-sac1 allele of the gene SAC1 and some other sac1 mutants display multiple-drug sensitivity, a phenotype characterized by sensitivity to drugs such as novobiocin and brefeldin A (3.Hughes W.E. Pocklington M.J. Orr E. Paddon C.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using high- and low-copy wild-type yeast genomic libraries, we had screened for sequences able to suppress sac1 multiple-drug sensitivity and had identified a variety of sequences able to complement the mutant (3.Hughes W.E. Pocklington M.J. Orr E. Paddon C.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the analysis was not comprehensive, and we had speculated that other open reading frames may be able to complement sac1mutant phenotypes. Principally, we were interested in testing the genes that had been described as encoding proteins with homology to Sac1p, namely the S. cerevisiae genes INP51,INP52, INP53, and FIG4, and, in addition, human synaptojanin-1. To examine the ability of these genes to complement sac1 mutant phenotypes, we transformed the genes, cloned into an inducible expression vector, into wild-type andsac1-deleted strains. Transformed strains were then tested for growth on plates containing a variety of drugs and inhibitors under conditions that would suppress (glucose) or promote (galactose) induction of the plasmid-borne gene. Expression of the genes in wild-type yeast appeared to have no effects on growth (data not shown), whereas expression of the genes in the sac1 mutant showed significant differences. Yeast sac1 mutants grew slightly slower than wild-type cells; however, mutants transformed with wild-type SAC1, INP52, or INP53 and grown on galactose grew at wild-type rates (Fig.1). When grown on medium containing inhibitory concentrations of drugs, the effect was more pronounced. Yeast sac1 disruptants were drug-sensitive and did not grow; however, mutants transformed with wild-type SAC1,INP52, or INP53 and incubated on medium containing galactose grew at wild-type rates (Fig. 1). Therefore, the effects of sac1 mutations can be suppressed by some property contributed by overexpressed Inp52p and Inp53p phosphatases. The demonstration that sac1 phenotypes could be suppressed by phosphatidylinositol-phosphate 5-phosphatases strengthened our hypothesis that the lipid phosphoinositides may represent part of the mechanism by which Sac1p is able to mediate its pleiotropic effects (3.Hughes W.E. Pocklington M.J. Orr E. Paddon C.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Other observations such as the effects of Sac1p on actin function (1.Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be regulated by PtdIns(4,5)P2; the effects of Sac1p on Sec14p function, which regulates the ratio of PtdIns and phosphatidylcholine (24.Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); and the fact that some SAC1 mutants show inositol auxotrophy (3.Hughes W.E. Pocklington M.J. Orr E. Paddon C.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) also suggested that the lipid phosphoinositides may be important for Sac1p function. Therefore, we sought to measure the levels of these lipids in wild-type and mutant sac1 strains. Wild-type and yeast strains containing a completely deleted SAC1 gene were incubated with [3H]inositol before total cell phospholipids were extracted and deacylated to allow separation of the resulting head groups by HPLC. The elution characteristics of the inositol-containing head groups have been well characterized (17.Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1219-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), allowing comparison of the lipid phosphoinositides. The data in Fig.2 A indicate that cells lacking the SAC1 gene were characterized by reduced levels of GroPIns(4,5)P2 and an increase in GroPIns(3)P and GroPIns(3,5)P2. Most notably, thesac1-deleted strains showed a dramatic increase in a glycerophosphoinositide eluting at a time consistent with GroPIns(4)P. However, using the HPLC protocol described, the lipid deacylation products GroPIns(4)P and GroPIns(5)P cannot be efficiently separated (25.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Having shown that Inp52p and Inp53p, both putative 5-phosphatases, could suppress the effects of sac1 mutants that appear to be characterized by a dramatic increase in ad-4-phosphorylated lipid, it remained a possibility that the increase in PtdIns(4)P was in fact a peak of PtdIns(5)P. To establish the precise identity of the monophosphorylated glyceroinositide seen at the GroPIns(4)P position, we labeled cells containing a completely deleted sac1 gene with [14C]inositol. As before, total cell phospholipids were then extracted and deacylated to allow separation of the glyceroinositides derived from lipid phosphoinositides by HPLC. Fractions containing the elevated levels of head group corresponding to the phosphatidylinositol monophosphate were collected and desalted. This purified [14C]inositol compound was then mixed with3H-labeled GroPIns(3)P, GroPIns(4)P, and GroPIns(5)P before separating the species by HPLC, confirming that the lipid species proposed to be PtdIns(4)P was indeed PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 2 B). This confirmed that the 10-fold increase in lipid seen insac1 mutants was indeed an increase in PtdIns(4)P. We have consistently seen an ∼7-fold increase in PtdIns(3,5)P2, a 1.5-fold increase in PtdIns(3)P, a 5-fold decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2, and up to a 10-fold increase in PtdIns(4)P. Recently, similar analyses of lipid phosphoinositide levels in sac1 mutants also indicated that levels of PtdIns(4)P increase, by ∼6–10-fold (11.Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12.Rivas M.P. Kearns B.G. Xie Z. Guo S. Sekar M.C. Hosaka K. Kagiwada S. York J.D. Bankaitis V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2235-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, although there is agreement with respect to the elevation of PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(3)P, and PtdIns(3,5)P2, we show here a 5-fold decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 not reported before. Whether this distinction is due to strain differences or labeling protocols remains to be resolved; however, we have observed the decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in sac1 deletions in two different strain backgrounds (FY833 and YPH499; data not shown). Having shown that yeast sac1 mutants have dramatically altered levels of lipid phosphoinositides, yeast mutants transfected with vectors containing SAC1 andINP52 were grown in galactose to induce production of Sac1p and Inp52p and were labeled with [3H]inositol to test the lipid phosphoinositide profiles of these yeast mutants. As shown in Fig. 3, in galactose, sac1mutants continued to show defects in the levels of all of the lipid phosphoinositides compared with wild-type yeast. Transformation of the yeast mutants with a vector containing the wild-type SAC1gene restored the level of lipids to almost wild-type levels. Similarly, the gene INP52 conferred a restoration of lipid levels to the mutant on induction, a feature not seen when grown on glucose (data not shown). Although the restoration of the level of lipid phosphoinositides by Inp52p and Inp53p could have been due to the carboxyl-terminal 5-phosphatase domain, we speculated that suppression was in fact due to the only region of homology between these proteins, the amino-terminal Sac domain (Fig. 1). To examine this, the Sac domains from Sac1p, Inp51p, Inp52p, Inp53p, Fig4p, and synaptojanin-1 were subcloned into a galactose-inducible vector. These constructs were transformed into wild-type and mutant sac1 yeast, and the growth characteristics of these strains were examined on medium containing glucose or galactose and various drugs. As shown in TableI, the construct containing the Sac domains from Sac1p, Inp52p, and Inp53p conferred a growth advantage on the mutant cells. The suppression seen with these domains was not as complete as that seen with full-length proteins, as colonies of Sac domain-containing yeast mutants appeared only several days after yeast mutants transformed with full-length genes. However, as mutant cells transformed with Sac domains from Inp52p and Inp53p both conferred the same growth advantage as the Sac domain from Sac1p, the results indicate that the Sac domains of the phosphatases are sufficient to restore wild-type phenotypes to sac1 mutants.Table ISome Sac domains partially suppress sac1 deletion strain novobiocin sensitivityMediumSac domainSac1pMds1pFig4pInp51pInp52pInp53pSynapojanin-1Glc++++++++++++++Gal+++++++++++++++++Glc + NovaNov, novobiocin; Kan, kanamycin.−−−−−−−Gal + Nov+−−−++−Glc + Kan−−−−−−−Gal + Kan+−−−++−FY833.sac1ΔURA3 yeast mutants transformed with pYX243-Sac domain constructs were grown on SD plates containing glucose or galactose with or without a restrictive concentration of novobiocin (1.8 mg/ml) or kanamycin (100 μg/ml).

Since the ECM is a key regulator of mammary gland morphogenesis, and mammary epithelial cells express OPN at elevated levels, we sought to determine whether this protein plays a role in the postnatal mammary gland development. By generating transgenic mice that express OPN antisense-RNA (AS-OPN mice) in the mammary epithelia we achieved suppression of OPN production in this organ. The pregnant AS-OPN mice displayed a lack of mammary alveolar structures, a drastic reduction in the synthesis of β-casein, whey acidic milk protein, and lactation deficiency. In agreement with these findings, we uncovered that a mammary cell line, NMuMG, which undergoes both structural and functional differentiation on ECM-coated plates, when transfected with an antisense OPN-cDNA construct, failed to undergo such differentiation. Furthermore, the results of gel-invasion assays demonstrated that these cells manifest elevated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity when OPN expression is significantly reduced. The identity of this proteinase as MMP-2 is confirmed by Western blotting, zymography, and inhibition of its activity by a specific inhibitor, TIMP-2. Taken together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, an essential role of OPN in mammary gland differentiation and that the molecular mechanism(s) of its action, at least in part, involves down-regulation of MMP-2.

Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding rat OPN revealed that this protein is composed of 317 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 32 kDa for the peptide backbone (reviewed in Ref. 1.Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). However, OPNs isolated from or secreted by various tissues exhibit electrophoretic mobilities consistent with a protein of apparent molecular mass between 44 and 75 kDa (reviewed in Ref. 2.Butler W.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This variability is most likely due to the post-translational modifications (3.Nemir M. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18202-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine OPN is encoded by a single copy gene (4.Craig A.M. Denhardt D.T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that is composed of seven exons and spans more than 8 kb of nucleotide sequence (5.Behrend E.I. Chambers A.F. Wilson S.M. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11172-11175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It maps to the ric (Rickettsiaresistance gene) locus on mouse chromosome 5, and a possible allelism between the opn and ric has been reported (6.Fet V. Dickinson M.E. Hogan B.L. Genomics. 1989; 5: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In several cell types, OPN interacts with specific integrins, namely αvβ3, αvβ5, and αvβ1, and also with the CD44 receptor in RGD-dependent manner (reviewed in Ref. 7.Uede T. Katagiri Y. Iizuka J. Murakami M. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The OPN-integrin interaction mediates important cell functions, most of which are RGD-dependent, including the promotion of cell adhesion and spreading on substrata, chemotactic and haptotactic activities, and cellular signaling (8.Senger D.R.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of OPN-mRNA and protein is suppressed in cells derived from mice generated by targeted disruption of the protooncogene, src (14.Chackalaparampil I. Peri A. Nemir M. McKee M.D. Lin P.H. Mukherjee B.B. Mukherjee A.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1457-1467PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that src regulation of OPN production is due to the presence of a src response element in the promoter region of the OPN gene (15.Tezuka K.I. Denhardt D.T. Rodan G.A. Harada S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22713-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although OPN is expressed in several organs, the epithelium of the mammary gland overexpresses this protein specifically during pregnancy and lactation, and is abundantly present in milk (16.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has now been well established that ECM at the stromal-epithelial interface plays a pivotal role in growth, survival, and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, and unlike most tissues and organs, a major part of the mammary gland development occurs post-natally (17.Streuli C.H. Bailey N. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1383-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Since OPN is an ECM protein, and mammary epithelial cells express this protein at elevated levels (18.Brown L.F. Berse B. van de Water L. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Perruzzi C.A. Manseau E.J. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this protein plays a role in the post-natal development of the mammary gland, including ductal branching, lobuloalveolar structure formation, and lactation. We rationalized that a lack of or significantly reduced levels of OPN synthesis may impair such processes. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing OPN antisense RNA, specifically in the mammary epithelia, under the regulation of MMTV-LTR promoter/enhancer. This promoter was chosen because it directs mammary tissue-specific expression of transgenes at the onset of puberty without exogenous hormone supplement (19.Groner B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 182-186Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We show here that suppression of OPN synthesis caused a virtual absence of lobuloalveolar structures, drastic reduction of β-casein and whey acidic protein (WAP) synthesis in mammary epithelia, and lactation deficiency. Similarly, in in vitro experiments, a mammary epithelial cell line, NMuMG, that undergoes structural and functional differentiation in culture, including the formation of lobuloalveolar structures and synthesis of milk proteins, failed to do so when they were transfected with an OPN antisense cDNA construct. Furthermore, these transfected cells showed enhanced gel invasion, and synthesized elevated levels of metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Taken together, these results define an essential role of OPN in mammary gland development and differentiation, and raise the possibility that the molecular mechanism(s) of OPN action, at least in part, involves the down-regulation of MMP-2. Mice were housed under 10-h dark and 14-h light cycles, and were handled in accordance with approved protocols. To generate the transgene construct, a full-length murine OPN cDNA (20.Craig A.M. Smith J.H. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9682-9689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated in the antisense orientation into SalI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pMAMneo (CLONTECH). The linearized 7.4-kb NdeI-ApaI (AS-OPN) fragment was injected into single-cell embryos of B6XSJL mice, which were then introduced into the oviducts of pseudopregnant CD1 mice (DNX Inc.). Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analysis ofBamHI-digested genomic DNA from tail biopsy using mouse OPN cDNA, and neomycin gene-specific probes, respectively. In some instances, mice were also genotyped by PCR amplification using murine OPN cDNA-specific primers (MOP-L, 5′-TCA CCA TTC GGA TGA GTC TG-3′; MOP-R, 5′-ACT TGT GGC TCT GAT GTT CC-3′). For whole-mount analysis (21.Sympson C.J. Talhouk R.S. Alexander C.M. Chin J.R.,. Clift S.M. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the second inguinal mammary glands were removed, kept flat in tissue cassettes, and fixed overnight in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. The tissues were then dehydrated, delipidated, stained with iron hematoxylin, cleared in xylene, mounted, and photographed. For histological analyses, 5–7-μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and photographed. Total RNA was purified from freshly isolated mouse tissues and from actively growing cultured cells as described (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to 32P-labeled sense or antisense OPN riboprobes transcribed from pGEM4–2ar plasmid (20.Craig A.M. Smith J.H. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9682-9689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using T7/SP6 RNA labeling kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) containing 1 × 106cpm/ml of the appropriate probe. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice, 5 min each, at room temperature with 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS, twice at room temperature for 20 min with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, twice at 65 °C for 30 min, with 0.1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS, and once for 30 min at room temperature with 0.1× SSC and autoradiographed. For RT-PCR analysis, 200 ng of total RNA were used for the reverse transcription and PCR amplification using GenAmp RT-PCR kit (Perkin Elmer) and the primers MOP-L and MOP-R to reverse-transcribe antisense and sense RNA, respectively. The amplified cDNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with digoxigenin-labeled OPN oligonucleotide probe MOP-P (5′-AGA GCG GTG AGT CTA AGG AG-3′) and detected by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and chemilumigraphy. For Western blot analysis, mammary glands were first flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized, and homogenized in five volumes of extraction buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/μl aprotinin, 2 μg/μl leupeptin, and 1 μg/μl pepstatin). After clearing, aliquots of the homogenates containing ∼20 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with anti-OPN antiserum (OST-1; 1:200; Ref. 23.Singh K. Mukherjee A.B. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23847-23851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% Tween 20 for 15 min each at room temperature. Bound primary antibody was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Sigma) using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate. The membranes were then washed thoroughly with water and photographed. For the detection of MMP-2, semiconfluent cultures of non-transfected, mock-transfected, and OPN antisense cDNA-transfected NMuMG cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and aliquots containing equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked by placing overnight with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 οC, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-MMP-2 antibody (1:1000; Chemicon) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody detection was carried out as described above. MatrigelTM (basement membrane from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumors) was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products and used to coat 35-mm culture dishes (400 μl/dish). Matrigel was allowed to gel by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then plated (3.5 × 105cells/dish) in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 3 μg/ml bovine prolactin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and hepatocyte growth factor at concentration of 20 ng/ml. Cells were grown for 6 days to allow morphological differentiation to occur. For the analysis of expression of milk proteins, an RT-PCR kit from Promega was used. Ten μg of total RNA was used for each reaction. For β-casein, the primers used are: CAGTGAGGAATCTGTTGAA (forward primer) and GGTCTTGGACAGACATATC (reverse primer). For WAP, the primers used are: 5′-TAG CAG CAG ATT GAA AGC ATT ATG-3′ (RT primer) and 5′-GAC ACC GGT ACC ATG CGT TG-3′ (PCR primer). The first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with avian myeloblastosis virus RT (avian mammary tumor virus reverse transcriptase) at 48 °C for 45 min. The avian myeloblastosis virus RT inactivation was carried out by heat denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min. Amplification was carried out in 40 PCR cycles consisting of a denaturation step of 30 s at 94 °C, an annealing step of 1 min at 60 °C, and an extension step of 2 min at 68 °C. For gel invasion assay, invasion chambers containing inserts coated with Matrigel (Biocoat) were used as suggested by the manufacturer (Becton Dickinson). Cells were serum-starved for 4 h, harvested by trypsinization, and plated in the upper chambers at a density of 3.5 × 105cells/well, in serum-free medium. Growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber to serve as a chemoattractant. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells attached to the upper surface of the membrane along with the layer of Matrigel coating were removed using a cotton-tipped swab. The cells that migrated through the filter and attached to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 10% methanol, stained with Giemsa, and counted under a phase contrast microscope. For invasion assays in presence of the MMP-2 inhibitor TIMP-2, the upper surface of the membranes of the Transwell inserts (Costar) were coated with 10 μl/cm2 Matrigel containing 10 μg/ml human TIMP-2 (Calbiochem). After hardening of the Matrigel layer at 37 °C, the cells were plated and the assays were carried out as described above. For establishing the proteolytic profiles of NMuMG cells by zymography (24.Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell lysates were prepared in substrate gel sample buffer (0.1% SDS, 4% sucrose, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), cleared by centrifugation, and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis the gels were soaked twice for 30 min each at room temperature in 2.5% Triton X-100, with gentle shaking. The gels were rinsed in distilled water and incubated overnight at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). After incubation, gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue, destained with water, and photographed. The areas of gelatinolytic activity appeared as light translucent bands over a blue background. The construct used for the generation of AS-OPN transgenic mice contained full-length OPN cDNA in the antisense orientation downstream from the MMTV-LTR promoter of the eukaryotic expression vector pMAMneo (Fig.1 A). The biological activity of this transgene construct was first tested by transfecting the murine cell lines MC3T3E1 (25.Sudo H. Kodama H.-A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar) and JB6 (26.Colburn N.H. Former B.H. Nelson K.A. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1979; 281: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Transfected cells expressed OPN antisense RNA which efficiently suppressed OPN-protein synthesis (Ref. 27.Su L. Mukherjee A.B. Mukherjee B.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2163-2169PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). This construct was, therefore, used to generate transgenic mice. Six founder mice were obtained, two of which were used to establish two independent transgenic mouse lines. Southern blot and PCR analyses confirmed the genomic integration and germline transmission of the transgene to the progeny of both founders. Southern blot analysis of BamHI-digested genomic DNA of one line of AS-OPN transgenic mice using OPN cDNA and neomycin gene probes showed the presence of 1.3- and 2.6-kb bands, respectively (Fig. 1,C and B). The Southern hybridization signal patterns were found to be different for the two lines when genomic DNA from both were digested with ClaI and hybridized with the same OPN cDNA probe (data not shown), confirming different integration site of the transgene in the two mouse lines. To detect transgene expression, total RNA isolated from mammary glands of 65-day-old virgin mice was subjected to RT-PCR analysis. Fig. 2 A shows that the OPN antisense RNA is expressed in the mammary glands of transgenic, but not in those of the normal control mice, although OPN-mRNA is expressed in both normal and transgenic mice. To determine whether the expression of the transgene is more pronounced in mammary tissue due to the presence of MMTV-LTR promoter, total RNA was isolated from several organs including the mammary gland, kidney, spleen, and liver of the transgenic mice and analyzed by Northern blotting, using OPN antisense RNA probe. The results showed that the OPN antisense RNA expression is significantly higher in the mammary gland, compared with that of other tissues (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). To examine transgene expression in different stages of mammary gland development, RNA was extracted from glands of virgin and pregnant AS-OPN mice at early and late (17 days) gestation, and Northern blot analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 2 C, OPN antisense-RNA is expressed in the mammary glands of virgin transgenic mice, and its expression is increased during pregnancy, consistent with previous reports on the pattern of MMTV-LTR promoter-driven transgene expression in the mammary gland (28.Muller W.J. Lee F.S. Dickson C. Peters G. Pattengale P.K. Wallace R. Leder P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These data confirm the coexpression of endogenous OPN gene and transgene in the mammary glands of AS-OPN mice. To determine whether OPN-protein production is suppressed as a consequence of the expression of OPN antisense RNA in transgenic mice, mammary glands from both 65-day-old virgin normal and AS-OPN mice were homogenized, and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-OPN serum (OST-1). The results show that the OPN levels are drastically reduced in the mammary glands of both lines of AS-OPN mice derived from two independent founders as compared with those of the normal controls (Fig. 2 D). These results clearly demonstrate that elevated expression of OPN antisense RNA in the mammary epithelium effectively suppressed the production of OPN protein in this tissue. The founder transgenic mice did not show any detectable phenotypic abnormality, and developed to the adult stage as normally as their non-transgenic littermates. The female progeny gave birth to normal size litters; the newborn pups appeared normal at birth and did not show any obvious morphological abnormalities. All pups born to approximately 68% of AS-OPN mice (n = 21; Table I) died within 24 h after birth, and approximately 32% of them produced enough milk to support 1–4 pups but not full-size litters. Close morphological examination of the pups that died after birth revealed the absence of milk in their stomachs. This indicated that death of pups occurred due to starvation, and suggested that either most of the AS-OPN mothers were lactation-deficient or the pups were incapable of suckling. To examine these possibilities, pups born to AS-OPN mice, whose previous litters had died after birth, were allowed to be nursed by actively lactating foster mothers. Eighty-eight percent of these pups survived and grew normally (Table I). These results clearly show that all AS-OPN mothers have lactation deficiency and a vast majority of them are clearly non-lactating.Table INeonatal mortality of pups born to AS-OPN miceBornaThe pups were counted on the morning of delivery.

Open table in a new tab To determine the possible cause of the apparent lactation deficiency in AS-OPN mice, we examined the mammary glands of post-partum animals morphologically and biochemically. The mammary glands of non-lactating AS-OPN mice were 2–5 times smaller in size than those of normal lactating mice (data not shown). Whole mount analysis of these glands showed that, although some alveolar lobules were formed (Fig.3 C), they were greatly reduced in size and number as compared with those of the lactating non-transgenic mice (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B shows histological sections of the normal gland where the alveolar lobules almost completely filled the fat pad, leaving little stromal space. In addition, they were also arranged in well organized, tightly packed structures with large luminal spaces (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the mammary glands of non-lactating AS-OPN mice revealed only few alveolar structures, sparsely distributed in individual patches throughout the fat pad, some in collapsing state, and with little or no luminal spaces (Fig. 3 D). In order to determine whether mammary glands of AS-OPN mice are capable of synthesizing milk proteins, we examined the expression of β-casein and WAP mRNAs by RT-PCR using total RNA from the mammary tissues of AS-OPN and non-transgenic mice at 16 days of gestation. Fig. 3 E shows that while the RNAs of both proteins are abundantly expressed in mammary tissues of non-transgenic mice (N), they are virtually undetectable in the mammary tissues of the AS-OPN mice (T). These observations demonstrate that lack or drastic reduction of OPN synthesis in the mammary tissues of AS-OPN mice not only interferes with the development of normal lobuloalveolar structures but also affects the functional differentiation of the mammary epithelia, attested by a virtual lack of synthesis of milk proteins β-casein and WAP. It has been well established that morphological and functional differentiation of mammary epithelial cells can be inducedin vitro (29.Chen L.H. Bissell M.J. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, an in vitro system, using mammary epithelial cells, offers a unique opportunity to further investigate the effects of down-regulation of OPN synthesis in these cells on their structural and functional differentiation. In the present study, we used a normal murine mammary epithelial cell line, NMuMG, that differentiate in vitro. NMuMG cells were transfected with the same construct used to generate the AS-OPN mice. The mock-transfected (vector only) and non-transfected cells served as controls. Several stably transfected clones were isolated, and two of these clones, AS6 and AS8, expressing the lowest levels of OPN were characterized and chosen for further analysis. As shown in Fig.4 A, both AS6 and AS8 clones stably incorporated the antisense OPN cDNA, which is absent in non-transfected and mock-transfected cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that OPN antisense RNA is expressed by both of these clones (Fig.4 B). As a result, there was a drastic reduction in the levels of OPN protein, as compared with non-transfected and mock-transfected NMuMG cells (Fig. 4 C). These observations show that expression of antisense OPN-RNA effectively down-regulates the synthesis of OPN in antisense-transfected NMuMG cells. When non-transfected, mock-transfected, AS6, and AS8 cells were cultured on Matrigel-coated dishes in presence of hormones, non-transfected and mock-transfected NMuMG cells formed compact spherical structures (Fig. 5,A and B). When hepatocyte growth factor was added to the cultures, many of those spheroids formed long branching tubules (Fig. 5 E). Histological analysis showed that many of these spheroids or tubular structures also contained a lumen, resembling the alveoli of the mammary gland (Fig. 5 F). However, AS-OPN-transfected AS6 and AS8 cells failed to form such spheroids or branching tubules and remained as monolayer cultures (Fig. 5,C and D). Thus, NMuMG cells cultured on Matrigel-coated dishes undergo morphogenesis, including the formation of structures typical of mammary glands in vivo, but their counterparts, expressing antisense OPN RNA and showing drastically reduced OPN production, failed to undergo such differentiation. Similar results were also obtained using branching morphogenesis assays in collagen gels (data not shown). Functional differentiation of NMUMG cells in culture was evaluated by their capacity to synthesize major milk proteins. It has been reported that synthesis of milk proteins such as β-casein and WAP can be induced in mammary epithelial cells in culture (29.Chen L.H. Bissell M.J. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined by RT-PCR whether AS6 and AS8 cells, grown on Matrigel-coated dishes in presence of appropriate hormones, have the ability to express these milk proteins. Non-transfected and mock-transfected NMuMG cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig.6, while non-transfected and mock-transfected control cells expressed significant amounts of both β-casein and WAP mRNAs, the AS6 and AS8 cells did not. Thesein vitro data, therefore, support our observations in vivo that mammary glands of AS-OPN mice, expressing significantly reduced levels of OPN, fail to form alveolar structures and do not synthesize β-casein and WAP mRNAs. It has been well established that ECM at the stromal-epithelial interface is a key regulator of the structural and functional differentiation of the ma"

APS sulfotransferase was purified to homogeneity from Lemna minor and compared with APS reductase previously obtained by functional complementation of a mutant strain of Escherichia coli with an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. APS sulfotransferase was a homodimer with a monomer M r of 43,000. Its amino acid sequence was 73% identical with APS reductase.

The reaction sequence from sulfate to sulfide is called assimilatory sulfate reduction as opposed to dissimilatory sulfate reduction, which occurs in certain anaerobic organisms such asDesulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum, where sulfate functions as an electron acceptor during oxidation of organic substrates and where reduced forms of sulfur are excreted into the surroundings (3.Siegel L.M. Greenberg D.M. Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds. Academic Press, New York1975: 217-286Crossref Google Scholar). The first step of assimilatory sulfate reduction is an activation of sulfate catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase (EC 2.7.7.4). The adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS)1 is the substrate for APS kinase (EC 2.7.1.2.5), which forms adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) in a second activation step (1.Schmidt A. Jäger K.

In two early reports it was demonstrated, however, that plants and algae use APS rather than PAPS as sulfonyl donor for the first reduction step (12.Tsang M.L. Goldschmidt E.E. Schiff J.A. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47 (suppl.): 20Google Scholar, 13.Schmidt A. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1972; 84: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). APS-dependent enzymes were partially purified from spinach (14.Schmidt A. Planta. 1976; 130: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and isolated to homogeneity from the marine macroalgaPorphyra yezoensis Ueda (15.Kanno N. Nagahaisa E. Sato M. Sato Y. Planta. 1996; 198: 440-446Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and from spinach leaves (16.Ara T. Sekiya J. Cram W.J. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Brunold C. Rennenberg H. Sulphur Metabolism in Higher Plants. Backhuys Publishers, Leiden1996: 177-179Google Scholar). The subunit M r was estimated to be 43,000. The enzymes exclusively used APS as substrate and were inactive with PAPS (14.Schmidt A. Planta. 1976; 130: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15.Kanno N. Nagahaisa E. Sato M. Sato Y.

Backhuys Publishers, Leiden1996: 177-179Google Scholar). In vitro the products of the enzyme with APS and GSH as reductant were SO32− and GSSO3− (17.Schmidt A. Z. Naturforsch. 1972; 27b: 183-192Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18.Tsang M.L.-S. Schiff J.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1976; 17: 1209-1220Google Scholar, 19.Abrams W.R. Schiff J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1973; 94: 1-10Google Scholar). The consistent finding of GSSO3− together with SO32− when GSH was used as reductant led to the idea that GSH (19.Abrams W.R. Schiff J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1973; 94: 1-10Google Scholar) or a small protein molecule (CarS−) (18.Tsang M.L.-S. Schiff J.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1976; 17: 1209-1220Google Scholar) functioned as a cofactor or carrier in a sulfotransferase reaction by accepting the sulfur group from APS to form GSSO3− or CarSSO3−, and the enzyme was named APS sulfotransferase, accordingly. GSSO3−and also CarSSO3− can react nonenzymatically with thiols like GSH to form SO32− (3.Siegel L.M. Greenberg D.M. Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds. Academic Press, New York1975: 217-286Crossref Google Scholar, 19.Abrams W.R. Schiff J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1973; 94: 1-10Google Scholar). It was proposed, however, that the physiological reaction pathway functioned with thiosulfonate reductase reducing the bound sulfite of CarSSO3− to bound sulfide CarSS− (20.Schmidt A. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1973; 93: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thiosulfonate reductase was not characterized in detail but showed characteristics of sulfite reductase (3.Siegel L.M. Greenberg D.M. Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds. Academic Press, New York1975: 217-286Crossref Google Scholar). Recently three isoforms of APS reducing enzymes were cloned by complementingEscherichia coli mutant deficient in PAPS reductase activity with an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library independently by two groups (21.Setya A.

They were named APS reductases by both groups, assuming a reaction mechanism identical to PAPS reductases in which only SO32− was formed (21.Setya A. Murillo M. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Interactions. 1998; 109: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Compared with PAPS reductases, APS reductase cDNAs contain an N-terminal extension coding for a chloroplast targeting peptide and a C-terminal extension with homology to thioredoxin (21.Setya A. Murillo M. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13383-13388Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22.Gutierrez-Marcos J.F. Roberts M.A. Campbell E.I. Wray J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13377-13382Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Like APS sulfotransferases, APS reductases used DTE or GSH as a reductant (21.Setya A. Murillo M. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13383-13388Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,25.Prior A. Uhrig J.F. Heins L. Wiesmann C. Lillig H. Stoltze C. Stoll J. Schwenn J.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Here we describe the purification to homogeneity of APS sulfotransferase from Lemna minor and present evidence demonstrating (i) that APS sulfotransferase and APS reductase are identical enzymes, (ii) that they form SO32− from APS with GSH as reductant, and (iii) that GSSO32− is only formed subsequently from SO32− and GSSG. APS and PAPS were from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). [35S]APS and [35S]PAPS were prepared according to Li and Schiff (26.Li J. Schiff J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using commercially available enzyme preparations from Sigma, containing ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase activity. [35S]PAPS was converted into [35S]APS by treatment with 3′-nucleotidase from Sigma (26.Li J. Schiff J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). [35S]SO42− was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GSSO3−was synthesized according to Waley (27.Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 71: 132-137Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). L. minor L. was cultivated according to Neuenschwander et al. (28.Neuenschwander U. Suter M. Brunold C. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Routinely APS sulfotransferase was measured according to Brunold and Suter (29.Brunold C. Suter M. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 339-343Crossref Google Scholar). The assay systems are given in the legends of the appropriate tables and figures. Extracts from L. minor were prepared according to Neuenschwander et al. (28.Neuenschwander U. Suter M. Brunold C. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The entire procedure was carried out at 0–4 °C. For the preparation of the extract 40 g of plants were rinsed with deionized water and homogenized in a glass homogenizer cooled in ice water in 160 ml of 50 mmTris-SO42−, pH 8.5, containing 30 mm Na2SO3, 10 mm DTE, 5 mm 5′-AMP, 5% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 ml. The homogenate was then filtrated through one layer of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 15 min. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was slowly added to the supernatant fluid to reach 30% saturation. After 1 h of additional stirring, the mixture was centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was redissolved in 30 ml of standard buffer (50 mmTris-SO42−, pH 8.5, 30 mmNa2SO3, 5 mm 5′-AMP, 2 mm DTE) and one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 50 ml. After gentle stirring the mix for 1 h, the solution fluid was applied to a 5 × 44 cm Sephacryl S-300 HR column, equilibrated with standard buffer at a flow rate of 0.9 ml min−1. Proteins were eluted at the same flow rate with 800 ml of standard buffer. Fractions were collected and analyzed for APS sulfotransferase activity and protein content. Fractions with enzyme activity >50% of the peak fraction were pooled. The enzyme solution was concentrated to a final volume of 6–10 ml in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, model 8050) using a YM30 (30-kDa cut-off) membrane. After centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was filtrated using a disposable filter holder, mesh size 0.2 μm (FP 030/3, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). To carry out the three following steps a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. The filtrate was loaded on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with standard buffer. The elution was performed using a linear 3-ml NaCl gradient from 50 to 100 mm, followed by 4.5 ml of standard buffer containing 1m NaCl. Fractions were collected and analyzed for APS sulfotransferase activity and protein content. The peak fractions were pooled, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.6 m. This solution was applied to a Phenyl Superose HR 5/5 column equilibrated with standard buffer containing 0.7 m(NH4)2SO4. Elution was done using a linear 9.5-ml (NH4)2SO4 gradient in standard buffer from 0.7 m(NH4)2SO4 to 0 mm. The peak fractions were pooled and were concentrated to a final volume of 40–80 μl using a Centricon-30 (30-kDa cut-off) ultrafiltration unit (Amicon). The concentrate was applied to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with standard buffer containing 67 mm(NH4)2SO4. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.7 ml min−1 under isocratic conditions. The fractions with APS sulfotransferase activity >50% of the peak fraction were pooled. The enzyme solution was concentrated to a final volume of <50 μl. A native gel was prepared as described by Fankhauser and Brunold (30.Fankhauser H. Brunold C. Experimentia. 1978; 34: 939-941Google Scholar) omitting the stacking gel and adding 10 mm DTE and 1 mm 5′-AMP to the separating gel. To 45 μl of sample, 15 μl of loading buffer (0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.08% bromphenol blue, 0.1% mercaptoethanol) was added. The sample was loaded directly onto the gel and run in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 77 mmglycine, 2 mm DTE, 1 mm 5′-AMP, 0.1% mercaptoethanol at 10 mA per gel for 4 h at 4 °C. The gel was cut into 2-mm slices. Each gel slice was placed into a elution device (Biotrap, Schleicher & Schuell), and elution took place in 15 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, and 0.1% mercaptoethanol at 100 V for 3 h at 4 °C. The eluate was analyzed for APS sulfotransferase activity. Trichloroacetic acid was added to fractions containing activity to a final concentration of 10%. Samples were kept at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for another 30 min. The pellet was washed with 1 of ml acetone:H2O = 49:1 (v/v) and redissolved in 20 μl 0.1 m DTE, 0.1 m NaHCO3. 10 μl of sample buffer was added. Separation by SDS-PAGE using a Mini-Protean II slab Cell apparatus (Bio-Rad) was done on a 10% acrylamide gel as described in the manufacturer's protocol. All chromatography media, standard chromatography columns, and fast protein liquid chromatography columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA extraction and Southern hybridization were carried out according to standard procedures (31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The standard procedures of Sambrook et al. (31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were followed. Gas phase microsequencing of APS sulfotransferase was done according to Söhndel et al.(32.Söhndel S. Hu C.-H. Marti D. Affolter M. Schaller J. Llinas M. Rickli E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) after SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme. The central region of APS sulfotransferase was obtained from L. minorRNA by RT-PCR using the sequence from domains conserved betweenA. thaliana APS reductase and bacterial and yeast PAPS reductases (see Fig. 2 C; underlined sequences I–IV) and the thioredoxin motif to synthesize oligonucleotide primers. The amplified fragment of 750 bp was completely sequenced on both strands. Using this sequence information, gene-specific primers (SP) for the 5′- and 3′-RACE were synthesized. For the 5′-RACE, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of poly(A) RNA using a gene-specific primer SP1 (5′-ACTGGTCCTTGCGCTGGCCG-3′), Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and the deoxynucleotide mixture. The mRNA-cDNA hybrid was then purified from unincorporated primers and nucleotides by the GlassMax DNA Isolation Matrix System (Life Technologies, Inc.). For adapter, 10 pmol of the oligo d(T) anchor primer (AP, 5′-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGACT16-3′) and anchor reverse primer (APrev, 5′-GTCGACATCGATACGCGTGGTC-3′) were allowed to anneal. Then a blunt end ligation of the adapter and the RNA-cDNA hybrid was carried out at 15 °C overnight using 400 units T4 ligase (BioLabs). The following PCR amplification was performed with the APrev and the nested SP2 primer (5′-GTGATCCAGGCTCTGAGGCC-3′). The PCR products were then separated on an agarose gel. For the second PCR amplification, the APrev and the third nested SP3 primer (5′-TCTGAGAGCTCTTCTAAGGGGC-3′) were used. The major band (approximately 640 bp) on the agarose gel was used as template. The PCR product was separated on an agarose gel and isolated with the GlassMax DNA Isolation Matrix System. The DNA was cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector using the Original TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the 3′-RACE, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of poly(A) RNA using the oligo d(T) anchor primer, avian murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and the deoxynucleotide mixture. The first PCR amplification was then directly performed without a further purification step using the AP and the gene-specific primer SP4 (5′-ACCAGGACAGCACGAGAGGG-3′). The PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. For the second PCR amplification the band on the agarose gel was used as template with the nested SP5 primer (5′-AAGGTGGTGGTGGGAGGACG-3′) and the AP. After separation of the PCR products on an agarose gel the major band (approximately 560 bp) was purified using the GlassMax DNA Isolation Matrix System. The DNA was cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector using the Original TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences related to PAPS and APS reducing enzymes were retrieved from GenBankTM with the BLAST software. The phylogenetic analysis was performed with the Treecon program (33.Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Applic. Biosci. 1993; 9: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (34.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) using the Dayhoff matrix. APS sulfotransferase from L. minor lacking the presequence encoding the transit peptide was cloned into pET14b expression vector, which ensured an addition of a His6 tag at the N terminus of the expressed protein by RT-PCR amplification. For protein expression, the construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant proteins were purified from 400-ml overnight bacterial cultures on Ni2+ columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.5 ml, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 75 μm [35S]APS, 5 mm GSH, 0, 0.5, or 1 mm GSSG, and recombinant APS sulfotransferase. This reaction mixture was optimal for product analysis but gave enzyme activities that were only approximately 10% of the maximum rates. Incubation was at 37 °C under argon. After incubation, 15 μl of 50 mm HCl and 10 μl 3.6% (w/v) formaldehyde were added. An aliquot of 0.1 ml was injected into a high performance liquid chromatography system (Kontron, Zürich, Switzerland) equipped with a 4 × 11 mm guard (column number 72 14 52 40, Marcherey Nagel) and a 4 × 250 mm anion II column (number 72 00 94, Marcherey Nagel), equilibrated with 2 mm potassium phtalate, pH 5.8. The columns were eluted using equilibration buffer from 0–18 min, followed by a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 2m from 18–28 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min−1. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, 100 μl of 1m Na2SO3 was added to each fraction, and acid volatile radioactivity was determined according to Brunold and Suter (29.Brunold C. Suter M. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 339-343Crossref Google Scholar). Individual compounds eluted from the column were identified on the bases of their retention time,A 280 nm, radioactivity, and capacity to liberate radioactivity upon acidification ([35S]SO32−, GS35SO3−). TableI presents a typical purification of APS sulfotransferase from L. minor cultivated under aseptic condition. The activity of the enzyme was increased in the plants by addition of 10 mm NH4Cl 24 h before harvest (35.Brunold C. Suter M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activity in the crude extracts varied between 20 and 25 nmol min−1 mg protein−1. The enzyme was unstable throughout the purification procedure and during storage even though 5 mm 5′-AMP because substrate analogue for APS was added to the extraction buffer and included in all buffers used subsequently. Omission of 5′-AMP resulted in a rapid loss of enzyme activity (Fig. 1). On the gel used for native PAGE (Table I, step 7), APS sulfotransferase was visible as a yellow band, indicating a cofactor bound to the protein. From the 15 μmol min−1 mg protein−1 (Table I), it can be calculated that APS sulfotransferase contributed 1.3‰ to the total proteins in the crude extracts.Table IPurification of APS sulfotransferase from L. minor LPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgμmol min −1μmol min −1 mg protein −1%fold1.

Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. Fig.2 A shows an SDS-PAGE separation of three APS sulfotransferase preparations from native PAGE (Table I, step 7) differing in enzyme activity. Two bands withM r values of approximately 41,000 and 43,000 were visible in all three lines. As expected, the fraction containing the highest APS sulfotransferase activity (Fig. 2 A,lane 2) was also the one most intensely stained. The yellow color, which was visible after native PAGE, was no longer detectable after SDS-PAGE, indicating that the putative cofactor had been lost. N-terminal microsequencing of the two bands revealed an overlap of 5 amino acids (Fig. 2 B) between the two proteins, indicating that the band with the lower M r was a breakdown product of native APS sulfotransferase. Indeed, addition of protease inhibitors during extraction resulted in a single band after SDS-PAGE, corresponding to a M r of 43,000 (data not shown). The complete Lemna APS sulfotransferase cDNA of 1377 base pairs contained a single open reading frame coding for a protein of 459 amino acids (Fig. 2 C). The deduced amino acid sequence contained a stretch of 30 residues from Ser-69 to Glu-98 that were identical with the sequence determined from the purified APS sulfotransferase by N-terminal sequencing. This fact confirmed that: (i) this cDNA encoded the APS sulfotransferase and (ii) the encoded protein possessed a presequenc"

The NF-κB family, which shares the Rel homology domain, consists of p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that human atherosclerotic tissues expressed NF-κB proteins (2.Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A. Brandl R. Knuechel R. Page M. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A.

Proliferation of SMC plays an important role in the formation of intimal thickening in animals and human with several vascular diseases, such as restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and atherosclerosis (10.Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1991; 13: 885-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,11.Schwartz S.M. deBlois D. O'Brien E.R. Circ.

However, intracellular signals leading to NF-κB activation in SMC proliferation is still unclear.I-κB is an inhibitory protein of NF-κB. The I-κB family includes I-κBα, I-κBβ, I-κBγ, p100, p105, and Bcl-3. After cell stimulation, I-κB is phosphorylated and degraded by ubiquitination and cleavage by proteasome enzymes. As a result, NF-κB is released as an active form, is localized into nuclei, and transmits signals through binding to DNA (1.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). I-κB degrades immediately after injury in vascular walls (4.Landry D.B. Couper L.L. Bryant S.R. Lindner V. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1085-1095PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection or liposomal delivery of I-κBα blocks NF-κB activation and inhibits SMC proliferation (12.Bellas R.E. Lee J.S. Sonenshein G.E. J.

Immunohistochemical study of human atherosclerotic tissues, using the antibody recognizing I-κB-binding site of p65 of NF-κB, indicated that p65 of NF-κB was activated in SMC of atherosclerotic lesions, but not in normal vascular tissues (2.Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A. Brandl R. Knuechel R. Page M. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Neumeier D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that I-κB plays a key role to regulate the activation of NF-κB in SMC proliferation on vascular walls.Proliferation of vascular SMC may be regulated by growth factors and cytokines in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. A number of factors to regulate SMC proliferation have been identified, such as thrombin, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The response of thrombin is mimicked by thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). These factors have been reported to stimulate NF-κB activation in various cells. On the other hand, a previous paper indicated that 4-cyano-5,5-bis-(methoxyphenyl)4-pentenoic acid (E5510) suppressed NF-κB activation induced by thrombin in SMC (14.Nakajima T. Kitajima I. Shin H. Matsumoto W. Soejima Y. Maruyama I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we first focused on NF-κB activation and I-κB degradation to be regulated by bFGF, TRAP, TNF-α, and E5510. We have reported in this paper that TRAP and bFGF induced I-κB degradation and NF-κB activation through an E5510-sensitive pathway and TNF-α through an E5510-insensitive pathway. Extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway is activated in SMC proliferation in vivo andin vitro (15.Bornfeldt K.E. Campbell J.S. Koyama H. Argast G.M. Leslie C.C. Raines E.W. Krebs E.G.

Here we have also reported the role of ERK1/2 in NF-κB activation induced by TRAP and bFGF but not by TNF-α.RESULTSProliferation of vascular SMC may be regulated by growth factors and cytokines in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. A number of factors to regulate SMC proliferation have been identified, such as thrombin, bFGF, and TNF-α. The response of thrombin is mimicked by TRAP. Nuclear transcriptional factors such as NF-κB regulate SMC proliferation. We first determined the effect of growth factors and cytokine TNF-α on DNA synthesis in cultured SMC by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. TRAP and bFGF induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into SMC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). TRAP at 10 μm and bFGF at 1 ng/ml increased the activity up to 3 and 6.5 times, respectively, to the unstimulated activity. TNF-α did not affect the activity even at concentrations up to 10 ng/ml. Since previous papers indicated that E5510 inhibited SMC proliferation in intimal thickening in canine vascular tissue (26.Mawatari K. Komori K. Kuma S. Okazaki J. Kawasaki K. Eguchi D. Itoh H. Onohara T. Sugimachi K. J. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1997; 38: 359-365PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Fujioka K. Esato K. Furutani A. Akiyama N. Yoshimura K. Takenaka H. Sekido T. Suganuma A. Sagami F. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of E5510 on cultured SMC proliferation. E5510 inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by TRAP and bFGF (Fig. 2 B). E5510 attenuated the activity of TRAP to the basal level at 500 μm. E5510 decreased the activity of bFGF in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition was significant at 0.5 μm and higher concentrations. E5510 had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation into untreated and TNF-α-treated cells.To determine the effect of E5510 on the increase in cell number, we utilized MTT assay. TRAP and bFGF increased cell number in a time-dependent manner. During 6 days incubation, TRAP increased cell number 3.3 times and bFGF 4.5 times. TNF-α induced the slight increase in cell number at 1 day but no significant increase at 3 and 6 days (Fig. 3 A). E5510 suppressed the increase in cell number induced by TRAP and bFGF. E5510 diminished the activity of TRAP at 300 μm and the activity of bFGF at 100 μm to the unstimulated level. E5510 had no effect on cell number of untreated and TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). These results show that TRAP and bFGF were potent stimulants for SMC proliferation, whereas TNF-α was less potent and that E5510 inhibited DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC after the stimulation of TRAP and bFGF.Figure 3Effect of TRAP , bFGF , and TNF -α on rat SMC proliferation.

To measure the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity, SMC were transfected with HIV-1-LTR PLAP. Tandem NF-κB sequence exists in the LTR of HIV-1, and NF-κB positively regulates transcription of this gene (23.Goto M. Yamada K. Katayama K. Tanaka I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 860-873PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP, bFGF, and TNF-α stimulated the transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). TRAP enhanced the activity significantly at 3 μm and more. bFGF and TNF-α increased the transcriptional activity at 3 and 10 ng/ml. E5510 at 100 μm suppressed the activity stimulated by TRAP and bFGF (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, E5510 did not affect the TNF-α-induced transcriptional activity even at 500 μm. These results showed that the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity was induced by TRAP and bFGF through a distinct pathway from that of TNF-α in SMC.Figure 4Effect of TRAP , bFGF , and TNF -α on NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity.

To determine NF-κB activity to bind to DNA after SMC stimulation, the nuclear extracts were analyzed in EMSA using an oligonucleotide containing NF-κB consensus sequence (Fig.5). EMSA showed the two bands corresponding to NF-κB, p50/p50 homodimer complex, and p50/p65 heterodimer complex. After the treatment with TRAP, bFGF, and TNF-α, NF-κB activation in binding to DNA was induced, which was in parallel with the NF-κB transcriptional activity in the reporter gene assay. When E5510 was added to the culture, the agent suppressed the NF-κB activation in the stimulation by TRAP and bFGF. In contrast, E5510 at the same dose had no effect on the activation by TNF-α. Supershift assay was done using antibodies against p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB. For control, anti-c-Jun and anti-NF-ATc2 antibodies were used. Anti-p50 and p65 antibodies induced the dramatic shift of the bands, and anti-c-Rel induced the shift of the minor portion of the band. Other antibodies did not affect the migration of the band. 20- or 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled consensus oligonucleotide diminished NF-κB band (data not shown). These data showed that NF-κB complexes contained p50 and p65 predominantly and c-Rel in minor portion of the band. To study the specificity of NF-κB signals, we next determined AP-1 activity in SMC.Figure 5Effect of E5510 on NF-κB activity in EMSA. A, SMC were pretreated with E5510 (500 μm) for 2 h and then incubated with TRAP (10 μm), bFGF (10 ng/ml), and TNF-α (3 ng/ml) for 60 min. Nuclear extracts from the cells were evaluated in EMSA. B, NF-κB components were identified by a supershift assay. The nuclear extracts were subjected to EMSA in the presence of the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We evaluated the same nuclear extract in EMSA using AP-1-specific probes and confirmed that E5510 had no effect on AP-1 activity in the treatment of TRAP, bFGF, and TNF-α (data not shown). The results of NF-κB activity in EMSA was quantitated in BAS2000 and compared with the results of AP-1 activity (Fig. 6). E5510 suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by TRAP by 79.5% and the activation by bFGF by 73.0%. In contrast, E5510 at the same dose had no effect on the activation by TNF-α. E5510 did not decrease the DNA binding activity of AP-1. These results suggest that E5510 suppressed NF-κB DNA binding activity induced by TRAP and bFGF but not the activity by TNF-α and that the effect was selective to NF-κB but not to AP-1.Figure 6Inhibition of NF-κB activity but not AP-1 activity by E5510 in EMSA. NF-κB activity (closed columns) and AP-1 activity (hatched columns) were quantitated as radioactivity and indicated as a relative value to the control (without E5510). The data were the average value of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NF-κB activity is regulated by I-κB proteins, and the degradation of I-κB results in NF-κB activation. Cytosolic extracts were isolated from SMC treated with TRAP, bFGF, and TNF-α, and the degradation of I-κBα and I-κBβ proteins was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). I-κBα was degraded 60 min after stimulation by TRAP and bFGF. After 180 min, the amount of the protein was recovered. In contrast, TNF-α did not promote the I-κBα degradation in SMC. On the other hand, the amount of I-κBβ was once increased 15 and 30 min after stimulation by any of TRAP, bFGF, and TNF-α and then degraded after 60 and 180 min. These data suggest that I-κBα degradation was regulated in a different way from I-κBβ degradation in SMC and that I-κBα degradation, rather than I-κBβ degradation, might play a role in NF-κB activation induced by TRAP and bFGF.Figure 7Time-dependent change of I-κBα and I-κBβ proteins after stimulation of TRAP , bFGF , and TNF -α.

Compared with vehicle-treated cells, E5510-treated cells showed the suppressed degradation of I-κBα in the activation by TRAP and bFGF. E5510 had no effect on I-κBα degradation induced by TNF-α. On the other hand, E5510 suppressed I-κBβ degradation in the activation by bFGF and TNF-α. But E5510 had no effect on I-κBβ degradation induced by TRAP. These results suggest that E5510 was potent to suppress the degradation of I-κB proteins. The degradation of I-κBα, rather than I-κBβ, was important in NF-κB activation after the stimulation of TRAP and bFGF in SMC.Figure 8Inhibition of I-κBα and I-κBβ degradation by E5510. Cells were pretreated with E5510 (300 μm) for 2 h, and TRAP (10 μm), bFGF (10 ng/ml), and TNF-α (3 ng/ml) were added.

Among the MAPK family, ERK1/2 plays a role in stimulating SMC proliferation, and ERK1/2 activity is dramatically induced during SMC proliferation in injured arteries in the rat (16.Lille S. Daum G. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. J. Surg. Res. 1997; 70: 178-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the possibility that ERK1/2 regulated NF-κB activity in SMC using an NF-κB reporter gene assay and an ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 (Fig.9 A). PD98059 significantly decreased the NF-κB transcriptional activity induced by TRAP and bFGF. At 10 μm PD98059, the NF-κB transcriptional activity of TRAP and bFGF was reduced to the control level. PD98059 at the same dose had no effect on vehicle-treated culture. In addition, the effect of PD98059 on SMC proliferation was determined in MTT assay (Fig. 9 B). PD98059 suppressed SMC proliferation induced by TRAP and bFGF. PD98059 decreased the proliferation induced by TRAP and bFGF to 27.5 and 19.8% of the control, respectively. These data indicate that ERK1/2 was important in NF-κB activation and SMC proliferation.Figure 9Inhibition of NF-κB activity and growth activity by an ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059.SMC were pretreated with PD98059 at 10 μm for 2 h, and bFGF (10 ng/ml) and TRAP (10 μm) were added.A, NF-κB-dependent PLAP activity was determined at 24 h by PLAP assay as shown under “Materials and Methods.” n = 9–11 for each point.

ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation assay clearly indicated that TRAP and bFGF stimulated ERK1/2 activation. TRAP significantly activated ERK1/2 at 15 and 30 min after the stimulation, and the activity was returned to the level of unstimulated cells at 60 min. bFGF induced the activation at 15 min, and the activity decreased rapidly at 30 and 60 min. In contrast, TNF-α had no effect on ERK1/2 activity at concentrations of 3–10 ng/ml, although TNF-α at these doses activated NF-κB. Then we determined the effect of E5510 on ERK1/2 activity. It was remarkable, however, that E5510 did not affect the ERK1/2 activity stimulated by TRAP and bFGF. Since ERK1/2 was important in NF-κB activation and SMC proliferation induced by TRAP and bFGF, these results indicated that E5510 suppressed a signal in the downstream of ERK1/2 activation leading to NF-κB activation in SMC proliferation.Figure 10Effect of bFGF , TRAP , TNF -α, and E5510 on ERK1/2 activity in SMC. A, quiescent SMC were incubated with bFGF (10 ng/ml), TRAP (10 μm), and TNF-α (3 ng/ml). ERK1/2 activity was determined at 15, 30, and 60 min. B, cells were incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of E5510 at 300 μm for 2 h, and bFGF (10 ng/ml), TRAP (10 μm), and TNF-α (3 ng/ml) were added. ERK1/2 activity was determined at 15 min.

We studied the effects of growth factors on cultured rat SMC proliferation. TRAP and bFGF, but not TNF-α, stimulated cell proliferation in [3H]thymidine incorporation assay and increased cell number. E5510 dose-dependently inhibited SMC proliferation induced by TRAP and bFGF. In animal experiments, E5510 inhibited SMC proliferation in intimal thickening in canine vein graft and Teflon graft models (26.Mawatari K. Komori K. Kuma S. Okazaki J. Kawasaki K. Eguchi D. Itoh H.

Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that E5510 is a potent inhibitor of SMC proliferation in culture and in vivo.TRAP and bFGF activated the NF-κB-dependent transcription in SMC. E5510 suppressed NF-κB activation of TRAP and bFGF and also blocked TRAP- and bFGF-inducible degradation of I-κBα. These findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of E5510 on NF-κB activation was due to the suppression of I-κBα degradation. We propose the signal cascade of NF-κB activation and SMC proliferation, as discussed below (Fig. 11).Figure 11Proposed signal pathways leading to NF-κB activation. TRAP and bFGF activate ERK1/2, I-κB degradation, and NF-κB activation.

E5510 was originally prepared as an anti-platelet agent. In previous studies of ours and others (19.Fujimori T. Harada K. Saeki T. Kogushi M. Yoshimura T. Katayama K. Jpn. J.

Bull. 1996; 19: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) using human platelets, E5510 had a potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation and subsequent release of mitogens. The effect was found to be dependent on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibition of COX-1 and -2 activities by E5510 resulted in blocking collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation, like a COX inhibitor indomethacin. Salicylates, anti-inflammatory agents with an inhibitory activity of COX, inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation and tissue factor expression through blocking I-κBα degradation in monocytic THP-1 cells (30.Oeth P. Mackman N. Blood. 1995; 86: 4144-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, salicylates suppress TNF-α-induced I-κBα phosphorylation, degradation, NF-κB activation, and adhesion molecules expression (31.Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). However, indomethacin has no effect on the I-κBα degradation in the same model (31.Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). COXs are induced in SMC and other cells by growth factors and cytokines (32.Libby P. Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. J. Clin.

Many of them have been shown to be toxic to microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, and bacteria and also to mammalian cells. It has been suggested that thionins are present in seeds to protect them, and the germinating seedling, from attack by phytopathogenic microorganisms, but the mechanism by which they kill cells remains unclear. Using electrophysiological measurements, we have shown that β-purothionin from wheat flour can form cation-selective ion channels in artificial lipid bilayer membranes and in the plasmalemma of rat hippocampal neurons. We suggest that the generalized toxicity of thionins is due to their ability to generate ion channels in cell membranes, resulting in the dissipation of ion concentration gradients essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

The purified proteins were subsequently found to kill microorganisms (3.De Calaya F. Ganzales-Pascual B. Garcia-Olmedo F. Appl. Microbiol. 1972; 23: 998-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that these proteins are present in plants as a defense against microbial attack. Thionins are found in many cereal tissues (4.Apel K. Bohlmann H. Reimann-Philipp U. Physiol. Plant. 1990; 80: 315-321Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and have been identified in other plant species (5.Daley L. Theriot L. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1987; 35: 680-687Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and they form a diverse class of proteins with low sequence similarity but highly conserved three-dimensional structure. Evidence for a role in the constitutive defense of plants against pathogen attack has been provided by the expression of thionins in transgenic plants. Carmona et al. (6.Carmona M. Molina A. Fernandez J. Lopez-Fando J. Garcia-Olmedo F. Plant J. 1993; 3: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showed that expression of barley α1-hordothionin in transgenic tobacco led to an increase in resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, whereas overexpression of an endogenous leaf thionin inArabidopsis thaliana resulted in an increase in resistance to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (7.Epple P. Apel K. Bohlmann H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Various thionins have been reported to have a wide array of effects on the viability and biochemical or physiological functions of both animal and microbial cells. This has prompted a number of models to explain their mode of action, none of which consistently explains all of the available data (for reviews, see Refs. 8.Florack D. Stiekema W. Plant Mol.

Rev. 1992; 11: 169-191Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The thionins are known to alter the permeability and fluidity of the plasma membrane of treated cells (11.Thevissen K.

Toxicon. 1989; 27: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, their action at this site is still under debate. Thionins are toxic to a wide range of cells, and nearly every organism tested has proven to be susceptible (8.Florack D. Stiekema W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13.Molina A. Ahl Goy P. Fraile A. Sanchez-Monge R. Garcia-Olmedo F. Plant Sci. 1993; 92: 168-177Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This universal toxicity suggests that the manner in which thionins kill cells does not rely on a specific cell surface receptor and that the processes disrupted by thionins are common to most cells. It has recently been shown that γ-zeathionins are sodium channel agonists (14.Kushmerick C. de Souza Castro M. Santos Cruz J. Bloch Jr., C. Beirão FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); on the basis of that observation together with the data presented in this paper, we suggest that the nomenclature for these two classes be changed, as they clearly act in functionally distinct manners. The most readily observed effect of thionins on cells is the disruption of membrane integrity (10.Vernon L. J. Toxicol. Toxin.

Beirão FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and 2–5 mmCa2+ is sufficient to completely protect cells, whereas calcium chelators increase the toxic effect of thionins (15.Vernon L. Rogers A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Iodination of tyrosine 13 of the Pyrularia pubera thionin, a residue found in all toxic thionins, leads to a loss of toxicity (16.Fracki W. Li D. Owen N. Perry C. Naisbitt G. Vernon L. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,17.Wada K. Ozaki Y. Matsubara H. Yoshizumi H. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This residue is absent only in the two nontoxic members of the thionin family the crambins (18.Garcia-Olmedo F. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Hernadez-Lucas C. Ponz F. Marana C. Carmona M. Lopez-Fando J. Fernandez J. Carbonero P. Oxford Surv. Plant Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 6: 31-32Google Scholar). These data suggested to us that it may be the protein directly that is responsible for plasma membrane disruption, rather than secondary effects, and that this might be initially through the formation of ion channels by a complex of thionin molecules inserted into the plasmalemma. The passage of ions through the channel probably involves Tyr-13, which is on one side of the protein in the center of a hydrophilic domain (Protein Data Bank accession number 1BHP). A previous study concluded that thionins do not form ion channels (11.Thevissen K. Ghazi A. de Samblanx G. Brownlee C. Osborn R. Broekaert F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15018-15025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), but inconclusive electrophysiological methods were used without adequate controls. Another study also concluded that α-purothionin (19.Caaveiro J. Molina A. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Gonzalez-Manas J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2567-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) did not form ion channels by assuming that large fluorescent cations would correctly mimic the natural substrate of the proteins. Using a highly purified preparation of β-purothionin (β-pth),1 we provide conclusive evidence that thionins form monovalent cation-selective ion channels when inserted into either artificial or natural membranes and that this is the most likely primary mode of action of these cytotoxic proteins. β-Purothionin was prepared from unbleached wheat flour by petroleum ether extraction and acidic ethanol precipitation (20.Garcia-Olmedo F. Sotelo I. Garcia-Faure R. Ann. Inst. Nac. Invest. Agro. 1968; 17: 433Google Scholar) and subjected to preparative cathodic electrophoresis (21.Westermeier R. Electrophoresis in Practice. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1997: 131-142Google Scholar). The protein from the electrophoresis was subjected to reverse phase chromatography on PorosR2 media in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using a 10 column volume gradient from 0–70% acetonitrile on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC at 2 ml/min. The peak fraction that contained β-pth was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), as well as by bioassays for cytotoxicity. Peak fractions from the FPLC were taken and diluted 1:100, and 1 μl was added to 10 μl of saturated α-hydroxy cinnamic acid, of which 2 μl was spotted onto a target. The protein was analyzed on a Varian time of flight mass spectrometer using an accelerating voltage of 25,000 V. Laser power and gain were altered to give the highest possible signal to noise ratio. The standards used for calibration were bovine insulin (molecular weight, 5734.5) and gramicidin S (molecular weight, 1141.5). The fractions that contained a protein giving a molecular mass signal of 4921 Da (calculated from the β-pth protein sequence) were pooled and further purified by cation exchange chromatography on a Bio-Rad MA7S column in 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.5, using a 15 column volume gradient of 0–2 m NaCl. Fractions containing β-pth were desalted by repeating the reverse phase chromatography and subsequently lyophilized. The purified product was subjected to N-terminal sequencing to confirm its identity. Two other purothionins were also purified from the same starting material: α1-pth was resolved from β-pth and α2-pth at the first reverse phase step, and α2-pth was resolved from β-pth during the cation exchange chromatography. All of the purothionins (α1, α2, and β) were homogenous, as judged by MALDI-MS and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Toxicity of the intermediate and purified fractions of the thionins was determined by treating mouse p388 (ATCC) cells and the fungus Verticillium dahliae with β-pth. Mouse p388 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium F15 supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, harvested after 48 h at 4 °C, and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis was monitored by adding 1 μm β-pth to 0.5 ml of cells and observing through a Zeiss light microscope at a magnification of × 400.Verticillium growth was monitored according to Brokaertet al. (22.Brokaert W. Terras F. Cammue B. Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 69: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar) except that Czapeks Dox broth (Difco) was used as the culture medium. 2 mg of purified β-pth was iodinated using lactoperoxidase as per Wada et al. (17.Wada K. Ozaki Y. Matsubara H. Yoshizumi H. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The extent of iodination of Tyr-13 was determined by MALDI-MS. Artificial lipid bilayers were made with phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) dissolved in n-decane and painted across a small aperture in the wall of a 2-ml Delrin cup separating cis and trans chambers containing salt solutions (23.Piller S. Ewart G. Premkumar A. Cox G. Gage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The membranes formed in these experiments were made in two compositions, PS:PE:PC 2:2:1 and PE:PC 2:1. The cis chamber of the bilayer apparatus normally contained 100 mm NaCl, and the trans chamber normally contained 10 mm NaCl in 5 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6. The cis chamber was connected to ground, and the trans chamber was connected to the input of an amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments). Voltages were measured in the trans chamber relative to the grounded cis chamber. Thionin preparations were dissolved in water and added to the cis chamber at 800 nm and stirred until channel activity was observed. To show the effect of adding calcium ions to an active bilayer (held at −40 mV, cis to trans), 10 mm calcium chloride (final concentration) was added to the cis chamber and stirred for 10 s. To remove the free calcium from the chamber, EGTA and phosphate were added at 12 and 20 mm, respectively. Rat hippocampal neurons were cultured and patch-clamped according to Curmi et al. (24.Curmi J. Premkumar L. Birnir B. Gage P. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The electrode solutions were supplemented with 200 nmβ-pth by backfilling. The pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm TES, pH 7.2. The bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, pH 7.2. The purified β-pth preparation was homogenous as judged by both MALDI-MS (Fig. 1 a) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using silver and Sypro (Molecular Probes) staining (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing of the first 12 amino acids confirmed its identity. The protein was biologically active as shown by its ability to kill mouse p388 (ATCC) cells (Fig. 1 b) and the fungus Verticillium dahliae (data not shown). Batches used in these experiments were toxic to both cell types at concentrations of 200 nm and above and after 30 min, as judged by microscopic examination, resulted in 95% cell death at 1 μm using p388 cells. The plasma membrane was visibly altered in two ways: vesicles were pinched off, remaining associated with the nucleus, and membrane blebs formed. These effects are similar to those observed by Piller et al. (25.Piller S. Jans P. Gage P. Jans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4595-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using the HIV Vpr, a small basic protein that forms cation-selective ion channels in artificial bilayers (21.Westermeier R. Electrophoresis in Practice. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1997: 131-142Google Scholar). At higher concentrations (above 5 μm), rapid and complete cell lysis was observed. When 800 nm β-pth was added to the cis chamber of the bilayer apparatus and briefly stirred, ion channel activity was observed after about 5 min and continued until the bilayer broke down, typically 30–60 min. The current trace from a typical experiment is shown in Fig. 2 a. Currents typically displayed several amplitudes (0–15 pA) and reversed at positive potentials. In 10 experiments, the average reversal potential was +35 ± 3 mV (mean ± 1 S.E.) (Fig. 2 b), indicating that the membrane had become about 7 times more permeable to Na+ than to Cl−. When KCl was substituted for NaCl, the reversal potential was very similar (+38 ± 3 mV;n = 5), indicating that channels were about equally permeable to Na+ and K+. The I/V curve for β-pth showed significant rectification. Channels were formed when α1- and α2-purothionin were added to artificial bilayers, and the reversal potentials were +45 ± 2 and +52 ± 3 mV, respectively (data not shown). Thionins are nontoxic in vivo in the presence of low millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (13.Molina A. Ahl Goy P. Fraile A. Sanchez-Monge R. Garcia-Olmedo F. Plant Sci. 1993; 92: 168-177Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15.Vernon L. Rogers A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the artificial bilayers, ion channel activity caused by β-pth was also completely blocked when 10 mm Ca2+ was subsequently added to the cis chamber (Fig.3 a). This inhibition was long term (t >1 h) and could not be reversed by adding EGTA at concentrations up to 12 mm to the cis chamber. It was only partially reversed by the addition of 20 mm phosphate (not shown). Channel activity was potential-dependent, as illustrated in Fig. 3 b. Channel activity was reduced when the potential was switched from −40 to +40 mV (cis-trans). The cessation of activity was not immediate but occurred after a delay of several seconds. Conversely, channel activity gradually increased when the potential was switched from positive to negative (cis-trans) (data not shown). Both α1-pth and α2-pth conducted ions at potentials more positive than the reversal potential (data not shown). The role of tyrosine 13 in the toxicity of other thionins has been well established by iodination experiments (16.Fracki W. Li D. Owen N. Perry C. Naisbitt G. Vernon L. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17.Wada K. Ozaki Y. Matsubara H. Yoshizumi H. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Iodinated β-pth in our experimental system did not form ion channels in lipid bilayers (n = 5), even at low negative potentials (cis-trans, −200 mV) and high protein concentrations (80 μm). It was also completely inactive against mouse p388 cells and fungal hyphae (data not shown). We and others (15.Vernon L. Rogers A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that β-purothionin is toxic to mammalian cells (Fig. 1 b). Ion channels were activated in cell-attached patches on rat cultured hippocampal neurons when the recording pipette contained β-pth (800 nm, Fig.4). The channels were recorded with a pipette potential of −20 mV and reversed at a pipette potential of −60 mV (thus, if the membrane potential was −60 mV, the transmembrane potential was 0 mV), indicating that the ion channels formed by the protein were permeable to both Na+ and K+ ions. This potential was chosen because no natural cation-selective channels are active, although occasional spontaneous chloride channels are observed. In Fig. 4, the cation currents show upward deflections from zero. Similar results were obtained in three patches. The β-pth purified from wheat flour was biologically active and able to kill both fungal and mammalian cells at low nanomolar concentrations. Applying β-pth to p388 mouse cells resulted in rapid alterations in the surface membrane structure and cell morphology, as shown in Fig. 1 b. This is consistent with previous observations that suggest that thionins act at the plasmalemma. We found that α1-, α2-, and β-purothionins formed ion channels that are cation-selective in artificial bilayers and that β-pth formed channels in biological membranes. The selectivity of the β-pth-induced channels indicates it is 7 times more permeable to monovalent cations (K+ and Na+) than to Cl−. This protein is a potent broad-spectrum toxin, and according to our model for its mode of action, high ion selectivity would not be necessary for its function in vivo. Two other purothionin toxins (α1 and α2) are less toxic than β-pth and, interestingly, display greater selectivity for cations over anions as indicated by their higher reversal potentials. They also show other properties different from β-pth that might account for the difference in toxicity. Previous studies that concluded that thionins did not form channels were flawed in two ways: one study determined that alterations in conductance were due to protein binding (11.Thevissen K. Ghazi A. de Samblanx G. Brownlee C. Osborn R. Broekaert F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15018-15025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and another assumed that large fluorescent cations would mimic the channels natural substrate (19.Caaveiro J. Molina A. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Gonzalez-Manas J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2567-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we show by direct measurement that purothionins form cation-selective channels in lipid membranes. There is a good correlation between cytotoxicity and ability to form ion channels. Iodinated β-pth, which is nontoxic, was not capable of forming ion channels under conditions most favoring channel activity,i.e. low negative potentials and high protein concentrations. Preparations of β-pth that were not cytotoxic due to residual lipid contamination were also not able to form ion channels in artificial membranes (data not shown). The formation of ion channels in artificial bilayers lacking other cellular components suggests that thionins may be toxic to a wide range of organisms because they form ion channels and not, as has been suggested previously, because of membrane breakdown associated with protein binding (11.Thevissen K. Ghazi A. de Samblanx G. Brownlee C. Osborn R. Broekaert F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15018-15025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), redox activities (26.Garcia-Olmedo F. Pineiro M. Diaz I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), or activation of secondary messenger enzymes (27.Angerhofer C. Shier W. Vernon L. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Membrane composition has significant effects on the properties of the ion channels formed by β-pth and may therefore influence toxicology toward different cell types. In bilayers without PS, the channels formed by β-pth gave square openings and multiple subconductance states (Fig. 2 a). In a bilayer containing PS, there were multiple subconductances combined with irregular openings (Fig.3 b, bottom). This type of conductance pattern is typical of small protein channels (28.Pawlak M. Meseth U. Dhanapal B. Mutter M. Vogel H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1788-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PS is highly negatively charged and this may influence the aggregation state of the protein within the bilayer, altering co-operativity between aggregates, and hence exert an influence on channel conductance. The channels formed by β-pth display some unusual electrophysiological properties, and these are shown in Fig. 3. It is known that thionin toxicity can be eliminated and reversed by adding extracellular calcium (15.Vernon L. Rogers A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Adding calcium to an ion-conducting bilayer containing β-pth completely inhibited channel activity (Fig.3 b). This inhibition could not be reversed by calcium chelators. Although it is common that monovalent cation-selective channels will discriminate between divalent and monovalent cations or be activated/inhibited by Ca2+, it is unusual that the inhibition is not reversed by chelation. This suggests that the calcium is being buried or sequestered within the thionin channel. The tertiary structure of thionin, because of the extensive disulfide bridging, is very rigid (Protein Data Bank accession number 1BHP), so it is unlikely to be simply a conformational alteration in the individual thionin units. One explanation could be that the thionin itself strongly chelates the calcium, near the site through which ions pass, blocking the passage of other ions. The iodination of Tyr-13 results in an inactive toxin that does not form ion channels, although it is probably still able to bind to membranes (12.Osorio e Castro V. Vernon L. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that the chemical and/or steric environment surrounding Tyr-13 is important in ion conductance and may indicate that this residue forms a part of the pore through which ions pass. The channels formed by the β-pth displayed pronounced rectification: currents were not maintained at positive potentials approximately 10 mV above the reversal potential (Figs.2 b and 3 b) when all the channels had closed. A delay was often observed before current activity started after the potential was switched back to a negative potential. The delay may reflect the time taken for β-pth to adopt the correct orientation and aggregation state to enable ion conductance. These proteins are very small (5 kDa), and the largest α-helical segment is not sufficiently long to span a bilayer; therefore, a single molecule is unlikely to form an ion channel. Thionins exist as a dimer in solution (29.Ohtani S. Okada T. Yoshizumi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1977; 82: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and in crystals, higher order structures are found, suggesting that thionins are able to form complex quaternary complexes (30.Teeter M. Ma X. Rao U. Whitlow M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The channels observed in the artificial bilayers clearly result from the formation of a specific protein complex with defined electrophysiological properties and are not consistent with nonspecific bilayer breakdown. Although the formation of ion channels in artificial membranes indicates that β-pth may kill by ion channel formation, it is an artificial system, and channels may not occur in vivo. However, we demonstrated that β-pth is able to form cation-selective ion channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, confirming the data obtained in the artificial bilayers. The most likely mode of thionin toxicity at low concentrations is therefore through the formation of these cation-selective channels that dissipate the concentration gradients of potassium and sodium ions across the plasmalemma. The loss of ion homeostasis would result in the destruction of the plasma membrane potential. The plethora of observed physiological and biochemical effects of thionin application can then be explained by the many downstream effects that would follow depolarization and loss of the capacity of the cell to maintain homeostatic control of cellular functions. The thionin binding site on the plasmalemma must be the lipid surface itself, as it is able to form active ion channels in artificial bilayers where no other protein components are present. It has previously been suggested that thionins bind to phosphatidylinositol (10.Vernon L. J. Toxicol. Toxin. Rev. 1992; 11: 169-191Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but this lipid was not present in the mixtures tested in these experiments, and in wheat flour, a number of different lipid components are associated with extracted thionins (18.Garcia-Olmedo F. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Hernadez-Lucas C. Ponz F. Marana C. Carmona M. Lopez-Fando J. Fernandez J. Carbonero P. Oxford Surv. Plant Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 6: 31-32Google Scholar). Monovalent cations are able to inhibit thionin toxicity at high concentrations (31.Terras F. Goderis I. Vanleuven F. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B. Broekaert W. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and may act by disrupting ionic interactions between the thionins and the lipid binding sites. Divalent cations probably act by chelating the thionin binding sites, thus preventing thionin binding (15.Vernon L. Rogers A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thionins are present in solution as a dimer, but this unit has only a single hydrophobic face and so is unlikely to be the only unit of the conducting channel. Teeter et al. (30.Teeter M. Ma X. Rao U. Whitlow M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) observed an octamer in α1-pth crystals, and although this unit has the hydrophobic surface facing the interior, it may invert in a lipid bilayer to form a channel with four head-to-tail dimers as the conducting unit. Membrane lytic activity has previously been observed withPyrularia thionin (15.Vernon L. Rogers A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which indicates that the thionins are able to lyse membranes directly. This lytic activity may be a general property of the whole family, as both artificial bilayers and natural membranes were unstable when high concentrations of β-pth were applied. The small anion-selective channel forming peptide melittin from honeybee venom is also highly lytic and has been proposed to act in a two-step mechanism in killing cells (32.Terwilliger T. Weissman L. Eisendberg D. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), initially acting as an ion channel to depolarize cells and, if present at sufficient concentration, lysing cells directly. The manner in which the plant protects itself from thionin toxicityin vivo is not currently known. In vivo the thionins are targeted to storage vacuoles (33.Ponz F. Paz-Ares J. Hernandez-Lucas C. Carbonerro P. Garcia-Olmedo F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are present in the seed of cereals at extremely high concentrations, up to 10% of the total protein in wheat flour (18.Garcia-Olmedo F. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Hernadez-Lucas C. Ponz F. Marana C. Carmona M. Lopez-Fando J. Fernandez J. Carbonero P. Oxford Surv. Plant Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 6: 31-32Google Scholar). β-pth would be inactive as a channel protein within the plant vacuole because of its high positive transmembrane potential, but α1-pth and α2-pth were both shown to form ion channels at high positive potentials. The plant must have other mechanisms to protect itself against the toxicity of the thionins it accumulates in its seeds, presumably through their packaging within the storage vacuole. The very low concentrations at which the thionins are able to kill cells and the high amounts in which they are present would provide a significant obstacle to pathogen colonization of cereal and other plant seeds, and this is clearly their main biological function. Our observation that thionins form ion channels is a significant advance in the study of thionin toxicology. It explains the majority of observed cellular effects of thionins at concentrations that are well within the range at which they are physiologically active. The observed differences in channel properties between the different purothionin types is also a step toward explaining their different toxicology, and the existence of many natural thionin variants and a well characterized three-dimensional structure make this a promising model system to further explore ion channel function.

The low intrinsic GTPase activity of both factors is strongly stimulated on the ribosome by unknown mechanisms. Here we report that isolated ribosomal protein L7/12 strongly stimulates GTP hydrolysis by EF-G, but not by EF-Tu, indicating a major contribution of L7/12 to GTPase activation of EF-G on the ribosome. The effect is due to the acceleration of the catalytic step because the rate of GDP-GTP exchange on EF-G, as measured by rapid kinetics, is much faster than the steady-state GTPase rate. The unique, highly conserved arginine residue in the C-terminal domain of L7/12 is not essential for the activation, excluding an “arginine finger”-type mechanism.

GTPase-activating protein elongation factor GTP-binding proteins are involved in a number of important cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein synthesis, and protein export. Generally, GTPases act as molecular switches that alternate between an inactive GDP-bound conformation and an active GTP-bound conformation. The intrinsic GTPase activity of most GTP-binding proteins is low, ranging from 0.02 min−1 for Ras-like GTPases to 2–5 min−1 for the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The reaction is thought to proceed through an in-line associative mechanism in which the substrate, GTP, acts as a general base to activate a nucleophilic water (1.Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 2.Schweins T. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Warshel A.

(1994) Nature 276–279Google Scholar), revealed two conserved residues, glutamine and arginine, that are crucial for the stabilization of the GTPase transition state. Whereas a glutamine residue in a homologous position is also present in Ras-like GTPases, the corresponding arginine residue is missing, in keeping with the relatively low intrinsic GTPase activity. In the case of several small GTPases, GTP hydrolysis is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 that are specific with respect to their target GTP-binding proteins (5.Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GAPs accelerate the GTPase reaction has been elucidated recently for Ras (6.Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R.

Upon interaction with their respective target, both RasGAP and RhoGAP supply a catalytic arginine residue into the active site of Ras (“arginine finger”), thereby stabilizing the GTPase transition state and increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis more than 1000-fold. Furthermore, the structure of the active center of the Ras-RasGAP and Rho-RhoGAP complexes appears to be remarkably similar to the putative GTPase transition state structure of Gα (11.Noel J.P. Nat.

Biol. 1997; 4: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar stereochemistry of the GTPase reaction, regardless of whether the catalytic arginine is provided in cis or intrans. In several heterotrimeric G proteins, the rate of GTP hydrolysis is enhanced by proteins known as RGS proteins (regulator of G protein signaling) (12.Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13.Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex reveals that RGS proteins bind to the switch regions of Gα and stabilize the GTPase transition state of the G protein (14.Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Although RGSs bind to similar regions of GTP-binding proteins as GAPs, they do not donate catalytic residues for the GTPase reaction. Recently, yet another mechanism of GTPase stimulation has been found for a Ras-related protein, ARF1 (15.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). ARFGAP binds to regions of ARF that are distant from the nucleotide binding pocket, and there is no insertion of amino acid side chains from ARFGAP into the catalytic center of ARF. Elongation factors (EF) Tu and G are large, multi-domain GTPases which belong to a distinct subfamily of GTP-binding proteins (16.Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). For both factors, the molecular mechanisms of GTPase activation and GTP hydrolysis are not known (17.Hilgenfeld R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both EF-Tu and EF-G contain a conserved arginine residue homologous to the catalytic arginine in Gα; however, in Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu, replacement of this arginine (R59) with threonine did not significantly affect the GTPase (18.Zeidler W. Egle C. Ribeiro S. Wagner A. Katunin V. Kreutzer R. Rodnina M. Wintermeyer W. Sprinzl M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 2295: 596-604Crossref Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of both factors is either very low or absent (19.Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is strongly enhanced on the ribosome (20.Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21.Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochem.

Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), suggesting that the GTPase activity of both factors is increased by contacts with ribosomal components. Recently, both EF-Tu and EF-G have been visualized on the ribosome by electron cryomicroscopy (23.Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24.Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct.

In all reconstructions, a contact of EF-G and EF-Tu with the L7/12 stalk of the 50 S subunit was observed, in keeping with the importance of L7/12 for either factor binding to the ribosome or function on the ribosome, as demonstrated by numerous reports following the initial report by Kischa et al. (27.Kischa K. Möller W. Stöffler G. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 62-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The stalk comprises two dimers of the 12-kDa protein L7/12 (L7 differs from L12 by an acetylated N terminus). The protein consists of three domains. The N-terminal domain is required for dimer formation and for anchoring the protein to the ribosome by binding to ribosomal protein L10, whereas the C-terminal domain is involved in factor binding (28.Gudkov A.T. Budovskaya E.V. Sherstobaeva N.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,29.Sommer A. Etchison J.R. Gavino G. Zecherle N. Casiano C. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6522-6527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hinge region enables independent movement of the C-terminal domains relative to each other and to the N-terminal domains (30.Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16672-16679Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31.Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Budovskaya E.V. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Removal of the hinge region significantly reduces the mobility of the C-terminal domains and, upon reconstitution, yields inactive ribosomes (32.Oleinikov A.V. Perroud B. Wang B. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 917-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribosomes depleted of L7/12 have a decreased ability to interact with elongation factors, and activity is restored by the addition of L7/12 (27.Kischa K. Möller W. Stöffler G. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 62-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33.Hamel E. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6810-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribosomes, EF-G, and EF-Tu were prepared as described previously (22.Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 34.Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). mant-GDP and mant-GTP (2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)guanosine 5′-diphosphate (or -triphosphate)) were purchased from Molecular Probes. L7/12 was overexpressed from plasmid pT7–6::rpl L (provided by R. Traut, Dept. of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described previously (32.Oleinikov A.V. Perroud B. Wang B. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 917-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis was measured in Buffer A (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, and 7 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C using [γ-32P]GTP as described previously (22.Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Blank values resulting from 3.5% Pi present in [γ-32P]GTP were measured without added factors and subtracted throughout. Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were performed on a SX-18MV spectrometer (Applied Photophysics), and the data were evaluated as described previously (37.Jagath J.R. Rodnina M.V. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15408-15413Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). With the apparatus used, time constants of up to 500 s−1 could be measured. The fluorescence of mant-GTP (0.2 μm) and mant-GDP (0.5 μm) was excited at 366 nm and measured after passing KV408 filters (Schott). Experiments were performed in Buffer A at 37 °C by rapidly mixing equal volumes (60 μl each) of mant-GDP or mant-GTP with varying concentrations of nucleotide-free EF-G and monitoring the time courses of the fluorescence change. The data were evaluated by fitting an exponential function with the characteristic time constant,k app, the amplitude, A, and another variable for the final signal, F ∞, according to the equation F = F ∞ +A × exp(−k app ×t), where F is the fluorescence at timet. The results of several experiments (typical number, 10 experiments) were used to calculate the averagek app and the S.D. shown in Figs. 4 Band 5B. Because only single-exponential time courses were observed, the data were treated further in terms of a one-step binding model: EF-G + mant-GXP⇔EF-G·mantGXP. For this model, the bimolecular association rate constant and the dissociation rate constant can be determined from the linear concentration dependence of k app. Values of k 1 and k −1were determined by linear regression using thek app of all data sets, rather than the average values, to take into account the relatively large deviation of individual experiments. Thus, the values of k 1and k −1 are statistically valid, despite the significant S.D. of individual k app values. Calculations were performed using TableCurve software (Jandel Scientific).Figure 5Kinetics of EF-G interaction with mant-GTP. A, time course of binding to 1 μm EF-G. The smooth line shows the fit to an exponential function with the characteristic time constant,k app, the amplitude, A, and another variable for the final signal. B, dependence of thek app of binding on EF-G concentration. Parameters of the linear fit were as follows: k 1= 1.2 ± 0.7 μm−1 s−1, andk −1 = 7 ± 2 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Arginine 74 in L7/12 was replaced with methionine (R74M) or lysine (R74K) by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using plasmid pT7–6::rpLL. For each mutant, two polymerase chain reaction products were generated overlapping at the R74 mutagenic site. The following primer pairs were used to generate polymerase chain reaction products for the R74K mutant: (a) GAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTCAC and GACCCAGGCCAGTGGCGCCCTTTACTGCTTTGA, and (b) TCAAAGCAGTAAAGGGCGCCACTGGCCTGGGTC and AATTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCGA. Primer pairs used for the R74M mutagenesis were as follows: (a) GAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTCAC and GACCCAGGCCAGTGGCACCCATTACTGCTTTGA, and (b) TCAAAGCAGTAATGGGTGCCACTGGCCTGGGTC and AATTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCGA. Polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved withHindIII/BstXI andBstXI/SalI, ligated at the BstXI site, and cloned into the HindIII/SalI sites of the pT7–6::rpLL vector. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutated L7/12 genes were cloned into theBamHI/SalI sites of plasmid pGEX-5x-3 (Pharmacia). Mutant L7/12 proteins were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). GlutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins were cleaved by factor Xa (Pharmacia). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was used again to separate glutathione S-transferase from L7/12 protein. The ability of isolated L7/12 protein to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by either EF-Tu or EF-G was studied using the binary complexes EF-Tu·GTP and EF-G·GTP and the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe (Fig.1). Strong stimulation of GTP hydrolysis upon the addition of L7/12 was observed only with EF-G, whereas practically no GTPase activity was found with either EF-Tu complex. The time course of GTP hydrolysis in the presence of catalytic amounts of EF-G shows a linear increase in the concentration of liberated Pi that significantly exceeds the concentration of the factor (Fig. 2), suggesting multiple turnover of EF-G during the reaction. No initial burst of GTP hydrolysis was observed. This indicates that the overall rate of reaction is determined by the rate of GTP cleavage, rather than by turnover (see below).Figure 2Time course of EF-G-dependent GTP hydrolysis in the presence (●) or absence (○) of L7/12. EF-G (0.2 μm) was incubated with [γ-32P]GTP (5 μm) in the absence or presence of L7/12 (10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the steady-state kinetic parameters of the L7/12-stimulated GTPase of EF-G, GTP hydrolysis was measured under initial velocity conditions (1 min), in the presence of a catalytic amount of EF-G, with saturating concentrations of GTP as a substrate, and varying concentrations of L7/12. A hyperbolic curve was obtained (Fig. 3) and was fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding a K m for L7/12 of about 40 μm, and the k cat of the stimulated reaction was 0.3 s−1. Whereas this rate is much higher than that observed in the absence of L7/12 (19.Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is about 500 times lower than the rate constant of GTP hydrolysis by EF-G on the ribosome at comparable conditions (170 s−1) (22.Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The addition of the complex of proteins L7/12 with L10 had the same effect as L7/12 alone (data not shown). No GTP hydrolysis was induced on EF-Tu, even at very high concentrations of L7/12 (Fig. 3), although complex formation takes place under these conditions (K d = 10 μm as measured by tryptophan fluorescence of EF-Tu; data not shown). The enhancement by L7/12 of turnover GTP hydrolysis by EF-G may be due to the acceleration of either the cleavage of GTP or the exchange of GDP for GTP. To distinguish the two possibilities, the rate constants of nucleotide exchange were measured by stopped-flow using fluorescent derivatives of GDP and GTP, mant-GDP and mant-GTP. Upon binding to EF-G, the fluorescence of mant-GDP increases by about 10% (Fig.4 A). To determine the rate constants of nucleotide binding to EF-G and dissociation from EF-G, time courses were measured at different concentrations of EF-G, and the apparent rate constants were determined by exponential fitting. From the slope of the linear dependence of the apparent rate constant upon EF-G concentration (Fig. 4 B), the bimolecular association rate constant k 1 was calculated to be 2 ± 1 μm−1 s−1 for mant-GDP; from the ordinate intercept, the dissociation rate constantk −1 was determined to be 23 ± 4 s−1. With mant-GTP, the increase of fluorescence upon binding to EF-G was about 50% (Fig.5 A). From the concentration dependence of the apparent rate constant (Fig. 5 B), values of k 1 = 1.2 ± 0.7 μm−1 s−1 andk −1 = 7±2 s−1 were determined. From these values, we derived equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) of 12 ± 6 and 6 ± 3 μm, in good agreement with the respective values measured by equilibrium titrations (data not shown). The rate constants reported above suggest that under the conditions of the GTP hydrolysis experiments (Fig. 3), both the dissociation of EF-G·GDP (about 20 s−1) and the binding of GTP to EF-G (about 6 s−1 ) (at 5 μm GTP) are much faster than the turnover rate of GTP hydrolysis (0.3 s−1) measured in the presence of L7/12. Hence the stimulation by L7/12 of the turnover GTP hydrolysis by EF-G must be due to the acceleration of the GTP cleavage step. The concentrations of GDP and GTP in the cell are about 100 and 900 μm, respectively (38.Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar). With association rate constants in the range of 1–2 μm−1 s−1, the binding of GDP and GTP in the cell is expected to be very rapid, 100–1000 s−1, suggesting that the rate of nucleotide exchange in vivo is limited by the dissociation of EF-G·GDP. The rate constant determined for that step, about 20 s−1, is compatible with the overall rate of translation (4–20 s−1) (39.Sorensen M.A. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of L7/12 proteins from many different species revealed a unique, highly conserved arginine (R74 inE. coli) in the C-terminal domain. Due to the flexible hinge region of L7/12, the C-terminal domain is probably mobile enough to position the arginine into the catalytic center of the elongation factors. It was suggestive, therefore, to assume that L7/12 functions similarly to RasGAP and RhoGAP, namely, by providing a catalytic arginine in trans to the catalytic center of the elongation factors. To test this hypothesis, R74 in E. coli L7/12 was replaced with lysine or methionine. The stimulation of GTPase activity of EF-G was studied at an intermediate (10 μm) concentration of wild-type or mutant L7/12, to be able to observe changes in either the K m ork cat of the reaction. Neither mutation significantly affected the stimulatory effect (Fig.6), suggesting that the arginine at position 74 of L7/12 is not essential for the effect. Our data show that the GTPase activity of EF-G is strongly stimulated by the ribosomal protein L7/12. This effect was not detected previously (40.Donner D. Villems R. Liljas A. Kurland C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3192-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), most likely because the concentration of L7/12 in those experiments (1–2 μm) was too low compared with theK m of the interaction (40 μm, this study). No stimulation by L7/12 of the GTPase activity of EF-Tu was found, in agreement with an earlier report (41.Sander G. Ivell R. Crechet J.B. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); thus, our results do not confirm the enhancement by L7/12 of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu reported by Donner et al. (40.Donner D. Villems R. Liljas A. Kurland C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3192-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present result is in keeping with the earlier finding that EF-Tu in the ternary complex is refractory to GTPase stimulation on the ribosome, unless a cognate or near-cognate codon is recognized (20.Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21.Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42.Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 646-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, GTPase activation of EF-Tu appears to be confined to the ribosomal codon recognition complex, and it is probably not possible to mimick that state with EF-Tu, or the ternary complex, free in solution. Although L7/12 strongly stimulates the GTPase of EF-G free in solution, the k cat of GTP hydrolysis on the ribosome is substantially higher. There are several possible reasons for this. First, EF-G·GTP on the ribosome may assume an unknown conformation that is more susceptible to the stimulating interaction. Furthermore, additional contacts with the ribosome may contribute to the stimulation. In fact, in addition to the contact with protein L7/12, contacts of EF-G with the ribosome have been established with two regions of 23 S rRNA. In domain II, the loops around residues 1070 and 1100 were shown to take part in EF-G binding (43.Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 44.Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 45.Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The 1070 region is also the binding site of protein L11 (46.Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 47.Wimberly B. Guymon R. McCutcheon J.P. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1999; 97: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) as well as that of an antibiotic, thiostrepton, that inhibits EF-G function on the ribosome (48.Gale E.F. Cundliffe E. Reynolds P.E. Richmond M.H. Waring M. Antibiotic Inhibitors of Ribosomal Function. Wiley, London1981: 402-457Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect of thiostrepton is restricted to translocation and EF-G turnover, whereas GTPase activation and GTP hydrolysis are not affected (35.Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Matassova N.B. Katunin V.I. Semenkov Y.P. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9586-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no evidence suggesting a direct involvement of the L11 binding site in GTPase activation of EF-G. The second region of 23 S rRNA presumed to interact with EF-G (and EF-Tu) is the α-sarcin stem loop in domain VI (positions 2646–2674), although the dimethyl sulfate footprints indicative of the interaction (A2660 and A2662) were observed only when fusidic acid was present to stabilize the EF-G-ribosome complex (43.Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The isolated α-sarcin stem loop was shown to bind to EF-G in solution (44.Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the EF-G-ribosome complex, the α-sarcin stem is close to position 196 in the G domain of EF-G, which lies just above the GTP binding site, whereas the α-sarcin loop region is in the vicinity of position 650 in domain 5 of the factor (49.Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Whereas the arrangement of EF-G relative to the α-sarcin stem loop would be consistent with an influence on the GTPase site, we did not observe the dimethyl sulfate footprints indicative of the interaction when thiostrepton was present in the complex (35.Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Matassova N.B. Katunin V.I. Semenkov Y.P. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9586-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This suggests that, in the latter complex, EF-G does not interact with the α-sarcin region, whereas the GTPase activity is unaffected. We conclude that the contact of EF-G with the α-sarcin region does not contribute to GTPase activation but is rather a later event in the functional cycle. Our results indicate that the interaction of L7/12 with the G domain of EF-G induces or stabilizes the GTPase transition state conformation of EF-G. On the ribosome, additional contacts appear to augment the interaction with L7/12. Because the unique arginine is not essential for the activation, L7/12 does not function by the “arginine-finger” mechanism used by the GAPs of small GTPases. Instead, it may function by a RGS-type mechanism found for heterotrimeric G proteins. In such a mechanism, L7/12 would be expected to bind to the effector region of the factor and stabilize the active conformation of the catalytic center. Alternatively, the interaction between L7/12 and EF-G may occur at a distance from the nucleotide binding site, as observed for the ARF1-ARFGAP complex (15.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In such a case, ribosomal elements other than L7/12 may be involved in the interaction with the effector region of EF-G.

Many holin genes, including λS and 21 S, have the “dual-start” regulatory motif at the N terminus, suggesting that class I and II holins have the same topology. The primary structure of 21 S strongly suggests a bitopic “helical-hairpin” topology, with N and C termini on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, λ S chimeras with an N-terminal signal sequence show Lep-dependent function, indicating that the N-terminal domain of S requires export. Here the signal sequence chimera is shown to be sensitive to the missense change A52V, which blocks normal S function. Moreover, cysteine-modification studies in isolated membranes using a collection of S variants with single-cysteine substitutions show that the positions in the core of the 3 putative transmembrane domains of λ S are protected. Also, S proteins with single-cysteine substitutions in the predicted cytoplasmic and periplasmic loops are more efficiently labeled in inverted membrane vesicles and whole cells, respectively.

These data constitute direct evidence that the holin Sλ has three transmembrane domains and indicate that class I and class II holins have different topologies, despite regulatory and functional homology. transmembrane helix circular dichroism dithiothreitol 4-acetamido-4′-((iodo-acetyl)amino)stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt inverted membrane vesicles polyacrylamide gel electophoresis Tris-buffered saline N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxy-methyl)ethyl]glycine Host lysis for double-stranded DNA bacteriophages involves active degradation of the host peptidoglycan by enzymes designated as endolysins, or phage-encoded muralytic activities (1.Young R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diverse enzymatic activities fulfill this role in different phages but a common feature is that, despite the fact that their substrate is outside the cytoplasmic membrane, endolysins have neither a secretory signal sequence nor a specialized secretory system. Instead, endolysins require the function of a membrane protein called a holin to exit the cytosol and gain access to the cell wall. Active endolysin accumulates in the cytosol during the vegetative cycle until, at a genetically programmed time, the holin proteins somehow permeabilize the membrane and allow escape of the endolysin. Holins thus control the timing of host lysis and the progeny yield of the infective cycle. Nothing is known about the nature of the “hole,” the membrane lesion produced by the holin, except that it is apparently nonspecific in that different holins can function with different endolysins.Many holin genes have been identified and most, by inspection of their predicted primary structure, can be grouped into two classes. Class I holins, the prototype for which is λ S, are typically 90 to 125 amino acid residues in length and have three hydrophobic domains which could serve as integral transmembrane helices (TM)1 (Fig.1 A) (2.Young R. Bläsi U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3.Smith D.L. Purification and Biochemical Characterization of the Bacteriophage λ Holin. Texas A&M University, College Station, TX1998Google Scholar). In most cases of class I holins, all three potential TMs have residues with charged or hydrophilic side chains. Class II holins, the founding member of which is the phage 21 S21 protein (4.Bonovich M.T. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are typically 65 to 85 residues in length and have two hydrophobic TMs, generally lacking in charged or hydrophilic residues (Fig. 1 A). A feature common to both classes of holins is the highly charged C-terminal domain, generally rich in basic residues, which has been shown to be non-essential in λ S (5.Bläsi U. Fraisl P. Chang C.-Y. Zhang N. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Class I and II holin genes complement and appear to be wholly interchangeable, irrespective of the nature of the endolysin (2.Young R. Bläsi U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Holin function terminates the infective cycle and thus it is not surprising that it is subject to sophisticated regulation, which has been extensively studied for the λ holin. Lysis normally occurs 50 min after induction of a λ lysogen, but missense mutants of λS are known which exhibit lysis times from 19 min to greater than 2 h (6.Raab R. Neal G. Garrett J. Grimaila R. Fusselman R. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Johnson-Boaz R. Chang C.-Y. Young R. Molec. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, lysis can be triggered prematurely by addition of an energy poison, like cyanide, to the medium (8.Reader R.W. Siminovitch L. Virology. 1971; 43: 607-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal charged domain of λ S causes more rapid onset of lysis, whereas replacement of the normal sequence with a heterologous sequence with more positive charge retards lysis (5.Bläsi U. Fraisl P. Chang C.-Y. Zhang N. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of the S gene, and other holin genes, is the “dual start motif”; i.e. two translational start codons, at positions 1 and 3 (Fig. 1 A), which give rise to two products, called S107 and S105 (9.Raab R. Neal G. Sohaskey C. Smith J. Young R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10.Bläsi U. Nam K. Hartz D. Gold L. Young R.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with opposing functions. That is, S105 acts as the lethal holin, while S107 acts as an inhibitor of S105 (1.Young R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Raab R. Neal G. Sohaskey C. Smith J. Young R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Bläsi U.

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Within certain ranges, the proportion of S107 and S105, which is determined by an RNA stem-loop structure overlapping the translational initiation region (9.Raab R. Neal G. Sohaskey C. Smith J. Young R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10.Bläsi U. Nam K. Hartz D. Gold L. Young R.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and which is normally 1:2, is an important determinant of the lysis “clock” (13.Chang C.-Y. Nam K. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3283-3294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). The operative difference between S107 and S105 is the positively charged residue at position 2; replacement of this residue with a neutral or acidic residue ablates inhibitor function and converts S107 into a lethal holin (11.Bläsi U. Chang C.-Y. Zagotta M.T. Nam K. Young R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Structural information is limited and restricted to λ S, which in the detergent octyl glucoside has a CD spectrum consistent with approximately 40% α-helical structure (14.Smith D.L. Struck D.K. Scholtz J.M. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The topology of S is as yet undefined. The C terminus has been shown to be cytoplasmic, by the criterion of protease sensitivity and resistance in inverted membrane vesicles (IMV) and spheroplasts, respectively (5.Bläsi U. Fraisl P. Chang C.-Y. Zhang N. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD analysis of detergent-solubilized S indicates that about 40–45 residues are in helical conformation, suggesting two TM helices, assuming the detergent environment preserves the secondary structure (14.Smith D.L. Struck D.K. Scholtz J.M. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distal hydrophobic domain (residues 65–83) has a proportion of hydroxylated residues which would be unusual for a TM domain. These data suggested a model with hydrophobic domains 1 and 2 acting as TM domains (Fig. 1 C, model 3). However, gene fusion studies in which a secretory signal sequence was fused to S indicated that the N terminus must be externalized for lysis to occur, suggesting a topology with 3 TM domains (Fig. 1 C, model 5) (15.Graschopf A. Bläsi U. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the topology of S21 is to be evident from inspection of the primary structure, with the two uniformly hydrophobic domains of the right length for TM helices and the C terminus rich in basic residues, strongly suggesting a “C-inside, N-inside” orientation (Fig.1 C, model 4).Recently, it has been demonstrated that S 21 has a dual start motif functionally homologous to S, giving rise to two S21 protein products of 71 (S2171) and 68 (S2168) amino acids that function as inhibitor and effector, respectively (16.Barenboim M. Chang C.-Y. dib Hajj F. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Phylogenetic analysis shows that many holin genes, of both classes, appear to have a dual start motif. Thus the simplest expectation is that the dual start motif in class I and II holins should function from the same side of the membrane, a notion which would support models with two TM domains for λ S (Fig. 1, model 3).Here we report a cysteine-scanning analysis of the S gene, which has only a single-Cys codon in the parental allele (Fig.1 A). The properties of the mutant alleles are examined and the accessibility of the Cys residues of the membrane-embedded protein products is determined by chemical modification. The results allow an unambiguous determination of the membrane topology of λ S, and by extension, all class I holins. Host lysis for double-stranded DNA bacteriophages involves active degradation of the host peptidoglycan by enzymes designated as endolysins, or phage-encoded muralytic activities (1.Young R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In native tissues only Gi/o-coupled receptors, and not Gs-coupled receptors, activate these channels, and yet both should liberate free G protein βγ upon receptor stimulation. Receptor selectivity does not lie at the level of the G protein βγ dimer since a variety of different βγ subunit combinations have been shown to be similarly effective at potentiating these currents (28.Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In this study we have used a mammalian expression system (HEK293 cells) to investigate the neuronal-type Kir3.1+3.2A channels and their modulation by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors. We have demonstrated the activation of Kir3.1+3.2A channels by Gβγ and by agonist stimulation of Gi/o-coupled receptors but not by Gs-coupled receptors. We present evidence to suggest a key role for the Gα subunit in determining the specificity of coupling between receptor and channel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and TransfectionHEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (stocks: 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin), at 37 °C in humidified 95% O2, 5% CO2. A lipid-based transfection procedure was used (LipofectAMINE; Life Technologies, Inc.) and monoclonal cell lines established by picking single colonies of cells following transfection and growth under selective pressure. For the channel-expressing HKIR3.1/3.2 line, 727 μg of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used and for channel+receptor-expressing lines, we used a dual selection strategy with 727 μg of G418 and 364 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). For transient expression of receptors, G proteins, and other components, cells were co-transfected with cDNA (100–150 ng) encoding the humanized, red-shifted variant of jellyfish green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N1; CLONTECH) and cells visualized using a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescent microscope.Molecular BiologyStandard molecular cloning and mutagenesis techniques were employed throughout. All G protein-coupled receptors and G protein subunits, mutants, and chimeras were cloned into pcDNA1, pcDNA3, or pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). All cDNAs were sequenced to confirm their identity. For the expression of Kir3.1+3.2A, a bicistronic vector was engineered that enabled both subunits to be expressed in the same vector. This vector contained two restriction enzyme polylinkers around a picornavirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An IRES-containing plasmid (pIRES1hyg) was obtained fromCLONTECH, and the IRES element was amplified using PCR with oligonucleotides containing additional restriction enzyme sites inserted at the 5′ and 3′ ends using PCR. This fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3. The channel subunits were then subcloned into the newly engineered pcDNA3 and a stable HEK293 cell line established (HKIR3.1/3.2). For some experiments, we made stable cell lines that expressed both channel and receptor. In these instances, receptors (in pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)) were transfected into the stable Kir3.1+3.2A line and selected for using a dual selection strategy. Point mutants of Gαi1 (C351G and C351I) were made as in Ref. 29.Bahia D.S. Wise A. Fanelli F. Lee M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11555-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. COOH-terminal chimeras between Gαi1 and Gαs were made using a PCR-based approach with a high fidelity DNA polymerase (Vent; New England Biolabs) and 18–25 cycles. To replace the COOH-terminal 6 amino acids, a single round of PCR was used and appropriate 5′ and 3′ restriction enzyme sites added. For the chimeras where the COOH-terminal 13, 16, and 20 amino acids of Gαi1 were replaced with Gαs, two rounds of PCR were employed. The first round replaced the COOH-terminal 10, 13, and 17 amino acids, respectively, of Gαi1 with those of Gαs, and appropriate 5′ restriction enzyme sites while the second round added the remaining 3 amino acids, stop codon, and 3′ restriction enzyme sites.BiochemistryWestern BlottingSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed using a Bio-Rad minigel system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested into phosphate-buffered saline and total cell homogenate lysed with an equal volume of 2× gel loading buffer and probed with a primary polyclonal rabbit antibody to Gαs (Santa Cruz) and the appropriate secondary antibody before visualization of bands using the ECL Western blot analysis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Adenylate Cyclase AssayFor the measurement of A2A and β1 receptor-mediated accumulation of cAMP, the cell lines HKIR3.1/3.2/A2A and HKIR3.1/3.2/B1 were grown to 20% confluence in six-well dishes. Cells were pre-labeled with 5 μCi of [3H]adenine/well (in minimum essential medium) overnight at 37 °C and then incubated with adenosine deaminase (1 unit; for A2A receptors only) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro20–1724 (100 μm) in serum-free medium, for 30 min at 37 °C. Agonist (1 μm NECA for A2A; 10 μm isoprenaline for β1) was then added and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Medium was then aspirated and cells washed with serum-free medium. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2.5% perchloric acid and 0.1 mm cAMP at 4 °C. [3H]cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography using Dowex 50-alumina columns. Each fraction was collected in a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of Ultima Gold MV scintillant (Packard). A Beckman LS6000TA liquid scintillation counter was used to count radioactivity. Reactions were done in triplicate, and data are expressed as percentage conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP.Radioligand BindingCells were washed and harvested into binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) in the presence of protease inhibitors. They were then hypotonically shocked (10 mm Tris-HCl) and put on ice for 15 min, after which time an equal volume of 500 mmsucrose plus 10 mm Tris-HCl was added to restore tonicity. Cells were homogenized using a glass-on-glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was spun at 4 °C and the cell pellet resuspended in binding buffer. Specific binding was assessed using the radioligands [3H]DPCPX (A1) and [3H]CGS21680 (A2A) and nonspecific binding determined in the presence of non-labeled R-PIA. Binding reactions were incubated for at least 2 h at room temperature before the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Bound ligand was separated from non-bound ligand by vacuum filtration onto Whatman GF-B filters, which were then washed four times with 2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Points were determined in triplicate, and data were pooled. Binding data were fitted using non-linear regression to a saturation binding isotherm.ElectrophysiologyMembrane currents were recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (30.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflüg. Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes were pulled from filamented borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical) and had a resistance of 1.5–2.5 megohms when filled with pipette solution (see below). Prior to filling, the tips of patch pipettes were coated with a Parafilm/mineral oil suspension. Records were were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz, and data acquired and analyzed using a Digidata 1200B interface (Axon Instruments) and the pClamp suite of software (version 6.0; Axon Instruments). Cell capacitance was approximately 15 pF, and series resistance (<10 megohms) was at least 75% compensated. Recordings of membrane current were commenced after an equilibration period of approximately 5 min. Currents were measured at the end of each voltage step. All data are presented as mean ± S.E., and current densities are measured at −100 mV (unless otherwise stated). Student's t tests were performed to examine statistical significance, and * indicates p ≤ 0.05.Materials and DrugsSolutions were as follows (concentrations in mm): pipette solution, 107 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP (pH 7.2); bath solution, 140 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). All materials for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and Invitrogen. Radioligands were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and antibodies from Santa Cruz. Molecular biology reagents were obtained from New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All chemicals were from Sigma, Calbiochem, or RBI. Oligonucleotides were from Genosys Biotechnologies. Drugs were made up as concentrated stock solutions and kept at −20 °C or −80 °C. G protein-gated, inwardly rectifying K+ channels were first identified in atrial myocytes where they were shown to be activated by acetylcholine at muscarinic m2 receptors (1.Noma A. Trautwein W. Pflügers Arch. 1978; 377: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and stimulation of this current is responsible for slowing of the heart rate in response to vagal nerve stimulation. It was subsequently shown that this activation was sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTx),1 implicating the family of Gi/o proteins (2.Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G.

It is now apparent that G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ currents are present in many neuronal cell types, and they are involved in the postsynaptic inhibitory effects of stimulating Gi/o-coupled receptors such as GABAB and adenosine A1 (5.Lüscher C.

The channel is a heteromultimer of members of the inwardly rectifying Kir3.x family of potassium channels. Co-expression of Kir3.1 with Kir3.2, Kir3.3, or Kir3.4 results in currents that show many of the basic characteristics of the native channels in neurons and atria (11.Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M.

Yoshimoto Y. Horio Y. Morishige K.-I. Hibino H. Matsumoto S. Tokunaga Y. Maeda T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Tolaini M. Corbella P. Mamalaki C. Parrington J. Fox M. Miliou A. Jones M. Kioussis D. Science. 1996; 271: 1123-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 10.Milot E. Strouboulis J. Trimborn T.

Insulator elements associated with the 5′ end of the chicken β globin locus (11.Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G.

Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Some insulators can confer position-independent expression on a transgene when juxtaposed between the gene and the flanking sequences of the integration site (11.Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 14.Kellum R. Schedl P. Cell. 1991; 64: 941-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 17.Kellum R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and are thought to participate in the definition of the boundaries that define chromatin domains. The human genome contains ∼500,000 copies of an Alu sequence, which is a 281-bp short interspersed nucleotide repeat (19.Britten R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6148-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alu elements are found in primates and are grouped into several sequence families depending on the time of their insertion by retrotransposition (20.Robinson S.I. Nelkin B.D. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1982; 28: 99-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similar but evolutionarily distinct repetitive elements called B1 repeats are found in rodents. Most Alu and B1 elements contain functional RNA polymerase III (PolIII) promoters, as assayed byin vitro transcription. However, Alu transcripts are not as abundant in vivo as expected from their numbers in the genome, possibly because of specific repression by chromatin (21.Englander E.W. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10091-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Alu repeats can also contain enhancer or silencer elements in sequences surrounding the PolIII promoters (22.Britten R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9374-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23.Piedrafita F.J. Molander R.B. Vansant G. Orlova E.A. Pfahl M. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14412-14420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, evidence of a regulatory function for Alus in vivo is limited (24.Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,25.Wu J. Grindlay G.J. Bushel P. Mendelsohn L. Allan M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the 2.5- and 3.5-kb regions, which flank the human keratin-18 (K18) gene conferred position-independent expression on K18 and two heterologous reporter genes in transgenic mice (24.Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26.Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2214-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,27.Neznanov N. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Oshima R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Inactivation of an Alu promoter in the 5′-flanking region of the K18 gene suggested that transcription of this Alu element (Alu2) was involved in moderating position effects on the K18 gene (24.Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the subsequent discovery of the Lazarus regulatory element within the K18 5′-flanking region with both enhancer and cryptic promoter activity (28.Rhodes K. Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26534-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) complicated the evaluation of the regions of the K18 gene responsible for the cis-acting protective effects. Here, we show that the Alu2 fragment, without the Lazarus element, is sufficient to moderate position effects in transgenic mice. This activity is correlated with its PolIII transcriptional potential and the ability to inhibit potential transcriptional interference from a neighboring transcription unit. Recombinant constructs were prepared by standard techniques (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The metallothionein promoter-driven human growth hormone transgene (BSMtGH) was described previously (27.Neznanov N. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Oshima R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For plasmids nx and 2nx, theNsiI-XhoI fragment (bp 1457–2282) of the K18 gene (GenBankTM accession number AF179904), was inserted at the filled NotI and EcoRV sites of BSMtGH. Plasmids nxdB and 2nxdB were prepared by the same procedure but using the NsiI-XhoI K18 fragment excised from BSdBNX (24.Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Plasmid nx3′ was prepared by inserting a 3.6-kb fragment of K18 (bp 6457–1086) into the EcoRV site of plasmid nx. For plasmid 2int3, a 780-bp PvuII-ScaI fragment from intron3 of K18 (bp 4249–5035) was inserted at both the filled-inNotI and the EcoRV sites of BSMtGH. For the Alu2 plasmid (see Fig. 1), the sense primer, GCCCTCTAGACCCGCACACCACCAGACC, and the antisense primer, CCGGTCTAGAGGCGAGTTTGAAATTTGGGAG, were used to amplify by PCR nucleotides 1878–2200 of the K18 gene. The PCR products representing the Alu2, Alu4 (AF179904: bp 7723–8287), and Alu6 (bp 8871–9341) were inserted at the filled NotI site and theEcoRV site of BSMtGH. The MtAP transgene contains the metallothionein promoter (X15128, bp 255–601) fused through blunt BamHI and EcoRI sites to the human placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA (30.Millan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3112-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (M14169, bp 174–1782) and through a KpnI site to the noncoding, 3′ end of the last exon of the K18 gene (AF179904, bp 6263–6462). PCR-amplified Alu2 and a shorter Alu4 (K18, bp 7902–8185) were inserted through flanking NotI or XbaI sites using PCR primer coded restriction sites. The Alu2/4 hybrid (K18, bp 2220–2112 and 7989–8186) and Alu4/2 hybrid (K18, bp 7902–7987 and 2111–1878) were generated by PCR using Pfu thermostable polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla) and internal hybrid primers. The products were amplified with primer incorporated XbaI,NotI, and XhoI sites to facilitate directional cloning. All amplified fragments and junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. The SV40 enhancer block vector consists of the SV40 enhancer from pSV2neo (U02434, bp 3204–3460) flanked by unique BamHI andEcoRI sites. A promoter fragment of the K18 gene (AF179904, bp 2424–2556) (31.Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) drives the neomycin resistance (neo) gene and 3′ processing sequences derived from the pCIN4 vector (32.Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The mouse c-Fos promoter (J00370, bp 86–175) derived from d56fos-luciferase (33.Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Yang B.-S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) drives the puromycinN-acetyltransferase (puro) gene and 3′ processing sequences derived from PGK-puromycin plasmid (a gift of M. McBurney, Ottawa, CA). A second enhancer block vector utilizes the K18 first intron enhancer (AF179904, bp 3297–3398) in place of the SV40 enhancer. Alu elements derived from the K18 gene by PCR were cloned into the unique BamHI and EcoRI sites. Similarly, control λ phage DNA (J03459, bp 27088–27384) was amplified by PCR with appropriate restriction sites incorporated into the primers. The 480-bp mouse satellite sequence was a generous gift from B. A. Hamkalo (University of California, Irvine). It contained two copies of the mouse α-satellite sequence and was purified after digestion of the plasmid C59-BSAT with EcoRI and BamHI (35.Radic M.Z. Lundgren K. Hamkalo B.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The K18neo3 transcriptional interference vector contains a deletion of the K18 gene (AF179904, bp 1377–2282) to eliminate potential complications of recombination. The K18 3′-flanking sequence downstream from the BamHI site at bp 6514 was removed and replaced with an oligo nucleotide contain a unique XbaI site andEcoRI site. The XhoI/SalIneo gene cassette from pMC1 neo (36.Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar) was cloned into the blunt ended EcoRI site. Fragments of the K18 gene and its 3′-flanking sequence were inserted into the uniqueXbaI site. The fragments are NX, bp 1377–228; N-Alu, bp 1447–1883; Alu-2, 1878–2220; and Alu-L, 1878–2283. The K18 3′-flanking sequences are 3A, bp 6515–7903; 3B, bp 7904–9089; and 3C, bp 9090–10091. Transgenic mice were produced in the Burnham Institute Mouse Molecular Genetics Shared Service as described previously (37.Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transgene fragments were prepared by digestion withNotI and XhoI, agarose gel electrophoresis, and ion exchange resin or silica based purification. Mice were screened by dot-blots of tail DNA on Zeta probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridization with the hGH exon 5 probe (M13438, bp 1858–2232) or by PCR with the primers: GTCACCCGGGATCCCAAG and CCTCTTGAAGCCAGGGCAG. To detect deletions, DNA was digested with XbaI, and blots were hybridized with the hGH, nx (K18 nucleotides 1457–2282), or Alu2 (K18 nucleotides 1878–2200) probes. To determine transgene copy number, XbaI-digested DNAs were compared by Southern blotting to a series of plasmid standards (MtGH/HindIII), diluted in nontransgenic mouse DNA. Signals were analyzed on a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). To confirm that equal amounts of DNA were loaded in each lane, the blots or replicate blots were rehybridized with a cDNA probe complementary to the mouse metallothionein-1 (Mt-1) gene. MtAP transgenes were analyzed by Southern blot after hybridization with theNotI/BamHI and BamHI/PstI fragments specific for the Mt-1 promoter and AP DNA, respectively. The K18 exon 7 PCR product (bp 6243–6462) and the Alu2 PCR product were labeled by either the random primer method with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase or by PCR with only one primer and radioactive dCTP withTaq polymerase. PCR analysis of the terminal Alu fragments of A2 and A2/4 transgenic mice was performed with the Alu2 primer and an Mt-1 promoter primer (X151128, bp 498–517). After 4.5 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min were performed, and the products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was isolated from tissues using commercial acidic-phenol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase protection analysis was performed as described previously (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 38.Willoughby D.A. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 118: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39.Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Each hybridization experiment included a dilution series of synthetic hGH and Mt-1 standard RNA in yeast total RNA. After correction for the length of protected probe fragments, the amount of hGH and Mt RNA were determined by comparison to the standard curve. Extracts were prepared from frozen tissues and assayed by a chemiluminescent assay as described (40.O'Connor K.L. Culp L.A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 502-509PubMed Google Scholar). A standard curve of placental alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, catalog number P1391), diluted in extract from nontransgenic tissue extract was used to standardize all assays. Each value represents the average of duplicate assays in the linear range of standard curve converted to pg of standard AP/μg of total protein. Mouse HR9 parietal endodermal cells were transfected with a single plasmid by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. RNA was prepared and analyzed by RNase protection as described previously (39.Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Quantitation of radioactivity was performed with a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. Two or more dishes of HR9 mouse parietal endodermal cells containing 1.5 million cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA/dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After overnight incubation with the precipitate, the cells were washed, dissociated, pooled, and replated at 0.5–1 million cells/9 cm dish for puromycin selection and at 10,000–100,000 cells/dish for G418 selection. After 24 h, either 1 μg/ml puromycin or 400 μg/ml G418 was added to the dishes. The medium was changed once to remove dead cells, and resulting colonies were fixed in methanol and stained with crystal violet after 7 days for G418 selection and 12–14 days for puromycin selection. Triplicate dishes for each condition were counted. Plasmid templates (400 ng) were combined with HeLa cell S100 extract and transcribed as described (41.Dingermann T.S. Sharp S. Appel B. DeFranco D. Mount S. Heiermann R. Pongs O. Soll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except for the inclusion of 20 units of RNase Block (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 45 μCi of [32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) in each reaction. The reactions were digested with 50 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 15 min at 37 °C. Transcripts were purified by digestion with 400 μg/ml protease K at 55 °C for 15 m in the presence of 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.08% SDS, followed by extraction with (25:24:1) phenol:cloroform:isoamyl alcohol and spin chromatography on a Sephadex-G50 column. Transcripts were recovered by precipitation with 10 μg of carrier RNA, 3.25 m ammonium acetate, and 3.5 volumes ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading buffer, heat denatured, and separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 5% acrylamide gel. To identify smaller regions of the flanking sequences of the K18 gene responsible for facilitating transgene expression, transgenic mice were generated with a reporter gene composed of a mouse metallothionein enhancer-promoter and the human growth hormone gene (MtGH) (42.Palmiter R.D. Norstedt G. Gelinas R.E. Hammer R.E. Brinster R.L. Science. 1983; 222: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) flanked by sequences from the K18 gene (Fig.1). Southern blotting ofNsiI-digested DNA from 2nxdB mice (Fig.2 B) showed a weak band of ∼4500 bp (fragment 1) and a predominant band of ∼3700 bp (fragment 5) that corresponded to head to tail repeats of the full-length and partially deleted transgenes, respectively (Fig. 2 A). The ∼800-bp deletion corresponded to the loss of one of the two nx repeats between each MtGH cassette (Fig. 2 A). This was confirmed by Southern blotting of XbaI-cut DNA with a probe for the K18 nx sequence (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3), which revealed that most MtGH cassettes were separated by ∼900 bp (fragment 6) rather than ∼1700 bp (fragment 2) of DNA. Southern blotting of liver DNA from 2nx, and 2int3 mice (data not shown) indicated that whenever directly repeated sequences flanked the MtGH cassette one of the two flanking elements was deleted within the integrated transgene arrays. Constructs Alu2, Alu4, and Alu6 also contained two copies of the test sequence but in inverted orientations (Fig. 1). Southern blotting ofNsiI-digested liver DNA showed a mixture of head-tail and head-head transgene arrays in most Alu2 mice harboring multiple copies of the transgene (Fig. 3,A and B, lanes 1–6, fragments 1 and 4). Additional unique bands of lesser intensity likely corresponded to partially deleted transgenes or the junctions between terminal transgenes and flanking genomic DNA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6). Similar results were obtained with liver DNA fromAlu4 and Alu6 mice (data not shown).NsiI-cut liver DNA from mouse 6 showed two unique fragments of greater than unit length (Fig. 3 B, lane 4), suggesting either two separate integration sites or a second partial copy of the transgene. XbaI-cut liver DNA from Alu2 mice revealed that the hGH cassettes were largely intact (Fig. 3, A andB, lanes 8–13). An Alu2 probe detected a ∼750-bp fragment (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2–7, fragment 3), consistent with two copies of the Alu2 sequence between each MtGH cassette in multicopy transgene arrays. Mouse 5 and 6 had integrated one or fewer transgene copies (TableI).Table IhGH and Mt-1 RNA in transgenic miceMouseTG′CopyHeartBrainIntestineLiverGHMt-1GHMt-1GHMt-1GHMt-11nx3′0.60.413.60.219.70.413.40.562.82nx3′4.38.119.410.616.910.739.019.17.03nx3′14.1213.132.253.621.5305.048.3323.726.84nx3′115.1425.636.5110.725.5158.875.21389.062.15Alu20.70.412.35.120.10.48.00.542.96Alu20.92.79.40.817.50.213.31.011.77Alu21.875.919.817.424.857.545.6112.815.98Alu22.017.320.911.621.50.410.81.928.59Alu25.1136.931.025.623.112.518.4212.314.610Alu25.560.519.423.220.2115.933.927.611.011Alu41.00.415.44.037.60.425.92.051.212Alu48.413.816.17.337.40.422.10.47.313Alu60.30.825.71.338.70.441.20.393.114Alu610.446.60.444.90.445.10.4121.515Alu62.82.118.06.935.90.437.11.518.916Alu610.4181.244.422.736.8144.080.1475.5141.317Alu6751.226.50.536.90.532.72.143.2182nx3.072.822.824.121.8166.739.731.326.8192nx4.557.314.910.619.14.020.21.34.820nx6.0114.029.116.431.0126.423.1259.556.221nx6.3288.522.46.634.8394.379.3629.446.1222nx8.931.631.53.332.71.023.10.481.7232nx9.031.026.95.735.02.814.6165.289.0242nx15.14.58.95.222.62.419.432.320.325nx17.85.757.919.166.154.863.5903.9252.7262nx17.8267.719.97.917.7289.561.8676.332.9272nx31.40.46.90.417.40.410.60.43.828nx48.20.411.70.422.20.46.20.421.0292nx65.9239.024.419.424.9487.580.9482.979.6302nx66.70.412.80.418.70.413.40.44.7312nx133.50.410.80.417.60.411.00.41.2322nx257.91.116.010.927.50.528.629.437.733nxdB0.50.37.11.018.00.27.80.710.134nxdB1.83.29.62.217.92.031.410.63.535nxdB2.24.412.02.117.84.226.225.510.336nxdB2.50.411.00.419.80.48.20.45.1372nxdB19.00.49.00.417.90.47.71.174.0382nxdB19.60.434.21.327.40.422.10.427.4392nxdB80.0382.311.613.735.5286.765.9227.3105.2402int31.520.511.51.417.71.214.61.413.4412int31.50.410.50.418.90.47.00.43.3422int35.50.46.90.419.50.49.90.447.8432int314.10.415.02.622.20.423.30.455.6442int335.00.410.50.419.10.46.50.43.7452int354.7259.221.95.226.4598.7105.322.677.3462int3104.1416.744.85.433.429.629.124.1161.9472int3144.40.49.38.419.20.414.00.423.4Values represent attomoles RNA/μg total RNA; italicized bold face numbers represent the lower limit of the standard curve in a particular RNase protection run and are substituted values for samples in which hGH RNA was too low to measure, transgene copy number/cell, assuming 6 pg genomic DNA/cell.

The nx3′ transgene that lacked 1.5 kb of K18 5′-flanking DNA was expressed similarly to the previously tested larger construct (27.Neznanov N. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Oshima R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Table I and Fig.4). The addition of single Alu2 elements to each end of the reporter gene resulted in strong expression, despite a generally low number of integrated copies (Table I). In brain, bothnx3′ and Alu2 resulted in copy number-dependent expression (Fig. 3 A). In contrast the control 2int3 and the Alu4 andAlu6 mice had low expression in brain (Fig. 4 A). In heart, the relationship between hGH RNA, and copy number was less strongly correlated in nx3′ and Alu2 mice and was not evident in other tissues (Table I). The large difference in transgene expression levels between the Alu2,Alu4, and Alu6 mice is of interest because the 281-bp Alu sequence found in all three is at least 85% identical. These results indicated that the 323-bp Alu2 fragment contains a substantial portion of the cis-acting protective activity of the larger K18 flanking sequences. Because of their similar integrated structures, data from the2nx and 2nxdB transgenic mice were grouped with data from the nx and nxdB mice, respectively. Levels of hGH RNA were too low to measure in more than 25% of thenx and nxdB mice (Table I). No relationship between hGH RNA and copy number was observed in either thenx or the nxdB transgenic mice (Table I). However, high expressing lines were more commonly found amongnx mice than 2int3, Alu4,Alu6, or nxdB animals (Fig. 4, B andC). The stimulatory activity of the nx fragment may be due to either the presence of the Alu2 embedded within it and/or the presence of the 100-bp Lazarus regulatory element present immediately downstream of Alu2 in the nx fragment (28.Rhodes K. Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26534-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Comparison of the expression levels of the nx and nxdB transgenes supports the view that the PolIII promoter of the Alu2 may be more important than the Lazarus element for the stimulatory activity of the nx fragment (Fig. 4, B and C). One potentially important difference between nx and Alu2transgenes is the direct repeat orientation of the nx fragments and the inverted repeat orientation of the Alu sequences in Alu2,Alu4, and Alu6 genes. Because high copy number transgenes in Drosophila are targets for heterochromatin formation and subsequent silencing (43.Dorer D.R. Henikoff S. Cell. 1994; 77: 993-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), we considered whether the blocking of the position effect of the Alu2 element was an artifact of the generally low copy numbers of theAlu2 mice. Although the number of samples/group were small, the median expression levels for mice with less than 10 copies of the transgene were still much higher for the Alu2 mice than for the other groups including Alu4, Alu6,nxdB, and int3 mice. Position-independent, copy number dependent expression of a transgene may involve several different activities. Transcriptional interference could inhibit expression of tandem arrays of integrated transgenes. Fragments of the flanking sequences of the K18 gene were tested by transient transfection for activities that might inhibit transcriptional interference. The K18 gene was positioned upstream of a neotranscription unit in one plasmid (Fig.5 A). Fragments of both the K18 3′-flanking sequence and the nx fragment were then inserted between the two genes in both possible orientations, and the transcriptional products of both genes were assessed by RNase protection analysis of transiently transfected cells. Two of three fragments of the 3′-flanking sequences of the K18 gene resulted in increased expression of the downstream neo transcription unit (Fig.5 B). This effect was dependent upon the orientation of the 3A and 3C fragments. Only the orientations opposite to that found in association with the K18 gene were active. This orientation places the potential transcriptional direction of embedded Alu elements in the same orientation as that of the K18 and neo genes. The nx 5′-flanking sequence had a modest effect of increasing theneo gene RNA (Fig. 5). However, the half of the nx fragment that contained the Alu element was as active as the 3C fragment (note scale differences in Fig. 5, B and C), and this activity was also orientation-depe"

GABACreceptors are expressed predominantly in the retina on bipolar cell axon terminals, and are thought to mediate feedback inhibition from GABAergic amacrine cells. Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, we previously identified MAP1B as a binding partner of the GABAC receptor ρ1 subunit. Here we describe the isolation of an additional ρ1 interacting protein: a novel C-terminal variant of the glycine transporter GLYT-1. We show that GLYT-1 exists as four alternatively spliced mRNAs which encode proteins expressing one of two possible intracellullar N- and C-terminal domains. Variants containing the novel C terminus efficiently transport glycine when expressed in COS cells, but with unusual kinetics. We have confirmed the interaction between the novel C terminus and ρ1 subunit and demonstrated binding in heterologous cells.

The synaptic activity of these transmitters is terminated by sodium-dependent transport into neurons or glial cells in the vicinity of the synapse. Two categories of ionotropic GABA receptor are expressed in the central nervous system: GABAA and GABAC receptors (1.MacDonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2.Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 3.Lukasiewicz P.D.

Both are GABA-gated chloride channels, but are classified as different subtypes because of their distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties, as well as expression patterns. GABAA receptors are expressed throughout the central nervous system (1.MacDonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2.Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas GABACreceptors are expressed predominantly in the retina, with lower levels detected in other central nervous system regions (5.Enz R.

Shingai R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GABAC receptors are enriched on bipolar cell axon terminals where they receive GABAergic input from amacrine cells (8.Feigenspan A. Waessle H. Bormann J. Nature. 1993; 361: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 9.Tachibana M. Kaneko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3501-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Activation of these receptors inhibits glutamate release onto retinal ganglion cells (9.Tachibana M. Kaneko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2668-2679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is likely to be important in tuning the temporal resolution and spatial contrast of responses to visual stimuli in the retina (12.Dong C.J. Werblin F.S. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 2171-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GABAC receptors are thought to be formed from ρ subunits which are localized to retinal bipolar cells (13.Enz R. Brandstaetter J.H. Waessle H. Bormann J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ρ Subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes exhibit the same pharmacological and electrophysiological properties as GABAC receptors studied in the retina (8.Feigenspan A. Waessle H. Bormann J. Nature. 1993; 361: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14.Shimada S. Cutting G. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 683-687PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Wang T.-L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6524-6531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three ρ subunits have been cloned, and each forms functional homo-oligomeric receptors when expressed in Xenopusoocytes (12.Dong C.J. Werblin F.S. J.

However, there is pharmacological and biochemical evidence to suggest that ρ1 and ρ2 subunits can also form functional hetero-oligomers (16.Zhang D. Pan Z.-h. Zhang X. Brideau A.D. Lipton S.A. Proc.

In contrast, GABAA receptors are more complex hetero-oligomers, and are formed from α (1.MacDonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Although ligand-gated ion channels expressed in heterologous, non-synaptic systems display essentially native electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, it is becoming increasingly clear that they do not exist simply as isolated macromolecules at synaptic membranes in vivo. Yeast two-hybrid screens using intracellular domains of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits as baits, have isolated various proteins as binding partners for these receptors. These proteins may function to maintain the clustered distribution of the receptor at synaptic sites, or for bringing other important proteins into close proximity for intracellular signaling up- or downstream from the receptor (18.Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 19.Kim J.H. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20.Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1163-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These studies show that the post-synaptic density at excitatory synapses is a complex array of proteins which interact with ionotropic glutamate receptors, either directly or via scaffolding proteins (20.Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1163-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). More recently, similar studies aimed at understanding the architecture of the inhibitory synapse have used the large intracellular loop between transmembrane regions (TM) three and four of ionotropic GABA receptor subunits as yeast two-hybrid baits. These studies have identified a novel tubulin-binding protein, GABARAP, which interacts with the γ2 subunit of GABAA receptors and may function to localize the receptor at synaptic sites (21.Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Similarly, GABAC receptors have been shown to interact with MAP1B, a microtubule-associated protein which can influence the subcellular distribution of the receptor (22.Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To investigate further the identity of GABAC receptor interacting proteins, we have used the ρ1 subunit intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 as a yeast two-hybrid bait for additional screening of a retinal library. Here we report that a novel C-terminal splice variant of the glycine transporter GLYT-1 interacts specifically with the ρ1 subunit bait and show that this interaction occurs in a cellular environment. We describe the tissue distribution and functional characterization of GLYT-1 variants isolated from the retina. Finally, we propose a role for co-localization of these two proteins in the integration of GABA and glycinergic signaling, and the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission at bipolar cell-retinal ganglion cells synapses. This is the first report to demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between a neurotransmitter receptor and a neurotransmitter transporter. Approximately 3 million clones from a bovine retinal cDNA library constructed in the Gal4 activation domain-carrying vector pACTII (CLONTECH) were screened with a bait encoding the intracellular domain of the human ρ1 subunit cloned in the Gal4-DNA-binding domain-carrying vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH), as described previously (22.Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ρ1, ρ2, and GABAA receptor intracellular domain bait plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification of cDNA fragments, followed by in-frame ligation into pAS2–1, as described previously (22.Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out on both strands using SequenceTM Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The insert of “clone 6” isolated from the yeast-two hybrid screen was 32P-labeled and used to screen an adult bovine retinal cDNA library (Stratagene) by hybridization as described by Blondel et al. (23.Blondel O. Bell G.I. Moody M.M. Miller R.J. Gibbons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 27167-27170Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A single clone, designated λC6pA1, was obtained that contained a 1779-bp open reading frame similar to mGLYT-1, followed by 96 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence and a poly(A) tail. To determine if the bovine retina expressed GLYT-1 variants containing the previously characterized C terminus (D, Fig. 2) retinal cDNA using a bovine specific upstream primer located in the core region (GenBank U52689) 5′-CAGCCATTGTGGATGAGGTAG-3′, and a GLYT-1 downstream primer to a region of 3′-untranslated sequence common to human and mouse (GenBank X67056) 5′-TCATATCCGGGAGTCCTGGAA-3′. Amplification was using standard conditions (24.Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. 1st Ed. Academic Press, New York1990Google Scholar) and PCR products were blunt-end cloned into theHincII site of pGEM-4Z (Promega), and sequenced. All clones contained a 667-bp insert encoding the bovine homologue of the mGLYT-1 C terminus. Additional 5′ end sequences were isolated by ligation anchor (LA-) PCR of bovine retinal cDNA as described by Trout et al.(25.Trout A.B. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Pulendran B. Nossal G.J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9823-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), using a bGLYT-1 downstream primer (GenBank U52689) 5′-GCGATGCAGATGACCACGTTGTAGTA-3′, and an upstream primer specific to the anchor sequence. Bovine retinal cDNA was amplified, blunt-end ligated into the HincII site of pGEM-3Z, and sequenced. Sequences were confirmed in two independent LA-PCR experiments. Expression of mRNA encoding GLYT-1 variants in retina, kidney, hypothalamus, or adrenal was examined by RT-PCR using specific primer pairs. These primers amplified a sequence common to all forms of bGLYT-1 (universal primers), or were specific for transcripts containing N termini “A” or “B”, or C termini “D” or “F,” where one primer of a pair used was specific for a terminus, and the other primer used was to sequence in the “core” region (see Fig. 2). The up- and downstream primer sequences (5′ to 3′) and the length of their products (in bp) are: universal (210) CTGTGCCACCAGTGTCTATGCC and CCCAGCAAGATGAGCATGAA; N terminus A (235) TGGACAGGGAGTCCAGAGCC and CGCATGATGAAGTAGGGGAAC; N terminus B (257) GGATGGCGGCGGCTCAGGGA and CGCATGATGAAGTAGGGGAAC; C terminus D (258) TCATGGCTCTGTCCTCTGTCAT and GGCTGGAGCCATTACTGCC; C terminus “F” (262) CTTCCAGGACATCCAGATGATG and GGACACACGGACACTCCAGG. RT-PCR of cytoplasmic β-actin was used as a amplification control. The primers for β-actin were (5′ to 3′) CCAGAGCAAGAGAGGCATCCT and CCAGGTCCAGACGCAGGATG, generating a 357-bp PCR product. Tubes containing 100 pg of the relevant bGLYT-1 expression construct DNA and tubes which did not have DNA added were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. PCR products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate for 14 h. Plates were scanned and analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Full-length expression constructs of GLYT-1 variants were constructed as follows: LA-PCR products containing 80 bp of 5′-untranslated and the N terminus A or B were ligated to the λC6pA1 clone (containing C terminus E) and subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pCB6, to obtain expression constructs GLYT-1E and -1F. Expression constructs GLYT-1A and -1B were constructed by removing part of the core region and C terminus E from bGLYT-1E and -1F, respectively, and replacing them with the corresponding region from PCR product containing C terminus D. COS-7 cells at 50% confluence in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 7 μg of bGLYT-1A, -1B, -1E, or -1F DNA using 30 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four h after transfection cells were collected by trypinsization, plated onto two 100-mm dishes, and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was changed every third day for 2 weeks. Individual G418-resistant colonies were selected and used to establish independent stable cell lines for each variant. Glycine transport activity was measured on cells at passages 2–6. GLYT-1 activity was measured by radioflux assay. Confluent 24-well plates were rinsed twice in choline containing uptake media (150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) at 37 °C prior to experiments. Concentration series experiments were conducted for 15 min with 3000–0.1 μm [3H]glycine in sodium uptake media (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Time experiments were conducted for 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μm [3H]glycine in sodium uptake media. Inhibitor experiments were conducted for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 μm [3H]glycine in sodium uptake media and 1 mm glycine, proline, Sarcosine, MeAIB,l-alanine, or l-cysteine. Ion substitution experiments were conducted for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 μm [3H]glycine and uptake media with equimolar amounts of either choline or n-methylglucamine substituted for sodium, or equimolar amounts of acetate and gluconate substituted for chloride. Wells were incubated for 3 min in ion-substituted or sodium uptake/inhibitor media before the addition of radiolabel. After incubation wells were washed three times with cold choline uptake media and solubilized in 600 μl of 1% SDS. Concentration experiments were run on three cell passages in duplicate or quadruplicate for all other experiments. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad, DC protein kit). Nonspecific [3H]glycine uptake was determined in cells transfected with vector alone and subtracted from the total uptake to yield specific uptake. In vitro overlay assays were performed as described (22.Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were produced by PCR cloning of ρ1 cDNA fragments into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 32P radiolabeling using primers 5′-CGTGGATCCGAGTATGCGGCCGTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCACCTGGAGTATTTATCAAT-3′. GST-clone 6 was produced by excision from pAS2-1 using BamHI and EcoRI, and ligation into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequent purification of GST fusions was carried out as described previously (26.Smith D.B. Johnston K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). 10 μg of GST and GST-clone 6 were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to a guanidine denaturing-renaturing process in overlay buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA). After blocking by incubation in overlay buffer containing milk, the filter was incubated with 32P-labeled GST-ρ1 overnight at 4 °C. After washing, bound 32P-labeled ρ1 was detected by autoradiography. Addition of the myc tag was carried out as described (27.Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. MacDonald B.J. Smart T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), using the mutagenic primer: 5′-GGGCCAGTGCATCAGATCCTCTTCGGAGATCAGTTTCTGCTCTCTGCTTTCAGT-3′. COS cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were grown to 50–70% confluency, and transfected by electroporation. 10 μg of cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression constructs were used per transfection. After electroporation, cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine for immunofluorescence, or on plastic dishes for biochemical analysis, and incubated overnight. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (27.Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. MacDonald B.J. Smart T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) except permeabilization was carried out with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After overnight expression, ρ1Mry-transfected COS cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. The lysate was incubated with 25 μg of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h rotating at 4 °C. After washing four times in lysis buffer, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blotting. This was carried out as described (27.Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. MacDonald B.J. Smart T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Briefly, after overnight expression, transfected COS cells were starved of methionine by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine for 30 min. Labeling was carried out with 0.25 mCi of [35S]methionine/10-cm dish for 4 h. Cells were then lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. The lysate was incubated with protein A conjugated to Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecific binding, followed by incubation with protein A beads plus 5 μg of anti-GLYT-1E/F antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing four times in lysis buffer, the first two washes supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. After overnight expression, co-transfected COS cells were lysed, and treated as described above using 5 μg of anti-GLYT-1E/F, or nonimmune IgG. Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc 9E10. Using the yeast two-hybrid system with the large intracellular domain between TM3 and TM4 of the ρ1 subunit as a bait we screened a bovine retinal cDNA library to identify GABAC receptor interacting proteins. In addition to the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B (22.Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we isolated a novel clone, termed clone 6 (Fig.1 A). To determine if the interaction between clone 6 and ρ1 is specific, or a general feature of ionotropic GABA receptor subunits, we tested clone 6 against intracellular domains from a range of GABA receptor subunits in the yeast two-hybrid system. Fig. 1 B shows that the interaction is specific to the GABAC receptor ρ1 subunit, since no interaction is seen with GABAA receptor subunits nor the GABAC receptor ρ2 subunit. Hybridization screening of an adult bovine retinal cDNA library with a 32P-labeled insert from clone 6 isolated a clone containing a 1779-bp open reading frame, termed λC6pA1. The deduced amino acid (a.a.) sequence of this clone showed 94.9% identity to the mouse glycine transporter mGLYT-1A in a region corresponding to the N-terminal and core regions (28.Liu Q.R. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Lopez C.B. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The C-terminal of λC6pA1, identical in sequence to clone 6, shares only 10% a.a. identity with the mGLYT-1 C terminus. Taken together these data indicate that λC6pA1 is a bovine homolog of GLYT-1 with a novel C terminus (Fig.2). Bovine retinal cDNA clones containing a C terminus homologous to mGLYT-1, 93.1% identity, were obtained by RT-PCR. Since clone λC6pA1 contained only a few bases of 5′-untranslated sequence, we used ligation anchor PCR of bovine retinal cDNA to ensure we had isolated the complete open reading frame. We identified three species of mRNA encoding bGLYT-1 5′ ends, two encoding N terminus A with different 5′-untranslated regions, and one encoding N terminus B. The complexity of bGLYT-1 5′ splice products is similar to that reported for the mouse GLYT-1 (29.Borowsky B. Hoffman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29077-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The bovine N termini are termed A and B, according to the mGLYT-1 nomenclature, and the C termini are termed D and E. Bovine clones homologous to mGLYT-1C, an alternatively spliced N terminus, were not found. Additional PCR experiments using upstream primers specific for either N terminus and downstream primers specific for either C terminus showed the presence of transcripts that give rise to four potential GLYT-1 variants. These variants are termed GLYT-1A and -1B if they contain C-terminal D in conjunction with N-terminal A or B, respectively, or GLYT-1E and -1F if they contain C-terminal E in conjunction with N-terminal A or B, respectively. Thus the intracellular domain of ρ1 subunit can interact with the C-terminal intracellular domain of a novel splice variant of the glycine transporter, termed GLYT-1E/F. The tissue distribution of GLYT-1 mRNAs containing N termini A or B, or C termini D or E was examined by RT-PCR (Fig.3). The overall level of GLYT-1 transcript expression, as determined using primers to the core region, was similar in adrenal, hypothalamus, kidney, and retina (Fig. 3, universal). The expression levels of N-terminal A and C-terminal D containing transcripts were also similar in all tissues. By contrast, N-terminal B containing transcripts were present at higher levels in hypothalamus and retina than adrenal and kidney. Transcripts containing the ρ1-interacting C-terminal E (as determined by the presence of the expected 263-bp band) occurred at highest levels in the hypothalamus, but also at significant levels in the retina and kidney, and was absent in the adrenal. Additional PCR products were obtained with amplification of C-terminal E primers: the sequences of these products were not determined. To demonstrate a direct interaction between the ρ1 intracellular domain and GLYT-1E/F C terminus (clone 6), GST fusion proteins were constructed encoding both of these polypeptides for use in overlay assays in which no other proteins are present. GST-ρ1 was constructed in pGEX-2TK, which has an Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser motif engineered just C-terminal to GST, allowing in vitro labeling of the fusion protein with [γ-32P]ATP by the catalytic subunit of PKA. Gel overlay assays indicated that 32P-labeled GST-ρ1 bound to GST-clone 6, but not to GST alone, demonstrating that ρ1 intracellular domain binds directly to GLYT-1E/F C terminus, and no further factor is required for the interaction (Fig.4). Constructs encoding GLYT-1A, -1B, -1E, and -1F were transfected into COS cells and the kinetic and pharmacological characteristics of glycine uptake measured (Fig.5). Variation in the intracellular N-terminal domain had no significant effect on the kinetic properties of GLYT-1, as demonstrated by the similar properties of GLYT-1A compared with B, and of GLYT-1E compared with F (data not shown). However, variation in the C-terminal domain has a dramatic effect on the kinetic properties of the expressed transporter. GLYT-1B has aK m for glycine of 59 ± 8 μm and a V max of 4.7 ± 0.5 nmol/mg/min. In contrast, GLYT-1F showed complex nonlinear kinetics which cannot be fit using a single Michaelis-Menten equation. A K m could not be reliably estimated for GLYT-1F, yet it had an estimatedV max of 1.8 ± 0.2 nmol/mg/min. The time course of 10 μm [3H]glycine uptake by GLYT-1B was linear for the first 10 min, whereas uptake by GLYT-1F was linear over at least 1 h. The average initial velocity of glycine uptake was 95 ± 10 pmol/mg/min by cells expressing GLYT-1B and 24 ± 4 pmol/mg/min for GLYT-1F. Although variation in the C-terminal of GLYT-1 affects kinetic properties, it does not alter the sodium or chloride ion dependence of glycine uptake by GLYT-1E/F. No specific uptake was detected when sodium was substituted with either choline or NMG, or when chloride was substituted with acetate or gluconate. Nor do the pharmacological properties differ between bGLYT-1 variants. Specific uptake of radiolabeled glycine by all four variants was inhibited 85–90% by unlabeled glycine and sarcosine, whereasl-alanine, GABA, and MeAIB had no effect. These data are consistent with the properties of other GLYT-1 transporters. Proline, reportedly an inhibitor of the human GLYT-1 (25.Trout A.B. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Pulendran B. Nossal G.J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9823-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), has no effect on bovine GLYT-1 variants. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a GST fusion protein of clone 6 (GLYT-1E/F C-terminal intracellular domain) and tested for specificity in a number of assays. COS cells transfected with a construct encoding full-length GLYT-1E were prepared for immunofluorescence and stained with GLYT-1E/F antiserum. Fig.6 A shows some plasma membrane and predominantly endoplasmic reticulum staining in permeablized GLYT-1E transfected cells, but n"

To evaluate the feasibility of gene replacement therapy for GSD-1a, we have infused adenoviral vector containing the murine G6Pase gene (Ad-mG6Pase) into G6Pase-deficient (G6Pase−/−) mice that manifest symptoms characteristic of human GSD-1a. Whereas <15% of G6Pase−/− mice under glucose therapy survived weaning, a 100% survival rate was achieved when G6Pase−/− mice were infused with Ad-mG6Pase, 90% of which lived to 3 months of age. Hepatic G6Pase activity in Ad-mG6Pase-infused mice was restored to 19% of that in G6Pase+/+ mice at 7–14 days post-infusion; the activity persisted for at least 70 days. Ad-mG6Pase infusion also greatly improved growth of G6Pase−/− mice and normalized plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and uric acid profiles. Furthermore, liver and kidney enlargement was less pronounced with near-normal levels of glycogen depositions in both organs. Our data demonstrate that a single administration of a recombinant adenoviral vector can alleviate the pathological manifestations of GSD-1a in mice, suggesting that this disorder in humans can potentially be corrected by gene therapy.

Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 935-965Google Scholar). It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypoglycemia, liver and kidney enlargement, growth retardation, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lactic acidemia (1.Chen Y.-T. Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 935-965Google Scholar). These symptoms are caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), which catalyzes the terminal steps in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by converting Glu-6-P to glucose and phosphate (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). G6Pase, a key enzyme in glucose homeostasis, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-spanning protein with its active site facing the lumen (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Glu-6-P substrate originating in the cytoplasm must be translocated across the ER membrane by the Glu-6-P transporter (G6PT) before hydrolysis can occur (4.Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the biology and pathophysiology of GSD-1a and to develop gene therapy for this disorder, we have generated G6Pase-deficient (G6Pase−/−) mice by gene targeting (5.Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The GSD-1a mice manifest essentially the same clinical and pathological symptoms as human patients. The extensive similarities between homozygous mutant animals and human GSD-1a patients indicate that the G6Pase−/− mouse is a valid animal model for GSD-1a. Using these mice, we have shown that Glu-6-P transport and hydrolysis are tightly coupled events (5.Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Glu-6-P uptake is mediated by the G6PT and that G6Pase activity facilitates Glu-6-P transport into the ER lumen by the G6PT protein (6.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Current treatments of GSD-1a are directed toward controlling symptomatic hypoglycemia (1.Chen Y.-T. Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 935-965Google Scholar). Patients receive continuous nasogastric infusion of glucose (1.Chen Y.-T.

McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 935-965Google Scholar) or frequent oral administration of uncooked cornstarch (1.Chen Y.-T. Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 935-965Google Scholar, 7.Chen Y.-T. Cornblath M. Sidbury J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Both treatments significantly alleviate the metabolic abnormalities of GSD-1a and greatly improve their prognosis. However, the underlying pathological process remains untreated, and as a result, long-term complications develop in adult patients. Moreover, the efficacy of dietary treatment is frequently limited due to poor compliance. One attractive alternative to dietary therapy for GSD-1a is somatic gene therapy, whereby a functional recombinant G6Pase gene is targeted to the affected organ in vivo. Glucose homeostasis is primarily maintained by the balance between glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and to a lesser degree in the kidney, the two organs that primarily express the G6Pase gene (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the hepatocyte is the preferred target for G6Pase gene replacement therapies. Clinical experience supports this assessment. Kidney transplantation into GSD-1a patients, intended to correct renal failure (8.Emmett M. Narins R.G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1978; 239: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9.Chen Y.-T. Scheinman J.I. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1991; 14: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was unsuccessful in alleviating hypoglycemia or hyperlipidemia. On the other hand, liver transplantation into GSD-1a patients has improved growth and corrected hypoglycemia and other biochemical abnormalities associated with the G6Pase deficiency (10.Kirschner B.S. Baker A.L. Thorp F.K. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 238-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,11.Selby R. Starzl T.E. Yunis E. Todo S. Tzakis A.G. Brown B.I. Kendall R.S. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152: S71-S76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the G6Pase−/− mouse model to evaluate the feasibility of using a second-generation recombinant adenovirus (12.Engelhardt J.F. Ye X. Doranz B. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our results indicate that the G6Pase gene can be successfully delivered to the liver, producing a functional G6Pase system that normalizes the metabolic abnormalities associated with GSD-1a and that greatly increases the survival of G6Pase−/− mice. A mouse G6Pase gene-bearing recombinant adenovirus (Ad-mG6Pase) carrying the viralE1-deleted and temperature-sensitive (ts)E2A mutations was generated through homologous recombination in 293 cells between a cotransfected linearized transfer vector (pAv6-mG6Pase) and the large ClaI fragment of the adenoviral Ad5-ts125 genome (tsE2A) (12.Engelhardt J.F.

Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 719-731Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) contained the entire coding region (nucleotides 12–1814) of the murine G6Pase cDNA (15.Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21482-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Ad-mG6Pase was grown and purified by CsCl density ultracentrifugation as described (14.Mittereder N. Yei S. Bachurski C. Cuppoletti J. Whitsett J.A. Tolstoshev P. Trapnell B.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 719-731Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All animal studies were conducted under an animal protocol approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee. Starting within postnatal day 1, glucose therapy consisting of intraperitoneal injection of 25–100 μl of 10% glucose every 8 h was administered to the G6Pase−/−mice. Mice that passed weaning were given glucose injections and unrestricted access to water containing polycose (5%) and mouse chow (Zeigler Bros., Inc., Gardners, PA) containing primarily ground corn, ground wheat, soybean meal, wheat middlings, vitamins, and minerals. Fourteen-day-old G6Pase−/− mice (5.Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were infused with 0.1 ml of Ad-mG6Pase containing 2 × 109 plaque-forming units via the retro-orbital vein. As controls, we used G6Pase−/− mice that received buffer alone and wild-type (G6Pase+/+) and heterozygous (G6Pase+/−) littermates. Glucose therapy was terminated immediately in Ad-mG6Pase-infused G6Pase−/−mice, and the weaning mice were given mouse chow ad libitum. Microsomal preparations and phosphohydrolase assays were performed as described (6.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of microsomal proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mmGlu-6-P, and 2 mm EDTA. Sample absorbance was determined at 820 nm and is related to the amount of phosphate released using a standard curve constructed with a stock of inorganic phosphate solution. Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact membranes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Enzyme histochemistry of G6Pase (16.Teutsch H.F. Graumann W. Lojda Z. Pearse A.G.E. Schlebler T.H. Progress in Histochemistry and Cytochemistry: Chemomorphology of Liver Paraenchyma. 14. Gustav Fisher Verlag, Stuttgart1981: 2.2.2Google Scholar) was carried out by incubating liver sections (10 μm) for 10 min at room temperature in a solution containing 40 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.5, 10 mmGlu-6-P, 300 mm sucrose, and 3.6 mm lead nitrate. The trapped lead phosphate was visualized following conversion to the brown-colored lead sulfide. Glu-6-P uptake measurements were performed as described previously (6.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.2 mm[U-14C]Glu-6-P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by filtering immediately through a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schüll) and washed with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose. Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate, which abolished Glu-6-P uptake, were used as negative controls. Mouse plasma samples were collected by orbital bleeding using a heparinized Pasteur pipette (Baxter Healthcare Co.) and transferred to a fluoride oxalate-treated capillary blood-collecting tube (Terumo Medical Co., Elkton, MD). Glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and uric acid in plasma samples were analyzed using kits obtained from Sigma. Glycogen in liver and kidney tissues was determined by measurement of glucose produced after digestion of glycogen with amyloglucosidase (17.Teutsch H.F. Graumann W. Lojda Z. Pearse A.G.E. Schlebler T.H. Progress in Histochemistry and Cytochemistry: Chemomorphology of Liver Paraenchyma. 14. Gustav Fisher Verlag, Stuttgart1981: 2.2.5Google Scholar). For hematoxylin and eosin staining, tissues were preserved in 10% neutral buffered Formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4–6 μm. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with the GraphPAD Prism program (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The most important initial clinical presentation of both human and mouse GSD-1a is life-threatening hypoglycemia. As a result, most of our G6Pase−/− mice died within the first 14 days of life in the absence of any form of therapy. To improve the survival rate of the G6Pase-deficient mice, we administrated 10% glucose intraperitoneally every 8 h, starting within postnatal day 1, and included polycose in the drinking water. The survival rate of these mice greatly improved, and ∼60% of the G6Pase−/− mice lived up to 20–21 days of age. Unfortunately, this mode of therapy cannot sustain the life of G6Pase−/− mice beyond weaning (21 days), and only <15% of the G6Pase-deficient mice lived to be 28 days old. We therefore used 14-day-old G6Pase−/− mice in this study. G6Pase−/− mice were infused via the retro-orbital vein with 2 × 109 plaque-forming units of a second-generation recombinant adenovirus (12.Engelhardt J.F. Ye X. Doranz B. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6196-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13.Yang Y. Nunes F.A. Berencsi K. Gonczol E. Engelhardt J.F. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) containing the murine G6Pase cDNA under the control of the Rouse sarcoma virus promoter (Ad-mG6Pase). Simultaneously, the glucose therapy was terminated. All of the 14-day-old G6Pase−/− mice (n = 41) receiving Ad-mG6Pase infusion survived to 56 days of age. Therefore, the mice had a 100% survival rate up to 42 days post-infusion. Of the 10 animals that were followed up for 56–70 days post-infusion, only one animal died prematurely, generating a 90% 84-day survival rate of G6Pase−/− mice under adenovirus-mediated gene therapy. The survival of G6Pase−/− mice under glucose therapy also markedly improved after weaning because mice tend to eat constantly and the mouse chow contains a high percentage of starch, the major component of a very successful dietary therapy in human GSD-1a patients (7.Chen Y.-T. Cornblath M. Sidbury J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As a result, 56% of the weaned G6Pase−/− mice lived to 42 days of age. However, only two control weaned G6Pase−/− mice lived to 70 days of age, and only one to 84 days of age. G6Pase is an ER membrane-associated enzyme with its active site facing the lumen (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, appropriate membrane insertion is required for activity. Moreover, the Glu-6-P substrate has to be translocated from the cytoplasm to the ER lumen before hydrolysis can occur (4.Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we have demonstrated that Glu-6-P transport and hydrolysis are tightly coupled events and that G6Pase activity is required for efficient Glu-6-P transport into the ER by the G6PT (5.Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 6.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, hepatic G6Pase expression was evaluated both by an increase in microsomal phosphohydrolase activity and by the activation of microsomal Glu-6-P transport. G6Pase−/− mice were analyzed for expression of recombinant G6Pase by Northern and enzyme histochemical analyses of liver tissues before and after virus infusion. As expected, the G6Pase transcript was absent from the livers of control G6Pase−/− mice, but became detectable in the livers of Ad-mG6Pase-infused animals at 7–14 days post-infusion (data not shown). When livers from animals infused with Ad-mG6Pase for 14 days were sectioned and stained for G6Pase activity, the entire liver stained positive (Fig. 1 B), albeit at a lower level than that of the G6Pase+/+ mice (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, there was no detectable G6Pase activity in liver sections of age-matched control G6Pase−/− mice (Fig. 1 A). Glu-6-P phosphohydrolase activity in the liver reached as high as 19% of the activity in G6Pase+/+ mice at day 7 post-infusion (Table I). Hepatic G6Pase activity persisted for an additional 7 days before declining to 10.6% of control G6Pase+/+ levels at day 28 post-infusion.

Open table in a new tab It has been demonstrated that systemic infusions of recombinant adenoviruses result in delivery of the transgene primarily to the liver (18.Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Perricaudet M. Wolff J.A. Gene Therapeutics: Methods and Applications of Direct Gene Transfer. Birkhauser Boston Inc., Boston1991: 345-362Google Scholar, 19.Kozarsky K.F. Wilson J.M. Curr. Opin.

Indeed, we detected only a very low level of G6Pase enzymatic activity (2.8% of wild-type activity) in the kidneys of G6Pase−/− mice at 14 days post-infusion. Liver microsomes from G6Pase+/+ mice transported Glu-6-P efficiently, indicating the presence of an intact G6Pase system (Fig.2 A). We have previously shown that G6Pase activity is required for efficient microsomal Glu-6-P uptake (5.Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and indeed, we observed no significant Glu-6-P uptake by liver microsomes of G6Pase−/− littermates (Fig.2 A). However, Ad-mG6Pase infusion activated microsomal Glu-6-P transport activity in the livers of G6Pase−/−mice (Fig. 2). It should be noted that despite a 19% restoration of hepatic G6Pase activity in G6Pase−/− mice at days 7–14 post-infusion, hepatic microsomal Glu-6-P transport activity at day 14 (28-day-old mice) post-infusion was considerably higher than the transport activity at day 7 (21-day-old mice) post-infusion (Fig.2 B). This is consistent with earlier observations showing that despite the high levels of G6Pase and G6PT expression in newborn mice, postnatal microsomal Glu-6-P transport activity increases gradually to peak about 28 days of age (21.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chen H. Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although our glucose therapy significantly improved the survival of G6Pase−/− mice, they grew slower than their G6Pase+/+ or G6Pase+/− littermates. At 14 days of age, the average weights of G6Pase−/− and G6Pase+/+/G6Pase+/− mice were 5.9 and 10.3 g, respectively (Fig.3 A). The body weights of G6Pase−/− mice increased rapidly after Ad-mG6Pase infusion, and the growth rate of the infused animals was comparable to that of G6Pase+/+/G6Pase+/− mice (Fig.3 A). The growth rate (Fig. 3 A) of untreated G6Pase−/− mice that have survived weaning also increased presumably due to the combination of glucose therapy, food supplements, and the constant eating habit of mice. Infusion of Ad-mG6Pase partially corrected liver (Fig. 3 B) and kidney (Fig. 3 C) enlargement seen in G6Pase−/− mice. The decrease in liver and kidney weights was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in glycogen contents in both organs (data not shown). Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that the G6Pase−/− mice had marked glycogen deposits in the hepatocytes of the liver (Fig.4 A) and both kidneys (Fig.4 D). Glycogen storage in both organs was considerably decreased after Ad-mG6Pase infusion (Fig. 4, B andE). In addition to hypoglycemic seizures that could be relieved by immediate glucose injection, G6Pase−/− mice under glucose therapy manifested hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia in the first 28 days of life (Table II). As evidenced by the renewed growth of weaned G6Pase−/− mice, plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and uric acid profiles were also markedly normalized (Table II).Table IIPlasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and uric acid levels in G6Pase −/− mice after Ad-mG6Pase infusionMiceAgePost-infusionGlucoseap = 0.038 and 0.0025 for control G6Pase−/− (21–28 days old) and G6Pase−/−mice at days 7 and 14 post-infusion, respectively; p = 0.011, 0.33, and 0.13 for control G6Pase−/− (>28 days old) and G6Pase−/− mice at days 28, 56, and 70 post-infusion, respectively; and p < 0.0001 for G6Pase+/+mice and all others.Cholesterolbp < 0.0001 for control G6Pase−/−mice (21–28 days old) and all others; p = 0.0005 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/− mice at day 7 post-infusion;p = 0.012 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/−mice (>28 days old); and p = 0.15–0.85 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/− mice at days 14, 28, 56, and 70 post-infusion.Triglyceridecp < 0.0001 for control G6Pase−/−mice (21–28 days old) and all others; and p > 0.5 for all other comparisons.Uric aciddp < 0.0001 for control G6Pase−/−mice (21–28 days old) and all others; p = 0.003 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/− mice at day 14 post-infusion;p = 0.02 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/−mice at day 70 post-infusion; p = 0.0001 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/− mice (>28 days old); andp = 0.35 and 0.13 for G6Pase+/+ and G6Pase−/− mice at days 7 and 28 post-infusion, respectively.daysdaysmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlG6Pase−/− (n = 6)21–2866.6 ± 15.6519.9 ± 59.9 (7.0)238.2 ± 64.7 (4.5)7.16 ± 1.36 (7.2)G6Pase−/−(n = 2)>28108.3 ± 12.7115.9 ± 16.4 (1.6)58.6 ± 11.5 (1.1)1.83 ± 0.10 (1.8)G6Pase+/+/G6Pase+/− (n = 23)21–84213.7 ± 12.773.9 ± 4.353.5 ± 5.01.00 ± 0.11G6Pase−/−(n = 7)217109.3 ± 13.0168.5 ± 23.2 (2.3)51.2 ± 2.5 (0.96)1.14 ± 0.31 (1.1)G6Pase−/− (n = 5)2814128.3 ± 7.276.4 ± 16.4 (1.0)52.0 ± 10.2 (0.97)1.54 ± 0.15 (1.5)G6Pase−/− (n = 3)4228155.8 ± 11.479.6 ± 10.2 (1.1)50.3 ± 8.6 (0.94)1.28 ± 0.16 (1.3)G6Pase−/−(n = 3)7056126.3 ± 20.599.7 ± 5.6 (1.4)50.0 ± 5.8 (0.93)NDeND, not determined.G6Pase−/− (n = 3)847084.3 ± 14.384.4 ± 8.8 (1.1)41.6 ± 4.2 (0.78)1.57 ± 0.27 (1.6)Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired ttest, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired ttest, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Numbers in parentheses are -fold of G6Pase+/+ mice. G6Pase gene replacement in G6Pase−/− mice resulted in the normalization of plasma glucose levels toward the normal control values in G6Pase+/+ mice (Table II). Moreover, the hypoglycemic seizures frequently suffered by the untreated G6Pase−/− mice were not observed in Ad-mG6Pase-infused animals. Ad-mG6Pase infusion also elicited 68, 70, and 84% reductions in plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and uric acid, respectively, at day 7 post-infusion (Table II). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride were completely normalized at 14–28 days post-infusion. We have used G6Pase−/− mice that manifest pathological features virtually identical to those of human GSD-1a patients to evaluate gene replacement therapy for this inheritable disorder. We demonstrated that a single administration of Ad-mG6Pase, a second-generation recombinant adenovirus containing the murine G6Pase cDNA, essentially corrected the abnormal plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride profiles in G6Pase−/− mice. Moreover, Ad-mG6Pase infusion partially alleviated liver and kidney enlargement manifested by GSD-1a mice and reduced glycogen deposition in both organs. Whereas only 15% of the 14-day-old G6Pase−/− mice under glucose therapy survived weaning, 100% of the age-matched G6Pase−/− mice infused with Ad-mG6Pase lived to 56 days of age, and 90% of the transgene-infused animals lived to 84 days of age. A limitation of the currently used adenoviral vector is the short-term expression of the transgene (18.Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Perricaudet M. Wolff J.A. Gene Therapeutics: Methods and Applications of Direct Gene Transfer. Birkhauser Boston Inc., Boston1991: 345-362Google Scholar, 19.Kozarsky K.F. Wilson J.M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite this limitation, the transient correction of metabolic abnormalities in G6Pase−/−mice achieved using the present system permits us to assess the feasibility of gene replacement therapy for GSD-1a. Our data suggest that gene therapy may be a viable option for the treatment of human GSD-1a patients when the G6Pase transgene expression can be sustained. G6Pase is an ER transmembrane protein (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and an appropriate membrane insertion of the protein is required for enzymatic activity. In this study, we showed that survival of the G6Pase−/−mice was sustained immediately after Ad-mG6Pase infusion as the pups survived without glucose therapy. Hepatic G6Pase activity was restored to 3.6% of that in the G6Pase+/+ mice at day 2 post-infusion, suggesting that hypoglycemic seizures that threaten the survival of the G6Pase−/− mice could be prevented by low levels of G6Pase activity in the liver. The active site of G6Pase faces the lumen of the ER (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and for Glu-6-P hydrolysis in vivo, the Glu-6-P substrate must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the ER lumen by the G6PT (4.Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Glu-6-P transport and hydrolysis are tightly coupled events and that G6Pase activity greatly facilitates Glu-6-P uptake by the G6PT protein (5.Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 6.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the adenovirus-directed G6Pase expression in the livers of G6Pase−/− mice activated hepatic microsomal Glu-6-P uptake activity, establishing the mutual dependence of the G6PT and G6Pase on the hydrolysis of Glu-6-P. Expression of the G6Pase gene is activated immediately following birth (2.Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar, 21.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chen H. Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a surge in G6Pase mRNA and enzymatic activity is not accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the G6PT-mediated Glu-6-P uptake (21.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chen H. Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), despite the fact that a high level of G6PT expression has occurred since gestation day 19 (22.Lin B. Hiraiwa H. Annabi B. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Instead, postnatal microsomal Glu-6-P transport activity increases only gradually to peak around postnatal day 28 (21.Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chen H. Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that an increase in hepatic G6Pase activity (19% of G6Pase+/+ mice) in Ad-mG6Pase-infused G6Pase−/− mice was accompanied by a similar increase (25% of G6Pase+/+ mice) in microsomal Glu-6-P uptake activity at day 14 post-infusion when the mice were 28 days old (Fig. 2 B). A comparable increase in microsomal Glu-6-P uptake was not accompanied by the increase in hepatic G6Pase activity at day 7 post-infusion when the mice were 21 days old. The discordance between G6PT/G6Pase expression and microsomal Glu-6-P transport activity suggests the involvement of additional factor(s) in modulating the microsomal Glu-6-P transport function. It has been reported that an increase in G6Pase mRNA by glucose is mediated, in part, by glucokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to Glu-6-P (23.Argaud D. Kirby T.L. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12854-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cytoplasmic Glu-6-P level, which is controlled to some extent by glucokinase in the liver, can regulate the G6PT protein to transport Glu-6-P. Interestingly, hepatic glucokinase mRNA and activity first appear in the liver only at postnatal day 15, and its highest expression is reached at postnatal day 30 (24.Iynedjian P.B. Ucla C. Mach B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6032-6038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of glucokinase in microsomal Glu-6-P transport is currently under investigation. It has been shown that liver transplantation into GSD-1a patients have corrected hypoglycemia and several other biochemical abnormalities associated with this disorder (10.Kirschner B.S. Baker A.L. Thorp F.K. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 238-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11.Selby R. Starzl T.E. Yunis E. Todo S. Tzakis A.G. Brown B.I. Kendall R.S. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152: S71-S76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our present findings indicating that expression of the G6Pase transgene in liver to 19% of that in G6Pase+/+ mice corrected growth retardation, liver and kidney enlargement, hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia manifested by GSD-1a mice and greatly improved the survival of these mice. In summary, we have used G6Pase−/− mice to assess gene replacement therapy for GSD-1a, and our results strongly suggest that this disorder can be corrected by gene therapy when vector systems that can direct sustained expression of the transgene are developed.

We demonstrate that Sp1, but not Sp3, is capable of activating the c-Src promoter and that Sp3 is also capable of inhibiting Sp1-mediated transactivation. The presence of multiple Pu:Py tracts conferred S1 sensitivity on plasmids in vitro, suggesting they are capable of adopting non B-DNA conformations.

Mutations eliminating SPy binding compromised Src transcriptional activity, especially in concert with additional mutations affecting Sp1 binding, suggesting the two factors may cooperate in regulating c-Src expression.

Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Vogt P.K. Nature. 1976; 260: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). c-Src is the prototype of a large family of highly conserved genes (Yes, Fyn, Fgr, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Blk, and Yrk), whose products have been implicated in many signal transduction pathways and a wide variety of cellular processes (2.Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most c-Src research over the last decade has focused on identifying the enzyme's targets, the mechanisms of post-translational kinase activity, and interacting proteins. In addition, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the many signal transduction pathways of which c-Src and its family members appear to be a part (2.Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1278: 121-149Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that c-Src activation is required in growth factor mediated passage of fibroblasts from the G2phase of the cell cycle to mitosis (4.Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5.Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), as well as a variety of other diverse signaling mechanisms including endothelin-dependent hypertrophic activation in cardiac myocytes (6.Kovacic B. Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35185-35193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). c-Src has also been implicated in the regulation of Ca2+ release through store-operated channels (7.Babnigg G. Bowersox S.R. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29434-29437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Src knockout mice display a single major phenotype, osteopetrosis, identifying c-Src activation as an essential component of osteoclast function (8.Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradly A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). This finding also supports the hypothesis of redundancy between Src family members (especially Yes and Fyn), which appear to share critical functions (9.Stein P.L. Vogel H. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1999-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition to these normal physiological functions, overexpression or activation of c-Src has been frequently linked to the development of human neoplasms, especially those of the colon (10.Talamonti M.S.

Most recently, activating mutations in the c-Src gene have been documented in a small percentage of advanced colon tumors (16.Irby R.B. Mao W Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W. Karl R.

Thus, while considerable information and knowledge has accumulated on pp60c-src, it is curious that virtually nothing is known about the transcriptional regulation of this important gene in normal or neoplastic cells. This is despite the fact that c-Src gene expression is developmentally regulated in the brain (17.Fults D.W. Towle A.C. Lauder J.M. Maness P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and transcriptionally up-regulated during osteoclast activation (18.Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum J. Clin.

Res. 1991; 28: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Src mRNA levels vary dramatically in both human cell lines and tissues, and we have recently shown that the frequently reported c-Src overexpression in many colon cancer cell lines results from transcriptional activation of the gene. 1K. Bonham, unpublished observations.1K. Bonham, unpublished observations. To begin to address this hitherto unexplored facet of c-Src regulation, we have isolated and identified a human c-Src promoter (20.Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter region has characteristics typical of the housekeeping class of genes, such as high GC content, lack of obvious TATA or CCAAT regulatory sequences, and multiple transcription start sites (20.Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these start sites were mapped to three unusual polypurine:polypyrimidine (Pu:Py)2 tracts, identified in a region of the promoter essential for full transcriptional activity. In this current report we describe a detailed study of the basal c-Src promoter. We show that transcriptional regulation of the c-Src promoter is absolutely dependent on the Sp family of transcription factors but also on the presence of these Pu:Py tracts. In addition, we describe a novel factor (SPy) which displays both double-stranded and single-stranded binding specificity when interacting with these important Pu:Py tracts. Finally, we were able to design a series of synthetic triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), which were able to specifically target the Pu:Py tracts in the c-Src promoter and inhibit transcription in vitro. In addition to expanding our understanding of c-Src gene regulation and genes controlled by similar sequence motifs, this work also suggests a potential therapeutic approach to down-regulating c-Src in diseases related to c-Src overexpression. Mouse fibroblast 10T1/2 and human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 and SW620 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. TheDrosophila SL2 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown at room temperature in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Other cell lines used for nuclear extract production were obtained from ATCC and maintained as suggested by the supplier.

Open table in a new tab The human c-Src promoter-CAT constructs p0.54Src-CAT, p0.38Src-CAT, and p0.20Src-CAT have been described before (20.Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar). The p0.84Src-BS plasmid was similar in content to 0.38Src-CAT but contained an extra 460 bp of 3′ intron 1 sequence cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene). The mutant 0.38Src-CAT constructs GC1, GA2, and GC1/GA2 were designed using the two-step PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis technique of Landt (21.Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For example, to generate the GC1 mutant construct, a first step PCR was carried out using the mutagenic GC1 primer and the T7 reverse primer (located downstream in the polylinker region of the template vector 0.54Src-CAT). The PCR product was then digested with SacII, and the resulting mutant 339-bp fragment used to replace the wild-typeSacII fragment in p0.54Src-CAT. The vector was then cut withNarI and religated, producing a mutated version of the wild-type p0.38Src-CAT construct. The same strategy was used to generate the GA2 mutant construct, using the GA2 mutagenic primer. Construction of the GC1/GA2 mutant vector was identical to that of the GA2 mutant, except that the template was the GC1 mutant version of p0.54Src-CAT. All of the mutant constructs containing mutations of the SPy sites in TC1 and TC2 alone and in combination with GC1mut, GA2mut, and GC1/GA2mut, as well as the mutants containing deletions of TC1 and TC2 were generated based on the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The desired mutations were introduced into either wild-type or previously mutated p0.38Src-CAT constructs using the complementary mutagenic primers listed in Table I to produce the 15 combinations of mutations between GC1mut, GA2mut, TC1mut, and TC2mut. All mutant plasmids generated in the PCR stage were then digested withNarI and SacII to isolate the promoter region, and the fragment ligated back into wild-type p0.38Src-CAT to ensure the absence of possible mutations elsewhere in the plasmid that could have occurred during the mutagenesis step. Construction of the TC3 deletion mutant has been reported previously (22.Ritchie S. Bonham K. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. pPacSp1, a Sp1 expression plasmid, was obtained from R. Tjian (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California). pPacSp3, an Sp3 expression plasmid, was obtained from G. Suske (Institut für Molekularbiologie and Tumorforschung, Philipps-Universität, Marburg, Germany). The β-galactosidase expression plasmids pCH110 and pCMV-βgal were obtained from Promega and W. Roesler (University of Saskatchewan), respectively. p97B, a β-galactosidase expression plasmid under the control of aDrosophila promoter, was a gift of L. Lania (University of Naples “Federico II,” Naples, Italy). Nuclear extracts were prepared from various human cell lines as described by Dignam et al. (23.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). For EMSAs,32P-labeled fragments A and B were prepared simultaneously by digesting 0.38Src-CAT with NarI and BssHII, followed by an in-fill reaction with Klenow fragment and [32P]dCTP. Following several precipitations, the two fragments were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified. Double-stranded probes were generated by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides and labeling with in-fill reactions using Klenow fragment and [32P]dCTP. Single-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For a typical EMSA, 5–10 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with 20,000–50,000 cpm of probe in Binding Buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in a 20-μl final volume. When competitor oligonucleotides or antibodies were used, they were added at the same time as nuclear extracts. The reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min before the addition of the labeled probe, followed by a 30-min incubation at 25 °C. The bound and free probes were resolved on either 4% (fragment A or B) or 6% (for synthetic oligonucleotide probes) polyacrylamide gels in running buffer containing 50 mm Tris base, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA at 150 V for 3 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The plasmid p0.84Src-BS containing the entire c-Src promoter region and a small portion of intron 1 was digested with 5 units/μg S1 in S1 buffer (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 3 mm ZnCl2) for 30 min. S1 digestion was terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction and the plasmid recovered by precipitation. The resulting S1-treated plasmid was then either left untreated or further digested with one of several restriction enzymes, and the products resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The regions of S1 sensitivity were determined by gel purification of the resulting S1/restriction fragments, followed by cloning and sequence analysis of several individual clones. Supercoiled plasmids were prepared for transfections using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). For SL2 cells, CAT expression vector 0.38Src-CAT (10.0 μg), p97b (10 μg), and pPacSp1 (0.1 μg) were typically co-precipitated with calcium phosphate and applied to 5 × 106cells/plate in duplicate. For 10T1/2 and SW480 cells, CAT expression vector (3.0 μg) and pCH110 (1.0 μg) were mixed with 172 μl of OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 20 μl of Superfect (Qiagen). Following a 15-min incubation at room temp, 1200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and appropriate antibiotics were added to the DNA-Superfect complexes, and applied in duplicate to two wells of a six-well plate (1.5 × 105 10T1/2 cells or 3.75 × 105 SW480 cells/well). Cells were harvested 48 h later with the provided lysis buffer, and protein levels determined using Bio-Rad reagent. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (24.Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar), and CAT protein levels quantified using a CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reported CAT levels are all corrected for transfection efficiency and were repeated at least three times in duplicate. For triplex inhibition studies, 200–500 molar excess of TFO over reporter plasmid concentration was first preannealed to the plasmid in a 40-μl reaction containing 10 mmMgCl2, 90 mm Tris, and 90 mmborate. The reactions were heated to 65 °C for 10 min and left at room temperature for at least 2 h. The annealing reaction was then transfected in duplicate to six-well plates as described above. The isolation and identification of the c-Src promoter has been previously reported (20.Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Ritchie S. Bonham K. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Construction of a series of 5′ promoter-CAT deletion plasmids identified a 180-bp region located between 0.38Src-CAT and 0.20Src-CAT (Fig.1 A) that was required for full promoter activity in mouse fibroblast and several human cell lines (20.Bonham K. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1973-1981PubMed Google Scholar).1 We therefore began our studies by examining the ability of nuclear extracts from both human and mouse 10T1/2 cell lines to form specific complexes with DNA probes derived from this promoter region. Digestion of the promoter with Nar I and Bss HII generated two fragments spanning the 180 bp of interest (Fig. 1 A), which, when used as probes, formed three DNA-protein complexes (Fig.2, A and B). The relative intensity of the complexes was observed to be very similar between human and mouse cells (data not shown). Due to the high GC content (82%) of this region of the promoter, it was not surprising to find two strong consensus binding sites (GC1 and GA2 at positions −608/−617 and −471/−481, respectively) for the transcription factor Sp1 ((G/T)(G/A)GG(C/A)G(G/T)(G/A)(G/A)(C/T)) (25.Courey A.J. Tjian R.I. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcription Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). To determine if the bandshifted complexes were indeed Sp family-related, a series of competition experiments were carried out. The DNA-protein complexes formed with both fragments A and B were successfully competed with an excess of double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a canonical high affinity site for the Sp1 transcription factor (Fig. 2, A and B). However, an oligonucleotide containing the GC-rich AP2 transcription factor consensus binding site failed to compete (Fig. 2, A andB).Figure 2Specific interaction of the 5′ c-Src flanking region with nuclear extracts. A and B, major complexes (C1–C3) and a minor complex (*) formed using32P-radiolabeled fragment (Frag) A and B with nuclear extracts (N.E.) derived from human Colo 205 cells.C and D, fragments A and B were incubated with Colo 205 nuclear extract in the presence or absence of various antibodies, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the Sp family comprises several similar proteins (Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4), each capable of binding the same consensus site (26.Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiß A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we performed EMSAs using antibodies specific to the different Sp family members. Using both fragments A and B, the addition of anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies to the bandshift reaction resulted in the loss of one band with anti-Sp1, two bands with anti-Sp3, or all three bands with both antibodies (Fig. 2, C and D). Purified recombinant Sp1 formed a complex that co-migrated with the band recognized by anti-Sp1 (Fig. 2 C, right lane). The apparent decrease in intensity of the remaining bands with anti-Sp1 was not a consistent observation. It therefore appears that these three complexes can be accounted for by just two Sp family members. To confirm that the regions GC1 and GA2 were truly responsible for complex formation, the sites were mutated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EMSAs using the mutated fragments showed the complete loss of complex formation with Sp1 and Sp3 (results not shown). It was therefore concluded that these two sites in the c-Src promoter were responsible for interacting specifically with Sp family members. Occasionally we observed a slower migrating complex that disappeared with anti-Sp3 antibody (Fig. 2, band noted byasterisk). We are uncertain as to the identity of this factor; however, it could be the result of either Sp3 multimers or Sp factors binding to other low affinity Sp1 sites present within each fragment. Our next objective was to determine if Sp family members were able to influence c-Src promoter activity. However, the vast majority of mammalian cells contain endogenous Sp1 and Sp3, making transfection experiments using exogenous Sp1 and Sp3 difficult to interpret. Therefore, to determine the effects of Sp family members on c-Src promoter activity, transfection experiments were performed in theDrosophila SL2 cell line, which lacks endogenous Sp1. Transfection of 0.38Src-CAT wild-type constructs into SL2 cells alone showed no detectable CAT expression. However, when co-transfected with the Sp1 expression vector, pPacSp1, the c-Src promoter was highly activated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A and results not shown). The construct 0.20Src-CAT, lacking the GC1 and GA2 binding sites (but containing several weaker Sp1 motifs), was transactivated by Sp1 to less than 10% the level of 0.38Src-CAT (Fig. 3 A). Since protein/DNA interactions at GC1 and GA2 consist of Sp1 as well as Sp3 members, we investigated the role of Sp3 on c-Src transcription. In SL2 cells, Sp3 alone was unable to transactivate c-Src under any condition tested. However, when increasing concentrations of Sp3 were expressed with constant amounts of 0.38Src-CAT and pPacSp1, Sp3 could repress Sp1-dependent transactivation of the c-Src promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). It therefore appears that Sp3 can negatively effect Sp1-mediated transactivation of the c-Src gene. We concluded that c-Src promoter activity was Sp1, but not Sp3 dependent in this experimental system. We next investigated the relative contribution of the various Sp1 binding sites to c-Src transactivation by constructing a number of mutant 0.38Src-CAT vectors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutant constructs were then co-transfected with pPacSp1 into SL2 cells. Individual mutations in GC1 and GA2 reduced promoter activity to about 60% of wild-type (Fig. 3A). Mutations in both GC1 and GA2 together further reduced transactivation to about 30% of wild-type. It therefore appeared that these two sites could account for the bulk of Sp1-mediated transactivation in this system. Since our interest is in the transcriptional regulation of c-Src in human cells, the effects of these mutations were next examined in a human cell line. When the wild-type and mutated 0.38Src-CAT constructs were transfected into human adenocarcinoma (SW480) cells, similar results to the SL2 system were observed (Fig. 3 C). Together, these results show that Sp1, through its interaction at two sites, is required for full c-Src transcriptional activation. In addition to the small Pu:Py tract overlapping the Sp1-GA2 binding site, the c-Src promoter contains three other longer Pu:Py sequences located between regions −515 and −391 (Fig. 1). Pu:Py sequences have the ability adopt non-BDNA conformations known as H-DNA, a structure consisting of triple-stranded and single-stranded regions of DNA (27.Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). H-DNA motifs can be assayed by their hyperreactivity to S1 nuclease, and in numerous other cases such regions have been reported to render supercoiled plasmids S1-sensitive (28.Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlano G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4174-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether supercoiled plasmids containing the c-Src promoter were also susceptible to S1 nuclease. Plasmid p0.84Src-BS, containing the complete c-Src promoter, was treated with S1 nuclease in combination with several restriction enzymes, and the fragments separated on an agarose gel, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.4 A). S1 digestion alone appeared to act to linearize the supercoiled plasmid (compare plasmid,lanes 3 and 4) and this was confirmed by subsequent digestion with XbaI or PstI (lanes 5–10). The resulting fragments were generated only when supercoiled plasmid containing the c-Src promoter was treated with S1 nuclease before treatment with restriction enzymes. Control constructs lacking the c-Src promoter failed to generate any fragments (results not shown). Subsequent cloning and sequence analysis of a number of these fragments demonstrated that they arose from S1 cleavage throughout the TC2-TC3 region (Fig. 4 B). It was concluded from these results that the presence of Pu:Py tracts within the c-Src promoter could confer a non-BDNA (probably H-DNA) structure containing a single-stranded region. To further investigate the significance of these Pu:Py tracts, we engineered a series of Pu:Py deletion mutants in the basic 0.38Src-CAT vector, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and tested their activity following transfection. Interestingly, we found individual deletions in TC1, TC2, and TC3 reduced CAT activity to 35%, 55%, and 65% compared with wild-type, respectively, even in the presence of the Sp1 binding sites GC1 and GA2 (Fig. 4 C). We concluded that these Pu:Py tracts were also essential for full activity of the c-Src promoter. We next investigated potential protein/DNA interactions at these Pu:Py sites by EMSAs using nuclear extracts from both human and mouse 10T1/2 cells. A major complex was observed using32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides to double-stranded TC1 and TC2, but not with TC3 (Fig.5 A). Examination of the sequences of each Pu:Py tract revealed that the sequence CTTCC was present twice in TC1 and once in TC2, but was absent in TC3 (Fig.1 B). A single base pair substitution in both of these sites in TC1 (CTTCC to CTTTC) completely abolished the binding of this factor (Fig. 5 A), while maintaining the integrity of the pyrimidine tract. A similar mutation in the single site in TC2 also prevented any complex formation (results not shown). Competition experiments demonstrated that unlabeled double-stranded TC1 and TC2 oligonucleotides could effectively compete away the binding of this factor, while the TC1mut or Sp1 double-stranded oligonucleotides failed to do so (Fig. 5 B). The nonspecific band in Fig.5 B was an inconsistent observation with certain nuclear extracts, and could be competed away by dissimilar oligonucleotides such as Sp1 (data not shown). Since our S1 experiments had demonstrated that this region of the c-Src promoter is capable of adopting structures that are partially single-stranded, we also examined potential complex formation using32P-labeled single-stranded probes in EMSAs. A robust bandshift was observed with probes derived from the pyrimidine strand of TC1 and TC2, while probes from the TC3 pyrimidine strand appeared to produce a bandshift consisting of more than one complex. Probes, on the other hand, derived from the corresponding purine strands showed significantly weaker interactions (Fig.6 A). For these reasons we have named this factor SPy (Src pyrimidine binding factor). SPy was effectively competed away using a molar excess of unlabeled pyrimidine strands, including unlabeled TC1mut CT (Fig.6 B). Most significantly, SPy was also competed away using excess unlabeled double-stranded TC1"
https://openalex.org/W2029581491,"Many cytokines have dual functions of promoting or inhibiting cell proliferation; however, the molecular mechanism of the dual functions of cytokines is not well understood. Under normal conditions, interleukin (IL)-3 is required for Ba/F3 cell proliferation, whereas interferon (IFN)-γ inhibits Ba/F3 cell proliferation. It is known that Stat1 play a major role in inhibition of cell growth in response to IFN-γ. We have examined the possibility of whether IFN-γ can act as a growth-promoting cytokine if the Stat1 function is selectively blocked. We have established variant Ba/F3 cell lines in which Stat1 function is inhibited by a dominant-negative Stat1 mutant. Intriguingly, once Stat1 function is inhibited, IFN-γ can replace IL-3 acting as an essential growth factor for cell proliferation. To understand the molecular mechanism of regulation of cell proliferation by the cytokines, the signaling pathways and gene induction by IL-3 and IFN-γ are further studied. Although IL-3 activates mitogenic-activated protein kinase and Akt kinase, IFN-γ does not. Interestingly, both IL-3 and IFN-γ induce expression of the c-Myc gene that is not dependent on the Stat1 activity. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant Myc can block IFN-γ-mediated Ba/F3 cell proliferation, suggesting that c-Myc gene induction is required for IFN-γ-mediated cell proliferation. These findings suggest that IFN-γ intrinsically and simultaneously induces specific and conflicting signaling pathways and transcriptional programs that contribute to the potential dual effects of IFN-γ in promoting or inhibiting cell proliferation.

The most notable feature of cytokines is the ability to stimulate cell growth. Many growth factor receptors contain intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs),1 whereas cytokine receptors are associated with PTK during activation (1.Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Activation of PTKs can generate mitogenic effects through the RAS-MAPK pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt kinase pathway and other signal proteins (3.Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Cytokines and growth factors can induce expression of proto-oncogenes, such as Myc, Fos, and other transcription factors that may positively regulate cell proliferation (3.Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Many growth factors and cytokines can strongly promote cell growth, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukin (IL)-3. On the other hand, some PTK-activating cytokines can inhibit cell proliferation. For example, interferons are cytokines with growth suppression activities (8.Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 9.Pestka S. Langer A.J. Zoon K. Samuel C. Annu. Rev.

We have previously suggested that the PTK-STAT signaling pathway, Stat1 in particular, may play a role in the negative control of cell growth by inducing gene expression of cyclin kinase inhibitors and caspases in response to extracellular stimuli (11.Chin Y.E.

Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, it is intriguing that a specific PTK-activating cytokine may exert conflicting (positive and negative) effects on cell proliferation. It is often observed that the same cytokine is capable of stimulating and inhibiting cell growth depending on cell context, cytokine concentration, and other conditions (14.Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). One striking example is epidermal growth factor, which promotes proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts but inhibits hair follicle cells, squamous carcinoma, and some breast cancer cells (14.Sporn M.B.

Similarly, many other cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6, etc., have routinely been classified as growth factors. However, they also have growth inhibiting activities (16.Sugamura K. Nakai S.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms of the dual effects of cytokines on cell growth is one of the most important tasks in the studies of cytokine functions and their medical applications. A working hypothesis is that every PTK-activating cytokine simultaneously initiates multiple signaling pathways that may have opposite (positive and negative) effects on cell growth. Thus whether a cytokine promotes or inhibits cell growth is determined by the relative strengths of positive or negative signals that may be induced intrinsically by the same cytokine-bound receptor. In the present study, we have comparatively investigated mechanisms of IL-3- and IFN-γ-mediated cell proliferation and growth suppression. Our results indicate that IFN-γ is a cytokine with both growth stimulating and inhibiting activities, although the growth promoting potential is usually suppressed by Stat1. Intriguingly, IFN-γ induces expression of the c-Myc oncogene and promotes cell proliferation, which is independent of Stat1 activation. Thus, we suggest that cytokine-induced conflicting signaling pathways and gene expression programs are molecular bases for stimulating or inhibiting proliferation of a cell. Ba/F3-6, a subclone of Ba/F3 cell line, is a bone marrow-derived murine IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line (22.D'Andrea A.D. Yoshimura A. Youssoufian H. Zon L. Koo J.W. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1980-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). WT9 and WT10 are Ba/F3-6-derived stable transformant clones expressing the wild type human Stat1. Y701F1 and Y701F2 are Ba/F3-6-derived stable transformant clones expressing the mutant human Stat1 (see below). MycDN9 and MycDN22 are Y701F1-derived stable transformant clones expressing the mutant human c-Myc-In373 (27.Sawyers C.L. Callahan W. Witte O.N. Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For establishment of these Myc-In373-expressing Y701F1 cells, the cells were selected with cotransfection of 5 μg of hygromycin-resistant gene plasmid (pMiwhph) in one electroporation. Then 24 h after transfection, 2 mg/ml hygromycin B were used to select Myc-In373-expressing cells. The Myc expression was confirmed by Western blotting (see Fig. 7 A).Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v), conditioned medium from the WEHI3 cell line (10% WEHI-conditioned medium) as a source of IL-3. Mouse recombinant IL-3 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), mouse recombinant IFN-γ from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), anti-Stat1 polyclonal antibodies, E23 and G16930, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Stat3 polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Z. Zhong, and anti-ERK1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK and anti-phospho-Akt polyclonal antibodies were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 5 × 103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with various concentrations of IL-3 or IFN-γ for 48 h in triplicate. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (TRK120, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added at 1.0 μCi/well 4 h before termination of incubation. The incorporated [3H]thymidine was counted with 1205 BetaplateTM liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). pEFneo is a mammalian expression vector with the promoter of the elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) gene and the neomycin-resistant gene. For preparation of pEFneo, polypeptide chain promoter was cut out with HindIII and XbaI sites from pEF-BOS, which is a gift from Dr. S. Nagata, and then the fragment was treated with T4 DNA polymerase. Cytomegalovirus promoter was removed from pcDNA3 at NruI andHindIII sites and then replaced by the EF-1α promoter after T4 DNA polymerase treatment. pEFneoStat1 was constructed by inserting human Stat1 cDNA to BamHI and EcoRV sites of pEFneo. pEFneoStat1-Y701F is a mutant human Stat1 in which a phenylalanine was substituted for tyrosine 701. pEFneo-Myc-In373 is a reconstructed expression vector containing a mutant human c-Myc from original pSRαMSVTKneo Myc-In373 with EcoRI sites (27.Sawyers C.L. Callahan W. Witte O.N. Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The fragment was ligated EcoRI sites of pEFneo. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into the cells by an electroporation procedure as described (54.Potter H. Weir L. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7161-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were mixed with 5 μg of plasmid in ice-cold potassium-phosphate-buffered saline and placed in chamber. Cells were subjected to 350 V pulse shock at the 500 microfarad capacity with Gene PulserII (Bio-Rad). Selection was initiated 24 h after transfection, using 2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were suspended in whole cell extraction buffer (400 mm KCl, 10 mmNaHPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and repeated freezing and thawing three times. After microcentrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was quantified. 10 μg of whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to Immun-BlotTMpolyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.0), the membranes were then soaked in the indicated antibodies, followed by soaking in anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase and visualized by using SuperSignalR Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Preparation of whole cell extracts is described above. 6 μg of whole cell extract protein in 3 μl of whole cell extraction buffer was mixed with 12 μl of32P-labeled M67-SIE probe in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 75 μm EDTA, 75 μmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 33 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 33 μg/ml sonicated salmon testis DNA (Sigma) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature followed by another 20 min incubation with or without antibodies as indicated. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer and detected by autoradiography. The probe DNAs for IRF1, c-Fos, c-Myc, and IL-3 were prepared as follows: for IRF1, a 1.0-kilobaseNheI-XhoI fragment excised from pMSGmIRF-1 plasmid that contains mouse IRF1 cDNA; for c-Fos, a 0.4-kilobaseXbaI-EcoRI fragment excised from pBSmFos that contains mouse c-Fos cDNA prepared by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers, 5′-AATCTAGAGGCTTCCACCCCAGAGTC-3′ and 5′-AGAATTCGTTGCTGCTGCTGCCCTTTC-3′, and first strand cDNA mixture as a template prepared from total RNA of IL-3-stimulated Ba/F3-6 cell with oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Inc.); for c-Myc, a 0.47-kilobaseEcoRI-XbaI fragment excised from pBSmMyc that contains mouse c-Myc cDNA prepared by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers, 5′-AGAATTCCACCACCAGCAGCGACTCT-3′ and 5′-AATCTAGAGGATGTAGGCGGTGGCTTTT-3′, and first strand cDNA mixture as a template described above; and for IL-3, a 0.5-kilobaseEcoRI-XbaI fragment excised from pBSmIL-3 that contains mouse IL-3 cDNA prepared by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers, 5′-AGAATTCGGAGGACCAGAACGAGACAATG-3′ and 5′-TAGGAGAGACGGAGCCAGATGC-3′, and first strand cDNA mixture as a template prepared from total RNA of T-cell receptor-stimulated mouse T cell with oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Total cellular RNA from each cell was prepared by TRIzolTM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Zeta-Probe GT blotting membranes (Bio-Rad). Probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized at 65 °C for 16 h. in 0.25 m Na2HPO4, 7% SDS. Then these membranes were washed at 65 °C for 30 min in 20 mmNa2HPO4, 5% SDS. Membranes were stained with 0.02% (w/v) methylene blue and 0.3 m sodium acetate for 30 min and washed with distilled water. A major objective of the current study is to examine whether each cytokine has intrinsic, pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation. We chose to study two cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-3, because they appear to have opposite effects on cell proliferation: IL-3 is a growth factor, whereas IFN-γ is a growth inhibitor. We used Ba/F3 cells, which are a pro-B cell line derived from bone marrow (22.D'Andrea A.D. Yoshimura A. Youssoufian H. Zon L. Koo J.W. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1980-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been well characterized that growth of Ba/F3 cells is dependent on IL-3. To avoid possible nonspecific effects derived from a heterogeneous population of Ba/F3 cells, we isolated a cell line Ba/F3-6, which is derived from a single cell of parental Ba/F3 cells. Similar to the parental Ba/F3 cells, Ba/F3-6 cells were dependent on IL-3 for proliferation and increased concentrations of IL-3 further stimulate thymidine incorporation (Fig.1 A). In contrast, cell proliferation in response to IL-3 was inhibited by IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1 B). These results are consistent with the view that IL-3 is a growth factor, whereas IFN-γ is a growth inhibitor. To exclude the possibility that the cell line Ba/F3-6 may have accumulated specific mutations during selection, or other potential clonal effects, we also isolated a number of other clones, which gave identical results as cell line Ba/F3-6 (data not shown). Our hypothesis is that the Stat1 may play a critical role in negative control of cell growth in response to IFN-γ. Based on this hypothesis, we anticipate that IFN-γ should lose its growth inhibiting effect if Stat1 activation can be blocked in these Ba/F3 cells. It was known that tyrosine 701 of Stat1 is essential for activation (23.Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Mutation of this critical site may generate a mutant Stat1 protein that may still bind to phosphotyrosine sites through the SH2 domain (24.Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) but itself is not phosphorylated and activated. Once this mutant Stat1 is overexpressed, it may generate a dominant-negative effect on activation of endogenous Stat1 protein. We thus made a point mutation that converted tyrosine 701 to phenylalanine (Y701F). We isolated cell clones from Ba/F3-6 cells transfected with this mutant Stat1 or wild type Stat1 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Two representative clones expressing the exogenously introduced the mutant Stat1 (Y701F1 and Y701F2) or wild type (WT9 and WT10) Stat1 protein were analyzed (Fig.2 A). These exogenous Stat1 proteins were expressed at the same level (lane 2–5), but it was significantly higher than endogenous Stat1 protein expression (lane 1). To examine the effects of the expressed proteins, Ba/F3-6 and derivative cells expressing wild type (WT9 and WT10) or mutant (Y701F1 and Y701F2) Stat1 were stimulated with IFN-γ for 30 min. Specific STAT DNA binding activity induced by IFN-γ was determined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay using a high affinity m67-SIE probe (Fig. 2 B; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Stat1 activity was significantly increased in cells expressing wild type Stat1 (lane 4 and 7), whereas Stat1 activity was almost completely blocked in cells expressing Y701F mutant Stat1 (lane 10 and 12). These results indicate that overexpression of Y701F mutant inhibits activation of endogenous Stat1. The identification of Stat1 in the complex was confirmed by supershifted bands (SS*) by a specific anti-Stat1 antibody. IL-3 could weakly activate Stat1 and Stat3 in Ba/F3 cells, and the identification of Stat1 and Stat3 in the complex were confirmed by supershifted bands (SS*, Stat1; SS**, Stat3) by anti-Stat1 or Stat3 antibodies (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–4). Stat1 activation by IL-3 was greatly enhanced in WT9 and WT10 (lanes 5–10) but was inhibited in Y701F1 and Y701F2 (lanes 11–14), suggesting again that Y701F mutant Stat1 acts as an efficient inhibitor of Stat1 activation. To investigate whether Stat1 function in transcriptional activation was affected in these cells, we examined gene induction mediated by Stat1. The IRF-1 gene is an immediate early gene regulated by Stat1 in response to IFN-γ (25.Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26.Taniguchi T. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We found that expression of the IRF-1 gene was induced to a maximal level in the Ba/F3-6 cells in response to IFN-γ, and expressing more wild type Stat1 protein in WT10 cells did not further increase IRF-1 gene expression (Fig. 2 D,upper panel). In contrast, in the cells expressing mutant Stat1 (Y701F), IRF-1 gene induction by IFN-γ was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 2 D). This result was consistent with the diminished Stat1 DNA binding activities in the Y701F mutant cells. Furthermore, correlated with induced Stat1 activities, IL-3 weakly enhanced IRF-1 expression in parental Ba/F3-6 cells, whereas IL-3 greatly enhanced IRF-1 expression in cells expressing the wild type (WT10) but not mutant (Y701F1) Stat1 protein (Fig. 2 E). These results further show that the Y701F mutation has a strong dominant-negative effect, and expression of the Y701F mutant protein in these cells is sufficient for blocking Stat1 activation and its function in gene regulation. These results also demonstrate that IL-3 can induce IRF-1 expression in a Stat1-dependent manner. Based on the above results, we obtained three types of Ba/F3 cells that were derived from the identical genetic background but with different levels of Stat1 activities: the parental Ba/F3-6 clonal cells with “normal” Stat1 activity, the wild type Stat1 expressing cells (WT) with higher Stat1 activity, and the mutant Stat1 expressing cells (Y701F) in which Stat1 activity was specifically inhibited. Using these different kinds of cells we next addressed the question of possible pleiotropic potentials of IFN-γ in regulation of cell proliferation. We have hypothesized that IFN-γ may have potential in stimulating cell growth, but this potential may be overridden by the strong anti-proliferative effect of Stat1. Indeed, treatment of Ba/F3-6 cells with IFN-γ resulted in no increase in thymidine incorporation in these cells (Fig. 3 A), indicating that IFN-γ did not promote DNA synthesis of Ba/F3-6 cells. However, as anticipated, in Y701F cells in which Stat1 function is defective, IFN-γ significantly promoted DNA synthesis (Fig.3 A). As controls, in wild type Stat1 expressing cells (WT9 and WT10), IFN-γ treatment did not increase DNA synthesis (Fig.3 B). These results suggested that IFN-γ can stimulate DNA synthesis if the negative signaling pathway is specifically inhibited. On the other hand, IL-3 could greatly promote DNA synthesis in the parental Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 3 C, see the curve labeled asBa/F3-6), whereas inhibition of Stat1 function by expressing Y701F mutant further enhanced DNA synthesis by IL-3 (Fig.3 C, Y701F1). On the contrary, expressing the wild type Stat1 reduced DNA synthesis in response to IL-3 (Fig.3 C, WT10). These results indicate that IL-3, like IFN-γ, has negative signaling potentials that are mediated by Stat1 activation. To exclude the possibility that these results were affected by clonal differences, Ba/F3-6 cells, which transiently expressed wild type Stat1, Y701F mutant Stat1, or vector alone were measured for the rates of DNA synthesis in the presence of various concentrations of IFN-γ (Fig. 3 D). Similarly to the above results from clonal cells, IFN-γ promoted DNA synthesis in the cell population transfected with Y701F mutant but not the vector. In contrast to Y701F mutant, cells transfected with the wild type Stat1 further reduced DNA synthesis. We next examined whether IFN-γ has a potential for maintaining long term proliferation of these cells (Fig.4). Ba/F3-6 (closed circle), WT9 (open square), WT10 (open triangle), Y701F1 (closed square), and Y701F2 (closed triangle) cells were cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml of IFN-γ but not IL-3. Within 7 days the parental Ba/F3-6 and wild type Stat1 expressing cells were all dead in the presence of IFN-γ. However, the mutant Stat1 expressing cells Y701F1 and Y701F2 were surviving and proliferating in response to IFN-γ (Fig. 4 A). Strikingly, after longer culturing, these Y701F mutant expressing cells become stable cell lines that could proliferate in presence of either IFN-γ or IL-3 (Fig. 4 B). The dependence on either IFN-γ or IL-3 was further shown by the observation that these Y701F cells become dead when none of the cytokines was provided (Fig. 4 B, open symbols with solid lines). This dependence on IFN-γ or IL-3 also excludes the possibility that oncogenic mutations were occurred and selected in these Y701F cells. We also confirmed that IFN-γ does not induce IL-3 production in Y701 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that when the STAT signaling pathway is selectively blocked, IFN-γ can replace IL-3, acting as an essential growth factor for maintaining cell proliferation. More importantly, we examined other cell clones that derived from parental Ba/F3 cells. We found that the mutant Stat1 Y701F could block IFN-γ-mediated growth inhibiting effect and IFN-γ treatment could promote DNA replication in these cells (data not shown), indicating that the above results were not derived from a specific clonal effect. Each cytokine may induce a variety of signaling pathways. To understand the mechanisms of regulation of cell proliferation by the cytokines, it is necessary to investigate activation of signal proteins in response to these cytokines. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) or MAPKs are activated by many mitogenic cytokines and are believed to play a major role in mediating cell proliferation (3.Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). To examine ERK activity, Ba/F3-6, WT10, and Y701F1 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ or IL-3 for 15 min, and the whole cell lysates were analyzed with specific anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Fig.5 A). In all these cells, despite different STAT activities shown above, ERK1 and ERK2 were significantly phosphorylated and activated by IL-3 treatment, whereas no ERK phosphorylation was observed by IFN-γ treatment. The activation of ERKs in Y701F cells by IL-3 but not IFN-γ was confirmed by the Western blot with anti-ERK1/2 antibody showing shifted ERK1 and ERK2 proteins, which indicated induced-phosphorylation (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, because activation of Akt kinase was involved in cell survival (5.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar), we also examine whether this kinase is activated by IL-3 or IFN-γ in mutant Y701F cells. Using a specific anti-phospho-Akt antibody, we found that the Akt kinase was phosphorylated in response to IL-3 but not to IFN-γ (Fig.5 C). The above results are consistent with the observation that IL-3 has a strong mitogenic effect and is required for survival of the Ba/F3 cells, whereas IFN-γ may not activate mitogenic pathways involving ERKs and Akt. Although IFN-γ has anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities, we have shown above that IFN-γ also acts as a mitogen when Stat1 activity is inhibited (Figs. 3 and 4). We are specifically interested in finding genes induced by IFN-γ that have cell proliferative functions. After examining many potential genes involved in mitogenic stimulation, we found that both IL-3 and IFN-γ significantly induced c-Myc gene expression (Fig. 6). There are two important features of c-Myc mRNA induction by these two cytokines. First, c-Myc mRNA is induced within 30 min, indicating that c-Myc is probably a primary responsive gene in response to IL-3 and IFN-γ. Second, Unlike IRF-1, expression of c-Myc gene is induced at similar levels by IFN-γ in Ba/F3-6, WT10, and Y701F1 cells, suggesting that Stat1 activity is not required for c-Myc induction. Thus, in Y701F1 cells, the loss of Stat1 activity abolished expression of genes involved in the negative control of cell growth, such as IRF-1, but did not affect expression of c-Myc. Thus the potential mitogenic effect of IFN-γ becomes dominant in Y701F1 cells. We next asked whether c-Myc function is necessary for IFN-γ-induced cell proliferation in Y701F cells. It was previously shown that an insertion mutation C-terminal to the DNA binding basic domain (In373) results in nonfunctional c-Myc protein, which can exhibit a dominant-negative effect (27.Sawyers C.L. Callahan W. Witte O.N. Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We expressed this dominant-negative form of c-Myc in Y701F cells. Two representative clones (MycDN9 and MycDN22) were used, and the Myc protein expression was examined by Western blot (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3and 4). The c-Myc expression did not affect expression of mutant Y701F Stat1 in these cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and 7). Consistent with the suggestion that Myc function is essential, expression of the dominant-negative c-Myc protein diminished the cell proliferative effect induce"

https://openalex.org/W2084904109,"The supramolecular architecture of the basement membrane is provided by two enmeshed networks of collagen IV and laminin. The laminin network is maintained exclusively by interactions among individual laminin molecules and does not depend on the presence of other extracellular matrix components. Laminin polymers can be obtained in vitro either in solution or in association with the surface of bilayers containing acidic lipids. In this work, we have tested the hypothesis that the negative charges present on acidic lipids establish an acid microenvironment that is directly responsible for inducing laminin aggregation. Using light-scattering measurements, we show that laminin does not aggregate on vesicles of neutral lipids, whereas instantaneous aggregation occurs to progressively greater extents as the proportion of acidic phospholipids in the vesicles is increased. Aggregation of laminin induced by vesicles containing acidic phospholipids occurs very rapidly, so that maximal aggregation for each condition is reached within 1 min after laminin dilution. Aggregation depends on the presence of Ca2+ ions, is reversed by increasing ionic strength, and can be detected at laminin concentrations as low as 6 nm. In addition, we show that, in the absence of vesicles, acidification of the bulk solution can also induce laminin self-polymerization through a process that exhibits the same properties as lipid-induced polymerization. The fact that there is a correspondence between the processes of self-polymerization of laminin in acidic medium and in neutral medium but in the presence of vesicles containing negatively charged lipids leads us to propose that the microenvironment of an acidic surface may trigger the assembly of laminin networks. In vivo, such an acidic microenvironment would be provided by negatively charged sialic acid and sulfate groups present in the glycocalyx surrounding the cells. The supramolecular architecture of the basement membrane is provided by two enmeshed networks of collagen IV and laminin. The laminin network is maintained exclusively by interactions among individual laminin molecules and does not depend on the presence of other extracellular matrix components. Laminin polymers can be obtained in vitro either in solution or in association with the surface of bilayers containing acidic lipids. In this work, we have tested the hypothesis that the negative charges present on acidic lipids establish an acid microenvironment that is directly responsible for inducing laminin aggregation. Using light-scattering measurements, we show that laminin does not aggregate on vesicles of neutral lipids, whereas instantaneous aggregation occurs to progressively greater extents as the proportion of acidic phospholipids in the vesicles is increased. Aggregation of laminin induced by vesicles containing acidic phospholipids occurs very rapidly, so that maximal aggregation for each condition is reached within 1 min after laminin dilution. Aggregation depends on the presence of Ca2+ ions, is reversed by increasing ionic strength, and can be detected at laminin concentrations as low as 6 nm. In addition, we show that, in the absence of vesicles, acidification of the bulk solution can also induce laminin self-polymerization through a process that exhibits the same properties as lipid-induced polymerization. The fact that there is a correspondence between the processes of self-polymerization of laminin in acidic medium and in neutral medium but in the presence of vesicles containing negatively charged lipids leads us to propose that the microenvironment of an acidic surface may trigger the assembly of laminin networks. In vivo, such an acidic microenvironment would be provided by negatively charged sialic acid and sulfate groups present in the glycocalyx surrounding the cells. 2-(p-toluidinyl)naphtalene-6-sulfonic acid phosphatidylserine phosphatidylcholine Laminin, a large extracellular glycoprotein (850 kDa), is the major component of basement membranes (1.Timpl R.

These functions depend directly on the supramolecular organization of the basement membrane, which is ultimately determined by the interactions between laminin molecules and between laminin and other macromolecules. It has been postulated that the overall scaffold of the basement membrane is formed by two independently assembled networks of collagen IV and laminin, bridged by other extracellular matrix components such as entactin (18.Yurchenco P.D. Schittny J.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1577-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 19.Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Large three-dimensional laminin networks have been obtained in vitro through a Ca2+-dependent self-polymerization process, which is strictly dependent on a critical laminin concentration of 60 nm (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical and ultrastructural analyses of polymers obtained in vitro revealed properties similar to those of laminin networks produced by two different tumor models, the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor and cultured embryonic carcinoma cells (19.Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In 1991, Kalb and Engel (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that laminin polymerized in vitro upon binding to planar lipid bilayers and that lipid-induced polymerization occurred below the critical concentration reported previously for aggregation in solution (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerization was more effectively induced by bilayers containing negatively charged sulfatides than by bilayers of neutral phospholipids, which led the authors to propose that the density of negative charges on the surface could be critical for laminin binding and self-assembly (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have investigated the correlation between the density of negative charges on lipid surfaces and the extent of laminin polymerization as well as a possible mechanism by which negative lipids might affect polymerization. Using light-scattering and fluorescence measurements, we show that an increase in the ratio of acidic to neutral phospholipids leads to an increase in laminin polymerization and that the effect of negative lipid surfaces can be mimicked by acidification of the solution phase. We propose that a surface-restricted acidic environment provided by the negative lipids might serve as a substrate for self-assembly at low concentrations of laminin. Natural mouse laminin isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. TNS1 was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), phosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar (Alabaster, AL), phosphatidylserine and Triton X-100 were from Sigma, and hepel silane was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Light scattering was measured on an ISSPC-PCI spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) at 35 °C. The wavelength of the incident light was fixed at 400 nm, and scattered light was collected at 90° between 350 and 450 nm. In all experiments, aggregation was initiated by diluting laminin from a stock solution to the indicated concentrations in either 20 mmsodium acetate, pH 4, or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, to a final volume of 600 μl. Laminin stock solutions (1 mg/ml) were kept at 4 °C until dilution into assay media previously warmed to 35 °C in the sample compartment of the instrument. Under these conditions,i.e. at 4 °C, aggregates are not expected to form in stock solutions until the exact time when dilution in prewarmed buffer takes place (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of previously formed aggregates in laminin stock solutions was confirmed by the low values of light scattering obtained when laminin was diluted at pH 7.0 (see Fig. 4,dotted line). After the laminin addition, samples were gently mixed, and measurements were taken immediately. The whole procedure took approximately 1 min, which was the minimum time for light-scattering measurement after laminin dilution. Data were corrected by subtracting appropriate blanks containing buffer only or buffer plus variable amounts of phospholipid vesicles. Prior to use, cuvettes were pretreated with hepel silane for 12 h to avoid adherence of laminin to the quartz surface. Chloroform solutions of phospholipids, either pure or in mixtures of varying molar ratios of PS to PC, were evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipid films formed were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, to a final lipid concentration of 1 mm. The suspensions were vortexed vigorously for approximately 5 min. Small unilamellar vesicles were formed by sonicating the turbid suspensions using a Branson sonifier (Sonic Power Company, Danbury, CT) equipped with a titanium microtip probe. Sonication was carried out in an ice bath, alternating cycles of 20 s at 50% full power with 60-s resting intervals until a transparent solution was obtained (usually eight cycles). After sonication, vesicles were centrifuged for 4 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge in order to remove titanium released from the probe. Vesicle suspensions were added to buffer before dilution of laminin so as to give a final phospholipid concentration of 0.1 mm. Laminin was diluted to 60 nm in 20 mm of either sodium acetate, pH 4, or Tris-HCl, pH 7, and titrated with increasing concentrations of TNS (using 5 or 0.5 mm stock solutions in a 1:1 mixture of dimethylformamide and water). Fluorescence intensities were measured immediately after each addition of TNS on an ISSPC-PCI spectrofluorometer, using excitation at 385 nm and recording emission between 350 and 480 nm. Fluorescence data were corrected by subtracting blanks containing buffer plus varying amounts of TNS. Additionally, spectra were corrected for dilution. In order to determine whether the extent of lipid-induced polymerization of laminin depended on the density of negative charges present on the lipid surfaces, we compared laminin aggregation promoted by small lamellar phospholipid vesicles containing increasing ratios of negative (PS) to neutral (PC) phospholipids (Fig.1). Aggregation was followed by measuring light scattered at 90°, which correlates with the size of particles in solution (22.Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman and Co., New York1980: 832-842Google Scholar). Maximal light scattering (maximal laminin aggregation) was obtained when vesicles contained only PS. This value dropped by 90% when vesicles containing only PC were assayed (Fig.1 A). When light-scattering values obtained at 400 nm were plotted against the PS:PC ratio (Fig. 1 B), a gradual decrease was observed, suggesting that the extent of aggregation could be related to the density of negative charges on the vesicles. Interestingly, aggregation was complete within 1 min, which is the time necessary to add laminin to the solution containing the vesicles, mix, and carry out the light-scattering measurement. Thus, the rate of aggregation is much faster than that reported for aggregation in solution, which occurs in a time frame of several hours (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that laminin binds to a variety of lipids, including phospholipids such as PC or negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ramsden J.J. Biopolymers. 1993; 33: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If laminin bound simultaneously to more than one vesicle, it could cross-link several of these vesicles, giving rise to a multivalent network involving the two species (laminin molecules and vesicles). Such networks would also lead to an increase in light scattering, like that observed upon laminin addition in Fig. 1. In order to show that the increase in light scattering induced by the addition of laminin to the vesicle suspension was not due to vesicle aggregation but, instead, to the formation of aggregates involving laminin molecules only, we have investigated how solubilization of vesicles after the laminin addition would affect preformed aggregates. Fig. 2 shows that the addition of 0.1% of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was sufficient to totally disrupt PS vesicles (compare first and second bars). The addition of laminin to PS vesicles in the absence of detergent led to an increase in light-scattering intensity of ∼800 arbitrary units (compare first and third bars in Fig. 2). When Triton was added to preformed aggregates (PS vesicles plus laminin), light scattering decreased by only 50% (comparethird and fourth bars in Fig. 2). The remaining intensity, i.e. the light-scattering intensity of the detergent-resistant aggregates, was approximately 800 arbitraryunits, which is similar to the increase in light scattering observed when laminin was added to the vesicles. This result shows that the high molecular order aggregates that are formed when laminin is added to PS vesicles and are responsible for the increase in light scattering are preserved even after solubilization of the vesicles, which indicates that they do not contain vesicles but involve polymerization of laminin molecules only. Kalb and Engel (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that laminin aggregates promoted by sulfatide bilayers were disrupted by the addition of EDTA or by increasing the ionic strength, which suggests that those aggregates were stabilized by divalent cations and by electrostatic interactions. Fig.3 A shows that the addition of 5 mm EDTA to aggregates formed in the presence of PS vesicles completely reversed aggregation, reducing light-scattering to the value found for vesicles alone. When EDTA was present in the medium before the addition of laminin, formation of aggregates was 70% inhibited (Fig. 3 B). It is interesting to note that these experiments were carried out in the presence of contaminant Ca2+ (∼10−6m) and that the addition of 1 mm CaCl2 did not lead to any additional increase in light scattering (not shown). The addition of increasing concentrations of NaCl to aggregates obtained in the presence of PS vesicles led to a decrease in light scattering, indicating disruption of laminin aggregates (Fig.4). It is noteworthy that at 150 mm NaCl more than 90% of light scattering still remained, indicating that aggregates formed in these conditions may occur at physiological ionic strength. The addition of 2 m NaCl to aggregates obtained in the presence of vesicles of all phospholipid compositions assayed here (see Fig. 1) led to complete reversal of aggregation (data not shown). Laminin aggregation on lipid vesicles was proportional to the relative content of negatively charged phospholipids (PS) in the vesicles. This observation raised the possibility that the driving force for lipid-induced aggregation could be the electrostatic surface potential associated with the negative charges of the phospholipids. Nevertheless, a second interpretation for the above data would be that the stimulus triggering laminin polymerization was simply its binding to the lipid surface, with the negative charges being responsible only for increasing the affinity of laminin binding. A negative electrostatic potential, however, leads to a reduction of the pH in the vicinity of the membrane (24.Van der Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Thus, if the electrostatic potential contributes to lipid-induced aggregation of laminin, one could expect acidification of the bulk solution to mimic the effect of PS vesicles in promoting laminin polymerization. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether, in the absence of lipid surfaces, reducing the pH could induce formation of laminin aggregates with properties similar to those reported for polymers obtained using negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. Fig. 5 shows light-scattering records obtained immediately after laminin was diluted to 60 nm in either pH 4 (solid line) or pH 7 (dotted line) in the absence of phospholipid vesicles. When diluted in acidic buffer, laminin exhibited a 40-fold higher maximal light-scattering intensity than when diluted in neutral buffer. Light scattering remained constant for at least 1 h (not shown), indicating that, as observed for the aggregation induced by PS vesicles, acid-induced aggregation reaches its maximal level within the first minute after laminin dilution. This result shows that acidification can also induce instantaneous aggregation of lamininin vitro. Fig. 6 shows the pH dependence of the instantaneous aggregation of laminin. Polymerization was induced by diluting laminin in buffer at pH 4. Progressive alkalization of the medium was obtained by the stepwise addition of Tris-HCl (pH 10). Alkalization led to an initial increase in aggregation as the pH was raised from 4.0 to 4.5. Above pH 4.5, further alkalization promoted a progressive decrease in light scattering, indicating the disruption of laminin polymers. Half-maximal depolymerization was obtained approximately at pH 5.5. Among natural amino acids, histidine is the one with a pK a (∼6.0) closest to the one observed here. Thus, it is possible that histidine residues, presenting a slightly shifted pK a, are involved in the acid-triggered polymerization of laminin. In order to investigate whether the aggregates formed under acidic conditions presented properties similar to those obtained in the presence of acidic phospholipids, we evaluated the sensitivity of acid-induced laminin aggregates to EDTA and to increasing ionic strength. EDTA added to preformed aggregates promoted a decrease of 94% in light scattering (Fig.7 A), whereas the addition of EDTA to the medium prior to laminin dilution reduced formation of aggregates by 96% (Fig. 7 B). An interesting finding was that aggregation of laminin was not observed in the presence of EDTA at any pH in the range of 2–8. The fact that aggregation strictly depends on the presence of divalent cations rules out the possibility that the aggregation phenomenon induced by acidification corresponds to an unspecific precipitation of laminin at its isoelectric pH. Stepwise increase of ionic strength led to an initial abrupt 30% drop in light scattering, followed by a gradual decrease as the concentration increased up to 3.5 m NaCl (Fig.8). The data already presented show that aggregation of laminin is mediated by electrostatic interactions both at neutral pH in the presence of PS vesicles and at acid pH in solution. However, the profiles of NaCl dependence show clear differences between the two conditions. First, on PS vesicles no significant reversal of aggregation is observed at physiological ionic strength (Fig. 4), whereas in the case of acid-induced laminin aggregation, the addition of 150 mm NaCl promotes a 50% decrease in light scattering. A similar decrease occurs when laminin is diluted in acid buffer already containing 150 mm NaCl (data not shown). The second difference is that while 2 m NaCl was enough to completely disrupt laminin aggregates formed on PS vesicles (Fig. 4), a higher concentration (3.5 m) was necessary to totally reverse acid-induced aggregation (Fig. 8). The different sensitivities to ionic strength may reflect differences in the geometry of the aggregates, those obtained in solution being more likely to present a heterogeneous composition, including small aggregates highly sensitive to NaCl and tightly packed large aggregates with a greater contribution from three-dimensional interactions (see “Discussion”). Instantaneous aggregation at acid pH was assayed at different laminin concentrations. Fig. 9compares maximal light-scattering values obtained by diluting laminin at pH 4 and 7 (in the absence of vesicles), using laminin concentrations ranging from 6 to 60 nm. Light scattering increases upon acidification were observed at all laminin concentrations assayed. This result demonstrates that acidification leads to laminin polymerization in solution at concentrations below the critical concentration of 60 nm previously reported for polymerization at neutral pH (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar lack of critical concentration for aggregation had been reported in the case of polymerization occurring on sulfatide bilayers (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation of laminin induced by PS vesicles at neutral pH also occurred at protein concentrations below 60 nm (Fig.10), again indicating a correspondence between polymerization of laminin at acidic pH in solution and at neutral pH in the presence of vesicles containing acidic phospholipids.Figure 10Polymerization of laminin on PS vesicles occurs at low laminin concentrations. Light-scattering intensities were measured after laminin was diluted to various final concentrations in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing PS vesicles (0.1 mm phospholipids). The inset shows light-scattering records obtained for vesicles only (bottom line) and after the addition of 6 nm laminin (upper line). Data were corrected by subtracting blanks containing vesicles only. S.E. values result from three separate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Formation of large protein aggregates such as laminin polymers reported here could be associated with protein denaturation. In order to investigate the possibility that acid-induced aggregation of laminin resulted from a denaturation process, we examined binding to laminin of the conformation-sensitive fluorescent probe TNS. A nonfluorescent molecule when free in solution, TNS binds to hydrophobic pockets in proteins, and binding is accompanied by an increase in its fluorescence (25.Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, TNS did not bind to laminin (Fig.11, open circles). When pH was decreased to 4, TNS bound to laminin as revealed by a fluorescence increase of 800-fold for a saturating concentration of the probe (open squares). When laminin was previously denaturated by preincubation with 2 or 5m urea, TNS binding at acidic pH was abolished (closed circles and squares, respectively). These results demonstrate that laminin does not denature at acidic pH but instead undergoes a conformational change upon acidification that preserves its tertiary structure and also favors its fast polymerization in vitro. In this work, we report that acidification induces instantaneousin vitro self-assembly of laminin at concentrations below 60 nm, previously shown to be the critical concentration necessary for assembly in solution at neutral pH (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we show that the aggregation triggered by acid pH in solution, which does not involve laminin denaturation or isoelectric precipitation, exhibits properties similar to those observed when self-assembly occurs at neutral pH but on the surface of vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, namely (a) very fast kinetics, (b) lack of a detectable minimum concentration for aggregation, (c) requirement for divalent cations, and (d) destabilization by high ionic strength. The requirement for Ca2+ ions is a property shared with laminin aggregates obtained in solution at neutral pH (20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium has been shown to stabilize polymerization by binding to a specific laminin domain located at the end of one of the short arms (19.Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ binding, this domain probably undergoes a conformational change (26.Paulsson M. Saladin K. Landwehr R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that promotes its interaction with a neighboring laminin molecule. In the present work, aggregation of laminin onto phospholipid vesicles was followed by measuring increases in light scattering. Light-scattering intensity is proportional to the size of the species in solution; however, in principle this technique does distinguish between aggregation of vesicles and aggregation of laminin. Thus, the observed increase in total light scattering upon the addition of laminin to PS vesicles could be due to aggregation of laminin molecules, to aggregation of vesicles, or even to laminin-induced fusion of vesicles. The last possibility is ruled out by the observation that the addition of EDTA reverses the laminin-induced increase in light scattering (Fig. 3). It is known that Ca2+ promotes fusion of vesicles; thus, the addition of EDTA could prevent fusion but not reverse it. The second possibility, that laminin could be cross-linking PS vesicles, is also ruled out by the finding that solubilization of vesicles did not reverse the laminin-induced increase in light scattering (Fig. 2). Thus, the most likely interpretation is that PS vesicles trigger laminin aggregation without becoming an essential component of the aggregates. It is well established that laminin aggregation in solution at neutral pH takes place only at protein concentrations above 60 nm(18.Yurchenco P.D. Schittny J.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1577-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 20.Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of a critical concentration for laminin aggregation, as shown here, had been reported previously for laminin polymerization onto sulfatide bilayers (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it was proposed that, upon binding to the surface of the bilayer, laminin would reach a higher effective concentration. In the present study, however, aggregation at low laminin concentrations was also obtained in solution upon acidification. The latter observation leads us to conclude that the contribution of the lipid surfaces is not restricted to a concentration effect, resulting from cumulative binding of laminin to the lipids, but that it may also involve conformational transitions in laminin, triggered by the contact with the lipid surface. The observed parallel between the polymerization of laminin induced by acid and that induced by negatively charged lipids suggests that the electrostatic surface potential associated with the negative lipids may be the driving force for laminin polymerization. In fact, the predictable capacity of a negatively charged lipid surface to create a microenvironment of localized lower pH has been experimentally demonstrated using model vesicles of phosphatidylglycerol. The effective surface pH on these vesicles was determined to be approximately 2 units lower than the pH in bulk solution (24.Van der Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The biological events modulated by laminin are classically mediated by protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions, involving a variety of membrane-associated molecules ranging from protein receptors of the integrin family (27.Sonnemberg A. Linders C.J. Modderman P.W. Damsky C.H. Aumailley M. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 28.Ekblom P. Curr. Opin.

Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, adhesive properties of laminin have been shown to involve binding of the basement membrane protein to glycolipids on the cell surface. For instance, the capacity of laminin to agglutinate erythrocytes is known to involve its specific binding to sulfated glycolipids (33.Roberts D.D. Rao C.N. Magnani J.L. Spitalnik S.L. Liotta L.A. Ginsburg V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1306-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34.Taraboletti G. Rao C.N. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12253-12258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in order to promote neurite outgrowth, one of its best characterized properties, laminin binds to sialic acid-containing gangliosides present on the neuronal membrane (35.Laitinen J. Löppönen R. Merenmies J. Rauvala H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The microenvironment of the plasma membrane surface is occupied by the glycocalyx, the carbohydrate-rich region covering the cell surface. Membrane-associated glycoproteins as well as gangliosides possess negatively charged residues of sialic acid. In addition, sulfate groups of the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans may also contribute to the formation of an electrostatic potential, capable of reducing the local pH on the cell surface. We propose that a negative surface potential generated on the cell surface by the combined effect of all negatively charged molecules present in the glycocalyx is responsible for triggering laminin aggregation. A series of previous proposals appearing in the literature provide background support for our hypothesis. First, a negative electrostatic potential has been proposed to play a role in the modulation of the interaction between granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and cell-associated glycosaminoglycans (36.Wettreich A. Sebollela A. Carvalho M.A. Azevedo S.P. Borojevic R. Ferreira S.T. Coelho-Sampaio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31468-31475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, the electrostatic potential generated by sialic acid residues in gangliosides has been identified as being responsible for cell-substrate interactions mediated by fibronectin and laminin (37.Cheresh D.A. Pierschbacher M.D. Herzig M.A. Mujoo K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Finally, negatively charged sulfate groups have been shown to mediate the stimulatory effect of glycosaminoglycans on laminin aggregation (38.Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Schittny J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3981-3991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microstructural analysis of laminin aggregates formed in solution at neutral pH revealed that, under these conditions, self-assembly leads to large three-dimensional aggregates. The properties of these aggregates are similar to those found in collagen-free basement membranes of embryonic carcinoma cells and in the collagen-rich basement membranes of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumors (19.Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In both cases, however, laminin is present at micromolar concentrations (18.Yurchenco P.D. Schittny J.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1577-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), which are probably greater than the concentrations found under physiological conditions. Physiological membranes are 30–300 nm thick (39.Martinez-Hernandez A. Amenta P.S. Lab. Invest. 1983; 48: 657-677Google Scholar), which, considering the dimensions of the extended laminin molecule (∼110 × 70 nm; Ref. 40.Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A. Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rohde H. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), indicates that laminin deposits more likely correspond to sheet-like structures than to random three-dimensional aggregates. Kalb and Engel (21.Kalb E. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19047-19052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the plasma membrane of epithelial cells may function as a surface to orient laminin self-assembly into a two-dimensional arrangement. To their model we add the observation that self-assembly of laminin at low concentrations may be driven by a negative electrostatic potential arising from negative charges on membrane-associated molecules. This model acquires particular interest if we consider the time course of the physiological events, where laminin is the first extracellular matrix protein to be secreted (41.Cooper A.R. MacQueen H.A. Dev. Biol. 1983; 96: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,42.Dziadek M. Paulsson M. Timpl R. EMBO. J. 1985; 4: 2513-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and must therefore initiate its self-assembly process at low concentrations and in the absence of other basement membrane elements.

To study further the roles of c-Abl in HR DNA repair, we generated c-Abl −/− andATM −/−/c-Abl −/−mutant cell lines from a chicken B lymphocyte DT40 cell line, comparing the phenotypes of these mutants to those ofATM −/− DT40 cells that we had created previously. We found that the time course of radiation-induced Rad51 focus formation is abnormal in ATM −/− DT40 cells, consistent with the observation thatATM −/− DT40 cells display hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and highly elevated frequencies of both spontaneous and radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. In contrast, c-Abl −/− cells did not show these ATM-related defects in their cellular response to radiation, nor did the disruption of c-Abl in ATM −/−DT40 cells exacerbate these ATM-related defects. However,c-Abl −/− DT40 cells, but not ATM−/− DT40 cells, were resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis, indicating an important role for c-Abl in this cellular response to ionizing radiation. These results therefore indicate that, although ATM plays an important role in genome maintenance, c-Abl is not essential for this ATM function. These findings suggest that c-Abl and ATM play important roles in the maintenance of the cell homeostasis in response to DNA damage that are, at least in part, independent. c-Abl is activated by DNA damage in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent manner and plays important roles in growth arrest and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. c-Abl also interacts physically and functionally with Rad51, a key molecule in homologous recombinational (HR) DNA repair.

A predisposition to lymphoid malignancy and extreme radiosensitivity are other features of the disease. Cells derived from A-T patients are characterized by a high level of chromosomal abnormalities, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), and defective cell cycle regulation, suggesting that these cellular anomalies result from a disruption of the ATMgene. ATM is a member of the family of large proteins carrying a carboxyl-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain (1.Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 2.Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar); this family includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mec1, Tor1, and Tor2, Saccharomyces pombe Rad3, Drosophila melanogaster Mei-41, human ATR, and the catalytic subunit of the vertebrate DNA-dependent protein kinase, all of which have roles in cell cycle checkpoint control and/or DNA repair (3.Lehmann A.R.

Although the precise functions of ATM in the cellular reaction to DNA damage have remained unclear, recent work has shown ATM to directly bind (5.Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S.

Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) c-Abl, one of key effectors of this reaction. c-Abl, first identified as the cellular homologue of v-Abl from the Abelson murine leukemia virus (7.Abelson H.T. Rabstein L.S. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2213-2222PubMed Google Scholar), is ubiquitously expressed and shares certain structural features with the Src family of tyrosine kinases (8.Goff S.P. Gilboa E. Witte O.N. Baltimore D. Cell. 1980; 22: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). c-Abl binds p53, and over-expression of c-Abl is associated with growth arrest in the G1 phase by p53-dependent mechanisms (9.Goga A. Liu X. Hambuch T.A. Senechal K. Major E. Berk A.J. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that c-Abl-deficient cells exhibit resistance to apoptosis induced by IR, and over-expression of c-Abl induces apoptosis (11.Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated that c-Abl activates the p53-related p73 in the apoptotic response to DNA damage (12.Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 13.Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H-Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The results of these studies indicate, therefore, that c-Abl plays important roles in growth arrest and the apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Other signals dependent on c-Abl activation include induction of the stress-activated protein kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (14.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D.

Homologous recombinational (HR) DNA repair plays a fundamental role in genome maintenance following DNA damage. Two groups of investigators have recently demonstrated functional interactions of c-Abl with Rad51, which is a eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial recombinase RecA and plays a key role in HR DNA repair (16.Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17.Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). One study showed that c-Abl inhibits binding of Rad51 to DNA by phosphorylating it on tyrosine 54, indicating that c-Abl negatively regulates Rad51 to function as a recombinase (18.Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R. Sung P. Shinohara A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3799-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The other study showed that c-Abl phosphorylates Rad51 on tyrosine 315 and that this phosphorylation enhances the association of Rad51 with Rad52 (19.Chen G. Yuan S.S. Liu W. Xu Y. Trujillo K. Song B. Cong F. Goff S.P. Wu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), although a possible significance of this c-Abl-dependent Rad51/52 interaction in the Rad51 recombinase function remains obscure. To further study the roles of c-Abl in HR DNA repair, we generated c-Abl −/−and ATM −/−/c-Abl −/−mutant clones from DT40 cells and compared the phenotypes of these mutant DT40 cells with those of ATM −/− mutant DT40 cells that we had created recently (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). The results presented in this study indicate that, whereas ATM functions are essential for genome maintenance, as has been shown previously, ATM does not require c-Abl for its functions in DNA maintenance. A partial chicken c-Abl cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR with degenerative primers (5′-GGACACCATGGAGGTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGRTTCCAYTGCCARCANGC-3′) using mRNA extracted from DT40 cells. Using this cDNA fragment as a probe, chicken c-Abl genomic clones were isolated by screening an EMBL3 SP6/T7 genomic library made from the liver of an adult male Leghorn chicken (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using standard procedures. As shown in Fig. 1 A, c-Abl disruption constructs were made by replacing about 500 base pairs of the genomic sequence of the chicken c-Abl kinase region with selection marker gene cassettes under the control of the β-actin promoter. The cell culture conditions and DNA transfection procedures were as described previously (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). To generate c-Abl −/− mutant clones, one allele was disrupted by selection in medium containing 1 mg/ml histidinol (Sigma) after transfecting wild-type DT40 cells with pABL-his, and the other allele was disrupted by transfecting thec-Abl +/− mutant clones with pABL-puro, followed by selection with both histidinol and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). To generateATM −/−/c-ABL −/−double mutant clones, ATM −/− DT40 cells (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar) were sequentially transfected with c-Abl-targeting constructs containing histidinol or blasticidin-S resistant gene cassettes. Cells were then selected in medium containing histidinol after the first transfection and then both histidinol and 25 μg/ml blasticidin-S (Calbiochem) after the second transfection. RT-PCR analysis of chicken c-Abl and ATM mRNA expression was performed as described previously (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar), using the following primers: ATM, 5′-GTGGATCCCACAGGAAGATA-3′ and 5′-GTCAGCTTCATCCTCTGGTC-3′; c-Abl, 5′-GAGGACACCATGGAGGTGGAAGAGTTCTTG-3′ and 5′-GGAGAACTTGTTGTAGGCCAGGCTCTCTGG-3′. Rad51 foci were visualized using confocal microscopy (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad) of cells stained with an anti-Rad51 antibody as described previously (21.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sonoda E. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova O. Morrison C. Takata M. Shinohara A. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6430-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Untreated cells and cells that were γ-irradiated with 4 Gy at different times after treatment were analyzed. Following microscopy and image processing with Adobe Photoshop v5.0, color-inverted images were printed, and distinct Rad51 foci were counted. Measurement of surviving colonies and chromosomal aberrations following x-ray irradiation were carried out as described previously (22.Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). IR-induced apoptosis was quantified by FACS using an ApoAlert annexin V apoptosis kit (CLONTECH). For targeted disruption of c-Abl, targeting vectors (pABL-his and pABL-puro) were constructed by inserting selection-drug resistance gene cassettes into the c-Abl genomic sequence, as shown in Fig. 1 A. Successful targeted integration was confirmed by Southern blot analysis as the appearance of a novel 4-kilobase pair SacI genomic fragment (Fig.1 B). To generateATM −/−/c-Abl −/−mutant clones, two c-Abl disruption constructs, pABL-his and pABL-bsr, were sequentially transfected into ATM −/−mutant clones (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). The disruption of the ATM and c-Abl genes was finally verified by RT-PCR analysis (Fig.1 C). c-Abl, which is activated by ATM (6.Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), has been shown to phosphorylate Rad51 on tyrosine in response to DNA damage (18.Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of these findings in HR DNA repair is not yet clear, as c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation negatively affected Rad51 activity in one set of experiments (18.Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R. Sung P. Shinohara A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3799-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) but enhanced its association with Rad52 in another experiment (19.Chen G. Yuan S.S. Liu W. Xu Y. Trujillo K. Song B. Cong F. Goff S.P. Wu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To further study a possible role for c-Abl in HR DNA repair, we analyzed the appearance of Rad51 foci inATM −/− cells, as well as c-Abl −/− andATM −/−/c-Abl −/− DT40 cells, following γ-irradiation. Rad51 foci are subnuclear aggregates, believed to represent intermediate structures formed during the recombination required to repair radiation-induced or replication-associated DNA damage (23.Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 24.Haaf T. Raderschall E. Reddy G. Ward D.C. Radding C.M. Golub E.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25.Tashiro S. Kotomura N. Shinohara A. Tanaka K. Ueda K. Kamada N. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar). BecauseATM −/− DT40 cells displayed various double-stranded break (DSB) DNA repair defects, we first examined whether the loss of ATM function had any effect on this activity. We immunostained radiation-induced Rad51 foci at different times in wild-type and ATM-null DT40 cells and visualized them using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, the disruption of ATM led to a pronounced delay in the formation of Rad51 foci, further indicative of dysfunctional HR in ATM-deficient cells. However, in c-Abl −/− DT40 cells Rad51 foci formed at a normal rate, and there was no significant difference in Rad51 focus formation between ATM −/− andATM −/−/c-Abl −/− DT40 cells (Fig. 2). These results, although not in direct conflict with the demonstration that c-Abl inhibits binding of Rad51 to DNA (18.Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R. Sung P. Shinohara A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3799-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), are in contrast to the report that c-Abl enhances the association of Rad51 with Rad52 (19.Chen G. Yuan S.S. Liu W. Xu Y. Trujillo K. Song B. Cong F. Goff S.P. Wu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To analyze the DSB DNA repair capacity of c-Abl −/− DT40 cells, the wild-type and mutant clones on methylcellulose plates were irradiated with various x-ray doses, and the percentage of clones surviving was determined relative to the numbers of colonies arising on untreated plates. As shown in Fig. 3 A, ATM−/−DT40 cells were extremely x-ray-sensitive, as we have recently reported (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, c-Abl −/− DT40 cells did not exhibit hypersensitivity to x-ray, and c-Abl disruption did not enhance the x-ray sensitivity of ATM −/− DT40 cells (Fig. 3 A). To confirm the results of this x-ray sensitivity assay, we examined chromosomal aberrations in ATM −/− and c-Abl −/− DT40 cells following IR treatment. Because the HR DNA repair pathway is used to repair induced DNA damage in the S-G2 phase of the cell cycle (22.Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), we reasoned that an increase in induced chromosomal aberrations observed within 3 h after IR (i.e. cells irradiated during the S-G2phase of the cell cycle) would reflect a defect in the HR repair pathway. As shown in Fig. 3 B,ATM −/− DT40 cells displayed highly increased levels of chromosomal aberrations within 3 h of x-ray irradiation, as we have recently reported (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, no significant increase in chromosomal aberration frequencies was observed in c-Abl −/− DT40 cells compared with wild-type cells. In addition, disruption of c-Abl inATM −/− DT40 cells did not lead to an increase in the ATM-related defects in chromosomal maintenance (Fig.3 B). Although the above described results indicate that c-Abl disruption did not grossly impair a cell's DSB repair capacity, it was of interest to study the possible role of c-Abl in another important cellular response to IR, apoptosis (11.Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12.Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 13.Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H-Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis of IR-induced apoptosis, we monitored the initial phase of apoptosis, using annexin V staining at 4 h following irradiation and subsequent flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, the frequencies of spontaneous apoptosis were slightly but significantly increased in both ATM −/− andATM −/−/c-Abl −/− DT40 cells compared with wild-type cells. This slight increase in spontaneous apoptosis in ATM-deficient DT40 cells is consistent with our recent findings that ATM-deficient DT40 cells show a slight p53-independent proliferation impairment (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar), which presumably results from the elevated levels of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in these cells (Fig. 3 B) (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, whereas the amount of IR-induced apoptosis was slightly increased inATM −/− DT40 cells, IR-induced apoptosis was inhibited in c-Abl −/− DT40 cells. Furthermore, ATM disruption in c-Abl −/− DT40 cells did not result in enhancement of the IR-induced apoptosis but rather in inhibition (Fig. 4). These results indicate important roles for c-Abl in IR-induced apoptosis, in agreement with the results of recent studies in human and murine cells (11.Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12.Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y.

Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Finally, we examined the possibility that the observed defect in IR-induced apoptosis reflects a role for c-Abl in cell cycle checkpoint control. Because DT40 cells do not express p53, wild-type DT40 cells accumulate in the G2-M phase but not in the G1phase following IR, and ATM disruption results in defective IR-induced mitotic delay (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, normal IR-induced mitotic delay was observed in c-Abl −/− DT40 cells, and c-Abl disruption did not exacerbate the IR-induced defective mitotic delay ofATM −/− DT40 cells (data not shown). These results therefore preclude the possible involvement of G2-M checkpoint control abnormalities in the defective apoptic response in c-Abl-deficient DT40 cells. In the present study, we have shown that the accumulation of Rad51 foci was slower in ATM-deficient cells than in wild-type cells, although the number of foci increased with time and gradually exceeded those found in similarly treated wild-type cells. This latter increase in Rad51 foci has been noted in A-T cells (26.Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and may reflect the accumulation of un- or improperly repaired DNA lesions. Strikingly, the formation of foci of other DSB repair proteins, the Mre11-Rad50 complex, in response to irradiation of A-T cells, is severely compromised (26.Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), further indicating a possible defect in DNA repair capacity caused by ATM defects (27.Foray N.

However, although c-Abl, activated directly by ATM (6.Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.

In support of these results, DSB repair capacity in c-Abl-deficient cells was not grossly impaired as assessed by IR sensitivity and IR-induced chromosomal breakage analyses, although various DSB repair defects have been well documented in ATM-deficient cells (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). These results indicate therefore that, although ATM (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar) and Rad51 (17.Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) are indispensable in DSB repair in eukaryotic cells, there must be redundant functions for c-Abl in DSB repair, at least in chicken DT40 cells and mouse fibroblasts (29.Liu Z-G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that the c-Abl-related gene (30.Kruh G.D. Perego R. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) substitutes for c-Abl in the c-Abl −/− cells in genome maintenance or G2-M checkpoint control. In contrast to its redundant role in DSB repair, c-Abl appears to play an important role in IR-induced apoptosis. However, as DT40 cells do not express p53 (20.Takao, N., Kato, H., Mori, R., Morrison, C., Sonoda, E., Sun, X., Shimizu, H., Yoshioka, K., Takeda, S., and Yamamoto, K. (1999) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar), it is likely that the c-Abl targets in IR-induced apoptosis are p53-related effectors such as the recently described p73 (12.Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M.

These structures are composed of two distinct morphological elements: a more abundant amorphus core of which elastin, responsible for the elastic properties, is the major constituent; and microfibrillar structures of about a 10–12-nm diameter, which are located around the periphery of the amorphous component and consist primarily of fibrillin-1 and/or −2 (1.Sakai L.Y.

Whereas the amorphous elastic core is apparently poorly organized, fibrillin-containing microfibrils are highly organized structures. We had originally isolated from chicken aorta a protein, EMILIN,1 that is broadly expressed in connective tissues, and it is particularly abundant in blood vessels, skin, heart, lung, kidney, and cornea (14.Colombatti A. Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15.Colombatti A. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. Castellani I. Collagen Relat.

The protein is synthesized in vitro by chicken aorta smooth muscle cells and by tendon fibroblasts, it is deposited extracellularly as a fine network (17.Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Colombatti A. Volpin D. J. Biol Chem. 1983; 258: 13262-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol.

Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17534-17540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMILIN is found mainly at the interface between amorphous elastin and microfibrils (19.Bressan G.M. Daga-Gordini D. Colombatti A. Castellani I. Marigo V. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and its function might be to regulate the formation of the elastic fiber because the addition of EMILIN antibodies in the culture medium of smooth muscle cells greatly affects the process of elastin deposition at least in vitro (19.Bressan G.M. Daga-Gordini D. Colombatti A. Castellani I. Marigo V. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The structural components of elastic fibers are defective in some heritable human syndromes: supra valvular aortic stenosis is associated with elastin gene defects (20.Li D.Y. Toland A.E. Boak B.B. Atkinson D.L. Ensing G.J. Morris C.A. Keating M.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the Marfan's syndrome, one of the most frequent genetic disorders, is associated with defects in the fibrillin-1 gene (21.Dietz H.C. Cutting G.R. Pyeritz R.E. Maslen C.L. Sakai L.Y. Corson G.M. Puffenberger E.G. Hamosh A. Nanthakumar E.J. Curristin S.M. Stetten G. Meyers D.A. Francomano C.A. Nature. 1991; 352: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), and congenital contractural arachnodactyly has been linked to the fibrillin-2 gene (22.Putnam E.A. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Milewicz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, of the numerous heritable syndromes with clear alteration of elastic fibers listed in the Online Mendelian Inherited in the Man data base, most have not been linked to any gene yet. Recently also the cDNA of human EMILIN has been cloned (23.Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and its structure revealed a unique modular organization. The presumed mature protein is composed of 991 amino acids and consists of a C terminus C1q-like globular domain (gC1q-like) endowed with cell adhesion-promoting functions, a short uninterrupted collagenous stalk, and a long segment of about 650 residues containing at least four heptad repeats with a high potential for forming coiled-coil α-helices and two leucine zippers. At the N terminus there is a cysteine-rich sequence stretch characterized by the presence of a partial epidermal growth factor-like motif and highly homologous to a region of multimerin, a platelet and endothelial cell component (24.Hayward C.P.M. Hassell J.A. Denomme G.A. Rachubinski R.A. Brown C. Kelton J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18246-18251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The presence of a gC1q-like domain and the recent identification that gC1q is structurally homologous to the tumor necrosis factor family of growth factors (25.Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) allowed the inclusion of EMILIN in the C1q/tumor necrosis factor superfamily of proteins. Given the distribution of the protein and the characteristics of its domains, a proposed function for EMILIN might be that it plays a fundamental role in the process of elastogenesis also in vivo and in mediating cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Thus, the knowledge of the regulation of the EMILIN gene could provide us with tools to understand the molecular mechanisms of its expression, whereas the characterization of the EMILIN gene and of eventual molecular markers would help investigate the potential association of EMILIN with heritable elastic fiber disorders. In the current study, we have elucidated the primary structure of the human EMILIN gene, established the chromosomal position, and generated preliminary data on the function of the human proximal promoter as well as defined the general organization of the murine EMILIN gene. A human genomic BAC library was screened for EMILIN gene-specific clones at Genome System using a cDNA fragment prepared by PCR and corresponding to the 3′-end of EMILIN (HEM-3′, from position 2580 to position 3048 of the cDNA as numbered in the GenBankTM/EBI DNA data base, accession number AF088916. Two positive clones, hBAC-A and hBAC-B, were identified and further characterized. Both isolated clones were authenticated by successful PCR reamplification of insert fragments with a range of primer pairs derived from EMILIN cDNA sequences and partially characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot. For each restriction endonuclease, 10 μg of DNA was digested to completion and the resulting fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters containing the transferred DNA were hybridized in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under stringent conditions to 32P-labeled human EMILIN cDNA probes HEM-3′ and HEM-5′, the latter extending from position 240 to position 900 of the cDNA. Appropriate restriction fragments (B1, B2, and B3) were gel purified and subcloned in the pGEM 7z+ vector for further analysis (Fig. 1). A similar approach but with homologous cDNA probes was followed to identify the murine gene and to characterize the single BAC clone containing the entire EMILIN gene. Sequencing of exons, introns, and gene flanking regions was carried out on purified subclones or, in some cases, directly on the BAC clones, using the dRhodamine Kit (Perkin-Elmer). All reported sequences have been confirmed by sequencing of both strands. Northern blot was performed using a human multiple tissue blot from CLONTECH. A32P-labeled probe was synthesized using as template the HEM-3′ clone and the multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in Rapid-hyb buffer. All the other procedures were performed using standard techniques. The 5′-RACE Kit for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of human uterus total RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (40 units) and 10 pm of the reverse primer RACE1 (positions +248 to +270 of the EMILIN gene) (see Fig. 6). The first-strand cDNA was purified using a glass fiber spin cartridge (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and oligo(dA)-tailed using terminal transferase (Promega Corp.). The cDNA was amplified by PCR through two rounds of 40 cycles each at 95, 50, and 72 °C using the oligo(dT)-anchor primer provided with the kit as the sense primer and with RACE2 (first round, positions +149 to +168) and RACE3 (second round, positions +118 to +138) as antisense primers. The resulting amplification products were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega Corp.) and sequenced. To confirm the results obtained by the RACE technique, additional PCR experiments were performed with two sense primers (TSPE, positions −18 to −1 and TSPI, positions +1 to +20) located immediately upstream and downstream from the transcription initiation site, in combination with an antisense primer located in exon 2 (TSPR, positions +1646 to +1660), using the same template as in the RACE experiments. To study the regulation of the human EMILIN gene proximal promoter, transient transfection experiments were performed with various promoter 5′-deletion fragments cloned into the promoterless vector (pGL3-Basic) (Promega Corp.). Regions of the EMILIN proximal promoter were amplified by PCR using sense primers with a KpnI-containing tail (P1 to P6 in Fig. 6) and an antisense primer with aSacI-containing tail (RP1 in Fig. 6). PCR products were double-digested to create cohesive ends and all fragments were purified by a Qiagen midi prep kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) before ligation into identical sites in the pGL3-Basic. Large scale plasmid isolation and purification was carried out using the Qiagen maxi prep kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). Plasmids were quantified by both spectrophotometer and ethidium bromide-agarose gel. Transient cell transfection of the human RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and of primary cultures of chicken embryo tendon fibroblasts were performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cultured cells at about 80% confluence were co-transfected in a 6-well plate with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA and with 0.2 μg of the pEGFP (CLONTECH) plasmid DNA to monitor for transfection efficiency. In each experiment pGL3-Basic and pGL3-luc, in which the luciferase gene was driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer, were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The −1200/+160 reference constructs were transfected in parallel with the other EMILIN promoter constructs. Each promoter construct was transfected in triplicates in at least three different experiments. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and the fluorescence activity of the co-transfected pEGFP vector was measured in situ with a fluorometer (Tecan AG, Switzerland). The cells were then harvested by scraping, lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and tested for luciferase activity. Screening of the human genomic BAC library with a human EMILIN cDNA probe led to the identification and purification of two clones, hBAC-A (58 kb) and hBAC-B (33 kb), which yielded PCR products of the expected size when amplified using several EMILIN cDNA-specific oligonucleotide primers. The authenticity of clones hBAC-A and hBAC-B was definitively proved by successful direct sequencing using primers in the coding region of EMILIN. For better sequencing some subclones were prepared by digesting the clones hBAC-A and hBAC-B with a panel of restriction endonucleases followed by Southern blot and filter hybridization with probes derived from different regions of the EMILIN cDNA. One SalI fragment (A.1) derived from clone hBAC-A and BamHI andHindIII fragments derived from clone hBAC-B (B.1 and B.3, respectively) (Fig. 1) were subcloned in the pGEM 7 vector and entirely sequenced. To overcome some sequencing problems, an additional clone (B.2) was obtained by PCR using as template clone hBAC-B and primers 35 and 37 (Fig. 1). The subclones generated from the hBAC clones overlapped and covered the entire EMILIN gene. This was assessed by a series of successful PCRs performed with a set of primers that amplified the expected regions at the extremities of the EMILIN cDNA. Furthermore, clone B.3 contained additional 1371 bp upstream of the translation start site (see Fig. 6), that included the 5′-untranslated region and at least part of the EMILIN promoter region (see below). The exon/intron boundaries of the protein-coding region of the EMILIN gene were identified by comparison with the cDNA sequence (23.Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Considering the size of the coding sequence (about 3 kb) the EMILIN gene is remarkably compact, spanning only about 8.0 kb in length. It is organized in 8 exons interrupted by 7 introns (Fig.2). Introns vary in length from 151 to 1126 bp and exons vary from 17 to 1929 bp. The average size of the exons is 500 bp and that of introns 550 bp, resulting in an overall coding capacity for this gene close to 50%, a percentage significantly higher than the average of 10% found in most vertebrate genes. The genomic organization of few constituents of the elastic fiber are known, and it is quite distinct from that of EMILIN. For instance, the microfibril-associated glycoprotein-2 has a cDNA size of about 1 kb, and its genome is around 10 kb (26.Hatzinikolas G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol.

The translation initiation codon of EMILIN is in exon 1, and the last exon contains 380 bp of noncoding sequences. Furthermore, all the sequences at the exon/intron boundaries are in full agreement with the consensus rules established for the canonical splice donor and acceptor sites of vertebrate genes (Fig. 3) and with the exception of the first two introns, that are in phase 2, all the other introns are in phase 1.Figure 3Sequences of the intron:exon junctions of the human EMILIN gene.

As schematized in Fig.4 A, the first exon contains the 5′-untranslated region and the signal peptide, and the cysteine-rich region showing homology to the N terminus of the blood protein multimerin is shared between exon 2 and part of exon 3. Instead, a remarkable correlation between gene structure and protein domains is evident in the very large exon 4, which includes a cluster of four coiled-coil structures and of two leucine zippers; the 5′- and 3′-exon borders correspond exactly to the beginning of the first coiled-coil stretch and to the end of the second leucine zipper, respectively. As both coiled-coil and leucine zipper structures might be involved in interchain association, this large exon might represent a sort of functional unit. The organization in this part of the gene resembles that found in many extracellular matrix genes in which often one or more protein domains are encoded within a single exon (for a review see Ref. 34.Bork P. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, the collagenous region is encoded by exon 5, 6 and part of 7, whereas the gC1q-like domain is splitted between exons 7 and 8, the latter containing also the 3′-untranslated sequence. As a preliminary effort to prepare constructs suitable for homologous recombination in ES cells, the murine EMILIN gene has also been isolated from a BAC library. A single clone of about 100 kb was identified in the screening, and the EMILIN gene was then characterized and completely sequenced 2P. Bonaldo and R. Doliana, unpublished data. and is schematically shown in Fig. 4. The murine gene is remarkably similar to the human gene; not only is the size of the exons (except for the first and the last that have not been completely characterized yet) almost identical between the two species, but also the size of the introns is nearly superimposable. Searches of the GenBankTM/EBI DNA data base showed a virtual identity between the 3′-end of the EMILIN gene and the 5′-end of the human ketohexokinase (KHK) promoter (35.Hayward B.E. Bonthron D.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The homology extends for 659 bp, and there are very few mismatches, likely because of polymorphisms and/or sequence reading errors. Fusion artifacts in the BAC clones used can be excluded as the same type of homology has been found in the kidney λgt10 clones used to characterize the EMILIN cDNA (23.Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, a CA dinucleotide repeat sequence, independently localized about 5 kb upstream of the KHK gene (36.Hayward B.E. Fantes J.A. Warner J.P. Intody S. Leek J.P. Markham A.F. Bonthron D.T. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), corresponds to the one found here by us in intron 3 of the EMILIN gene (see Fig. 4 A). Because the human KHK and the closely linked glucokinase regulatory protein genes have been mapped on chromosome 2p23, between the markers D2S305 and D2S165 (36.Hayward B.E. Fantes J.A. Warner J.P. Intody S. Leek J.P. Markham A.F. Bonthron D.T. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we can conclude that EMILIN and KHK lie in close proximity in a head-to-tail orientation, the EMILIN gene being localized upstream of the KHK gene with its 3′-end overlapping with the 5′-end of the promoter region of the KHK gene (Fig. 4 B). In addition, a similar KHK glucokinase regulatory protein gene organization has been found in the mouse and in the rat (35.Hayward B.E. Bonthron D.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have evidence, based on sequencing of the murine BAC clone, that indeed the murine EMILIN gene is similarly localized in close proximity to the KHK gene. Mapping of human YAC contigs indicated that the KHK gene lies <400 kb downstream from the phosphatase gene PPP1CB (36.Hayward B.E. Fantes J.A. Warner J.P. Intody S. Leek J.P. Markham A.F. Bonthron D.T. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37.Hayward B.E. Warner J.P. Dunlop N. Fantes J. Intody S. Leek J. Markham A.F. Bonthron D.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); however, the murine homolog of human PPP1CB maps, like several other human genes located on 2p, to mouse chromosome 12D (38.Saadat M. Kakinoki Y. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Yoshida M.C. Jpn. J. Genet. 1994; 69: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, the co-localization of KHK and glucokinase regulatory protein genes on mouse chromosome 5 (39.Wightman P.J. Hayward B.E. Bonthron D.T. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 700-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), despite their nonsyntenic relationship with PPP1CB, represents a strong indication that the murine EMILIN gene might be similarly localized to chromosome 5. A blot containing poly(A+) RNA of human tissues was hybridized with the EMILIN cDNA probe HEM-3′ and the results indicated that several tissues including heart, aorta, small intestine, colon, lung, kidney, uterus, and ovary gave a positive signal, whereas all parts of the brain analyzed were consistently negative (data not shown). Next, Northern blots of poly(A+) RNAs from selected human tissues were hybridized with the same probe as above and a single transcript of approximately 4 kb was detected (Fig. 5). The size of this transcript is in accord with the size of the reported cDNA (23.Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol.

We replaced the equivalent β-Thr159 of the chromatophore F0F1 ATP synthase of Rhodospirillum rubrum with Ser, Ala, or Val and the Glu184 with Gln or Lys. The mutant β subunits were isolated and tested for their capacity to assemble into a β-less chromatophore F0F1 and restore its lost activities. All of them were found to bind into the β-less enzyme with the same efficiency as the wild type β subunit, but only the β-Thr159 → Ser mutant restored the activity of the assembled enzyme. These results indicate that both Thr159and Glu184 are not required for assembly and that Glu184 is indeed essential for all the membrane-bound chromatophore F0F1 activities. A detailed comparison between the wild type and the β-Thr159 → Ser mutant revealed a rather surprising difference. Although this mutant restored the wild type levels and all specific properties of this F0F1 proton-coupled ATP synthesis as well as Mg- and Mn-dependent ATP hydrolysis, it did not restore at all the proton-decoupled CaATPase activity. This clear difference between the ligands for Mg2+ and Mn2+, where threonine can be replaced by serine, and Ca2+, where only threonine is active, suggests that the β-subunit catalytic site has different conformational states when occupied by Ca2+ as compared with Mg2+. These different states might result in different interactions between the β and γ subunits, which are involved in linking F1 catalysis with F0proton-translocation and can thus explain the complete absence of Ca-dependent proton-coupled F0F1catalytic activity.

These complexes are composed of a membrane-intrinsic F0 sector, which mediates proton translocation, and an extrinsic F1 sector, which carries the catalytic sites. All isolated F1 complexes are composed of five subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδε (1.Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

The three catalytic β subunits show a clear difference in bound nucleotides resulting in different conformational states. The asymmetric structure imposed on this hexamer by the interaction of the γ-subunit with these different β-subunits, supports the binding change mechanism (8.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), which proposed that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis involve transitions between different but interacting catalytic sites via rotation of the γ subunit relative to an α3β3 subassembly. Several models suggested that proton-translocation through F0 results in a coupled rotation of the F0-c and F1-γ subunits (8.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

However full elucidation of the detailed mechanism of action of the F0F1 ATP synthase will depend on identification of the specific residues and/or whole domains that participate in proton-coupled ATP synthesis and hydrolysis as well as in the regulation of these reversible activities. Tight regulation of ATP hydrolysis is especially important in photosynthetic organisms where it prevents the depletion of essential cellular ATP pools in the dark (3.McCarty R.E. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

F1-α, β, and γ subunits from photosynthetic sources are therefore very interesting targets for mutational analysis, based on the available MF1 crystal structure, of amino acid residues participating in coupled catalysis and its regulation. The F1-α and β subunits of the photosynthetic bacteriumRhodospirillum rubrum are most suitable for such studies. RrF1β1 was isolated in large amounts from the chromatophore membrane-bound RrF0F1 by a specific LiCl treatment (15.Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D.

Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar) inEscherichia coli cells lacking the whole uncoperon. The recombinant WT RrF1β was found to be as active as the native β-subunit (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in a large number of earlier developed in vitro assays, including the binding of nucleotides (19.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1022-1028Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and rebinding to the β-less RrF0F1 resulting in restoration of both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities (15.Philosoph S.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The rebinding of the highly purified native and WT RrF1β subunits was, however, found to require the presence of small amounts of RrF1α (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which were released with the bulk of the β subunit from the LiCl-treated chromatophores (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar, 20.Andvalojc P.J. Harris D.A. Biochim.

This finding provided a direct assay also for the isolated α-subunit. It has been used to follow the refolding of the recombinant RrF1α, expressed only in insoluble inclusion bodies (22.Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 27-30Google Scholar), into a functional monomer that assembles with the WT RrF1β monomer into active α1β1 dimers (23.Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). If the released α/β ratio can be controlled, the α-depleted β-less chromatophores together with the recombinant RrF1α and β monomers could provide suitable systems for studying the effect of mutagenized α as well as β on the in vitro assembly and activity of both the membrane-bound F0F1 and soluble F1 complexes. In this investigation we have defined the conditions for LiCl treatment of R .rubrum chromatophores that release the bulk of their RrF1β together with specific amounts of RrF1α. β-less chromatophores, which lost at least a third of this α subunit were used for preparing hybrid RrF0F1/CF1 complexes containing either only CF1β or CF1β and at least one copy of CF1α (50.Tucker W.C. Du Z. Hein R. Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 906-912Google Scholar). β-less chromatophores containing 90% of their α subunit were used here for testing the effect of mutations in RrF1β-Thr159 and Glu184, which are equivalent to MF1β-Thr163 and Glu188 in the catalytic nucleotide binding site (7.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). These fully conserved F1β residues have been mutated only in respiratory F1-ATPases (6.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), except for the equivalent CF1β-Thr168 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which has recently been mutated to serine and shown to increase dramatically the MgATPase activities of the soluble CF1 and α3β3γ complexes (24.Hu D. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our studies revealed that in the membrane-bound F0F1 the RrF1β-T159S, but not the T159A or T159V, could restore the proton-coupled Mg- and Mn-dependent ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities to the extent restored by WT RrF1β. Moreover, even the active β-T159S did not restore the proton-decoupled CaATPase activity. These results indicate that the conserved WT β-Thr159 is an absolutely essential ligand for Ca2+, which could not be replaced even by serine. The RrF1β-E184Q and E184K mutants did bind to the β-less chromatophores, but the assembled mutant RrF0F1s were completely inactive. R. rubrum cells were grown as described previously (15.Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli LM3115 strain (25.Jensen P.R. Michelsen O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7635-7641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lacking the unc operon was used as host for the recombinant plasmids (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar) carrying the WT and mutated RrF1β genes. This strain was found to express large amounts of RrF1β as a soluble protein when grown in LB medium, supplemented as described by Nathanson and Gromet-Elhanan (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), at 22 °C to about A 0.65. The RrF1β-Thr159 mutants were obtained by a modification of the PCR-based mutagenesis method of Ho et al. (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). For each mutation the start and end fragments of the cloned WT RrF1β gene (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar) were amplified separately in two independent PCR reactions, using the start-forward primer with the earlier introduced EcoRI site (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar), and the reverse primer with a newly introduced BamHI site. Each PCR reaction contained a complementary mutagenic primer (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The following mutagenic primers for T159V, T159A, and T159S-forward were, respectively: 5′-C-GTC-GGC-AAG-GT A - GTA -CTG-ATC-CAG-G-3′; 5′-C-GTC-GGC-AAG-GC A -GTA -CTG-ATC-CAG-G-3′ and 5′-C-GTC-GGC-AAG-TC A -GTA -CTG-ATC-CAG-G-3′; and for T159V, T159A and T159S-reverse were, respectively: 5′-C-CTG-GAT-C AG - TAC - T AC-CTT-GCC-GAC-G-3; 5′-C-CTG-GAT-CAG - TAC - T GC-CTT-GCC-GAC-G-3′ and 5′-C-CTG-GAT-CAG - TAC - T GA-CTT-GCC-GAC-G-3′. Each primer contained a new, underlined site for ScaI, introduced by two base changes, indicated by bold letters as the bases changed to give the Val, Ala, or Ser codons. Amplification was carried out as described earlier (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar), except that 50 pmol of each set of primers, 4 ng of pBSKS+-WTβ, and 1.25 units ofPwo DNA polymerase were used, in the buffer supplied with the enzyme. The two amplified fragments of each mutated gene were cut by EcoRI and ScaI or ScaI andBamHI, ligated with each other and with the pBSKS+ plasmid between its EcoRI andBamHI sites. The resulting recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli HB101 cells (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar), and plasmids fromamp-resistant colonies were screened for the mutations byScaI restriction analysis and by full DNA sequencing. All three mutants had only the above stated nucleotide changes. For mutagenesis of RrF1β-Glu184, the pBSKS+-WTβ plasmid (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli CJ236 and single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was prepared after infection with helper phage VCS M13 (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel et al. (28.Kunkel T.A. Benebek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotides to introduce the β-E184Q and E184K mutations, respectively: 5′-GCC-CTC-ACG-CGT -GCG-CTG-GCC-GAC-GCC-G and 5′-GCC-CTC-ACG-CGT -GCG-CTT-GCC-GAC-GCC-G. They also contained a new, underlined site for MluI, introduced by a single base change, indicated by a bold letter as the bases changed to give the Glu or Lys codons. The mutagenized DNA was transformed into E. coli HB101 cells, and the mutations were confirmed by MluI restriction analysis and full DNA sequencing. The β-E184K gene had only the stated mutation. However, β-E184Q had one additional change in nucleotide 249, altering the codon from GGC to GGT, both coding for glycine. All the expressed WT and mutant RrF1β subunits were isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction of the E. coli LM3115 cells and purified as described previously (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). LiCl treatment of the chromatophores was carried out as outlined by Gromet-Elhanan and Khananshvili (16.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 1 mm protease inhibitor PMSF was present in the final 1.9 m LiCl buffer, and the concentration of the treated chromatophores was varied as stated in the text. The LiCl supernatant was separated from the treated chromatophores, and the dissolved 60% ammonium sulfate precipitate (16.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar, 30.Flings S.P.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dr. Ora Goldberg (Biological Services, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA polymerase, and ligase were from New England Biolabs.Pwo DNA polymerase, dNTP, and pBTacI were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Plasmid pBSKS+ and helper phage VCS M13 were from Stratagene. [32P]Piwas obtained from the Nuclear Research Center, Negev, Israel. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Earlier preparations of β-less chromatophores were obtained by treatment with 2m LiCl and no added protease inhibitors (16.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar treatments of spinach (35.Avital S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7317-7320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) chloroplasts were also found to release some CF1α together with all the CF1β. Furthermore Western immunoblots probed with antibodies raised against spinach CF1α and β subunits revealed that some of the released CF1α was nicked by proteases and ran in SDS-PAGE together with the β subunit. This proteolysis was fully blocked only in the presence of a mixture of three protease inhibitors (37.Sokolov M. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since antibodies against CF1α show no cross-reaction with RrF1α (50.Tucker W.C. Du Z. Hein R. Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 906-912Google Scholar), we have raised antibodies against RrF1α and found proteolyzed RrF1α in LiCl extracts of earlier treated chromatophores. Addition of 1 mm PMSF blocked completely this proteolysis, thus enabling a clear determination of the relative amounts of the RrF1α and β subunits released from chromatophores treated by 1.9 m LiCl at 0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 mg of BChl/ml (Fig. 1, lanes 2–4). About 0.65, 0.32, and 0.13 of their RrF1α were, respectively, released as compared with practically all their β subunit (Fig. 1 and Fig.2, lane 5). Chromatophores treated with LiCl at 1.2 mg of BChl/ml were used for evaluating the effect of the β-T159 and β-E184 mutants when reconstituted with the various β subunits in presence of RrF1α at a ratio of α/β of 0.2.Figure 2Binding of WT and Thr159 mutant RrF1β to the β-less chromatophores.

Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The parallel MF1β Oγ-T163 was identified in the crystal structure as a ligand to Mg2+ (7.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). In the GTP-binding Ras protein, a serine, which replaces the threonine in this sequence, was also found to be a ligand to Mg2+ (39.Tong L. deVos A.M. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have mutated the RrF1β-Thr159 into serine (β-T159S) as well as alanine (β-T159A) or valine (β-T159V). All of them were found to assemble into the β-less R. rubrumchromatophores as efficiently as WT RrF1β (Fig. 2,lanes 1–4). However, the RrF1β-T159V and T159A mutants were unable to restore any ATP synthesis or hydrolysis activities, whereas the RrF1β-T159S mutant restored ATP synthesis as well as Mg- and Mn-dependent ATP hydrolysis (Figs.3 and4).Figure 4Divalent cation requirement of ATP hydrolysis restored in β-less chromatophores reconstituted with WT and mutant RrF1β at position 159. Washed chromatophores reconstituted with WT (■), T159S (▴), T159A (○), and T159V (⋄) were assayed for restored ATP hydrolysis using 4 mm ATP and the indicated concentrations of MgCl2 (A), MnCl2 (B), and CaCl2 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ATP synthesis restored by the β-T159S was similar or slightly higher than the WT rate and showed a similar MgCl2requirement (Fig. 3). Values of K m of 173 and 238 μm MgCl2 and V max of 352 and 429 μmol of ATP formed/h per mg of BChl were calculated for chromatophores reconstituted with the WT and the T159S mutant, respectively. The maximal rate of this restored ATP synthesis, as that observed in control R. rubrum chromatophores (14.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was obtained at MgCl2 concentrations below 10 mmand Mg2+/ADP ratios below 5. At 40 mmMgCl2, the rates restored by the WT and T159S mutant were inhibited by 50% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 3). The lower sensitivity of the mutant to inhibition by increasing MgCl2concentrations could explain its capacity to restore somewhat higher maximal rates of ATP synthesis. A very similar pattern was observed also for restoration of MgATPase activities by the WT and T159S mutant (Fig. 4 A). Mg- and Mn-dependent ATP hydrolysis in control R. rubrumchromatophores (14.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), as in β-less chromatophores reconstituted with WT RrF1β (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), were reported to be much more sensitive to inhibition by excess free Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions than their respective ATP synthesis activities. This difference in sensitivity provides the basis for the tight regulation of ATP hydrolysis in photosynthetic organisms, which enables them to limit the depletion of essential cellular ATP pools in the dark (2.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-839Google Scholar, 3.McCarty R.E. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 477-500Google Scholar). Chromatophores reconstituted with the RrF1β-T159S mutant retained this tight regulation more efficiently in presence of MgCl2 than in presence of MnCl2 (Fig. 4, compare A and B). Control chromatophores show no ATP synthesis in the presence of Ca2+, and their CaATPase, unlike the Mg- and Mn-dependent ATPase activities, is not coupled to proton-translocation. It is instead decoupled, since the presence of CaATP does not inhibit the light-induced, electron transport-triggered proton translocation (14.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was therefore rather surprising that the β-T159S mutant, which restored the proton-coupled ATP synthesis as well as the Mg- and MnATPase activities as efficiently as the WT RrF1β (Figs. 3 and 4, A and B), did not restore at all the proton-decoupled CaATPase activity (Fig.4 C). β-T159S was in this specific assay similar to the completely inactive β-T159V and T159A mutants rather than to the WT RrF1β. These results revealed a clear difference between the ligands for Mg2+ and Mn2+, where threonine could be replaced by serine, and for Ca2+, where only threonine is active. Anions, such as sulfite, were found to stimulate the MgATPase activities of control (40.Webster G.D. Edwards P.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as well as β-less chromatophores reconstituted with the WT RrF1β (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The MgATPase activity restored by the RrF1β-T159S mutant was also stimulated by sulfite although somewhat less than that restored by the WT β subunit (Fig. 5). A similar effect was observed also with the MnATPase activity (TableI). The two other β-T159A and β-T159V mutants did not restore any activity even in the presence of 100 mm sulfite (Fig. 5).Table IComparison of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities restored in β-less chromatophores reconstituted with WT and RrF1β-T159 and β-E184 mutantsAssayed activitiesActivities restored by the following RrF1β subunitsWTT159SE184K or E184Qμmol/h per mg BchlATP synthesis340390<0.1MgATPase110124<0.1MgATPase + sulfite320205<0.1MnATPase11585<0.1MnATPase + sulfite350220<0.1CaATPase57<1<0.1Conditions for reconstitution of the β-less chromatophores were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Restored ATP synthesis was assayed as described in Fig. 3, with 5 mmMgCl2, and ATP hydrolysis as described in Fig. 4, with 2 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2 and 8 mmCaCl2.

Open table in a new tab Conditions for reconstitution of the β-less chromatophores were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Restored ATP synthesis was assayed as described in Fig. 3, with 5 mmMgCl2, and ATP hydrolysis as described in Fig. 4, with 2 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2 and 8 mmCaCl2. When stated, 100 mm sulfite were added. The x-ray structure of MF1 showed a density for a water molecule, hydrogen-bonded to the equivalent MF1β-Glu188, at a distance of 4.4 Å from the γ-phosphate of the βTP (7.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). This residue could therefore be appropriately positioned to activate the water molecule for an inline nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate during ATP hydrolysis. We have mutated the RrF1β-Glu184into glutamine (β-E184Q) and lysine (β-E184K), and both mutants were found to bind to the β-less chromatophores as efficiently as the WT RrF1β (data not shown). However, no restoration of any tested activity was obtained with either mutant when measured under conditions found optimal for WT RrF1β (Table I). There was also no restoration of any ATP synthesis or hydrolysis activity at higher concentrations of divalent cations, which enabled some restoration of activity in the RrF1β-E195Q and E195K mutants (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the RrF1β-Glu184, although not required for assembly, is absolutely essential for all the above tested membrane-bound RrF0F1-activities. RrF1β-Thr159 and Glu184 are fully conserved in all sequenced F1 complexes. The equivalent MF1β-Thr163 was identified in the catalytic nucleotide binding site of the bovine MF1 crystal structure (7.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar) as a ligand to Mg2+, and the MF1β-Glu188 was suggested to be directly involved in catalysis. Our analysis of the equivalent RrF1β-E184Q and E184K mutants yielded assembled but fully inactive enzymes (Table I). Similar results were reported for the equivalent EcF1β-E181 mutations (41.Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21471-21478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Park M.-Y. Omote H. Maeta M. Futain M. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), where even the β-E181D mutant had only 1.4% of the control MgATPase activity. Only the equivalent TF1β-E190D mutant (43.Amano T. Tozawa K. Yoshida M. Murakami H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) had 7% of the WT MgATPase activity. These results confirm that this residue is essential for catalysis in respiratory as well as photosynthetic F0F1-ATP synthases, but do not really clarify its function (see Ref. 6.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Residues equivalent to RrF1β-Thr159 were mutated to serine in several respiratory systems (44.Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16552-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28818-28824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and recently also in C. reinhardtii (24.Hu D. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and checked extensively on the MgATPase activity of isolated F1 or α3β3γ complexes. In all tested cases this mutation resulted in a 3–10-fold increase in the MgATPase activity. It also eliminated the stimulation of the MgATPase by oxyanions or alcohols, and reduced the sensitivity of the MgATPase activity to inhibition by azide. The three mutants RrF1β-T159S, T159A, and T159V have, however, been tested for their in vitro assembly into the β-less membrane-bound RrF0F1 as well as for their capacity to restore all the divalent cation-dependent ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities of the assembled RrF0F1 complex. All three mutants did bind into the β-less chromatophores (Fig. 2), but only the assembled RrF0F1 containing the β-T159S was active. It did restore the WT rates and specific properties of ATP synthesis as well as Mg- and Mn-dependent ATP hydrolysis, including the tight regulation of these ATPase activities, and their effective stimulation by sulfite. However, even this active mutant could not restore any CaATPase activity. Two unexpected results emerged from the present study with the RrF1β-T159S. One is the large difference between the membrane-bound activities and properties obtained here with the mutant, which were very similar to those obtained with WT RrF1β, and the much higher activities and different properties than the WT ones that were earlier observed in soluble F1 or α3β3γ complexes containing the equivalent threonine to serine mutants of CF1 (24.Hu D. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) MF1(44.Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16552-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TF1 (46.Jault J.-M. Dou C. Grodsky N.B. Matsui T. Yoshida M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28818-28824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The second unexpected result is the inability of the RrF1β-T159S mutant to restore the proton-decoupled CaATPase, while effectively restoring the proton-coupled Mg- and Mn- ATPases. The capacity to restore CaATPase has not been tested with any other equivalent mutant, but an opposite effect of restoration of Ca- but not MgATPase activity was earlier observed with the RrF1β-E195G mutant (18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the ligands for Ca2+ and Mg2+ must be different, since only in the case of Ca2+ the threonine cannot be replaced by serine (Fig. 4 C). This difference in ligands might lead to a different conformational state of the catalytic site occupied by Ca2+ as compared with Mg2+ or Mn2+. It can explain the inability of the Ca2+-occupied catalytic sites to carry out ATP synthesis and proton-coupled ATP hydrolysis, by Ca-induced changes in the interactions between the β and γ subunits that may be involved in linking catalysis to proton translocation. Omote et al. (47.Omote H. Sambonnatsu N. Saito K. Sambong Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have recently reported that they observed similar rotation and torque generation in engineered WT EcF1-α3β3γ and an uncoupled mutant EcF1-α3β3γM23K. This mutant is unable to translocate protons through F0 but has about 60% of the WT EcF1-MgATPase activity. These properties are very similar to those recorded with the proton-decoupled membrane-bound and the soluble RrF1-CaATPase activity. It would therefore be most interesting to test whether rotation can occur also during CaATPase as well as MgATPase activity. Although CaATPase activity has been tested very thoroughly in various photosynthetic F1-ATPases (2.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria.

In this work, we report the purification, the biochemical characterization, and the cloning of the gene of a second H2O2-forming NAD(P)H oxidase from the archaeonS. solfataricus (SsNOX38). The relationship of the primary structure of this enzyme with that of other NADH oxidases and oxidoreductases is also analyzed. Restriction enzymes, modifying enzymes, and labeled compounds were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmid DNA, genomic DNA, and labeled probes were prepared as described (7.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). β-NADH, β-NADPH, α-NADH, deamino NADH, FAD, ATP, 4-aminoantipyrine, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, DTNB, and peroxidase were from Sigma. The following buffers were used: buffer A (25 mm MES/KOH, pH 5.5); buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8; 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8); and buffer D (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mmCH3COONa, 1 mm EDTA). NADH oxidase activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 65 °C by determining the initial rate of NADH oxidation in capped cuvettes. The reaction mixture contained 0.18 mm FAD, 1 mm NADH (or NADPH) in 1 ml final volume of buffer A. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme, and the reaction was followed kinetically by measuring the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (ε = 6220m−1·cm−1). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of substrate/min at 65 °C. Blanks without the addition of the enzymes were run to evaluate the spontaneous oxidation of substrate at 65 °C. The determination of the hydrogen peroxide produced by the NADH oxidase was performed as described (8.Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholtz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in 0.25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.25 mm 4-amino antipyrine, 25 mm phenol and 0.2 units of peroxidase. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 500 nm, and the concentration of H2O2 was calculated from a calibration curve. Assays for the DTNB and 2,6-dichloroindophenol reductase activities of NADH oxidase were performed as already described (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.3 mm EDTA, 75 μm2,6-dichloroindophenol or 0.4 mm DTNB, and 1 mmNADH in 1 ml final volume of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, The reaction was started by adding 3 μg of purifiedSsNOX38. The absorbance was monitored at 600 nm for the 2,6-dichloroindophenol and at 412 nm for DTNB. S. solfataricus cells (strain MT-4, ATCC 49255) were grown as already reported (9.De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Nicolaus B. Giardina E. Poerio E. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). 80 g of cells were resuspended in 300 ml of buffer B. The mixture was frozen and thawed twice, and ground with 100 g of sand for 15 min at 4 °C. From this point, all of the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at low speed to remove the sand, sonicated for 5 min on ice at 100 W, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove cell debris. The S-100 fraction (262 ml) was then dialysed against buffer C containing 10% glycerol and was applied on a DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow (2.5 × 80 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer at 2 ml/min. The column was then washed with buffer C containing 10% glycerol, and 22-ml fractions were collected. NADH oxidase activity was assayed on 450-μl aliquots, and the activity was eluted in two peaks corresponding to fractions 15–40 (pool I) and 41–80 (pool II), respectively. Pool II was concentrated by Aquacide II to 60 ml, dialysed against buffer C, loaded onto a Affi-gel blue column (1 × 8 cm, flow-rate 1 ml/min), washed with buffer C, and eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient 0–300 mm KCl in buffer C; 10 ml fractions were then collected. The enzyme activity, assayed on 50-μl aliquots, was eluted at 150–210 mm KCl. The pool of active fractions was concentrated by Aquacide II to about 3 ml and applied to a Superdex-75 gel filtration column (2.6 × 60 cm, flow-rate 1 ml/min), and eluted with buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl, and 4-ml fractions were collected. NADH oxidase activity was assayed on 25-μl aliquots. Active fractions, showing a single band on SDS-PAGE, were pooled, concentrated by Aquacide II, dialysed against buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Trypsin digestion of SsNOX38 was performed in buffer B at an enzyme concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml trypsin. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and at different times aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor (25 μg/ml final concentration) and finally analyzed on 14% SDS-PAGE. K m andV were determined by measuring the initial rate of NADH consumption at different substrate concentrations and in the presence of 0.2 mm FAD. The affinity of the enzyme for the cofactor was determined at different concentrations of FAD in the presence of saturating NADH concentration. Values of K m andV were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The heat inactivation of SsNOX38 was followed kinetically by incubating 1 mg/ml protein in buffer C at selected temperatures. After the heat treatment, aliquots were withdrawn, cooled on ice for 30 min, and then analyzed for the residual NADH oxidase activity as described above. UV melting curves of SsNOX38 were obtained in the temperature range of 50–105 °C using a computer-assisted Cary 1E spectrophotometer (Varian) equipped with a temperature controller. The increase in temperature was set at 0.1 °C/min, and the difference in absorbance at 286 and 274 nm was measured every second degree centigrade increase, normalized between 0 and 100, and plottedversus temperature (10.Arcari P. Masullo M. Arcucci A. Ianniciello G. de Paola B. Bocchini V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12288-12295Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The thermophilicity ofSsNOX38 was evaluated in the temperature range of 50–100 °C. At each temperature the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically as described above. A molecular probe for the isolation of the SsNOX38 gene was synthesized by PCR using as primer two oligonucleotides derived from the amino acid sequence of SsNOX38 and as template the S. solfataricus DNA. The forward primer, ATG·GAT·GGA·TAT·GAT·ATA·GT (nox1), was deduced from the N-terminal sequence MDEYDIV of the purified protein, whereas the reverse primer, TC·ATG·CCA·TAC·ATA·TAC·ATT (nox2), was designed from the N-terminal sequence NVYVWH of a 14-kDa tryptic fragment of the enzyme. Degenerations on the third codon position were reduced to a single nucleotide (indicated in bold) on the basis of the preferential codon usage in S. solfataricus(11.De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. Gene. 1996; 176: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A S. solfataricus DNA library was prepared into the pUC18 cloning vector, upon digestion of both DNAs withEcoRI/PstI restriction enzymes. About 2 × 103 colonies were analyzed using as probe the32P-labeled PCR fragment. Electrophoretic analysis was performed on 14% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS (12.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) using appropriateM r standards. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (13.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing of theSsNOX38 gene was performed on both DNA strands using the T7 sequencing kit (Promega) and synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. Southern blot on S. solfataricus genomic DNA was performed as described (14.Southern E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21463) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region and that of a tryptic fragment of the protein were determined by automated Edman degradation on a pulsed liquid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) connected on-line to a HPLC apparatus for PTH-amino acid identification. A query for sequence similarities was addressed to the GenBankTM data base using the BLASTP program (15.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref Scopus (70353) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses and alignments were established with the help of a nucleic acid and protein analysis software system packed with the CLUSTAL program (16.Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar). The SsNOX38 purification procedure is summarized in Table I. After the DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow step, two peaks of NADH oxidase activity were found in the flow-through (not shown). The first peak (pool I) led to the purification of a 35-kDa NADH oxidase (SsNOX35) as described in a previous work (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the second peak (pool II) led to the purification of the SsNOX38. The enzyme activity was purified 187-fold with a recovery of 21%. The final product was homogeneous on both SDS-PAGE and HPLC C4 column.Table IPurification of SsNOX38 from 80 g of S. solfataricus cellsTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitunit/mg%-foldS-1003511540.0151001DEAE53.1320.65940Affi-gel blue11.418.31.634107Superdex 754.011.22.821187One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalysing the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH/min at 65 °C. Open table in a new tab One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalysing the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH/min at 65 °C. The molecular mass ofSsNOX38 as estimated by SDS-PAGE was about 38 kDa (Fig.1), whereas the molecular mass determined by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 was about 70 kDa (not shown). These data suggested that the native enzyme is made of two identical subunits not covalently linked. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme was typical of a flavoprotein, with a major peak at 275 nm and two minor peaks at 375 and 470 nm (Fig.2 A). The fluorescence spectrum showed a maximum at about 520 nm (Fig. 2 B). These features suggest that, like SsNOX35 (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), even purifiedSsNOX38 is bound to a flavin cofactor.Figure 2Spectroscopic properties ofSsNOX38. Absorption (A) and fluorescence (B) spectra recorded at 25 °C at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.8. In B, the excitation wavelength was 490 nm, and both the excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SsNOX38 catalyzed the oxidation of NADH in the presence of molecular oxygen with formation of hydrogen peroxide. A stoichiometric amount of H2O2 was produced upon complete oxidation of NADH (Fig. 3), thus suggesting that the enzyme transfers two electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen. The enzyme required the presence of FAD as cofactor. NADPH was also a substrate for the enzyme, but it was oxidized at a rate about twice as slow as NADH. Furthermore, the enzyme did not exhibit activity toward α-NADH and deamino NADH (Fig.4). The kinetic parameters of the reaction using NADH as substrate and FAD as cofactor are summarized in Table II and compared with those of other thermophilic NADH oxidases (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17.Park H.J. Reiser C.O.A. Kondruweit S. Erdmann H. Schmid R.D. Sprinzl M. Eur. J.

The enzyme was not able to catalyze the electron transfer from NADH to 2,6-dichloroindophenol or to DTNB, typical electron acceptors of NADH dehydrogenases and thiol disulfide oxidoreductases activity, respectively.Figure 4Substrate specificity ofSsNOX38. The oxidase reaction was carried out at 65 °C in buffer A in the presence of 0.2 mm FAD with the indicated amounts of purified SsNOX38 and 1 mmNADH (●), NADPH (▪), deamino NADH (▴), or α-NADH (♦).

Open table in a new tab k cat was calculated considering theM r of SsNOX38 = 76,000. The thermophilicity of SsNOX38 was investigated by measuring the NADH oxidase activity at increasing temperatures. As reported in Fig.5, SsNOX38 showed the maximum activity at 87 °C. Above this temperature, inactivation occurred. The data collected in the temperature interval 50–87 °C, analyzed by the Arrhenius equation, gave a straight line (Fig. 5,inset) and a value of 40 kJ/mol was calculated for the activation energy. The heat inactivation of SsNOX38 was evaluated by measuring the residual NADH oxidase activity after heat treatment at two different temperatures (Fig.6 A). At 87 °C the enzyme remained stable for 60 min of treatment, whereas at 105 °C its heat resistance was drastically reduced with a t 12 of about 2 min. The stability of SsNOX38 was also evaluated by ultraviolet-monitored thermal denaturation in the absence or presence of 8 m urea (Fig. 6 B). The corresponding half-denaturation temperatures were 93 and 75 °C, respectively. The stability of the enzyme was also confirmed by its resistance to trypsin. In fact, cleavage of SsNOX38 in two major fragments of about 21 and 14 kDa was obtained after incubation of the protein for 20 h at 37 °C in the presence of trypsin at a 3:1 weight ratio (Fig. 7). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 21-kDa fragment M1DEYDIVVIGGGP was identical to that determined on the intact protein, whereas the N-terminal sequence of the first 10 residues determined on the 14-kDa fragment was VANVYVWHEL.Figure 6Heat stability ofSsNOX38. A, heat inactivation ofSsNOX38 was measured at 87 °C (○) or 105 °C (●).B, melting curves of SsNOX38 were measured in the absence (■) or presence (▪) of 8 m urea.

At timed intervals, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn, added to 0.25 μg of bovine trypsin inhibitor, and loaded onto a 14% SDS-PAGE.

This DNA fragment was then cloned in the pGEM-T easy vector and sequenced with the T7 and SP6 primers. The amino acid sequence translated from the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was coincident with the N-terminal sequences of both of the tryptic fragments of purified SsNOX38. Analysis of S. solfataricus DNA by Southern blot, using as probe the32P-labeled PCR (not shown), indicated that a 6.5-kilobase pair EcoRI/PstI fragment contained the entire gene. This fragment was identified by colony hybridization screening of a S. solfataricus library cloned into the pUC18 vector. Fig.7 shows the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding SsNOX38 and the translated amino acid sequence. The SsNOX38 gene coded for a protein composed of 332 amino acid residues, accounting for a M r 36508, a value close to that determined by SDS-PAGE. The translated primary structure of the enzyme contained the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined on both the purified protein and the 14-kDa tryptic fragment of SsNOX38. The start codon is a GTG triplet (Val), although in the purified protein the N-terminal amino acid detected by Edman's degradation is Met. This feature is common in other S. solfataricus genes (11.De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. Gene. 1996; 176: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig.8 shows the nucleotide sequence of the flanking regions of the SsNOX38 gene also. The 5′-flanking region contains a putative archaeal promoter (20.Thom M. Wich G. Nuleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and a potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence (21.Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar), and the 3′-flanking region contains a transcription termination signal. The SsNOX38 gene contains a high content of A and T (34.3 and 27.3%, respectively) as compared with G and C (25.8 and 12.5%, respectively). This finding is in agreement with the selective codon usage in S. solfataricusgenes (11.De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. Gene. 1996; 176: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The average hydrophobicity and the mean molecular weight of the amino acid residues in the SsNOX38 is slightly lower (4.95 and 110, respectively) than those calculated for other S. solfataricus proteins (5.18 and 114.8, respectively) (22.Dello Russo A. Rullo R. Nitti G. Masullo M. Bocchini V. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 23-30PubMed Google Scholar). SsNOX38 did not show homology with any other NADH oxidase available from the GenBankTM data base. Similarly, it did not show sequence identities with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 20 amino acid residues determined on SsNOX35 andSaNOX27 (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar). The best alignments were found with thioredoxin reductases and alkyl hydroperoxide reductases. The highest amino acid sequence homology (39.7% identity) was observed with a putative thioredoxin reductase translated from a Bacillus subtilisgenomic DNA fragment (GenBankTM accession number Z93939). Compared with alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, the best alignment was observed with the C-terminal region of the F subunit of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase from Xhantomonas campestris (25% identity; GenBankTM accession number U94336) (Ref. 23.Loprasert S. Atichartpongkun S. Whangsuk W. Mongkolsuk S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3944-3949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.9). A homodimeric NAD(P)H oxidase with a molecular mass of about 38 kDa/subunit has been isolated from S. solfataricus. The enzyme was different from another NADH oxidase (SsNOX35) previously isolated from the same source (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), because the amino acid sequence of SsNOX38 did not contain the N-terminal amino acid sequence of SsNOX35. Nevertheless, theSsNOX35 in its native state is also homodimeric, with one FAD molecule bound per enzyme subunit (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar). Like all other NADH oxidases, the SsNOX38 is probably involved in vivo in the regeneration of NAD from NADH produced in the aerobic pathway (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24.Higuchi M. Shimada M. Yamamoto Y. Hayashi T. Koga T. Kamio Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); the final product of the oxidase reaction is hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3). SsNOX35 andSaNOX27 also catalyze the transfer of electrons directly from NADH to molecular oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide. This feature is a distinctive property of thermophilic micro-organisms because, up to now, no H2O-producing NADH oxidase has been isolated from this source. Like SaNOX27 andSsNOX35, SsNOX38 also showed specificity for FAD. In addition, as reported for SsNOX35 (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), SsNOX38 is purified also as a flavoenzyme, as deduced from UV and fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2). Despite the two other archaeal enzymes,SsNOX38 can also oxidize β-NADPH (Fig. 4). This feature is shared by the NADH oxidase isolated from Thermus thermophilus (17.Park H.J. Reiser C.O.A. Kondruweit S. Erdmann H. Schmid R.D. Sprinzl M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SsNOX38 is very stable to heat inactivation and denaturation (Fig. 6). In fact, at 87 °C the enzyme retains its activity even after a 60-min incubation, whereas the t 12 at 105 °C was 2 min. The heat stability of SsNOX38 was comparable with that reported for SsNOX35 (t 12 = 3.8 min at 105 °C) (3.Masullo M. Ph.D. thesis. Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK1996Google Scholar, 4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar) but higher than that of SaNOX27 (t 12 = 3 min at 100 °C) (3.Masullo M. Ph.D. thesis. Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK1996Google Scholar, 4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), Thermoanaerobium brokii NOX (t 12 = 30 min at 80–85 °C) (19.Maeda K. Truscott K. Liu X.L. Scopes R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 187-190Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), andTaNOX (t 12 about 5 min at 87 °C) (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This property is also reflected in the thermophilicity ofSsNOX38 (Fig. 5). The highest activity was detected at 87 °C, a temperature about 7 °C higher than that observed for other thermophilic NADH oxidases (4.Masullo M. Raimo G. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Bannister J.V. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 23: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Park H.J. Reiser C.O.A. Kondruweit S. Erdmann H. Schmid R.D. Sprinzl M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The native FAD-bound SsNOX38 did not show any oxidase activity without additional FAD. This behavior was also observed under anaerobic conditions with the Amphybacillus xylanus NADH oxidase (25.Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Ohnishi K. Massey V. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2310-2311Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26.Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki K. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Thermus aquaticus NADH oxidase (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) it was suggested that the exogenous FAD stimulates the oxidase activity of the enzyme by mediating the electron transfer from the enzyme-bound FAD to molecular oxygen (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The same reaction occurs for other related NADH oxidases from A. xylanus (25.Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Ohnishi K. Massey V. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2310-2311Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26.Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki K. Uozumi T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25645-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that even for SsNOX38 the additional FAD might play a similar role. The K m of SsNOX38 for the β-NADH under aerobic conditions (Table II) was about 7- and 20-fold higher compared with the K m values of theSsNOX35 and SaNOX27, respectively, and at least one order of magnitude higher than K m values reported for TtNOX, TaNOX, and Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum NOX (CtNOX). TheK m for FAD was comparable with that ofSsNOX35, SaNOX27, and TaNOX but lower than that of NADH oxidase from T. thermophilus. The catalytic efficiency of SsNOX38 was about 15-fold lower than that of the other archaeal NADH oxidases, whereas it was 117-and 21-fold lower than that of thermophilic eubacterial NADH oxidases isolated fromT. thermophilus and T. aquaticus, respectively (Table II and references therein). These findings indicated that archaeal thermophilic NADH oxidases are less efficient compared with their eubacterial counterparts, where their fast aerobic growth is associated with a high NADH consumption (28.Niimura Y. Koh E. Uchimura T Ohara N. Kozaki M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 61: 79-84Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Many NADH oxidases have been reported as scavenging hydrogen peroxide and therefore fuctioning as peroxidases (2.Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). They are able to catalyze electron transfer from NADH to several electron acceptors such as methylene blue, cytochrome c, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, and potassium ferricyanide (24.Higuchi M. Shimada M. Yamamoto Y. Hayashi T. Koga T. Kamio Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17.Park H.J. Reiser C.O.A. Kondruweit S. Erdmann H. Schmid R.D. Sprinzl M.

In addition, other NADH oxidases have a thiol disulfide oxidase activity mediated by the presence of a redox-active disulfide center constituted of two very close cysteine residues (26.Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki K. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SsNOX38 is different from both types of NADH oxidases because it did not show any electron transfer activity toward 2,6-dichloroindophenol or DTNB. In fact, as deduced from the sequence of the SsNOX38 gene, no cysteine residues are present in the primary structure of the enzyme. Because, as already suggested for the A. xylanus NADH oxidase (31.Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Suzuki K. Uozumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5812-5817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide did not require the presence of the two cysteines, even for SsNOX38 the mechanism of the reaction might involve the formation of a flavin C/4a-hydroperoxide adduct (32.Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by the elimination of hydrogen peroxide. The translated amino acid sequence of SsNOX38 (Fig. 8) contains the consensus sequence present in both NAD- and FAD-binding enzymes (33.Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). In fact, the ADP-binding βαβ-fold region of many dinucleotide binding enzymes corresponded in the SsNOX38 to the region D5–D36 containing the hydrophobic core of six amino acids (Ile6, Val8, Thr9, Ala22, Ile32, Ala34) and the consensus sequence G10GGPVG. The other putative βαβ-fold region of SsNOX38 corresponds to the segment R152–D183, which includes residues Val153, Ile155, G157GGDSA, Ala166, Leu169, and Ile179. Another consensus sequence conserved among many FAD-binding sites is TXXXXhyhhGD, whereh represents a small hydrophobic amino acid and yis an aromatic residue (34.Eggink G. Engel H. Vriend G. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This sequence corresponds inSsNOX38 to the segment T271NLPGVYAGGD, thus indicating the presence of an additional binding site for FAD. Furthermore, the consensus sequence GXGXXAXXXAXXXXXXA, typical of the NADP binding proteins (35.Hanukoglu I. Gutfinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), is present also in theSsNOX38. This sequence corresponded to G157GGDSAVDWALTLAPVA, which might explain the oxidase activity of the SsNOX38 toward NADPH. The primary structure of SsNOX38 showed significant sequence homology with thioredoxin reductase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase from several organisms rather than with other NADH oxidases. The best alignment was found with a putative B. subtilis thioredoxin reductase, homologous to the Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase (36.Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9015-9019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to alkyl hydroperoxide reductase from X. campestris, the latter showing 64% sequence identity with the enzyme from S. typhimurium (37.Tartaglia L.A. Storz G. Brodsky M.H. Lai A. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10535-10540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple alignment showed sequence identities mainly in the regions containing the binding sites for FAD and NAD(P) (Fig. 9). Compared with these enzymes, an important divergence is the lack in SsNOX38 of the redox-active disulfide center. This finding might suggest that theSsNOX38 and NADH oxidoreductase enzymes originated from a common ancestor which, in the course of evolution, underwent different environmental constrains. In conclusion, SsNOX38, like SsNOX35, functions in S. solfataricus cells as a NADH oxidase. However, because the enzyme does not possess reductase activity, its involvement in other possible physiological roles cannot be excluded."

The S100 proteins have been implicated in cell cycle progression, differentiation, metabolism, cancer development, and metastasis (reviewed in Refs. 1.Barraclough R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and 2.Sherbet G.V Lakshmi M.S. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2415-2421PubMed Google Scholar). Thirteen of the S100 genes are located as a cluster in the human chromosome region 1q21, where abnormalities are found in a number of malignancies, including breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia (3.Mischke D.

In a mouse myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, an insertional mutation of a partial intracisternal A-particle into themts1 gene, resulting in the aberrant activation ofmts1, has been reported (5.Ambartsumian N. Tarabykina S. Grigorian M. Tulchinsky E. Hulgaard E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E.M. Gene. 1995; 159: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of a shorter mts1 transcript variant has been observed and proposed to be responsible for the etiology of disease progression in some human intraductal breast carcinomas (6.Tarabykina S. Ambartsumian N. Grigorian M. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E.M. Gene. 1996; 168: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7.Albertazzi E. Cajone F. Sherbet G.V. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which S100 proteins in general and mts1 in particular regulates the wide variety of growth functions attributed to them remains unclear. It has been proposed that physiological function of the S100 proteins is regulated via the interaction of target proteins or peptides, which increase the affinity of the S100 proteins to calcium. The target proteins for mts1 include the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin (8.Kriajevska M.V. Cardens M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nonmuscle topomyosin (9.Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Hasegawa Y. Sato K. Endo H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a 36-kDa microfibril-associated glycoprotein (10.Watanabe Y. Usuda N. Tsugane S. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 37-kDa protein (11.Dukhanina E.A. Dukhanin A.S. Lomonosov M.Y. Lukanidin E.M. Georgiev G.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In normal tissues, mts1 transcript was detected mainly in spleen, thymus, and bone marrow (12.Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mts1 is also abundant in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. However, mts1transcripts or proteins were detected at high levels in a number of human tumors (13.Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and were more abundant in cell lines that possessed metastatic properties than in related nonmetastatic cell lines (12.Ebralidze A.

Tarabykina S. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Clinically, the expression levels of mts1 were often associated with enhanced invasiveness of breast (15.Grigorian M. Ambartsumian N. Lykkesfeldt A.E. Bastholm L. Elling F. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16.Albertazzi E. Cajone F. Leone B.E. Naguib R.N. Lakshmi M.S. Sherbet G.V.

Cancer. 1997; 71: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and colon carcinomas (18.Takenaga K. Nakanishi H. Wada K. Suzuki M. Matsuzaki O. Matsuura A. Endo H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2309-2316PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elevated levels ofmts1 show strong correlation with the proliferative potential and invasive and metastatic ability of cancers. Direct evidence demonstrating that mts1 plays a causal role in metastasis came from experimental elevation of mts1 by transfection of a benign rat epithelial cell line (19.Davies B.R. Davies M.P. Gibbs F.E. Baraclough R. Rudland P.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lloyd B.H. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R.

Oncogene 8, 999–1008Google Scholar) and ofsrc-transformed rat fibroblasts (22.Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Endo H. Sakiyama S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that conferred in vitro cell invasion and promoted tumor progression. In animal models, mice harboring mts1 transgenes were more prone to metastasis. For example, the mouse GRS/A strain, characterized by a high incidence of mammary tumors that rarely metastasize, developed secondary tumors in the lungs when a mts1 transgene was introduced (23.Ambartsumian N.S Grigorian M.S. Larsen I.F. Karlstrøm O. Sidenius N. Rygaard J. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). A mts1 transgene coupled with the activatedneu oncogene also formed metastatic mammary tumors in mice (24.Davies M.P. Rudland P.S. Robertson L. Parry E.W. Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of antisense RNA or hammerhead ribozyme directed against mts1 transcript suppressed or reversed metastatic phenotypes in tumor cells (25.Maelandsmo G.M. Hovig E. Skrede M. Engebraaten O. Flørenes V.A. Myklebost O. Grigorian M. Lukanidin E Scanlon K.J. Fodstad O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5490-5498PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the investigation of the transcriptional regulation of mts1 may provide insights into the changes that occur in transcription-controlling mechanisms in carcinoma cells during tumor progression.The mouse mts1 cDNA was isolated by differential expression of mts1 in highly metastatic mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells and its nonmetastatic counterpart (27.Jackson-Grusby L.L. Swiergiel J. Linzer I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6677-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28.Goto K. Endo H. Fujiyoshi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequent cloning and sequencing showed that the mts1 gene consists of two protein coding exons and one small noncoding 5′ exon (29.Tulchinsky E.M. Grigorian M.S. Ebralidze A.K. Milshina N.I. Lukanidin E.M. Gene. 1990; 87: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mts1 minimal promoter contains a “TATA” box and is mapped within a 41-bp1region upstream of the transcription start site (30.Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulatory elements were not found in the distal upstream region. Transcription of mts1 is controlled by several positive and negative gene regulatory elements present in the first intron (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, the 1254-bp first intron region activated the expression of reporter genes under the control of themts1 promoter as well as heterologous promoters (30.Tulchinsky E.

Of interest, the intracisternal A-particle element described above was also inserted into the first intron of mts1 (5.Ambartsumian N. Tarabykina S. Grigorian M. Tulchinsky E. Hulgaard E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E.M. Gene. 1995; 159: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To study the transcription regulation of mts1, we and others have performed systematic analyses to delineate gene regulatory DNA elements in the first intron of mts1 (30.Tulchinsky E. Ford H.

First, DNase I hypersensitive sites often associated with regions of active transcription were mapped. Second, short DNA fragments harboring DNase I-hypersensitive sites were linked to reporter genes, and their transcription activities were demonstrated by transient transfection assays. Third, protein binding sites in these DNA fragments were characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and nucleotides essential for protein binding were identified by in vitro and in vivo footprinting experiments. Subsequently, the precise locations of the trans-acting factor binding sites were determined by deletion, followed by site-directed mutagenesis within the context of the reporter constructs. The cis-acting regulatory elements identified in this manner include a novel AP-1 binding site that is generated by DNA methylation (32.Tulchinsky E.M. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1737-1745PubMed Google Scholar), a κB-related site (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and a minisatellite core DNA element (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34.Prokhortchouk E.B. Prokhortchouk A.V. Rouzov A.S. Kiselev S.L. Lukanidin E. Georgiev G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The latter two elements were named Sb and Sa, respectively.The cellular factors that regulate the transcription of mts1are largely unknown. One general approach to identify gene-specific transcription factors is to use the cis-acting DNA elements as ligands in functional or in DNA-protein interaction studies. The κB-related Sb element described above partially contributes to the activity of the composite enhancer in a mts1-expressing mouse adenocarcinoma CSML100 cell line (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA-protein interaction analysis showed that Sb formed three sequence-specific complexes with nuclear proteins prepared from CSML100 cells. Two of those complexes were composed of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins: the p50·p50 homodimers and p50·p65 heterodimers (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The largest DNA-protein complex was formed by a previously unidentified protein. This protein was named p200 because its molecular mass was estimated to be ∼200 kDa by UV cross-linking experiments (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA-protein interaction studies coupled with reporter gene assays showed that mutations preventing NF-κB binding had no effect on the mts1 natural enhancer activity, but mutations abolishing the binding of p200 led to the functional inactivation of this site in the mts1 first intron (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). p200, therefore, is a factor essential for the transcription regulation of mts1.In an attempt to identify p200, we have constructed and screened a λgt11 expression cDNA library prepared from poly(A)+RNA of CSML100 cells with 32P-labeled DNA fragments containing multiple copies of the Sb site. We have isolated cDNA clones for two known genes, one of which is KRC. KRC encodes a large zinc finger protein that binds to the κB motif and to the signal sequence of V(D)J recombination (35.Wu L.C. Mak C-H. Dear N. Boehm T. Foroni L. Rabbitts T.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36.Wu L.C. Liu Y. Strandtmann J. Mak C.H. Lee B. Li Z. Yu C.Y. Genomics. 1996; 35: 3415-3424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further biochemical and functional analyses were focused on KRC, and the data suggest that KRC likely encodes p200 and that KRCis a transcription activator of mts1.DISCUSSIONOur analysis suggests KRC encodes a product that regulates transcription of mts1 in metastatic cells via the interaction with the Sb site, a κB-like motif, of the composite enhancer in the first intron of mts1. This Sb-binding protein, p200, was initially identified and characterized in themts1-expressing adenocarcinoma cell line CSML100 (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using32P-labeled Sb DNA as a ligand to screen a cDNA expression library prepared from CSML100 poly(A)+ RNA, we isolated a clone that corresponds to the carboxyl portion of a large zinc finger protein KRC, including a pair of C2H2 zinc fingers. Previously, we showed that KRC fusion proteins containing this zinc finger pair bind specifically to the κB motif (35.Wu L.C. Mak C-H. Dear N. Boehm T. Foroni L. Rabbitts T.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42.Mak C-H. Strandtmann J. Wu L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that KRC fusion proteins also interact specifically with Sb DNA. Additionally, we show that KRC positively regulates endogenous mts1 as well as reporter genes whose expression is under the control of themts1 gene enhancer present in the first intron.Recent analyses show that unlike most introns that are biologically inert, the first intron of mts1 is involved in important biological functions. The first intron regulates the expression of the host gene, and several positive and negative gene regulatory elements have been localized in this region. In addition to those protein binding sites, computer alignment (DIALIGN2 program) shows significant general conservation among the first intron sequences of themts1 genes in human (49.Bonven B.J. Nielsen A.L. Norby P.L. Pedersen F.S. Jorgensen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 564-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), mouse (33.Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar), and rat (5.Ambartsumian N. Tarabykina S. Grigorian M. Tulchinsky E. Hulgaard E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E.M. Gene. 1995; 159: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 51.Barraclough R. Savin J. Dube S.K. Rudland P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig.5), suggesting that other elements involved in transcription regulation or in DNA dynamics may exist. So far, three regulatory elements essential for the transcription regulation of murine mts1 have been described. One of the regulatory elements is a methylation-dependent AP1 binding site. Protein binding to the AP1 site is dependent on the resultant generation of a novel inhibitory AP1 binding site by DNA methylation in mouse (32.Tulchinsky E.M. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1737-1745PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest, this may explain the observation that methylation of the 5′ region of the mts1 gene correlated with the repression of mts1. DNA methylation has also been suggested to impose developmental stage-specific regulation ofmts1 in human and rat (52.Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 53.Nakamura N. Takenaga K. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 54.Chen D. Davies M.P. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20283-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, this AP1 binding site is absent in the corresponding regions in the human and ratmts1 genes, despite generally good conservation of the sequence of the flanking regions (Fig. 5). Other elements are likely present in the human and rat mts1 gene for regulating gene expression by DNA methylation.The other two regulatory elements, Sa and Sb, are located close together between nucleotides +788 to +841 (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the Sa/Sb sequence is conserved in human, mouse, and rat and is followed by the most conserved region in the sequence alignment (Fig. 5). A data base search of the gene sequence of mouse mts1 revealed that this region harbors a sequence of 51 nucleotides that completely matches a minisatellite sequence in rat (accession number U07929). The Sa sequence is located at the 5′ end of the minisatellite sequence and is similar to the core sequence of hypervariable tandem-repeated minisatellites (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34.Prokhortchouk E.B. Prokhortchouk A.V. Rouzov A.S. Kiselev S.L. Lukanidin E. Georgiev G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Sa sequence also resembles the χ sequence of Escherichia coli, which is often associated with recombination hotspots and provides binding sites for recombination proteins. Minisatellite DNA stimulates homologous recombination in mammalian cells (55.Collick A. Jeffreys A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 56.Wahl W.P. Moore P.D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).The regulatory Sb element is 9 to 17 nucleotides upstream of Sa (Fig.5). The Sb sequence is conserved, although there is a single nucleotide G to T transversion of the first nucleotide in human and a three-nucleotide insertion in rat compared with the composition of mouse Sb. The evolutionarily conservation of Sb suggests that Sb plays an important function. Sb is a target for KRC, which is a large protein of ∼250 kDa. The proximity of Sa and Sb and the large size of KRC suggest that KRC may be in contact with Sa-binding proteins. Of interest, KRC was cloned by the interaction of its expressed products with the signal sequences of V(D)J recombination and, therefore, has been suggested to be involved in DNA rearrangement (35.Wu L.C. Mak C-H. Dear N. Boehm T. Foroni L. Rabbitts T.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is provocative to suggest that the first intron ofmts1 is not only involved in transcription regulation but also represents a dynamic genetic region of DNA recombination leading to deregulation of mts1 and metastasis. So far, no direct evidence to support DNA recombination mediated by the minisatellite DNA has occurred in the first intron of mts1, although an insertion of an intracisternal A-particle element ∼600 bp upstream has been reported in a mouse myelomonocytic leukemia cell line (5.Ambartsumian N. Tarabykina S. Grigorian M. Tulchinsky E. Hulgaard E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E.M. Gene. 1995; 159: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The identification of Sb-binding proteins in vitro has led to the identification of transcription factors that regulate transcription of the mts1 gene. Mouse Sb interacts with three proteins, p50, p65, and p200, but human Sb only interacts with p200 (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that the binding of p200 to Sb is more stable when compared with the binding of NF-κBs (Fig. 1 B). Previously, we have shown that specific mutations introduced into the mouse Sb sequences that abolish NF-κB binding have no significant effect on the mts1 enhancer activity (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of p50 inhibits the mts1 enhancer in transient transfection experiments. 3M. A. Cohn and E. M. Tulchinsky, unpublished observations. Together, the data suggest KRC and NF-κBs may play distinct roles in regulating the expression of mts1, although both proteins can bind to the Sb site.KRC belongs to a emerging family of proteins that bind to κB-related motifs. The κB binding specificity and the large sizes of these proteins led to our previous speculation that a family member may encode p200 species (31.Tulchinsky E Prohortchouk E.B. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4828-4835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The efficacy of the KRCantibodies in gel supershift assay as well as the ability of aKRC expression construct to activate endogenousmts1 and mts1 reporter genes supportKRC as the gene encoding p200. The identification ofKRC as a transcriptional regulator of mts1 allows the investigation of how changes in the expression of transcription factors may promote the expression of mts1 in metastatic cancer cells.Here we present results showing that the expression of endogenousmts1 and mts1 reporter genes were induced in NIH/3T3 cells long term-transfected with a KRC expression vector pKRC/N6. Transfection experiments were also performed in CSML100 cells. However, no significant differences in expression were observed whenmts1 reporter genes were co-transfected with pKRC/N6 in transient transfection experiments (data not shown). The inability of the pKRC/N6 to affect the expression of mts1 reporters may be due to surplus levels of endogenous KRC in CSML100 cells or inefficient expression of pKRC/N6 in transient transfection. Experiments are under way to study the regulation of mts1 in CSML100 cells harboring an antisense construct for KRC transcripts.The KRC gene has more than seven exons with a full-size transcript of ∼9.5 kb encoding 2282 amino acids (36.Wu L.C. Liu Y. Strandtmann J. Mak C.H. Lee B. Li Z. Yu C.Y. Genomics. 1996; 35: 3415-3424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MultipleKRC transcripts can be generated by alternative RNA splicing events, which result in smaller protein isoforms (44.Mak C-H. Li Z. Allen C.E. Liu Y. Wu L.C. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to the largest gene product, smaller KRC isoforms of 2129 amino acids, 1702 amino acids, and 651 amino acids may be produced (44.Mak C-H. Li Z. Allen C.E. Liu Y. Wu L.C. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Potentially, those KRC proteins of 2282, 2129, and 1702 residues are large, contain one or more Sb-DNA binding structures, and therefore, are candidates for p200. At this stage, we have not determined which KRC isoform(s) interact with the mts1 enhancer and how these KRC isoforms orchestrate the transcription of mts1 in CSML100 cells. Currently studies are under way to characterize theKRC transcripts and proteins in CSML100 and NIH/3T3 cells.Members of the KRC family of genes have previously been shown to activate transcription of target genes. A representative member Mbp1 activated the transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer element, which contains two κB motifs (57.Seeler J-S. Muchardt C. Suessle A. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse counterpart, αA-CRYBP1, has also been implicated in the activation of transcription because the introduction of an αA-CRYBP1 antisense construct has a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of a reporter gene under the control of the αA-CRYBP1 binding site (58.Brady J.P. Kantorow M. Sax C.M. Donovan D.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, another family member, MIBP1, has been shown to mediate the expression of the somatostatin receptor type II gene in the brain (50.Dörflinger U. Pscherer A. Moser M. Rümmele P. Schüle R. Buettner R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3736-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results presented here provide the first evidence that KRC is a transcription activator and defines mts1 as one of the target genes ofKRC. Mts1, also known as S100A4, is a member of the S100 family of small acidic Ca2+-binding proteins. The S100 proteins have been implicated in cell cycle progression, differentiation, metabolism, cancer development, and metastasis (reviewed in Refs. 1.Barraclough R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and 2.Sherbet G.V Lakshmi M.S. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2415-2421PubMed Google Scholar). Thirteen of the S100 genes are located as a cluster in the human chromosome region 1q21, where abnormalities are found in a number of malignancies, including breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia (3.Mischke D.

Of major importance are the reaction by-products of PLA2 activity, a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. The fatty acid is often arachidonic acid, one of the main constituents of the cell membrane in several tissues (15.Katsuki H. Okuda S. Prog.

We now report the purification and functional characterization of a PLI from Notechis ater (Australian tiger snake) serum. The inhibitor termed, N. ater inhibitor (NAI) has been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of all PLA2 enzymes that it was tested against. Additionally, the affinity of the interaction was in the nanomole to micromole range dependent on the PLA2examined. Notexin from Notechis scutatus (Common tiger snake) and taipoxin from Oxyuranus scutellatus(Australian taipan) were purchased from Venom Supplies (Tanunda, South Australia). Bee venom PLA2 (Apis millifera), bovine pancreatic PLA2 (Bos taurus), andCrotalus atrox PLA2 (Western diamondback rattlesnake) were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human secretory human type II PLA2 was generously donated by the Garvan Institute (Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia). The PLA2 inhibitor LY311727 was generously donated by Eli-Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, Indiana). Pooled N. ater serum was obtained from World Tiger Snake Farm (Launceston, Tasmania). It should be noted that the serum was pooled from two very similar subspecies ofN. ater, namely N. ater serventyi (Chappell Island tiger snake) and N. ater humphreysi (Tasmanian tiger snake). NAI (which elutes in the 0.5 m peak) was purified from whole N. aterserum using a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 15 cm). Serum (10 mg of total protein) was loaded onto the column that had been equilibrated in 0.01 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with an increasing concentration of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluant was monitored at 280 nm (ISCO, UA-6 UV-visible Detector), and fractions were collected (ISCO, Retriever II). The 0.5m peak (referred to as the semi-purified preparation or SPP) was used for functional characterization of NAI. The α- and β-chains of NAI were purified on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech smart system fitted with a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Sephasil C8 5 μm (2.1 × 100 mm) column. The column was equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The SPP collected form the DEAE-Sephacel column was loaded onto the C8 column and eluted with a gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (buffer B). The percentage of buffer B was increased as follows: 0–2 min 0%, 2–10 min 0–55%, 10–50 min 55–70%, and 50–60 min 70–100%. The eluant was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. Software controlled peak fractionation was used to collect peaks with the integrated fraction collector. Following reduction and alkylation the proteins were N-terminally sequenced with a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer. The molecular mass of NAI was assessed by size exclusion chromatography according to the method of Andrews (44.Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). A Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was calibrated with; aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. The SPP was chromatographed under identical conditions, and the native mass of NAI was estimated using the elution volume of the peak containing NAI. Two PLA2assays were utilized, either the spectrofluorometric assay of Radvanyiet al. (45.Radvanyi F. Jordan L. Russo-Marie F. Bon C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) or a mixed micelle assay based on the method of Seilhamer et al. (46.Seilhamer J.J. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Plant S. Miller J.A. Kloss J. Johnson L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5335-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were carried out as described except that enzymes were dissolved in saline/0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. For the spectrofluorometric assay substrates utilized were either 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-prendecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (10pPC, Molecular Probes, Inc.) or 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-prendecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, ammonium salt (10pPG, Molecular Probes, Inc.). Phosphatidyl ethanolamine, l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl, [arachidonyl-1-14C] (NEN Life Science Products) (specific activity, 2.035 Gbq/mmol) was used as substrate in the mixed micelle assay. The pH stability was investigated by altering the pH of the solution in which the SPP (10 μg/assay) was dissolved and testing this in the fluorometric PLA2 assay. The assay was performed using N. scutatus venom as the PLA2 source (50 ng/assay with 10pPC as substrate) at room temperature. The pH values tested were 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12. The SPP was made up to the appropriate pH and incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to testing. Temperature stability was assessed in the same manner as the pH stability. Samples were heated or cooled at the appropriate temperature for 30 min and immediately tested in the fluorometric PLA2 assay at room temperature. The temperatures examined were 4, 25, 37, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C. For both experiments the assay was performed at room temperature. Also, samples were not preincubated with venom because the stability of the PLA2 under varying pH and temperature values could not be assured. All samples were performed in triplicate with appropriate positive and negative controls. Results are expressed as percentage inhibition relative to control values. The SPP was lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate solution, pH 7.2, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and digested with 0.8 unit of N-glycosidase F or 5.0 milliunits ofO-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the SPP was either subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (47.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions and silver stained (48.Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3721) Google Scholar) or blotted onto nitrocellulose and carbohydrate detected by the digoxigenin glycan detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Salts present in the deglycosylation buffer were removed by running samples over a AG11A8/G10 column. The AG11A8 matrix (Bio-Rad) represented 1.5 × 7.5 cm of the column; poured directly on top of this was Sephadex G10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) matrix, representing 1.5 × 6 cm of the column. The column was equilibrated in water at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and samples were eluted under the same conditions. The eluant was monitored at 280 nm (ISCO, UA-6 UV-visible Detector), and fractions were collected. The eluted sample was tested in the fluorometric PLA2 assay for inhibitory activity against N. scutatus venom,Agkistrodon bilineatus venom (Central American Moccasin) and bee venom PLA2. For N. scutatus venom andA. bilineatus venom, 10pPC was used as substrate; 10pPG was used as substrate for bee venom PLA2. All PLA2sources were dissolved in saline/0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin.N. scutatus venom was used at 33.3 ng/assay, A. bilineatus venom 500 ng/assay and bee venom PLA2 25 ng/assay, all in a final volume of 10 μl. Native NAI was used as the positive control. Results are expressed as the percentage of inhibition relative to control values. The α- and β-chains were purified by RP-HPLC (see above) after deglycosylation and analyzed by mass spectrometry using a Micromass Platform II single quadrupole instrument. The mass of the reverse phase purified proteins were also measured before deglycosylation. All enzymes except hsPLA2-II and bovine pancreatic PLA2 were tested in the fluorometric assay using 10pPC as substrate. Bovine pancreatic PLA2 and hsPLA2-II were tested in the fluorometric assay using 10pPG as substrate and in the mixed micelle assay. The amount of enzyme added for the fluorometric assay were as follows; notexin, 16.7 ng; taipoxin, 800 ng; C. atrox PLA2, 40 ng; bee venom PLA2, 10 ng; bovine pancreatic PLA2, 6250 ng. For the mixed micelle assay 100 ng of bovine pancreatic PLA2 or 5 ng of hsPLA2-II were used. All enzymes were dissolved in saline/0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, except bovine pancreatic PLA2 and hsPLA2-II, which were dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, respectively. The IC50 was determined by preincubating varying concentrations of NAI (10.5 mg/mL) in a constant volume, against a constant amount of enzyme (see above and Refs. 49.Todhunter J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 383-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50.Aitafoun M. Mounier C. Heymans F. Binisti C. Bon C. Godfroid J.J. Biochem.

Signal. 1997; 16: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The concentration of NAI was varied between 30 μm and 70 pm (PLA2- and assay-dependent) until a sigmoidal dose response curve was generated allowing calculation of the IC50 value. For comparison, the IC50 for the Lilly compound LY311727 was determined using the mixed micelle assay with hsPLA2-II. All samples were performed in triplicate. Results were analyzed by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism (version 2.01) and expressed as the percentage of inhibition relative to control values. NAI was purified from whole N. ater serum utilizing a DEAE-Sephacel column (Fig.1). All peaks were collected, concentrated, and tested for inhibitory activity against N. scutatus venom in the fluorometric assay. Peaks 3 and 4 inhibited; however, when samples were diluted to a equal protein concentration, inhibition of PLA2 enzymatic activity was only detected in peak 4. The purity of NAI is approximately 90% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig.2). NAI is composed of two proteins, an α-chain (∼30 kDa) and a β-chain (∼25 kDa). These proteins are noncovalently associated because a similar separation pattern is observed when the gel is run under nonreducing conditions (not shown). The native mass of NAI was estimated at 110 kDa by size exclusion chromatography (not shown). The α- and β-chains can be separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3), and it is apparent that isoforms of the α-chain are present. By measuring the area under the curve for the α- and β-chains at 280 nm and correcting for their relative absorbance using extinction co-efficients calculated from the amino acid sequence, the NAI complex is suggested to be composed of two α-chains and one β-chain. The N terminus of the purified chains were sequenced (Table I). Two N termini were present in the peak containing NAIα, demonstrating that isoforms were partially separated under the RP-HPLC conditions utilized (Fig.3).Figure 2SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of DEAE-Sephacel separated N. aterserum.

The temperature and pH stability of NAI was investigated by varying the temperature or pH of the solution in which NAI was dissolved and measuring the inhibitory activity of NAI. The temperature stability of NAI is shown in Fig.4. As can be seen, NAI is active following exposure to a wide range of temperatures, with 76 ± 13% inhibitory activity still present after heating at 100 °C for 30 min. NAI was found to retain greater than 89% of its inhibitory activity following exposure to temperatures between 4 and 90 °C. A similar situation was seen for the pH profile of NAI (Fig.5). NAI retained greater than 94% of its inhibitory activity following overnight incubation at pH 4–12; at pH 2 the level of inhibition was 35 ± 7%.Figure 5pH stability of NAI.

Results are represented as the averages ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The glycosylation status of NAIα and NAIβ was investigated with the digoxigenin glycan detection system. After determining that only the α-chain was glycosylated, the type of linkage was analyzed, using enzymes specific for N-linked or O-linked sugars (52.Haselbeck A. Roos A. Hosel W. Topics Biochem. 1992; 10Google Scholar, 53.Haselbeck A. Hosel W. Topics Biochem. 1988; 8: 1-4Google Scholar). All carbohydrate moieties were removed byN-glycosidase F but were not affected byO-glycosidase (not shown). Mass spectrophotometric analysis of the native and deglycosylated α-chain (not shown) indicated mass differences of 2207 and 2864 Da, which are consistent with carbohydrate masses of biantennary sugars (54.Settineri C.A. Burlingame A.L. Chapman J.R. Protein and Peptide Analysis by Mass Spectrometry. 1st ed. 61. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1996: 255-278Google Scholar). After deglycosylation, NAI (in the form of the SPP) was tested for inhibitory activity against wholeN. scutatus venom, A. bilineatus venom, and bee venom PLA2 using the fluorometric assay (Fig.6). It is apparent that deglycosylated NAI is as active on all PLA2 enzymes as untreated control samples. The IC50 values determined (with 95% confidence interval) using the fluorometric assay (Fig. 7) with 10pPC as substrate for notexin, taipoxin, C. atrox PLA2, and bee venom PLA2 enzymes are as follows: 0.13 nm(0.05–0.28 nm), 0.89 nm (0.53–1.5 nm), 2.4 nm (1.4–3.9 nm), and 0.16 nm (0.085–0.31 nm), respectively. The IC50 for bovine pancreatic PLA2 (Fig.8) calculated using the fluorometric assay with 10pPG as substrate (the enzyme is not active on 10pPC) was 32.3 nm (21.8–47.7 nm). Using the mixed micelle assay the IC50 values for bovine pancreatic PLA2 and hsPLA2-II (Fig.9) were 12,050 nm (2,030–71, 490 nm) and 287.3 nm (146.4–563.9 nm), respectively. The IC50 using LY311727 (Fig. 10) on hsPLA2-II in the mixed micelle assay was calculated at 808 nm(551.4–1,184 nm).Figure 8Inhibition curve for NAI versusbovine pancreatic PLA2 enzyme.

These isoforms have high homology to other PLIs, with 67–70% homology to the 30-kDa chain of the PLI from Naja naja kaouthia (Thailand cobra), depending on which sequence was used for comparison. Only one sequence was present for NAIβ, which also shows high homology (84%) to the 25-kDa chain of the PLI purified from N. naja kaouthia (31.Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A number of PLIs have been isolated from either elapid or crotalid serum. Many of these PLIs have been sequenced and show homology to two protein families. We propose that PLIs with homology to urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, Ly-6, and CD59 will be classified as Class A PLIs. Those with homology to the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins will be classified as Class B PLIs, whereas other PLIs will be classified as Class C PLIs. Experiments were designed to investigate the pH stability and thermostability of NAI (Figs. 4 and 5). NAI was found to be extremely pH- and temperature-resistant with greater than 89% inhibition recorded for temperatures between 4 and 90 °C and greater than 94% inhibitory activity retained between pH 4 and 12. These experiments also serve to demonstrate that NAI is an effective inhibitor whether it is added before the PLA2 (IC50 studies) or added after the PLA2 (pH or temperature studies). When NAI was added after the PLA2, inhibition was immediate and as effective as when NAI was preincubated with the PLA2enzyme. Preincubation was used for the IC50 studies because the assay was empirically determined to be more robust when performed in this fashion. Carbohydrate moieties are common on snake PLIs and have been detected or presumptive evidence for their existence has been found on at least one chain for all snake PLIs characterized (30.Ohkura N.

https://openalex.org/W2054236953,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 ofEscherichia coli is regulated by a bifunctional protein, IDH kinase/phosphatase. In this paper, we demonstrate that the effectors controlling these activities belong to two distinct classes that differ in mechanism and in the locations of their binding sites. NADPH and isocitrate are representative members of one of these effector classes. NADPH inhibits both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase, whereas isocitrate inhibits only IDH kinase. Isocitrate can “activate” IDH phosphatase by reversing product inhibition by dephospho-IDH. Mutations in icd, which encodes IDH, had parallel effects on the binding of these ligands to the IDH active site and on their effects on IDH kinase and phosphatase, indicating that these ligands regulate IDH kinase/phosphatase through the IDH active site. Kinetic analyses suggested that isocitrate and NADPH prevent formation of the complex between IDH kinase/phosphatase and its protein substrate. AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate represent a class of regulatory ligands that is distinct from that which includes isocitrate and NADPH. These ligands bind directly to IDH kinase/phosphatase, a conclusion which is supported by the observation that they inhibit the IDH-independent ATPase activity of this enzyme. These effector classes can also be distinguished by the observation that mutant derivatives of IDH kinase/phosphatase expressed from aceK3 andaceK4 exhibited dramatic changes in their responses to AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate but not to NADPH and isocitrate.

Holms W.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 87: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2.Garnak M. Reeves H.C. Science. 1979; 203: 1111-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IDH controls the partitioning of isocitrate between this cycle and the glyoxylate bypass. The flux of isocitrate through the bypass is essential for growth on acetate because it prevents the quantitative loss of the acetate carbons as CO2 in the Krebs cycle (3.Kornberg H.L. Madsen N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1951; 24: 651-653Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4.Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). During growth on acetate, ∼70% of IDH is maintained in the inactive, phosphorylated form, forcing isocitrate though the bypass (5.LaPorte D.C. Walsh K. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

Crystallography demonstrated that the site of phosphorylation, Ser-113, lies within the active site cleft. Ser-113 forms a hydrogen bond with isocitrate in the active, dephosphorylated form of IDH. Phosphorylation of Ser-113 inactivates IDH by blocking isocitrate binding through a combination of electrostatic and steric effects. In contrast, NADP+ and NADPH bind to both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms for IDH (10.Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

The phosphatase activity has an absolute requirement for ATP or ADP (14.LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This protein also has an intrinsic ATPase activity (16.Stueland C.S. Eck K.R. Stieglbauer K.T. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16095-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of affinity labeling and analyses of the effects of site-directed and random mutagenesis of aceK suggest that all three activities are catalyzed by the same active site (17.Miller S.P.

The IDH phosphorylation cycle is controlled by a variety of metabolites. For example, AMP, pyruvate, and 3-phosphoglycerate activate IDH phosphatase and inhibit IDH kinase. Others, such as NADPH, inhibit both activities. Isocitrate inhibits IDH kinase but its effect on IDH phosphatase is controversial; some studies found no effect, whereas others report activation of this activity (reviewed in Ref.18.LaPorte D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these ligands elicit such a diversity of regulatory effects remain a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that there are at least two mechanisms by which the IDH kinase/phosphatase is regulated. Members of one of these effector classes bind directly to IDH kinase/phosphatase, whereas members of the other act through the active site of IDH.

Cultures were grown at 37 °C in L broth (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract) with 40 μg/ml tetracycline in a 3.5-liter high-density fermentor. Expression of the aceK genes was induced with 3 mmisopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside during the mid-log phase of growth. The purification of IDH kinase/phosphatase has been described previously (14.LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. IDH phosphatase was assayed by measuring the release of [32P]phosphate from [32P]phospho-IDH at 37 °C, as described previously (9.LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The standard reaction (50 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of [32P]phospho-IDH (∼1 × 105 cpm/assay) and Mg·ATP. The amount of [32P]phosphate released was measured in the supernatant following precipitation of the protein with trichloroacetic acid. IDH kinase was assayed by monitoring the transfer of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to IDH at 37 °C, as described previously (9.LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of Mg·[γ-32P]ATP (∼3 × 106 cpm/assay) and dephospho-IDH. The production of [32P]phospho-IDH was monitored by precipitating the protein onto filter paper and measuring the amount of radioactivity. The IDH-independent ATPase activity of IDH kinase/phosphatase was measured at 37 °C using the method of Bais (28.Bais R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reactions (50 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 or 2.0 mm Mg·[γ-32P]ATP (∼5 × 105 cpm/assay). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 140 ng of wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase. The amount of [32P]phosphate released was determined following absorption of the unreacted ATP to activated charcoal. The velocities of the enzyme reactions in the presence of effectors can be described by Equation 1,ve=f v∞+(1−f)voEquation 1 where ve is the velocity at a given concentration of effector, f is the fraction of the effector sites which are occupied, v ∞ is the velocity at saturating effector, and vo is the velocity in the absence of effector. Assuming that IDH kinase/phosphatase exhibits simple, hyperbolic binding of the effector, this equation can be expressed as,Ve=[e]([e]+K)(v∞−vo)+voEquation 2 where [e] is the effector concentration andK is the effective dissociation constant for that effector. Nonlinear regression employing Equation 2 was used to analyze the activation of IDH phosphatase. A linearized form of this equation was used to analyze the inhibition of IDH kinase and the ATPase.1(vo−ve)=K(vo−v∞) 1[e]+1(vo−v∞)Equation 3 A number of small molecules, such as isocitrate and NADP(H), play multiple roles for IDH. In addition to acting as substrates for this enzyme, they also regulate IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase. This multiplicity of roles raised the possibility that these ligands act through a single binding site, the active site of IDH. However, other authors have suggested that distinct regulatory sites for these ligands were present on IDH kinase/phosphatase (29.Nimmo G.A. Nimmo H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30.Cazzone A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 127-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We began by testing whether occupation of the coenzyme site of IDH could inhibit IDH kinase/phosphatase. This question was addressed using a derivative of IDH that has an inverted specificity for the coenzyme. This protein, IDHIS (previously designated DIA-KS-Y), includes six amino acid substitutions in the adenosine binding pocket that collectively convert the enzyme from one that favors NADP(H) to one that favors NAD(H) (22.Chen R. Greer A. Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite these mutations, IDHISremained a substrate for IDH kinase, although the apparentV max was reduced by a factor of 2, whereas the corresponding K m was increased almost 10-fold (TableI). This increase inK m may suggest that the coenzyme binding site of IDH is part of the interface between this protein and IDH kinase/phosphatase, although this remains speculative.Table IPhosphorylation of IDH derivatives of IDH kinaseIDHKm IDH, effV max, effμmnmol/min/mgWild-type1.7100IDHIS2070IDHN115L0.923IDH kinase was assayed at different concentrations of dephospho-IDH using 100 μm Mg · [32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results were analyzed using Lineweaver-Burke plots.

Standard errors were less then 17%. We examined the sensitivity of IDH and IDHIS to NADPH and NADH to determine whether the regulatory effects of these ligands were mediated through the active site of IDH. The reduced coenzymes were chosen for these studies because their K i values for inhibition of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase are more than an order of magnitude lower then those for the oxidized forms with wild-type IDH as the substrate (not shown). With wild-type IDH as a substrate, IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase exhibited linear inhibition by NADPH and were relatively insensitive to NADH (Fig.1 and TableII). With IDHIS as a substrate, the sensitivities of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase to NADH were dramatically increased, whereas those toward NADPH were decreased. These results parallel the altered coenzyme specificity of the dehydrogenase reaction, strongly suggesting that the dinucleotides affect IDH kinase by binding to the active site of its protein substrate, IDH.Table IIEffects of mutations modifying IDH on the regulation of IDH kinase/phosphataseEffective K iIDHIDH KinaseIDH PhosphataseIsocitrateNADPHNADHNADPHNADHmmWild-type0.0160.088.10.295.0IDHIS1.70.55.20.82IDHN115L0.97Effective inhibition constants were determined from the plots presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Standard errors were less then 19%. Open table in a new tab Effective inhibition constants were determined from the plots presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Standard errors were less then 19%. We next determined whether occupation of the organic acid binding site of IDH could inhibit IDH kinase. Isocitrate is known to inhibit IDH kinase, although its effect on IDH phosphatase is controversial (see below). We suspected that isocitrate, like NADPH, affects IDH kinase by binding to the active site of IDH. We tested this possibility using a derivative of IDH, IDHN115L, in place of wild-type dephospho-IDH. This derivative includes an amino acid substitution two residues away from the phosphorylation site, Ser-113. This mutation causes a conformational change in the active site that dramatically reduces affinity for isocitrate (23.Chen R. Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although IDHN115L retained the ability to act as a substrate for IDH kinase (Table I), the effective K i for isocitrate was increased almost 20-fold (Fig. 2, Table II). This observation indicates that isocitrate also acts through the active site of IDH. Reports that isocitrate activated IDH phosphatase have been used to support the conclusion that this ligand bound to IDH kinase/phosphatase (29.Nimmo G.A. Nimmo H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30.Cazzone A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 127-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, we found that isocitrate had no effect on IDH phosphatase activity in the absence of dephospho-IDH (Fig.3). We suspected that the “activation” observed by previous authors had resulted from isocitrate binding to the active site of dephospho-IDH, preventing this protein from acting as a product inhibitor of IDH phosphatase. Consistent with this idea, we found that IDH phosphatase was strongly inhibited by dephospho-IDH and isocitrate was able to reverse this inhibition (Fig. 3). IDHN115L retained the ability to inhibit IDH phosphatase. IDH phosphatase activity was reduced by a factor of 6 by 5 μm wild-type dephospho-IDH or 1 μmdephospho-IDHN115L (Fig. 3), consistent with the difference in Km values exhibited by IDH kinase for these proteins (Table I). However, isocitrate was much less effective in reversing inhibition by dephospho-IDHN115L (Fig. 3), indicating that isocitrate activated IDH phosphatase by binding to the active site of dephospho-IDH, thereby reversing product inhibition. The ability of isocitrate to reverse the inhibition of IDH phosphatase by dephospho-IDH suggested that this ligand acted by preventing the formation of the complex between these proteins. A similar mechanism appears to be responsible for the inhibition of IDH kinase by isocitrate, because this ligand increased the K m for dephospho-IDH without affecting the V max (Fig.4). NADPH may also act by preventing the formation of complexes between IDH kinase/phosphatase and its protein substrates. This ligand increased the K m of IDH kinase for dephospho-IDH and that of IDH phosphatase for phospho-IDH. NADPH did not affect theV max of either of these activities (Fig.5). The conclusion that the effector sites for isocitrate and NADPH were located on IDH raised the question of whether the sites for other effectors were also located on this protein. We addressed this question by examining the IDH-independent ATPase activity of IDH kinase/phosphatase (16.Stueland C.S. Eck K.R. Stieglbauer K.T. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16095-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of IDH, any effector capable of modulating this ATPase activity must bind directly to IDH kinase/phosphatase. Isocitrate and NADPH had no effect on the intrinsic ATPase activity (Table III), consistent with our conclusion that these ligands act through sites on IDH (see above). In contrast, AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate inhibited the ATPase activity. These effectors do not appear to compete directly with ATP because the inhibition was partial. Furthermore, the inhibition constant and the extent of inhibition are essentially the same when assays are performed at 0.2 and 2 mm ATP, even though theK m of the ATPase for ATP is 0.6 mm (Ref.17.Miller S.P.

K act, effective activation constant; K i, effective inhibition constant;v ∞/v o, the ratio of the calculated velocity predicted at saturating concentrations of the effector (v ∞) to the velocity observed in the absence of the effector (v o); WT, wild-type. The K i values describing the inhibition of the ATPase activity by AMP and 3-phosphoglycerate are in good agreement with the constants describing the activation of IDH phosphatase and inhibition of IDH kinase by these effectors. The K ifor inhibition of the ATPase by pyruvate was significantly greater than the K i for the kinase and theK act for the phosphatase. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may reflect differences in the assay conditions (e.g. the presence of IDH in the kinase and phosphatase assays but not in the ATPase assay). The abilities of AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate to inhibit the IDH-independent ATPase activity indicate that these effectors bind to IDH kinase/phosphatase. Because isocitrate and NADPH act through the active site of IDH, it appears that effectors that regulate the IDH phosphorylation cycle represent at least two distinct classes that can be distinguished by their site of action. As a further test of our conclusion that the effectors of IDH kinase/phosphatase fall into two distinct classes, we examined the effects of mutations in aceK, the gene encoding this protein. We focused our efforts on derivatives of IDH kinase/phosphatase having marked reductions in IDH phosphatase activity but retaining a near wild-type level of IDH kinase activity, AceK3 and AceK4. Each protein includes a single amino acid substitution: Q373R in AceK3 and Y414C in AceK4 (17.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol.

AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate produce modest activations of wild-type IDH phosphatase and partial inhibitions of wild-type IDH kinase (Figs.Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Table III). For each of these effectors, theK act for activation of the phosphatase was virtually identical to the K i for inhibition of IDH kinase. The relative activations of the residual AceK3 and AceK4 IDH phosphatase activities by these effectors were dramatically increased compared with the wild type protein (by 3- to 40-fold). We also observed striking increases in the K act values for IDH phosphatase (10- to 400-fold). Although the extent of inhibition of the mutant kinases were similar to wild-type, theK i values were substantially increased (2.5- to 20-fold), an effect which was similar to that which we had observed for the K act values for IDH phosphatase.Figure 7Regulation of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase by 3-phosphoglycerate. IDH phosphatase and IDH kinase were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of varying concentrations of Mg·3-phosphoglycerate.

Data were plotted using Equation 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One result of the greater relative activations of the mutant IDH phosphatases is that the differences between the wild-type and mutant activities were greatly reduced. The specific activities of wild-type and AceK3 IDH phosphatase differed by 125-fold in the absence of effector but by only 3-fold in the presence of saturating levels of AMP (Table IV). Similarly, there was a 250-fold difference in the specific activities of wild-type and AceK4 IDH phosphatase. Saturating concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate reduced this difference to 8-fold. Although this certainly does not represent an exhaustive analysis of these effects, it appears that changes in effector responses play a significant role in the selective loss of IDH phosphatase activities by AceK3 and AceK4.Table IVMaximal activations of IDH phosphataseIDH PhosphataseBasalAMP3-phosphoglyceratePyruvatenmol/min/mgWild-type25507550AceK30.2117215AceK40.09396Equation 2 and data presented in Figs.

Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 were used to determine the activity of IDH phosphatase in the absence of effectors or in the presence of saturating AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, or pyruvate. Standard errors of the mean were all less than 9%. In contrast with the results obtained with AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate, the mutations in aceK3 and aceK4 had no effect on the responses of their products to isocitrate and NADPH (Table III). These results are consistent with the suggestion that these effectors fall into two distinct classes. The IDH phosphorylation cycle of E. coli is catalyzed by a single, bifunctional protein, IDH kinase/phosphatase. Our results indicate that effectors regulating this protein belong to one of two classes, depending on their effects on IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase, the influence of mutations in aceK andicd on these responses and their abilities to inhibit the intrinsic ATPase activity. These two classes differ in the locations of the binding sites and in their mechanisms of action. AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate belong to one class of effectors. They activate IDH phosphatase and inhibit both IDH kinase and the intrinsic ATPase activities. Their ability to inhibit the ATPase activity in the absence of IDH indicates that they bind directly to IDH kinase/phosphatase. Mutations in aceK3 and aceK4dramatically increase the fold activation andK act values for IDH phosphatase and theK i values for IDH kinase for this class of ligands. The mechanisms by which AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate act remain unclear. A considerable body of evidence supports the suggestion that the kinase and phosphatase reactions are catalyzed at the same active site (17.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18.LaPorte D.C. J. Cell.

Because these effectors bind directly to IDH kinase/phosphatase, they may control a conformational equilibrium between forms of this protein that favor the kinase or phosphatase reactions (Fig. 9). The selective inhibition of IDH phosphatase and the altered effector sensitivity of the AceK3 and AceK4 proteins are consistent with a shift in this equilibrium in favor of IDH kinase, although this remains speculative. NADPH and isocitrate are members of a second class of effectors. Both ligands inhibit IDH kinase, and NADPH also inhibits IDH phosphatase (18.LaPorte D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These ligands differ from the class defined by AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate in several respects: (i) they do not activate IDH phosphatase, (ii) they bind to IDH rather than to IDH kinase/phosphatase, (iii) they do not inhibit the IDH-independent ATPase activity, and (iv) the responses to these ligands are not affected by the mutations in aceK3 and aceK4. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that occupation of the active site of IDH by the substrates of this enzyme inhibits IDH kinase and phosphatase. A mutation in icd, which reduced the affinity of IDH for isocitrate, had parallel effects on the responses of both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase to this ligand. Similarly, mutations that converted the preference of IDH from NADP(H) to NAD(H) had parallel effects on the regulation of both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase by these ligands. Finally, isocitrate and NADPH had no effect on the intrinsic ATPase activity of IDH kinase/phosphatase, in contrast with AMP, pyruvate, and 3-phosphoglycerate, effectors which appear to act by binding to IDH kinase/phosphatase. Peptide substrates have proven to be very valuable tools for studying protein kinases (32.Graves D.J. Martensen T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and might have provided additional insights into the locations of the effector sites for IDH kinase/phosphatase. Unfortunately, that approach was not possible in this case because IDH kinase/phosphatase does not appear to recognize peptide substrates, a tentative conclusion based on our observation that neither tryptic nor chymotryptic peptides derived from either phospho- or dephospho-IDH are substrates for this protein. 2S. P. Miller, R. Chen, E. J. Karschnia, C. Romfo, A. Dean, and D. C. LaPorte, unpublished observation. Our suspicion is that unlike many other protein kinases and phosphatase, IDH kinase/phosphatase does not simply recognize a short primary amino acid sequence. Our conclusion that NADPH regulates IDH kinase/phosphatase through the IDH active site contradicts earlier reports that suggested that the site for this ligand was on IDH kinase/phosphatase (29.Nimmo G.A. Nimmo H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence (failure of phospho-IDH to enhance the fluorescence of NADPH) had suggested to the previous authors (29.Nimmo G.A. Nimmo H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that NADPH could not bind to phospho-IDH even though this ligand inhibited IDH phosphatase. However, it was subsequently demonstrated that NADPH does, indeed, bind to phospho-IDH (11.Dean A.M. Lee M.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with our conclusion that this is the site of action for this ligand. The observation that isocitrate prevented product inhibition of IDH phosphatase by dephospho-IDH suggested that this ligand inhibited the formation of the IDH kinase/phosphatase·IDH complex. Additional support for this conclusion was provided by the observation that inhibition of IDH kinase by isocitrate appeared to be competitive with dephospho-IDH. Similar observations were obtained for NADPH; this ligand was competitive with dephospho-IDH for IDH kinase and with phospho-IDH for IDH phosphatase. Thus, it appears that occupation of either the coenzyme or organic acid binding sites of IDH can prevent complex formation with IDH kinase/phosphatase. We have not directly determined whether a similar mechanism is responsible for inhibition of IDH kinase/phosphatase by other ligands which can bind to the IDH active site (e.g. NADP+, α-ketoglutarate), but it seems likely that this is the case. Previous reports on the effect of isocitrate on IDH phosphatase activity have been contradictory. Whereas some studies found no effect, others reported that this ligand activated the phosphatase even in the absence of added dephospho-IDH (29.Nimmo G.A. Nimmo H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this activation of IDH phosphatase by isocitrate was probably an artifact resulting from the presence of dephospho-IDH as a contaminant of the phospho-IDH. Our results suggest that occupation of either the coenzyme or organic acid subsite of IDH inhibit complex formation with IDH kinase/phosphatase (see above and Fig. 9). The phosphorylation site, Ser-113, lies within the IDH active site forming a hydrogen bond to isocitrate in the catalytically active, dephospho-form of IDH. It seems very likely that formation of the complex between IDH and IDH kinase/phosphatase includes a number of other residues that also lie within this active site. This suggestion is supported by our observation that mutations within the adenine pocket of the NADPH binding site substantially increased the K m of IDH kinase for IDH. Ligands such as isocitrate and NADPH may prevent complex formation by directly interfering with contacts between IDH and IDH kinase/phosphatase. They might also act by inducing the closed conformation of IDH, a form that has been suggested to prevent access to the site of phosphorylation (33.Finer-Moore J. Tsutakawa S.E. Cherbavaz D.B. LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13890-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NADPH inhibits both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase because it binds to both substrate proteins, dephospho- and phospho-IDH. In contrast, isocitrate inhibits only IDH kinase because it binds to the substrate, dephospho-IDH, of this enzyme but does not bind to phospho-IDH, the substrate of IDH phosphatase (11.Dean A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2032494141,"A hybrid version of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase was investigated in which one catalytic subunit has the wild-type sequence, and the other catalytic subunit has Glu-239 replaced by Gln. Since Glu-239 is involved in intersubunit interactions, this hybrid could be used to evaluate the extent to which T state stabilization is required for homotropic cooperativity and for heterotropic effects. Reconstitution of the hybrid holoenzyme (two different catalytic subunits with three wild-type regulatory subunits) was followed by separation of the mixture by anion-exchange chromatography. To make possible the resolution of the three holoenzyme species formed by the reconstitution, the charge of one of the catalytic subunits was altered by the addition of six aspartic acid residues to the C terminus of each of the catalytic chains (AT-C catalytic subunit). Control experiments indicated that the AT-C catalytic subunit as well as the holoenzyme formed with AT-C and wild-type regulatory subunits had essentially the same homotropic and heterotropic properties as the native catalytic subunit and holoenzyme, indicating that the addition of the aspartate tail did not influence the function of either enzyme. The control reconstituted holoenzyme, in which both catalytic subunits have Glu-239 replaced by Gln, exhibited no cooperativity, an enhanced affinity for aspartate, and essentially no heterotropic response identical to the enzyme isolated without reconstitution. The hybrid containing one normal and one mutant catalytic subunit exhibited homotropic cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.4 and responded to the nucleotide effectors at about 50% of the level of the wild-type enzyme. Small angle x-ray scattering experiments with the hybrid enzyme indicated that in the absence of ligands it was structurally similar, but not identical, to the T state of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, addition of carbamoyl phosphate induced a significant alteration in the scattering pattern, whereas the bisubstrate analogN-phosphonoacetyl-l-aspartate induced a significant change in the scattering pattern indicating the transition to the R-structural state. These data indicate that in the hybrid enzyme only three of the usual six interchain interactions involving Glu-239 are sufficient to stabilize the enzyme in a low affinity, low activity state and allow an allosteric transition to occur. A hybrid version of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase was investigated in which one catalytic subunit has the wild-type sequence, and the other catalytic subunit has Glu-239 replaced by Gln. Since Glu-239 is involved in intersubunit interactions, this hybrid could be used to evaluate the extent to which T state stabilization is required for homotropic cooperativity and for heterotropic effects. Reconstitution of the hybrid holoenzyme (two different catalytic subunits with three wild-type regulatory subunits) was followed by separation of the mixture by anion-exchange chromatography.

Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6142) Google Scholar). On the functional level these two forms of the enzyme differ in catalytic activity and/or substrate affinity. Thus, the activity of the enzyme is modulated by the form in which it exists or by the relative proportions of the two forms in solution at any one time. On the structural level these two forms of the enzyme often differ on the quaternary level (2.Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). These differences in quaternary structure are associated with the relative movements of subunits with respect to each other that may result in differences in subunit interface interactions. One set of interface contacts stabilizes one form of the enzyme, and another set of contacts stabilizes the other form of the enzyme. Here we set out to determine the contribution of specific interface contacts to the relative stability of the alternate conformations of the allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2) has become a model system for the study of allosteric regulation. This enzyme catalyzes the committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate and l-aspartate to formN-carbamoyl-l-aspartate (3.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme shows homotropic cooperativity for the substrate l-aspartate and is heterotropically regulated by ATP, CTP (3.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and UTP in the presence of CTP (4.Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The enzyme from E. coli is a dodecamer composed of six catalytic chains of M r 34,000 and six regulatory chains of M r 17,000. The catalytic chains are organized as two trimeric subunits, whereas the regulatory chains are organized as three dimeric subunits. The active sites are located at the interfaces between the catalytic chains, and the nucleotide effectors bind to the same site on each of the regulatory chains (5.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 491-496Crossref Google Scholar, 6.Ladjimi M.M. Ghellis C. Feller A. Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Hervé G. J. Mol.

Two functionally and structurally different states of aspartate transcarbamoylase have been characterized. The low affinity, low activity conformation of the enzyme is described as the “tense” or T state, and the high affinity, high activity conformation of the enzyme is described as the “relaxed” or R state. The conversion from the T to the R state occurs upon aspartate binding to the enzyme in the presence of carbamoyl phosphate. Structurally, the enzyme elongates by at least 11 Å along the 3-fold axis, the upper catalytic trimer rotates 10° relative to the lower trimer, and the regulatory dimers rotate 15° around the 2-fold axes (10.Ke H.-M. Lipscomb W.N. Cho Y. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. Fetler L. Vachette P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to these quaternary changes, several tertiary changes also occur during the T to R state transition. Specifically, the 80s loop and 240s loop become reoriented. The distinct interchain contacts of side chains of the 240s loop in the T and R states have been identified as being the major contributors to the concerted transition and the stabilization of the T and R states (12.Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In particular, site-specific mutagenesis has been used to determine that the interactions of Glu-239, Asp-236, and Tyr-240 in the T and R states are critical for the stabilization of these alternate conformations of the enzyme. In the T state Glu-239 of C1 1C followed by a number, e.g. C1 or C4, refers to a particular polypeptide chain in aspartate transcarbamoylase.forms interchain interactions with Lys-164 and Tyr-165 of C4 (13.Krause K.L. Voltz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 527-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Conversion to the R state breaks these interactions and establishes new intrachain interactions between Glu-239 of C1 and Lys-164 and Tyr-165 of C1 (see Fig. 1). The E239Q mutant holoenzyme, in which all these interactions are eliminated, exhibits no cooperativity, has an increased affinity for aspartate, and the maximal velocity remains the same as that of the wild-type enzyme. In addition, the E239Q mutant holoenzyme does not respond to the nucleotide effectors. On a functional level, the kinetic data suggest that the elimination of these interactions reduces the stability of the T state and shifts the enzyme into an R-functional state (12.Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On a structural level, small angle x-ray scattering studies have shown that the E239Q substitution induces a change in the quaternary structure of the unligated mutant enzyme toward the R state, an R′ state (14.Tauc P. Vachette P. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The addition of PALA2 resulted in a structure identical to that of the PALA-ligated wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the addition of carbamoyl phosphate alone shifts the scattering pattern of the E239Q holoenzyme to the R-structural state. Thus, the energy associated with the binding of carbamoyl phosphate is sufficient to convert the E239Q holoenzyme into the R-structural state. The conversion of the E239Q holoenzyme into the R state by carbamoyl phosphate explains the functional properties of this mutant enzyme. Since the kinetic experiments are performed in the presence of a saturating concentration of carbamoyl phosphate, the mutant holoenzyme is already converted to the R state and thus the addition of aspartate or PALA cannot cause any additional structural transition. Without the possibility of a structural transition, cooperativity as well as nucleotide effects would not be expected. Because aspartate transcarbamoylase contains six identical catalytic chains, the wild-type enzyme has six interactions involving Glu-239 that stabilize the T state of the enzyme. Here we have created a hybrid holoenzyme in which one catalytic trimer has the wild-type Glu at position 239 and the other catalytic trimer has Glu-239 replaced by Gln. This hybrid enzyme will allow us to determine whether only three of the six possible interchain interactions are sufficient for stabilization of the T state of the enzyme and will provide insight into the strength of the interchain interactions necessary to stabilize the tense T state of aspartate transcarbamoylase. Agarose, ATP, CTP, l-aspartate, N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and uracil were obtained from Sigma. Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and Source Q resins, ampicillin, and Tris were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The UNO Q-1 ion-exchange column, Protein Assay Dye, and sodium dodecyl sulfate were purchased from Bio-Rad. Carbamoyl phosphate dilithium salt, obtained from Sigma, was purified before use by precipitation from 50% (v/v) ethanol and was stored desiccated at −20 °C (3.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Casamino acids, yeast extract, and tryptone were obtained from Difco. Ammonium sulfate and electrophoresis grade acrylamide were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Antipyrine was obtained from Fisher. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). The pGEM-T vector system was purchased from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin) and used according to their protocol. The E. coli strain MV1190 (Δ(lac-proAB), supE, thi, Δ(sri-recA)306::Tn10(tetr)/F′traD36, proAB, lacI q,lacZΔM15) was obtained from J. Messing. EK1104 (F− ara, thi, Δ(pro-lac), ΔpyrB,pyrF ±, rpsL) was previously constructed in this laboratory (15.Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the E239Q and wild-type holoenzymes cannot be resolved by anion-exchange chromatography, six aspartic acid residues were added to the wild-type catalytic chain to allow for chromatographic separation of the hybrid enzyme. The Asp residues were introduced by addition of six Asp codons to the pyrB gene by PCR (16.Saiki R.H. Gelgand D. Stoffel S. Scharf S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 230: 487-491Crossref Scopus (13489) Google Scholar). The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA fragment was isolated from the agarose using glass beads (Bio101, Vista, CA). The DNA fragment containing the modified pyrB gene was mixed with the linear T-tail vector, pGEM-T, and treated with T4 DNA ligase for 16 h at 4 °C. Both a candidate with the PCR product inserted and the plasmid used for expression, pEK54 (17.Xu W. Pitts M.A. Middleton S.A. Kelleher S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5507-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were digested with the restriction enzymes BstEII and SacI. The insert and vector fragments were isolated from an agarose gel using glass beads and treated with DNA ligase. The resulting plasmid, pEK357, was sequenced (18.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar) to confirm that the mutagenesis had been successful and that the PCR had introduced no other mutations. Plasmid pEK56 (12.Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) carries the E239Q mutation in thepyrB gene and also carries the pyrI gene. In order to remove the pyrI gene so that this plasmid would only produce catalytic subunit, it was digested with BglII and BamHI. The larger fragment of 4543 base pairs, lacking most of the pyrI gene, was isolated from the agarose gel using glass beads. This DNA fragment with complementary ends was treated with T4 DNA ligase to form pEK316. A smaller version of the plasmid pEK164 (19.Dembowski N.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was constructed by digesting pEK164 with the restriction enzymes SmaI and SnaBI. The 3958-base pair fragment was isolated from agarose gel using glass beads. This DNA fragment with blunt ends was treated with T4 DNA ligase to form pEK168. The aspartate transcarbamoylase wild-type, AT-C, and E239Q-C catalytic subunits were overexpressed utilizing strain EK1104 containing plasmids pEK17, pEK357, and pEK316, respectively. Bacteria were cultured at 37 °C with agitation in M9 media (20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 368-369Google Scholar) containing 0.5% casamino acids, 12 μg/ml uracil, and 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.2, followed by sonication to lyse the cells. Two 65% ammonium sulfate fractionation steps were performed. Ion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin was used to purify the enzyme further (21.Stebbins J.W. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14860-14864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After concentration, the purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and nondenaturing PAGE (23.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar, 24.Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). The aspartate transcarbamoylase regulatory subunit was overexpressed utilizing strain EK1104 containing plasmid pEK168. Bacteria were cultured at 37 °C with agitation in M9 media (20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 368-369Google Scholar) containing 0.5% casamino acids, 12 μg/ml uracil, and 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.1m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.2, 0.1 mm zinc chloride followed by sonication to lyse the cells. Two 65% ammonium sulfate fractionation steps were performed. As described previously, ion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin was used initially to purify the regulatory subunit (19.Dembowski N.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The regulatory chain was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using Source-Q. The Source-Q (1 × 10 cm) column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm zinc acetate. This was followed by a gradient (total volume of 10 column volumes) of 0–50% 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 1.0 mNaCl. After concentration of the appropriate fractions, the purity of the regulatory subunit was checked by SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and nondenaturing PAGE (23.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar, 24.Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of purified wild-type catalytic subunit and AT-C catalytic subunit were mixed with excess regulatory subunit and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate overnight (25.Sakash J.B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mixture was examined by nondenaturing PAGE to confirm the formation of the three holoenzyme species, C2R3, (C)(AT-C)R3, and (AT-C)2R3. This mixture was then fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography using a Bio-Rad UNO Q-1 column. The column was equilibrated with 40 mmKH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0. After the sample was injected, the column was washed, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, for 4 min with 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, followed by 0–50% 40 mm KH2PO4buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 m NaCl gradient over 20 min. Nondenaturing PAGE was used to identify the fractions containing C2R3, (C)(AT-C)R3, and (AT-C)2R3. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 40 mm KH2PO4buffer, pH 7.0. Each species was rechromatographed a second time using identical conditions. Equal amounts of purified E239Q-C catalytic subunit and AT-C catalytic subunit were mixed with excess regulatory subunit and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate (25.Sakash J.B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mixture was examined by nondenaturing PAGE to confirm the existence of the three holoenzyme species, (E239Q-C)2R3, (E239Q-C)(AT-C)R3, and (AT-C)2R3. Separation of the species was performed using the UNO Q-1 column as indicated above. The concentration of the wild-type holoenzyme, catalytic subunit, and regulatory subunit were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 0.59, 0.72, and 0.32 cm2 mg−1, respectively (26.Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of the mutant enzymes were determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye-binding assay (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). The concentration of the nucleotides was determined from absorbance measurements at the λmax at pH 7.0 using the respective molar extinction coefficients of the nucleotides. The aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was measured at 25 °C by the colorimetric method (28.Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Saturation curves were performed in duplicate, and data points shown in the figures are the average values. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. Data analysis of the steady-state kinetics was carried out as described previously (29.Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fitting of the experimental data to theoretical equations was accomplished by non-linear regression. When substrate inhibition was negligible, data were fit to the Hill equation. If substrate inhibition was significant, data were analyzed using an extension of the Hill equation that included a term for substrate inhibition (30.Pastra-Landis S.C. Evans D.R. Lipscomb W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4624-4630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide saturation curves were fit to a hyperbolic binding isotherm by non-linear regression. The small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed on the Beam Line 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. A significantly upgraded version of the small angle scattering instrument was used. The specimen-to-detector distance was 95 cm, and the x-ray wavelength was tuned to 1.381 Å using the Si(111) double-crystal monochromator (31.Tsuruta H. Brennan S. Rek Z.U. Irving T.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 672-682Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A linear gas chamber detector filled with a Xe/CO2 mixture was used in the experiment. Total counting rate on the detector was between 30,000 and 90,000 counts/s. The scattering curves are expressed as the momentum transfer h (h = 4π(sinθ)/λ), where 2θ and λ are the scattering angle and the wavelength of the x-ray beam, respectively, which was calibrated using the (100) reflection from a cholesterol myristate powder sample held at the specimen position. Sample solutions were maintained at 25 °C. All scattering curves were normalized to incident beam intensity integrated over exposure time, and the corresponding solvent scattering was subtracted. The enzyme solution was diluted so all the scattering curves were performed at the identical protein concentration. A hybrid aspartate transcarbamoylase holoenzyme composed of two different catalytic subunits (i.e. one wild-type and one mutant) can be formed by reconstitution of the two different catalytic subunits with excess regulatory subunits. However, this result is a mixture containing pure wild-type holoenzyme, pure mutant holoenzyme, and the desired hybrid holoenzyme. It has been reported that hybrid species of this type can be separated after chemical modification of one of the subunits such that the charge on that subunit is altered (32.Wente S.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although such an approach was attempted here, it was found unreliable so we altered the charge on one of the subunits by adding a C-terminal extension of six aspartic acid residues in an approach similar to that used by Onuffer and Kirsch (33.Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with aspartate aminotransferase employing Glu residues. As a first control, the catalytic subunit containing the Asp extension (AT-C) was purified, and a kinetic characterization was performed to determine whether the addition of the six Asp tail had any significant influence on catalysis. Aspartate saturation curves were determined for the wild-type, the AT-C, and the E239Q catalytic subunits, and the kinetic parameters were calculated from these curves (TableI). The kinetic parameters of the AT-C were very similar to those of the wild-type catalytic subunit. AT-C had a specific activity of 26.3 mmol/h/mg and a K m of 5.0 mm compared with the wild-type catalytic subunit parameters of 27.4 mmol/h/mg and 6.9 mm. E239Q catalytic subunit had a specific activity of 26.6 mmol/h/mg and aK m of 27 mm, similar to the previously published kinetic data (12.Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R.

Similar kinetic characterization of the reconstituted C2R3 and (AT-C)2R3 holoenzymes verified that the actual reconstitution procedure does not alter the intrinsic properties of these enzymes. The reconstituted holoenzymes were formed by mixing wild-type catalytic subunit (C) and AT-C catalytic subunit in the presence of excess regulatory subunit (R). This mixture, resulting in the three possible reconstituted holoenzyme species C2R3, (C)(AT-C)R3, and (AT-C)2R3, was separated by anion-exchange chromatography. The purity of the individual species was verified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the major band in each lane (see Fig. 2). As is the case of wild-type aspartate transcarbamoylase holoenzyme, the hybrids also show a small contamination of (C)2(R)2. Kinetic characterization indicated that all three of the reconstituted holoenzymes had similar maximal observed specific activities, [Asp]0.5 and Hill coefficients, confirming that the addition of the Asp tail and reconstitution procedure do not significantly alter the holoenzyme (see Table I). The hybrid holoenzyme containing one wild-type catalytic subunit and one E239Q-C catalytic subunit was generated by mixing E"
https://openalex.org/W2012243322,"The conventional model for transport of Ca2+ by the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) involves a pair of binding sites for Ca2+ that change upon phosphorylation of the ATPase from being high affinity and exposed to the cytoplasm to being low affinity and exposed to the lumen. However, a number of recent experiments suggest that in fact transport involves two separate pairs of binding sites for Ca2+, one pair exposed to the cytoplasmic side and the other pair exposed to the lumenal side. Here we show that the carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl] carbodiimide (EDC) is membrane-impermeable, and we use EDC to distinguish between cytoplasmic and lumenal sites of reaction. Modification of the Ca2+-ATPase in sealed SR vesicles with EDC leads to loss of ATPase activity without modification of the pair of high affinity Ca2+-binding sites. Modification of the purified ATPase in unsealed membrane fragments was faster than modification in SR vesicles, suggesting the presence of more quickly reacting lumenal sites. This was confirmed in experiments measuring EDC modification of the ATPase reconstituted randomly into sealed lipid vesicles. Modification of sites on the lumenal face of the ATPase led to loss of the Ca2+-induced increase in phosphorylation by Pi. It is concluded that carboxyl groups on the lumenal side of the ATPase are involved in Ca2+ binding to the lumenal side of the ATPase and that modification of these sites leads to loss of ATPase activity. The presence of MgATP or MgADP leads to faster inhibition of the ATPase by EDC in unsealed membrane fragments than in sealed vesicles, suggesting that binding of MgATP or MgADP to the ATPase leads to a conformational change on the lumenal side of the membrane.

The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar). The change in orientation of the sites is linked to a change in the affinity of the sites, from high affinity when facing the cytoplasm to low affinity when facing the lumen. Thus the unphosphorylated ATPase binds two Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, where the Ca2+ ion concentration is μm, and, following phosphorylation by ATP, transports the two Ca2+ ions across the membrane, releasing them on the lumenal side where the Ca2+concentration is mm. However, recent experiments have identified problems with this model. In particular, the alternating site model predicts that binding of Ca2+ from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane should be competitive with binding of Ca2+ from the lumenal side, but a variety of equilibrium and kinetic experiments have shown that binding from the two sides of the membrane is, in fact, noncompetitive (2.Jencks W.P. Yang T. Peisach D. Myung J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3.Myung J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8775-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4.Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a four-site model for the ATPase, with separate pairs of binding sites for Ca2+ on the two sides of the membrane; transport of Ca2+ by the Ca2+-ATPase then corresponds to transfer of Ca2+ from the cytoplasmic pair of sites to the lumenal pair of sites, driven by phosphorylation of the ATPase by ATP (Fig. 1) (2.Jencks W.P. Yang T. Peisach D. Myung J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3.Myung J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8775-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 10 putative transmembrane α-helices in the Ca2+-ATPase contain four negatively charged residues, in helices M4, M5, M6, and M8, and mutation of these residues blocks high affinity Ca2+ binding to the ATPase. These residues are therefore presumed to constitute the pair of binding sites to which Ca2+ ions bind from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (5.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). It was first assumed that two of these acidic residues would be present at each of the two Ca2+ ion-binding sites and that the two binding sites would be located one above the other because binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase is sequential (5.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 6.Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have, however, suggested a peripheral role for helix M8 in Ca2+ binding (7.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) consistent with a side-by-side arrangement for the two Ca2+ ion-binding sites (8.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar); a side-by-side arrangement is also consistent with recent cryoelectron microscopic studies of the Ca2+-ATPase (9.Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As well as the residues in the transmembrane region, it has been suggested that Asp residues in the loop joining helices M6 and M7 on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane could make up part of the cytoplasmic pair of Ca2+-binding sites (10.Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Moller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the only four acidic residues in the transmembrane region of the ATPase are involved in the cytoplasmic pair of binding sites, acidic residues at the pair of low affinity sites must correspond to residues on the lumenal side of the membrane. Only about 10% of the mass of the Ca2+-ATPase is located on the lumenal side (9.Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and this is predicted to consist mainly of small loops between the transmembrane α-helices but with a relatively large loop between helices M7 and M8 (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis of polar residues on the lumenal side of the ATPase failed to identify any whose mutation blocked accumulation of Ca2+ driven by hydrolysis of ATP (7.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chemical labeling of residues has often been found to have larger effects on activity than mutagenesis, presumably because of steric effects associated with the relatively bulky labeling reagents; good examples are provided by studies of the labeling of Cys residues inlac permease (11.Kaback H.R. Wu J.H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 333-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we have used labeling by a carbodiimide to show the presence of amino acid residues on the lumenal side of the ATPase, critical for function. Labeling of the Ca2+-ATPase with the hydrophobic carbodiimides dicylcohexylcarbodiimide andN-cyclohexyl-N′-(4-dimethylamino-1-naphthyl)carbodiimide is competitive with binding of Ca2+ at the high affinity sites, and so these carbodiimides are likely to modify carboxyl groups at the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites (12.Pick U. Weiss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13.Munkonge F. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14.Garcia de Anios J. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase is also inactivated by reaction with the water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl] carbodiimide (EDC)1 (15.Coan C. Jakobs P. Ju J.Y. Murphy A.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here we make use of the membrane impermeability of EDC to distinguish between the effects of modifying carboxyl groups on the cytoplasmic and lumenal sides of the Ca2+-ATPase and show that modification of carboxyl groups on the lumenal side of the membrane inhibits ATPase activity and Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation by Pi. These results are consistent with the four-site model for the Ca2+-ATPase. Octaethylene glycol-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8) andn-octyl-β-d-glucoside were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, and 4-bromomethyl-6,7-dimethoxycoumarin (Br-DMC) was from Molecular Probes. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described in Ref.16.Dalton K.A. East J.M. Mall S. Oliver S. Starling A.P. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, and Ca2+-ATPase was purified as membrane fragments from SR as described in Ref. 17.East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4144-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar. Reconstituted vesicles were prepared using a procedure based on the method described by Levy et al.(18.Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). DOPC (18 mg) was suspended in buffer (4.2 ml; 10 mmPipes, 100 mm K2SO4, pH 7.1) containing 40 mm octyl-β-d-glucoside and sonicated in a bath sonicator (Ultrawave model U100) for about 5 min. SR (1 mg protein) was solubilized in 0.5 ml of buffer (10 mm Pipes. 100 mm K2SO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.1) containing 12 mg of C12E8. The solubilized SR was mixed with the lipid sample to give a 1:600 molar ratio of protein:lipid. Detergent was removed by addition of four aliquots of washed SM2Bio-Beads over a period of 4 h, as described by Levy et al. (18.Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), to give the final preparation of sealed vesicles. When reconstituted vesicles were required containing Mg2+ and Pi in the lumenal volume, these ions were included in the reconstitution buffer at the required concentrations. SR vesicles were passively loaded with Ca2+ by incubation in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm sucrose, and the required concentration of Ca2+ at pH 7.0 for 2 h at a protein concentration of 40 mg protein/ml. ATPase activities were determined at 25 °C using a coupled enzyme assay in a medium containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 2.1 mm ATP, 1.1 mm EGTA, 0.53 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH, pyruvate kinase (7.5 IU), and lactate dehydrogenase (18 IU) in a total volume of 2.5 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an aliquot of a 25 mm CaCl2 solution to a cuvette containing the ATPase and the other reagents to give a maximally stimulating concentration of Ca2+ (free Ca2+ concentration was ∼10 μm). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by suspending 18 mg of DOPC in 1.1 ml of buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 4.0, 100 mmK2SO4) and extruding 15 times through a 100-nm pore polycarbonate filter in an Avestin mini-extruder. Fluorescein or EDC was trapped in the vesicles by including them in the original suspension buffer; untrapped reagent was removed by passing the vesicles through two 5-ml columns of coarse Sephadex G50. Samples were diluted 12-fold into buffer, and the fluorescence was recorded, exciting fluorescence at 481 nm, recording the fluorescence intensity at 507 nm. When required, vesicles were made leaky by addition of 1.2 mm C12E8. SR or ATPase (6 mg protein/ml) were incubated with EDC (2.4 mm) at 37 °C in buffer (100 mm Mops, pH 6.8, 2 mm EGTA, 80 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2) for the stated times. The reaction was stopped either by dilution into the ATPase assay mix or by centrifugation of the reaction mixture through two columns containing coarse Sephadex G-50, pre-equilibrated in buffer. The Ca2+-ATPase was labeled with Br-DMC by addition of a stock solution of Br-DMC in dimethylformamide to SR (8 mg protein/ml) in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 200 mm sucrose) to an initial molar ratio of DMC:SR of 10:1. The mixture was incubated at room temperature, and the unreacted Br-DMC was removed by centrifugation through two Sephadex G-50 columns. The labeling ratio was estimated using extinction coefficients of 1.2 liter g−1 cm−1 and 12,900m−1 cm−1 for protein and DMC, respectively, in 1% (w/v) SDS (19.Stefanova H.I. East J.M. Gore M.G. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6023-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were recorded by using an SLM 8000C spectrofluorimeter. DMC fluorescence was excited at 350 nm and observed at 425 nm; tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 290 nm and observed at 340 nm; and fluorescein fluorescence was excited at 495 nm and observed at 525 nm. The positive charge on the water-soluble EDC would be expected to make it membrane-impermeable. This was confirmed by studying the reaction between EDC and the carboxyl-containing fluorescence probe fluorescein, with either EDC or fluorescein trapped in unilamellar lipid vesicles. The presence of the -OH and -COOH groups on fluorescein (for structure see Fig.2) make its fluorescence intensity pH-sensitive; addition of NaOH to increase the pH of a solution of fluorescein from four to ten results in a ∼24-fold increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2, curve a). Addition of 2 mm EDC immediately before the addition of NaOH leads to a 32% decrease in the response to NaOH (Fig. 2, curve c). Increasing the time of reaction with EDC or increasing the concentration of EDC had no significant effect on the change in response to NaOH; we therefore conclude that formation of the acylisourea derivative of fluorescein results in a 32% lower fluorescence intensity at high pH. It should also be noted that the rate of reaction of EDC with carboxyl groups is fastest in the pH range 3.5–4.5 (20.Nakajima N. Ikada Y. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A also shows the results of an experiment in which 200 mm EDC was trapped inside large unilamellar vesicles, which were then diluted 12-fold into pH 4.0 buffer containing 1 μm fluorescein. The sample was incubated for 1 h, and then NaOH was added to increase the pH to 10; as shown (curve b), the observed increase in fluorescence intensity was the same as for fluorescein alone in the absence of EDC (curve a), showing that over the 1-h time period of the incubation EDC did not leak out of the vesicles. If the detergent C12E8 was added immediately before the addition of NaOH to make the vesicles leaky to EDC, the response to NaOH was reduced (curve d) as seen previously (curve c). The experiment was repeated with fluorescein (0.1 mm) trapped in the vesicles (Fig. 2 B), using carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) to equilibrate protons across the membrane. Dilution of the vesicles into buffer at pH 4.0 followed by addition of NaOH resulted in only a small increase in fluorescence intensity, showing that the majority of the fluorescein was trapped in the vesicles; subsequent addition of FCCP (0.25 μm) resulted in a large increase in fluorescence intensity, as protons equilibrated across the membrane (curve c). If vesicles were incubated for 1 h in buffer at pH 4.0 containing 2 mm EDC before addition of NaOH (curve b), the fluorescence response was the same as for vesicles incubated in the absence of EDC (curve a), again showing that EDC was unable to penetrate into the vesicles to react with the fluorescein. We conclude that EDC is membrane-impermeable under these conditions. Ca2+ binding to the high affinity sites on the Ca2+-ATPase can be conveniently monitored from the change in tryptophan fluorescence intensity observed on Ca2+ binding to the ATPase (21.Dupont Y. Leigh J.B. Nature. 1978; 273: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22.Guillain F. Gingold M.P. Buschlen S. Champeil P. J. Biol.

Labeling the ATPase with excess EDC had no significant effect on the measured affinity for Ca2+ (Fig.3). Maximal levels of Ca2+binding to the ATPase were determined by incubation with 50 μm45Ca2+ at pH 7.2, as described in Starling et al. (25.Starling A.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The levels of binding observed for unlabeled and EDC-labeled ATPase were 7.5 and 6.0 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Coan et al. (15.Coan C. Jakobs P. Ju J.Y. Murphy A.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have shown that incubation of SR vesicles with EDC leads to loss of ATPase activity. This is confirmed by the data shown in Fig.4. SR vesicles were incubated with 2.4 mm EDC at pH 6.8 and 37 °C for the given periods of time, and then 2 μl of the sample were diluted into 3 ml of the ATPase assay mixture to stop the reaction and to determine the remaining ATPase activity. Reaction with EDC leads to almost complete loss of ATPase activity, at a rate of 0.07 ± 0.01 min−1 (Fig. 4). When the same experiment was repeated but with the purified Ca2+-ATPase, present as unsealed membrane fragments, inhibition was found to be somewhat faster, with a rate of 0.10 ± 0.01 min−1. These experiments suggest the presence of more quickly reacting sites on the Ca2+-ATPase, accessible to EDC in unsealed membrane fragments but inaccessible in sealed SR vesicles. This possibility was explored further by studying the reaction with the Ca2+-ATPase reconstituted into sealed phospholipid vesicles. Reconstituted vesicles were prepared by dissolving DOPC in buffer containing a relatively high (40 mm) concentration of octyl-β-d-glucoside and then mixing with SR solubilized in C12E8. Removal of detergent by the addition of SM2 Bio-Beads led to the formation of tightly sealed vesicles containing the Ca2+-ATPase (26.Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reconstituted vesicles are impermeable to ATP so that only outwardly facing ATPase molecules hydrolyze ATP added to the external medium. The reconstitution procedure gives a random incorporation of ATPase molecules between the two halves of the bilayer, as shown by a doubling of ATPase activity upon addition of low concentrations of C12E8 (0.8 mg/ml) to make the vesicles leaky to ATP (26.Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); C12E8 at this concentration had no significant effect on the activity of the purified Ca2+-ATPase (27.de Foresta B. le Maire M. Orlowski S. Champeil P. Lund S. Moller J.V. Michelangeli F. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2558-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reconstituted vesicles were incubated with EDC and then diluted into the ATPase assay mixture to determine the ATPase activity of the outward facing ATPase molecules. C12E8 (0.8 mg/ml) was then added to give the total ATPase activity; subtraction of the activity measured in the absence of C12E8 from that measured in the presence of C12E8 gave the activity of the inward facing ATPase molecules. The time course of inhibition of the ATPase activity of the outward facing ATPase molecules was found to be identical to that of the ATPase in SR vesicles (0.06 ± 0.01 min−1), but for the inward facing ATPase molecules the maximum inhibition was only 80%, and the time course of modification was faster, with a rate (0.11 ± 0.02 min−1) the same as that for the purified ATPase (Fig. 4). The observation that the inward facing ATPase molecules are inhibited by EDC shows that sites on the lumenal side of the ATPase react with EDC, leading to inhibition of the ATPase. Reaction of a carbodiimide with an acidic amino acid residue gives an initial unstable O-acylisourea, which can then undergo further reaction, including reaction with an endogenous nucleophile to give an intramolecular cross-linked product (28.Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). To reduce the possibility of intramolecular cross-linking, reactions with EDC were also performed in the presence of 5 mm glycine ethyl ester; as shown in Fig. 4, this had no effect on the rate or level of inhibition of ATPase activity. The Ca2+-ATPase can be phosphorylated by Pi in a Mg2+-dependent reaction in the absence of Ca2+ ions on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane; binding of Ca2+ to the high affinity binding sites on the Ca2+-ATPase inhibits this phosphorylation (1.de Meis L. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of Ca2+ to the low affinity, lumenal pair of Ca2+-binding sites on the ATPase leads to increased levels of phosphorylation by Pi, an effect particularly marked at neutral pH values where the levels of phosphorylation are otherwise low (2.Jencks W.P. Yang T. Peisach D. Myung J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4.Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29.Suko J. Plank B. Preis P. Kolassa N. Hellmann G. Conca W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Levels of phosphorylation can either be measured directly using 32Pi or through the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of DMC-labeled ATPase, which occurs upon phosphorylation (4.Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). DMC-labeled SR vesicles were loaded with Ca2+ and diluted to 0.12 mg protein/ml in buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 6 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Mg2+, and the change in EDC fluorescence upon addition of 10 mm Pi was recorded. As shown in Fig. 5 the magnitude of the fluorescence response increased with increasing Ca2+ load, a maximal change of about 4.8% being observed in the presence of 4 mm Ca2+. Coan et al. (15.Coan C. Jakobs P. Ju J.Y. Murphy A.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have reported that modification of SR vesicles with EDC (at cytoplasmic sites) blocks phosphorylation with32Pi, and in agreement, addition of Pi to DMC-labeled EDC-modified SR resulted in no significant change in fluorescence intensity (data not shown). To study the effect of EDC modification of the lumenal sites on the response of phosphorylation to Ca2+, DMC-labeled ATPase was reconstituted into sealed vesicles of DOPC in the presence of 10 mm Pi and 10 mm Mg2+, trapping Pi and Mg2+ within the reconstituted vesicles. Reconstituted vesicles were then diluted into buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.1, 100 mmK2SO4), and the response to the addition of Ca2+ was recorded. Under these conditions, binding of Ca2+ to lumenal sites on the inward facing ATPase molecules would lead to increased phosphorylation, observed as a decrease in DMC fluorescence intensity, and binding of Ca2+ to the cytoplasmic sites on the outward facing ATPase molecules would lead to dephosphorylation of the small proportion of these ATPase molecules phosphorylated under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, the net result is that addition of Ca2+ leads to a decrease in fluorescence intensity of up to about 5%, the concentration of Ca2+ giving a half-maximal effect being 1.2 mm, comparable with the lumenal concentration of Ca2+ giving half-maximal effect for SR vesicles. The Ca2+-ATPase can bind and transport divalent metal ions such as Co2+ and Mn2+ instead of Ca2+ (30.Chiesi M. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); Mn2+ will also replace Mg2+ in phosphorylation of the ATPase by Pi(31.Gonzalez D.A. Alonso G.L. Lacapere J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Light scattering problems prevented the use of Co2+, but as shown in Fig. 5, we found that addition of Mn2+produced a larger phosphorylation-induced change in DMC fluorescence intensity than did Ca2+, and so Mn2+ was used in subsequent experiments. Effects of Mn2+ were only observed in the presence of lumenal Pi, and the concentration of Mn2+ giving a half-maximal effect was about 0.5 mm (Fig. 5). To determine the effect of modification with EDC on the fluorescence change caused by Mn2+, vesicles were reconstituted as described above and then incubated with 3 mm EDC at 37 °C. At various times samples were taken and diluted into buffer, and the response to the addition of 1 mm Mn2+was recorded. As shown in the inset to Fig.6, whereas a ∼10% decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed upon addition of 1 mmMn2+ to unreacted vesicles, after 60-min reaction with EDC the fluorescence response was reduced to ∼2%, after correcting for dilution effects. The time course of the loss of fluorescence response fitted to a single exponential process with a rate of 0.05 ± 0.01 min−1 comparable with the time course of the loss of ATPase activity. Modification with EDC was also found to block the fluorescence response to addition of Ca2+ over the same time period (data not shown). As reported by Coanet al. (15.Coan C. Jakobs P. Ju J.Y. Murphy A.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the presence of Mg2+ in the external medium results in some protection for SR against inactivation by EDC; in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, reaction with 2.4 mm EDC for 60 min leads to 81% inhibition of ATPase activity (Fig. 7) compared with 90% in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4). A similar effect of Mg2+ is observed for the purified ATPase (Figs. 4 and 7). Addition of ATP in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+had no significant effect on the level of inhibition of SR by EDC, but for the purified ATPase, inhibition increased to 95% at high concentrations of ATP (Fig. 7). The half-maximal effect of ATP was observed at 5 μm ATP; this is similar to theK d value for MgATP, estimated as between 2 and 6 μm at pH 7.2 in the presence of 2 mmMg2+ (32.Lacapere J.J. Bennett N. Dupont Y. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP in the presence of Mg2+ was observed to have the same effect as ATP but, in the absence of Mg2+, neither ADP nor ATP at concentrations up to 5 mm had any effect on inactivation of the ATPase by EDC. We conclude that binding of MgATP or MgADP to the catalytic site on the cytoplasmic domain of the ATPase leads to a conformation change on the lumenal side of the ATPase, resulting in increased inhibition on reaction with EDC. The mechanism of the Ca2+-ATPase has usually been described in terms of the alternating sites, E1-E2 model (1.de Meis L. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar). This proposes that in the E1 conformation, the ATPase has two outward facing Ca2+-binding sites of high affinity. Following the binding of two Ca2+ ions and MgATP, the ATPase becomes phosphorylated to give E1PCa2. This then undergoes a conformational change to the E2PCa2 state in which the two Ca2+-binding sites are inward facing and low affinity. Following loss of Ca2+ from these sites, the ATPase can be dephosphorylated to give E2, which can then undergo a conformational change back to E1. However, this model predicts that binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase from the lumenal side of the membrane (to E2) will be competitive with binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (to E1), whereas experimentally binding from the two sides of the membrane has been found to be noncompetitive (2.Jencks W.P. Yang T. Peisach D. Myung J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3.Myung J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8775-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4.Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A four-site model for the ATPase has therefore been proposed in which the Ca2+-ATPase contains two pairs of sites for Ca2+, a high affinity pair of sites facing the cytoplasm and a low affinity pair of sites facing the lumen (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of the ATPase results in closing of the cytoplasmic pair of sites with transfer of the two bound Ca2+ ions to the pair of lumenal sites (2.Jencks W.P. Yang T. Peisach D. Myung J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3.Myung J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8775-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The lumenal side of the ATPase consists mostly of small loops between transmembrane α-helices with a larger loop between helices M7 and M8 (Fig. 1). The small loop between helices M1 and M2 and the larger loop between helices M7 and M8 are predicted to be rich in acidic residues. The two low affinity Ca2+-binding sites could be organized side-by-side as suggested in Fig. 1 because release of Ca2+from the phosphorylated ATPase is sequential (33.Forge V. Mintz E. Canet D. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18271-18276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34.Duggleby R.C. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Release of Ca2+ from the lumenal sites must involve a conformational change on the ATPase because release of Ca2+ is slow (∼20 s−1; see Ref. 34.Duggleby R.C. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) despite the low affinity of the sites for Ca2+; this conformational change could correspond to movement of the M7-M8 loop, as suggested in Fig. 1. If a pair of binding sites for Ca2+ do exist on the lumenal side of the membrane, then chemical modification of these residues would be expected to block binding of Ca2+ on the lumenal side of the membrane and, possibly, block transfer of Ca2+from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal sites and thus block ATPase activity. Here we have shown that the charged, water-soluble carbodiimide EDC is membrane-impermeable, and we have used this membrane impermeability to distinguish between acidic groups on the cytoplasmic and lumenal sides of the ATPase. Homogenization of muscle gives a preparation of sealed SR vesicles in which the ATPase molecules are oriented the right way round; purification of the Ca2+-ATPase from the SR membrane gives a preparation of ATPase in unsealed membrane-fragments (1.de Meis L. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar). Thus in SR vesicles only carboxyl groups in the ATPase exposed on the cytoplasmic side are available for reaction with EDC, whereas for the purified Ca2+-ATPase both cytoplasmic and lumenal sides are available for reaction. As shown in Fig. 4, inhibition of ATPase activity by EDC is faster for the purified ATPase than for SR, suggesting that inhibitory sites on the lumenal side react more quickly than those on the cytoplasmic side. This was confirmed by experiments with reconstituted membranes in which the Ca2+-ATPase is randomly distributed between the two faces of the membrane; outward facing ATPase molecules are inhibited more slowly than inward facing ATPase molecules (Fig. 4). The observation that inward facing ATPase molecules are inhibited by EDC (Fig. 4) shows that modification of sites accessible from what would normally be the lumenal side of the ATPase causes inhibition of the ATPase. The modified sites are not the pair of high affinity Ca2+ ion-binding sites because modification of the ATPase with EDC does not result in any change in affinity of the high affinity sites for Ca2+ (Fig. 3); modification of the high affinity sites with hydrophobic carbodiimides blocks Ca2+ binding to these site (12.Pick U. Weiss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13.Munkonge F. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14.Garcia de Anios J. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). That the lumenal sites modified by EDC could be the lumenal Ca2+-binding sites is suggested by experiments measuring the effect of divalent metal ions on the level of phosphorylation of the ATPase by Pi. The level of phosphorylation of the ATPase can be measured from changes in the fluorescence intensity of DMC-labeled ATPase (4.Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ or Mn2+ to lumenal sites on the ATPase leads to increased levels of phosphorylation by Pi (Fig.5), but modification of lumenal sites by EDC leads to a loss of this stimulatory effect of divalent metal ions (Fig. 6). Sites labeled by EDC on the lumenal side of the membrane therefore include sites involved in Ca2+ binding on the lumenal side of the membrane. Extensive mutagenesis of lumenal residues by Andersen (7.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) failed to identify any residues whose mutagenesis blocked uptake of Ca2+ driven by hydrolysis of ATP. It is possible that more sensitive assays of protein function would have detected defects resulting from mutagenesis of key residues on the lumenal side of the ATPase. It is also possible that the inhibitory effects of EDC observed here follow from steric effects rather than from simple removal of the negative charge resulting from modification of a carboxyl group. The Ca2+-binding sites on the ATPase must be linked functionally to the cytoplasmic domain of the ATPase because phosphorylation of the ATPase by ATP leads to transfer of Ca2+ from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal pair of binding sites. Evidence for such a link is provided by the experiment shown in Fig. 7, showing that binding of MgATP to its binding site on the cytoplasmic domain leads to increased inhibition of the purified ATPase but not SR; this implies that binding of MgATP results in increased reactivity of lumenal sites to EDC. In the absence of ligands for the Ca2+-ATPase, the Ca2+-ATPase is present as an equilibrium mixture of the two conformations E1 and E2, with the E1-E2 equilibrium being pH-dependent, high pH favoring the E1 conformation (reviewed in Ref. 24.Henderson I.M.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lacapere et al. (32.Lacapere J.J. Bennett N. Dupont Y. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the affinity of the ATPase for ATP in the absence of Ca2+ increases with increasing pH, consistent with stronger binding of ATP to the E1 than to the E2 conformation of the ATPase. Stronger binding of ATP to the E1 than to the E2 conformation of the ATPase means that addition of ATP will shift the E1-E2 equilibrium toward E1. The observed increase in inhibition of the purified ATPase by EDC in the presence of ATP would then be consistent with a greater reactivity for the lumenal sites in the E1 conformation of the ATPase than in the E2 conformation."

Recently, we identified a variable major lipoprotein (Vmp)1 as the principal TNF inducing stimulus of Borrelia recurrentis, the causative agent of louse borne relapsing fever (12.Vidal V. Scragg I.G.

The TNF-inducing stimulus ofB. recurrentis is of particular interest since this is the only human infectious disease in which anti-TNF therapy has been conclusively demonstrated to have a beneficial role (13.Fekade D.

The structure of the lipid modification of a native spirochetal lipoprotein has not been elucidated but features of lipoproteins from Borrelia burgdorferi provide insight into a possible structure. Metabolic labeling studies with palmitic acid and the presence of a consensus lipoprotein leader sequence indicate a lipid modification similar to that ofEscherichia coli murein lipoprotein (16.Brandt M.E. Riley B.S. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 983-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, indirect evidence from functional comparisons suggests that the lipid modifications of B. burgdorferi and E. colilipoproteins may differ. First, B. burgdorferi lipoproteins have greater potency than E. coli murein lipoprotein (2.Ma Y. Weis J.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L.

Jung G. Bessler W.G. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2676-2681PubMed Google Scholar); and second, B. burgdorferi lipoproteins are considerably more potent than corresponding lipopeptides synthesized with the E. coli type of lipid modification having three palmitic acid residues (Pam3Cys) (3.Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Levi M.E. Shen Y. Davis L.S. Norgard M.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2866-2877PubMed Google Scholar).The lack of direct evidence concerning the native lipid modifications of spirochetal lipoproteins, and the established clinical importance of TNF induction in louse borne relapsing fever, led us to investigate the biochemical structure of the Vmp of B. recurrentis.DISCUSSIONThe discovery that the lipid moiety is essential for the potent cytokine inducing and mitogenic properties of bacterial lipoproteins has renewed interest in their structure. Since the seminal paper of Hantke and Braun (25.Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) describing the structure of the lipid modification of E. coli murein lipoprotein several other lipoproteins have been characterized (26.Weyer K.A. Schafer W. Lottspeich F. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27.Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp.

These recent investigations have revealed significant differences in the structure of the lipid modification of bacterial lipoproteins. Moreover, the biological potency of bacterial lipoproteins varies considerably and this variation results from the type of lipid modification present on the lipoprotein (28.Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4804-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Metzger J.W. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Loleit M. Eckert M. Bessler W.G. Jung G. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been widely assumed that spirochetal lipoproteins possess a lipid modification similar to E. colimurein lipoprotein having three palmitic acid residues (Pam3Cys). Given the importance ascribed to spirochetal lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of disease we undertook a detailed structural characterization of a native spirochetal lipoprotein. Our results clearly demonstrate that the TNF inducing activity of B. recurrentis Vmp A1 resides in the NH2-terminal lipid modification that is indeed similar in structure to that of E. coli murein lipoprotein.Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that Vmp A1 is not a single entity, but consists of three lipoproteins having identical peptide sequence but differing lipid moieties. The first hint of heterogeneity in Vmp A1 came from the Q-TOF analysis of the intact protein when molecules of masses 35,077, 35,101, and 35,120 daltons were observed. These molecules are of greater molecular weight than predicted from the gene sequence, confirming the presence of one or more post-translational modifications on Vmp A1. To elucidate the structure of the post-translational lipid modification of Vmp A1 that confers bioactivity, a methodology to isolate the TNF inducing active lipopeptide was established utilizing a normal phase HPLC system. Three lipopeptides of masses 1524, 1550, and 1552 daltons were present in the active fractions. Characterization of these lipopeptides by MS/MS showed unequivocally that the lipid moieties are located on the NH2-terminal peptide. Comparison of the actual mass data on the isolated lipopeptide with the gene sequence revealed the presence of three types of lipid attachment of masses 789, 815, and 817 daltons. These masses are consistent with the following fatty acid substitutions to a NH2-terminal glyceryl cysteine: 1) C16:0, C16:0, C16:0; 2) C16:0, C16:0, C18:1; 3) C16:0, C16:0, C18:0. Structures 1 and 2 have been identified previously in recombinant B. burgdorferi Osp A (rOsp A) expressed in E. coli(30.Bouchon B. Klein M. Bischoff R. Van Dorsselaer A. Roitsch C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and structure 2 also has been found in E. coli murein lipoprotein (31.Pittenauer E. Quintela J.C. Schmid E.R. Allmaier G. Paulus G. de Pedro M.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 892-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Structure 3 has not been reported previously. It is noteworthy that C18:0 was detected in the fatty acid analysis of lipoprotein extracts from other spirochetes but was not found inE. coli murein lipoprotein (25.Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 32.Belisle J.T. Brandt M.E. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In conclusion, analysis of the intact lipoprotein and active lipopeptide has revealed that Vmp A1 has only one post-translational lipid modification occurring at the NH2 terminus that confers bioactivity. Moreover our data provide the first direct proof of localization of the triacyl moiety at the NH2-terminal cysteine residue of a lipoprotein, with one of the fatty acyl groups being on the amino-terminal group itself.Clinical investigations of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction of louse borne relapsing fever have provided perhaps the clearest example to date of the causal role of TNF in the pathogenesis of severe infectious disease in humans (13.Fekade D. Knox K. Hussein K. Melka A. Lalloo D.G. Coxon R.E. Warrell D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33.Negussie Y. Remick D.G. DeForge L.E. Kunkel S.L.

We have extended this investigation by providing a comprehensive structural description of the native TNF-inducing moiety of B. recurrentis isolate A1. A key issue raised by this structural study is the mode of presentation of the TNF-inducing lipid component of Vmp A1 to the responsive host cell. Purified spirochetal lipoproteins and synthetic lipopeptides stimulate cells through toll-like receptor 2 (34.Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R.

Immun. 1999; 67: 140-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when Vmps are released upon lysis of the spirochetes they are presumably still associated with other membrane components, possibly forming micelles or larger aggregates. Thus the active lipid component may remain embedded within a hydrophobic structure and apparently unable to interact directly with protein receptors on the responsive cell surface. Because of the importance of B. recurrentis Vmp and other spirochetal lipoproteins in disease pathogenesis a fuller understanding of how this class of lipid toxin interacts with host cells is required. Lipoproteins have been implicated as the principal mediators of the inflammatory response that occurs in the human host during a spirochetal infection. In vitro, it has been clearly established that outer surface lipoproteins of spirochetes causing Lyme disease and syphilis induce the production of inflammatory mediators from a variety of cell types (1.Radolf J.D.

Recently, we identified a variable major lipoprotein (Vmp)1 as the principal TNF inducing stimulus of Borrelia recurrentis, the causative agent of louse borne relapsing fever (12.Vidal V. Scragg I.G.

The TNF-inducing stimulus ofB. recurrentis is of particular interest since this is the only human infectious disease in which anti-TNF therapy has been conclusively demonstrated to have a beneficial role (13.Fekade D. Knox K. Hussein K. Melka A. Lalloo D.G. Coxon R.E. Warrell D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that lipid modification is essential for the potent biological activities of spirochetal lipoproteins (3.Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Levi M.E. Shen Y. Davis L.S. Norgard M.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2866-2877PubMed Google Scholar,12.Vidal V. Scragg I.G. Cutler S.J. Rockett K.A. Fekade D. Warrell D.A. Wright D.J. Kwiatkowski D. Nat.

The structure of the lipid modification of a native spirochetal lipoprotein has not been elucidated but features of lipoproteins from Borrelia burgdorferi provide insight into a possible structure. Metabolic labeling studies with palmitic acid and the presence of a consensus lipoprotein leader sequence indicate a lipid modification similar to that ofEscherichia coli murein lipoprotein (16.Brandt M.E. Riley B.S. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 983-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, indirect evidence from functional comparisons suggests that the lipid modifications of B. burgdorferi and E. colilipoproteins may differ. First, B. burgdorferi lipoproteins have greater potency than E. coli murein lipoprotein (2.Ma Y. Weis J.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L.

Jung G. Bessler W.G. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2676-2681PubMed Google Scholar); and second, B. burgdorferi lipoproteins are considerably more potent than corresponding lipopeptides synthesized with the E. coli type of lipid modification having three palmitic acid residues (Pam3Cys) (3.Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Levi M.E. Shen Y. Davis L.S. Norgard M.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2866-2877PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of direct evidence concerning the native lipid modifications of spirochetal lipoproteins, and the established clinical importance of TNF induction in louse borne relapsing fever, led us to investigate the biochemical structure of the Vmp of B. recurrentis. DISCUSSIONThe discovery that the lipid moiety is essential for the potent cytokine inducing and mitogenic properties of bacterial lipoproteins has renewed interest in their structure. Since the seminal paper of Hantke and Braun (25.Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) describing the structure of the lipid modification of E. coli murein lipoprotein several other lipoproteins have been characterized (26.Weyer K.A. Schafer W. Lottspeich F. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27.Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp.

These recent investigations have revealed significant differences in the structure of the lipid modification of bacterial lipoproteins. Moreover, the biological potency of bacterial lipoproteins varies considerably and this variation results from the type of lipid modification present on the lipoprotein (28.Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4804-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Metzger J.W. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Loleit M. Eckert M. Bessler W.G. Jung G. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been widely assumed that spirochetal lipoproteins possess a lipid modification similar to E. colimurein lipoprotein having three palmitic acid residues (Pam3Cys). Given the importance ascribed to spirochetal lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of disease we undertook a detailed structural characterization of a native spirochetal lipoprotein. Our results clearly demonstrate that the TNF inducing activity of B. recurrentis Vmp A1 resides in the NH2-terminal lipid modification that is indeed similar in structure to that of E. coli murein lipoprotein.Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that Vmp A1 is not a single entity, but consists of three lipoproteins having identical peptide sequence but differing lipid moieties. The first hint of heterogeneity in Vmp A1 came from the Q-TOF analysis of the intact protein when molecules of masses 35,077, 35,101, and 35,120 daltons were observed. These molecules are of greater molecular weight than predicted from the gene sequence, confirming the presence of one or more post-translational modifications on Vmp A1. To elucidate the structure of the post-translational lipid modification of Vmp A1 that confers bioactivity, a methodology to isolate the TNF inducing active lipopeptide was established utilizing a normal phase HPLC system. Three lipopeptides of masses 1524, 1550, and 1552 daltons were present in the active fractions. Characterization of these lipopeptides by MS/MS showed unequivocally that the lipid moieties are located on the NH2-terminal peptide. Comparison of the actual mass data on the isolated lipopeptide with the gene sequence revealed the presence of three types of lipid attachment of masses 789, 815, and 817 daltons. These masses are consistent with the following fatty acid substitutions to a NH2-terminal glyceryl cysteine: 1) C16:0, C16:0, C16:0; 2) C16:0, C16:0, C18:1; 3) C16:0, C16:0, C18:0. Structures 1 and 2 have been identified previously in recombinant B. burgdorferi Osp A (rOsp A) expressed in E. coli(30.Bouchon B. Klein M. Bischoff R. Van Dorsselaer A. Roitsch C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and structure 2 also has been found in E. coli murein lipoprotein (31.Pittenauer E. Quintela J.C. Schmid E.R. Allmaier G. Paulus G. de Pedro M.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 892-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Structure 3 has not been reported previously. It is noteworthy that C18:0 was detected in the fatty acid analysis of lipoprotein extracts from other spirochetes but was not found inE. coli murein lipoprotein (25.Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 32.Belisle J.T. Brandt M.E. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In conclusion, analysis of the intact lipoprotein and active lipopeptide has revealed that Vmp A1 has only one post-translational lipid modification occurring at the NH2 terminus that confers bioactivity. Moreover our data provide the first direct proof of localization of the triacyl moiety at the NH2-terminal cysteine residue of a lipoprotein, with one of the fatty acyl groups being on the amino-terminal group itself.Clinical investigations of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction of louse borne relapsing fever have provided perhaps the clearest example to date of the causal role of TNF in the pathogenesis of severe infectious disease in humans (13.Fekade D.

However, when Vmps are released upon lysis of the spirochetes they are presumably still associated with other membrane components, possibly forming micelles or larger aggregates. Thus the active lipid component may remain embedded within a hydrophobic structure and apparently unable to interact directly with protein receptors on the responsive cell surface.

We have previously described a downstream initiation of tal-1 transcription specifically associated with a subset of T cell leukemias that leads to the production of NH2-truncated TAL-1 proteins. In this study, we characterize the human promoter (promoter IV), embedded within a GC-rich region in exon IV, responsible for this transcriptional activity. The restriction of promoter IV usage is assured by a novel silencer element in the 3′-unstranslated region of the human gene that represses its activity in erythroid but not in T cells. The silencer activity is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific nuclear factor to a novel protein recognition motif (designated tal-RE) in the silencer. Mutation of a single residue within the tal-RE abolishes both specific protein binding and silencing activity. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the tal-1 promoter IV is actively repressed in cells of the erythro-megakaryocytic lineage and that this repression is released in leukemic T cells, resulting in the expression of the tal-1 truncated transcript.

Indeed, in addition to chromosomal translocations, 12–26% of T-ALL patients harbor localtal-1 recombinations, termed tald, which remove 90–100 kilobase pairs of upstream sequences from the tal-1locus (11.Bernard O. Lecointe N. Jonveaux P. Souyri M. Mauchauffe M. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Brown L. Cheng J.T. Chen Q. Siciliano M.J. Crist W. Buchanan G. Baer R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3343-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Finally, some T-ALLs and leukemic T cell lines displaytal-1 expression without known tal-1 gene alteration (11.Bernard O. Lecointe N. Jonveaux P. Souyri M. Mauchauffe M. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Macintyre E.A. Smit L. Ritz J. Kirsch I.R. Strominger J.L. Blood. 1992; 80: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An etiological role for tal-1 in T-ALL development is also supported by its strong similarity with two distinct bHLH genes, LYL-1 and tal-2, also involved in sporadic chromosomal translocations associated with T-ALLs (for a review, see Ref. 22.Baer R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 341-347PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the oncogenic potential oftal-1 in T cell lineage has been clearly demonstrated in transgenic mouse models (23.Condorelli G.L. Facchiano F. Valtieri M. Proietti E. Vitelli L. Lulli V. Huebner K. Peschle C. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5113-5119PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).During hematopoiesis, tal-1 is expressed at low levels in early progenitor cells. Commitment to the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages is correlated with an increase in tal-1 gene expression, whereas it is shut down in other cells, notably in the T lymphoid lineage (8.Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Denning S.M. Haynes B.F. Waldmann T.A. Kirsch I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10128-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14.Green A.R. Lints T. Visvader J.

Jones M. Mathieu-Mahul D. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1995; 85: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that tal-1 is essential for early embryonic development (4.Robb L. Lyons I. Li R. Hartley L. Kontgen F. Harvey R.P. Metcalf D. Begley C.G. Proc. Natl.

BioEssays. 1997; 19: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating thattal-1 function is crucial in very early hematopoiesis. Indeed, several reports led to the conclusion that TAL-1 proteins, in concert with two other cell-specific factors, GATA-1 and LMO2, act as positive regulators of erythroid differentiation (27.Valge-Archer V.E. Osada H. Warren A.J. Forster A. Li J. Baer R. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8617-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28.Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4831-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that tal-1 also regulates the development of the vascular system (30.Visvader J.E. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 31.Gering M. Rodaway A.R. Gottgens B. Patient R.K. Green A.R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). All of these observations strongly suggest that during embryonic development tal-1 activity may be required as early as the formation of hemangioblast, the common progenitor for both hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Finally,tal-1 expression was also detected in midbrain and spinal cord of mouse embryos (17.Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and very recent transgenic studies in mice have identified enhancers that recapitulate physiologicaltal-1 expression in these tissues (13.Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Sinclair A.M. Gottgens B. Barton L.M. Stanley M.L. Pardanaud L. Klaine M. Gering M. Bahn S. Sanchez M. Bench A.J. Fordham J.L.

Biol. 1999; 209: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).tal-1 encodes two major protein isoforms, full-length pp48–50 and N-terminally truncated pp24–28, both of which possess the bHLH domain and heterodimerize with the ubiquitously expressed bHLH E-proteins, E47, E12, and HEB (11.Bernard O.

Both types of TAL-1/E47 heterodimers were found to bind preferentially to the AACAGATGGT E box (36.Hsu H.L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but only the pp48–50 TAL-1 species contains an amino-terminal transactivation domain (37.Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7869-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A putativetal-1 target gene, whose function is still unknown, has recently been identified (38.Cohen K.S. Maouche C.L. Vitelli L. Vinit M.A. Blanchard I. Yamamoto M. Peschle C. Romeo P.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Several studies have demonstrated that the expression of thetal-1 gene is itself highly regulated during adult hematopoiesis through complex interactions of cis-acting positive and negative regulatory elements. Two alternative 5′ promoters, Ia and Ib, have been identified in both human and murine genes. The activity of the promoter Ia is restricted to the erythroid and megakayocytic lineages and is mediated by the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (39.Lecointe N. Bernard O. Naert K. Joulin V. Larsen C.J. Romeo P.H. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Gottgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1995; 86: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter Ib was found to be active in primitive myeloid cells through the action of PU-1, Sp1, and Sp3 transcription factors (41.Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Gottgens B. Murrell A.M. Elefanty A.G. Green A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8781-8790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42.Bockamp E.-O. Fordham J.L. Gottgens B. Murrell A.M. Sanchez M.J. Green A.R. J.

Azogui O. Lecointe N. Mugneret F. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, we have previously described a third downstream promoter, which appears to be specifically activated in a subset of human leukemic T cells (43.Bernard O. Azogui O. Lecointe N. Mugneret F. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, the truncated transcripts generated from this promoter have thus far not been detected in normal hematopoietic tissues. Importantly, these shorttal-1 transcripts encode the NH2-truncated TAL-1 proteins (11.Bernard O. Lecointe N. Jonveaux P. Souyri M. Mauchauffe M. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar), whose function in normal hematopoiesis is still unknown. However, in a transgenic model, the truncated TAL-1 proteins were found to cooperate with LMO-1 to generate T cell malignancies (44.Aplan P.D. Jones C.A. Chervinsky D.S. Zhao X. Ellsworth M. Wu C. McGuire E.A. Gross K.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2408-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In this study, we defined the third tal-1 promoter, termed promoter IV in this paper, that lies within the coding sequences of exon IV and does not by itself display cell type specificity. Moreover, we have identified a novel silencer element in the 3′-unstranslated region of tal-1 (3′-UTR), which modulates the promoter IV activity in a manner indistinguishable from the regulation of the truncated tal-1 transcription in hematopoetic cell lines. Promoter IV silencing is mediated through the binding of a novel tissue-specific nuclear factor to this silencer element. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the tal-1 promoter IV is actively repressed in cells of the erythro-megakaryocytic lineage and that this repression is released in leukemic T cells, resulting in expression of the tal-1 truncated transcript.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlyingtal-1 gene expression, focusing on the origin of an intragenic transcription initiation that occurs exclusively in a significant proportion of human leukemic T cells and leads to the production of the short TAL-1 proteins (11.Bernard O. Lecointe N. Jonveaux P. Souyri M. Mauchauffe M. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Bernard O. Azogui O. Lecointe N. Mugneret F. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transient transfections and mutational deletions allowed us to map the sequences responsible for this activity in the middle of the coding sequences of exon IV, embedded within a highly GC-rich region (80% G/C content). There is no TATA box consensus at the expected position (around −30) from the major transcription start site; however, the sequence TTAAA between residues −24 and −20 could be a TATA-like element. In addition, two Sp1-like consensus sites are present, strongly suggesting that promoter IV initiation might be mediated through the binding of Sp1-like proteins. Several transcription start sites within exon IV are observed in the DU528 cell line, 2C. Courtes, unpublished results. which may reflect the presence of a strong secondary structure in this region. All of these structural features are usually associated with the so-called housekeeping genes. Indeed, we found that promoter IV itself functions in a non-tissue-specific manner when tested in transient transfection experiments. Since these findings did not reflect the restricted profile of tal-1 truncated transcripts among distinct hematopoietic lineages, we searched for additional regulatory sequences located in a region distinct from the 5′ promoter IV region.A negative regulatory element was identified in the 3′-UTR of the humantal-1 gene which inhibits promoter IV activity in erythroid but not in T cells. The 3′-UTR regulatory element can be defined as a classical silencer (49.Brand A.H. Breeden L. Abraham J. Sternglanz R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1985; 41: 41-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) based on its ability (i) to repress promoter IV as well as a heterologous promoter, (ii) to function in a position-independent manner, and (iii) to inhibit transcription when placed in either orientation with respect to the transcriptional start site.Intragenic transcriptional regulatory sequences have been found in numerous genes and, in the vast majority, these elements map within DNA regions close to the transcription start site. In contrast, the promoter IV silencer is located at a rather long distance away from the 5′ promoter IV region (8 kilobase pairs). Although rare, this situation has been described for other silencers controlling the expression of genes coding for the T cell receptor α-chain (50.Winoto A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 649-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), CD4 (51.Sawada S. Scarborough J.D. Killeen N. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 917-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and interleukin-4 (52.Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Examples of cis-regulatory sequences located in the 3′-UTR are even rarer. In eukaryotes, the 3′-UTR is usually seen as a key repository of information for regulating mRNAs in the cytoplasm, since it contains signals for controlling translation, stability, and localization (reviewed in Ref. 53.Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing is a rare function for a 3′-UTR that, to our knowledge, has been previously described for only two other loci, interleukin-4 (52.Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and a rat serine protease inhibitor (54.Le Cam A. Legraverend C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Although silencers have been functionally demonstrated in numerous vertebrate genes, the question of how they act on the target promoters is still unanswered. We have identified a cell type-specific protein-DNA complex (tal-RE binding activity) that correlates with the silencer activity in vivo. Mutation of a single residue within the tal-RE (G666 to A) results in a loss of both protein binding and silencer activity, demonstrating that the tal-RE-binding protein(s) plays a central role in regulating silencer function in erythroid cells. We have defined the sequence required for tal-RE-binding (GTTNNGCNTTC) that appears to be a novel protein recognition motif. UV cross-linking experiments have allowed the initial characterization of a cell-specific nuclear factor(s) of about 40 kDa that interacts with the tal-RE. Given the absence in tal-RE of a palindromic sequence usually associated with the binding of homodimeric polypeptide, the binding factor(s) probably does not bind as a homodimer. Two inverted direct repeats (5′-TGGGGA … TCCCCA-3′) are flanking the tal-RE that may confer some secondary structure to the surrounding proximal DNA. Interestingly, these direct inverted repeats match IK2/LyF core-like consensus. Several studies have reported that Ikaros complexes are localized to discrete heterochromatin foci associated with transcriptionally silent genes (55.Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 56.Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and more recently, Ikaros proteins have been described as being able to target chromatin remodeling and deacetylation complexes in vivo (57.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller E. Winandy S. Viel A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 58.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although we failed to detect the presence of proteins on these sequences by in vivo footprinting, it will be of interest to test the possibility that some members of the Ikaros family might cooperate with the tal-RE-binding factor in the silencing activity of the tal-1 3′-UTR.The mechanisms and factors involved in the repression of eukaryotic genes have not been studied as extensively as those involved in activation. Repressors appear to act by either modifying chromatin or inhibiting some basal processes in transcription initiation and/or elongation. The 3′-UTR DNA segment 562–833, in which the tal-RE occupies a central position, is not able to inhibit promoter IV activity in K562 cells. One possibility is that this short fragment can no longer adopt a structural configuration required for specific interaction between tal-1 promoter IV and the repressor element. Another explanation could be that the tal-RE binding activity, although essential, is not sufficient to confer the repressor activity to the 3′-UTR, supporting the notion that the 3′-UTR silencing activity probably operates through a complex set of regulatory elements. As judged by its strong negative effect on SV40 promoter in erythroid cells, the 3′-UTR silencing element probably recruits cell-specific repressors distinct from the tal-RE binding factor that directly interfere with the general transcriptional machinery. GATA consensus sequences in the silencer region are required for the developmental expression of the human ε-globin gene (59.Peters B. Merezhinskaya N. Diffley J.F. Noguchi C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3430-3437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60.Raich N. Clegg C.H. Grofti J. Romeo P.H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) as well as for the activity of the CD4 silencer (51.Sawada S. Scarborough J.D. Killeen N. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 917-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and more recently, the erythroid GATA-1 factor has been described as acting as an in vivorepressor of human ε-globin gene expression (61.Li Q. Clegg C. Peterson K. Shaw S. Raich N. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several potential GATA sites are also present in different domains of the 3′-UTR of the human tal-1 gene. This common occurrence raises the possibility that the erythroid-specific GATA-1 factor might be involved in the 3′-UTR silencer function. Further analysis will thus be required to identify possible additional cis-elements, distinct from tal-RE, as well as the trans-acting factors that might be crucial for the transcriptional repressor activity of the silencer.Whatever the mechanism of transcription repression through the silencer domain, it is clear that the factor binding to the tal-RE is of central importance for regulating tal-1 promoter IV in human erythroid cells. tal-RE binding activity is detected in all cells tested of the erythro-megakaryocytic lineages that normally expresstal-1 from promoter Ia (39.Lecointe N. Bernard O. Naert K. Joulin V. Larsen C.J. Romeo P.H. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Bockamp E.-O. McLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Gottgens B. Robb L. Begley C.G.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The absence of the silencer activity in all T cell lines tested, regardless of theirtal-1 expression, as well as in nonhematopoietic cells coincides perfectly with the lack of tal-RE-interacting protein. In tissues that do not normally transcribe tal-1, the peculiar chromatin structure associated with the highly GC-rich content of the human tal-1 locus, notably hypermethylation (63.Leroy-Viard K. Vinit M.A. Lecointe N. Mathieu-Mahul D. Romeo P.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3819-3827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probably renders the locus inaccessible to Sp1-like transcription factors and thus does not allow transcription initiation at the endogenous promoter IV; there is no need to repress promoter IV activity in these cells, thus in agreement with the absence of silencing activity of the 3′-UTR in these cells.The absence of tal-RE-binding proteins in leukemic T cells cannot be correlated to the leukemic phenotype, since human primary T cells do not display any tal-RE binding activity either. Promoter IV has been found to operate in a subset of human T-ALLs with the exception of those associated with tald deletions (43.Bernard O. Azogui O. Lecointe N. Mugneret F. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), implying that truncated TAL-1 proteins participate in T cell oncogenesis. Indeed, in a transgenic mouse model, pp24–28 TAL-1 proteins were found to cooperate with LMO-1 to generate T cell malignancies (44.Aplan P.D. Jones C.A. Chervinsky D.S. Zhao X. Ellsworth M. Wu C. McGuire E.A. Gross K.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2408-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of TAL-1 proteins in an immature T cell is likely to exert a dual effect. First, the inappropriate formation of TAL-1/E47 heterodimers diverts the E47 proteins from their normal target DNA (64.Park S.T. Sun X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7030-7037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and, as a consequence, inhibits their normal functions in early T cell development (Ref. 65.Bain G. Engel I. Robanus M.E. te R.H. Voland J.R. Sharp L.L. Chun J. Huey B. Pinkel D. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 13.Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that context, both large and short TAL-1 protein expression are likely to produce the same effects, since they share the same dimerization partners. Constitutive expression of pp48–50 TAL-1 in T lineage cells has been shown to prevent apoptosis (66.Leroy-Viard K. Vinit M.A. Lecointe N. Jouault H. Hibner U. Romeo P.H. Mathieu-Mahul D.

Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. Benjamin-Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983: 65-82Google Scholar, 2.Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol.

Physiol. 1993; 106: 1-26Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The heme is wedged between the E and F helices, and only the axial (proximal) His F8 (eighth residue on helix F) and Phe CD1 (first residue on the loop between the C and D helices) are completely conserved. This conserved globin fold, however, results in a very wide range of functionality, which appears to be controlled primarily by the nature of the “distal” residues at position E7, E11, E10, and B10 that line the ligand binding pocket (4.Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The major interaction that strongly stabilizes O2 over CO binding has been shown to involve H-bonding to the bound O2 by a distal residue, although destabilization of the bound CO by distal steric interaction cannot be completely discounted (4.Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 5.Phillips S.E.V. Schoenborn B.P.

Although the distal H-bond in vertebrate globins is always provided by residue E7 (which is overwhelmingly His, but occasionally Gln (2.Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar)), there is much more variation in the nature of the E7 residue and the position of the distal H-bond donor in nonvertebrate globins (3.Vinogradov S.N. Walz D.A. Pohajdak B. Moens L. Kapp O.H. Suzuki T. Trotman C.A.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106: 1-26Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Such alternate residue H-bond stabilization of the bound O2 has been established in natural globins from sea hares (Arg E10) (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and trematodes (Tyr B10) (8.De Baere I. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Klizas S.A. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. Wilkinson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15896-15907Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An effective strategy for determining the role of individual residues is to perform functional and molecular structural studies of site directed mutant globins (4.Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography is generally the most effective tool for describing both the global and heme pocket structures of globins (4.Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 6.Kuriyan J. Wilz S. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12.Bolognesi M. Coda A. Frigerio F. Gatii G. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The description of the globin active site structure, however, is just as effectively pursued by NMR, particularly in the paramagnetic oxidation/spin states, in which structurally exquisitely sensitive hyperfine shifts impart improved active site resolution over a diamagnetic analog (13.Bertini I. Turano P. Vila A.J. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2833-2933Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 14.Yamamoto Y. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectros. 1998; 30: 1-77Google Scholar, 15.La Mar G.N. Satterlee J.D. de Ropp J.S. Kadish K.M. Gailard R. Smith K.M. The Porphyrin Handbook. 5. Academic Press, New York2000: 185-298Google Scholar). Hyperfine shifts reflect electronic and/or magnetic properties of the chromophore, and hence can be extraordinarily sensitive to (and hence render detectable) small structural changes that are unlikely to be detected in either a crystal structure or a solution NMR structure of a diamagnetic analog. Perhaps the best examples of the exquisite sensitivity are the observation of isotope effects on iron-porphyrin covalency due to the distal H-bond to the bound ligand (16.Lecomte J.T.J. La Mar G.N.

The information content is particularly rich in the cyanomet globins, in which the bound cyanide can model both the H-bond acceptor properties of bound O2 (21.Emerson S.D. La Mar G.N.

The large dipolar shifts, moreover, guarantee that any heme pocket labile proton can be detected (usually resolved), and its role in H-bonding to the ligand elucidated directly by its placement in the distal pocket (17.Zhang W.

The pattern of the dominant heme methyl contact shifts reflect the orientation of the axial His relative to the heme (i.e. φ in Fig. 1) (29.Shulman R.G. Glarum S.H. Karplus M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 3: 581-594Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the pattern of the dominant meso-H dipolar shift reflects the orientation of the rhombic magnetic axes (κ in Fig. 1) (34.Wu Y. Chien E.Y.T. Sligar S.G. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6979-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35.Nguyen B.D. Xia Z. Yeh D.C. Vyas K. Deaguero H. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem.

Del Gaudio J. Frye J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 498: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but it has not yet been assessed in globins. Lastly, the dominant dipolar shifts for nonligated residues provide information on the orientation of the paramagnetic susceptibility tensor, which can be related to the tilt/bend of the Fe-CN unit and the orientation of the axial His and thereby facilitate the determination of the orientation of mutated residues in the heme cavity (17.Zhang W.

The Mbs from the sea hare Aplysia limacina (37.Tentori L. Vivaldi G. Carta S. Marinucci M. Massa A. Antonini E. Brunori M. Int. J. Pept.

Biol. 1992; 228: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Arg E10 can orient into the heme pocket and provide an H-bond to bound ligand. The sharp increase in k off and decrease in affinity for O2 in the Aplysia R(E10)T-Mb mutant directly confirms (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) the H-bonding role for this residue. A question that naturally arises is whether the alternate H-bonding residues in sperm whale and Aplysia Mbs can be interchanged solely by interchanging the Val E7/Arg E10 in Aplysia with the His E7/Thr E10 of sperm whale Mb. Similar studies have shown that substitution of the key distal residues can in small or large part transfer an unusual functional property from one globin to another (17.Zhang W. Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brunori M. La Mar G.N. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1019-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,26.Zhao X. Vyas K. Nguyen B.D. Rajarathnam K. La Mar G.N.

Thus, although the O2 off-rate increases sharply and its O2 affinity decreases sharply upon substituting His E7 by Val in sperm whale Mb, a significant portion of the O2 affinity can be recovered by inserting Arg E10 in the sperm whale H(E7)V/T(E10)R-Mb mutant (41.Smerdon S.J. Krzywda S. Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Wilkinson A.J. Brancaccio A. Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brunori M. Li T. Brantley Jr., R.E. Carver T.E. Eich R.F. Singleton E. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8715-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Solution 1H NMR of sperm whale H(E7)V/T(E10)R-metMbCN found that Arg E10 side chains oriented to provide an H-bond to the bound cyanide (22.Qin J. La Mar G.N. Ascoli F. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, the distal H-bonding scheme of Aplysia Mb can be transferred, albeit less effectively, to sperm whale Mb. The successful cloning and expression of Aplysia Mb has been reported (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although the N terminus of the recombinant protein, in contrast to true wild-type (12.Bolognesi M. Coda A. Frigerio F. Gatii G. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is not acetylated (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Substitution of Arg E10 for the Thr found in mammalian Mb led to very large decrease in O2 affinity and increase in O2 off-rate and autoxidation and clearly identified Arg E10 as the source of the H-bond stabilization to the O2 ligand (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, engineering the second residue to convert the Aplysia Mb to mimic the sperm whale Mb pocket, V(E7)H/R(E10)T-Mb, failed to either recover a significant fraction of the O2 affinity or retard the O2 off-rates relative to WT Aplysia Mb. We report herein on the 1H NMR spectra of the cyanomet complex of the Aplysia mutants V(E7)H-Mb and V(E7)H/R(E10)T-Mb that show that the individual distal His E7 residues are indeed oriented out of the heme pocket and hence cannot participate in any H-bonding interaction with the bound cyanide. On the other hand, comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of native wild-type (WT) and recombinant wild-type (rWT) Aplysia metMbCN shows that the N-acetylation missing in rWT Mb (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) leads to changes in both the relative stability of the alternate heme orientations in the heme pocket and a small reorientation of the proximal His imidazole plane relative to the F-helix, when compared with true WT. A. limacina V(E7)H and V(E7)H/R(E10)T mutant myoglobins were expressed and purified as described previously (7.Cutruzzolá F. Travaglini Allocatelli C. Brancaccio A. Brunori M. Biochem.

The final solutions had a protein concentration of ∼1.5 mm. 1H NMR spectra were collected on a GE Omega 500 MHz spectrometer. The strongly relaxed signals were optimally detected in WEFT spectra (42.Inubushi T. Becker E. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128-133Google Scholar).

Δχax and Δχrh are axial and rhombic anisotropies, and δDSS(obs) is the observed chemical shift referenced to DSS. δdia is the shift in the isostructural diamagnetic complex that is calculated via δdia = δtetr + δsec + δrc, where δtetr is the shift in an unfolded tetra peptide (48.Bundi A. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 285-297Crossref Scopus (828) Google Scholar); δsec is the shift of an amino acid proton typical for α-helices, β-strand, coils, etc. (49.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D.

(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7067–7072). To clarify the role of the α subunit in the rebinding of β, restoration of catalytic function, and conferral of sensitivity to the chloroplast-specific inhibitor tentoxin, LiCl-treated chromatophores were analyzed by immunoblotting before and after reconstitution with mixtures of R. rubrum and chloroplast α and β subunits. The treated chromatophores were found to have lost, in addition to most of their β subunits, approximately a third of the α subunits, and restoration of catalytic activity required rebinding of both subunits. The hybrid reconstituted with theR. rubrum α and chloroplast β subunits was active in ATP synthesis as well as hydrolysis, and both activities were completely resistant to tentoxin. In contrast, a hybrid reconstituted with both chloroplast α and β subunits restored only a MgATPase activity, which was fully inhibited by tentoxin. These results indicate that all three copies of the R. rubrum α subunit are required for proton-coupled ATP synthesis, whereas for conferral of tentoxin sensitivity at least one copy of the chloroplast α subunit is required together with the chloroplast β subunit. The hybrid system was further used to examine the effects of amino acid substitution at position 83 of the β subunit on sensitivity to tentoxin.

The general structure of these ATP synthases is highly conserved, consisting of F0, the membrane-spanning proton channel, and F1, the peripheral membrane sector, which contains the catalytic sites for reversible ATP synthesis. The F0 is composed of four different subunits labeled a, b, b′, and c in photosynthetic bacteria (1.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-830Google Scholar) and I–IV in chloroplasts (2.McCarty R.E. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reaction.

The chloroplast F0 subunits IV, I, II, and III are analogous to the bacterial a, b, b′, and c, respectively, with a probable stoichiometry of a1b1b′1c9–12. F1 from all sources is composed of five different subunits designated α to ε in order of decreasing molecular weight with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ε1.The x-ray crystal structure of bovine heart mitochondrial F1(MF1)1 at 2.8-Å resolution (5.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) defined the three-dimensional structures of alternating α and β subunits as forming a closed hexamer having a portion of the γ subunit embedded in its central cavity. Among the nucleotide binding sites, which are located one at each of the six α/β interfaces, the three catalytic sites, located predominantly on β subunits, were found to exist in three different conformational states. This asymmetric feature is compatible with the binding change mechanism, which proposed that the catalytic sites interconvert between three different conformational states during ATP synthesis via energy-dependent affinity changes in substrate binding and product release (6.Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 7.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Several recent studies of isolated (8.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) F1 have suggested that this is achieved via rotation of the γ subunit relative to the α3β3 subassembly. The MF1crystal structure identified a number of α-β, α-γ, and β-γ contacts, all or some of which may be responsible for dictating the asymmetric properties of each of the catalytic sites during catalysis. The importance of each of these contacts, and the steps involved in changing them, remain to be determined.Partially dissociated membrane ATP synthase complexes, which can be reassembled by adding isolated α and β subunits, can provide suitable tools for identifying and characterizing the interacting protein domains responsible for the binding change process. One such system, where both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis can be followed, was obtained by LiCl treatment of chromatophores isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum(12.Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment was found to release the bulk of their β subunits (12.Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Philosoph S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) resulting in the loss of over 90% of their ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities. Both activities could be restored upon reconstituting the treated chromatophores with the released subunits. The treated chromatophores could also be reconstituted with native spinach chloroplast CF1 β, although the protein preparation was contaminated with trace amounts of CF1 α (14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that the presence of small amounts of the α subunit was a requirement for the reconstitution of a hybrid ATP synthase with the CF1 β subunits (15.Avital S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7067-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Avni A. Avital S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7317-7320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a native enzyme with RrF1 β (17.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995: 51-54Google Scholar, 18.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that the LiCl treatment also removed some of the α subunit from the chromatophores. The identification of a small amount of an α1β1 dimer in addition to the large amount of β in the LiCl extract (19.Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has confirmed this possibility. Further analysis (51.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has shown that the amount of α subunit, but not of β subunit, released by the LiCl treatment is dependent upon the concentration of the chromatophores during the treatment.The hybrid RrF0F1/CF1 containing the CF1 β subunit with trace amounts of the CF1 α subunit was shown to have little, if any, proton-coupled ATP synthesis but 30–40% of the normal MgATPase activity (14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hybrid MgATPase activity was fully sensitive to tentoxin, a specific CF1 inhibitor (20.Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Bhatnagar P. Rich D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas the control or restored native RrF0F1 ATP synthesis or hydrolysis activities were completely resistant to tentoxin (14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Avital S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 379-385Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the β subunit might be responsible for conferring tentoxin sensitivity to the F1 enzyme. An aspartic acid residue at position 83 of CF1 β was indeed implicated as being essential for tentoxin sensitivity of the chloroplast CF0F1 ATP synthase (22.Avni A. Anderson J.D. Holland N. Rochaix J.D. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Edelman M. Science. 1992; 257: 1245-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23.Hu D. Fiedler H.R. Golan T. Edelman M. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the observation that the MgATPase activity of membranes isolated from an uncD-deleted Escherichia colistrain complemented with the chloroplast atpB gene was insensitive to tentoxin (24.Chen Z. Spies A. Hein R. Zhou X. Thomas B.C. Richter M.L. Gegenheimer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17124-17132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggests that additional CF1subunits might also be involved in conferral of this sensitivity.The fact that the LiCl treatment of R. rubrum chromatophores releases some of the α subunits as well as the β subunits has allowed us to examine the interplay between the α and β subunits, which results in coupled ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and in sensitivity to tentoxin. In this study we folded insoluble recombinant CF1β (25.Chen Z. Wu I. Richter M.L. Gegenheimer P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) into a fully functional monomer using the method developed for folding the recombinant RrF1 α subunit (26.Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and prepared two different hybrid RrF0F1 enzymes containing RrF1 α and CF1 β or CF1 α and CF1 β subunits. The results reveal that (a) the CF1 β subunit can restore a significant amount of proton-coupled ATP synthesis to treated chromatophores but only when all three copies of the RrF1 α subunit are present, and (b) the CF1 α subunit is required, along with the CF1 β subunit, to confer sensitivity to inhibition by tentoxin as well as high (>8-fold) stimulation by sulfite of the restored MgATPase activity.DISCUSSIONPrevious work has shown that the MgATPase activity of LiCl-treated chromatophores could be restored by their reconstitution either with CF1 β containing trace amounts (∼5%) of CF1 α (14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or with a preparation of CF1αβ containing an equimolar ratio of both subunits but not with a highly purified preparation of CF1 β (15.Avital S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7067-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High rates of MgATPase activity could, however, be restored to the treated chromatophores when the purified CF1 β was supplemented with small amounts of the CF1 αβ subunit preparation (16.Avni A. Avital S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7317-7320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that LiCl treatment of the R. rubrum chromatophores releases a significant amount of the α subunit along with the β subunits, thus explaining the requirement for small amounts of α in addition to β subunits for restoration of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis in the treated chromatophores. In an accompanying paper (51.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is further shown that the amount of α released increases with decreasing chromatophore concentration during the LiCl treatment, whereas the bulk of the β subunit is released at all tested concentrations. It is, therefore, also possible in this system to vary the ratio of the released α and β subunits.The preferential release of RrF1 β, which has been demonstrated by immunoblotting of the LiCl supernatant (51.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as of the treated chromatophores (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and3) is not readily explained by examining the crystal structure of MF1 in which the α3β3 hexamer appears to be stabilized by multiple contacts with the γ subunit (5.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). It can be better explained by the recently proposed structural models of the F0F1 ATP synthase, which suggest the presence of two connections between the F0 and F1 parts of the enzyme (7.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 41.Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42.Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 43.Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One connection involves the γ, ε, and c subunits and is proposed to function as the rotating portion of the enzyme. The second connection contains the δ subunit and the two b subunits and is suggested to act as a stator, which binds the F1 α3β3 hexamer to the F0 sector allowing the smaller subunits to rotate with respect to the hexamer. Earlier biochemical evidence has shown that a readily formed disulfide link between the EcF1 δ and one of the α subunits did not inhibit ATPase activity (44.Bragg P.D. Hou C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 45.Tozer R.G. Dunn S.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with bifunctional cross-linking reagents, α-δ dimers and α-α-δ trimers, but not β-δ dimers, were identified in EcF1 (46.Bragg P.D. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and TF1 (47.Sone N. Hou C. Bragg P.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 229-237Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The formation of such dimers and trimers as well as b-δ and b-b dimers have recently been observed by cross-linking of introduced cysteine residues in EcF0F1 α, δ, and b subunits (48.Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (11656): 16652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 49.Rodgers A.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The specific interactions between these subunits could stabilize a portion of the RrF1 α in the R. rubrum membranes during the LiCl treatment, thus resulting in the retention of at least one and possibly two α subunits per RrF0F1complex while nearly all of the RrF1 β subunits are removed.The treated R. rubrum chromatophores enabled us to form two types of RrF0F1/CF1 hybrids. One contained mostly CF1 β and exclusively RrF1α, while the other also contained CF1 α, which replaced the released portion of RrF1 α. A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with control RrF0F1 demonstrated that F1 α plays an essential role in a number of catalytic properties. Two specific CF1 α functions were documented; it was absolutely required, together with CF1 β, for obtaining full inhibition of the restored MgATPase activity by tentoxin, as well as for the high stimulation of this restored activity by sulfite (Fig.6 and Table I).Earlier reports demonstrated that the binding of 1 mol of tentoxin/mol of heat-activated CF1 was sufficient for obtaining full inhibition of its ATPase activity (20.Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Bhatnagar P. Rich D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). So, although the absence of any cross-reaction between RrF1 α antibodies and CF1 α (Fig. 4, lane 1) or vice versa (Fig. 6, inset) did not enable the determination of the ratio of the bound CF1 α to the remaining RrF1 α, the full inhibition of the hybrid containing both CF1 α and β by tentoxin sets a lower limit of 1 mol CF1 α bound/mol of reconstituted RrF0F1/CF1. CF1β-Asp83 was shown to be required for the inhibitory action of tentoxin and residues of different charge, such as lysine, or different spacer length such as glutamate, could not replace it (22.Avni A. Anderson J.D. Holland N. Rochaix J.D. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Edelman M. Science. 1992; 257: 1245-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,23.Hu D. Fiedler H.R. Golan T. Edelman M. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Table II illustrates that this aspartate is indeed essential for obtaining full inhibition by tentoxin in the presence of CF1 α. It could not be replaced even by the noncharged leucine or by the smaller alanine, thus suggesting the importance of the CF1 β-Asp83 charge and spacer length for tentoxin binding and/or inhibition.The mitochondrial equivalent of CF1 β-Asp83, MF1 β-Glu67, is located at an α/β interface in the bovine heart MF1 structure (5.Abrahams J.P.

If the CF1 β-Asp83 forms part of the tentoxin binding site, then CF1 α residues located near the CF1 β-Asp83 may also contribute to the binding of tentoxin. Comparison of known amino acid sequences of α subunits from both tentoxin-sensitive and -insensitive species revealed that, while all α subunits share considerable homology, a stretch of amino acid residues between 121 and 133 (chloroplast numbering) shows conservation only among the sensitive α subunits of spinach, pea, andC. reinhardtii. This stretch of amino acids is very divergent in the resistant α subunits of RrF1 and EcF1 with several amino acids differing in charge and size from the consensus sequence of sensitive CF1 α subunits. In addition, several of the residues in the equivalent stretch of amino acids in MF1 are located within 10 Å of Glu67on the β subunit. Two such residues in CF1, Ser131 and Pro132, are good candidates for having involvement in tentoxin binding. We are currently mutating these residues into RrF1 α to test this possibility.The MgATPase activity of treated chromatophores reconstituted with CF1 β containing ∼5% CF1 α were stimulated 5–7-fold by sulfite as compared with the 2–3-fold stimulation obtained with chromatophores reconstituted with RrF1 β (14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results could not specify whether the CF1 α or β or both were responsible for the extra high sulfite stimulation. The results presented in Table I indicate that, in the hybrid containing only CF1 β, the stimulation is very similar to the one obtained with the control R. rubrumchromatophores, but when CF1 α is also present, an 8-fold stimulation is obtained. This high stimulation was found to raise the level of the MgATPase activity restored in the hybrid enzyme formed with CF1 αβ to the activity restored with RrF1 α and β. The lower initial MgATPase activity of the hybrid containing CF1 α and β subunits may in part reflect the overall latency of the ATPase activity of CF1, which is considered necessary to limit wasteful ATP hydrolysis by CFoF1 in the dark (1.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-830Google Scholar, 2.McCarty R.E. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reaction. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 453-468Google Scholar).CF1 α exerts a negative effect on the restoration of proton-coupled ATP synthesis, which was obtained only when the treated chromatophores were reconstituted with RrF1 α in the presence of either RrF1 β or CF1 β (TableI). These results suggest that the chromatophores containing bound CF1 α are not properly coupled. In contrast, the hybrid chromatophores containing CF1 β in the presence of RrF1 α showed significant rates of ATP synthesis, indicating that CF1 β can replace at least some of the important energy coupling interactions of RrF1 β. The formation of hybrid RrF0F1/CF1 with chimeric CF1 α/RrF1 α and CF1β/RrF1 β, whose preparation is now under way, should help to identify the F1 α and/or β domains that are essential for the tight protein-protein interactions required for efficient proton-coupled ATP synthesis or hydrolysis.Interestingly, although CaATPase activity is not coupled to proton translocation (50.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) it was not restored by any hybrid RrF0F1/CF1 (Ref. 14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and see TableI). Recent results obtained with an RrF1 β-T159S mutant (51.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that substitution of serine for threonine in the active site blocks the restoration of Ca-dependent ATPase activity while enabling full restoration of both Mg-dependent ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. These two sets of results likely demonstrate differences in the geometry of the active sites on CF1 β and RrF1 β, as well as on RrF1 β-T159S when occupied by CaATP as compared with MgATP. The photosynthetic F0F1 ATP synthases found in the thylakoids of chloroplasts and in the cytoplasmic membranes of photosynthetic bacteria couple the movement of protons down an electrochemical proton gradient to the synthesis of ATP during photophosphorylation. The general structure of these ATP synthases is highly conserved, consisting of F0, the membrane-spanning proton channel, and F1, the peripheral membrane sector, which contains the catalytic sites for reversible ATP synthesis. The F0 is composed of four different subunits labeled a, b, b′, and c in photosynthetic bacteria (1.Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-830Google Scholar) and I–IV in chloroplasts (2.McCarty R.E. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reaction.

The chloroplast F0 subunits IV, I, II, and III are analogous to the bacterial a, b, b′, and c, respectively, with a probable stoichiometry of a1b1b′1c9–12. F1 from all sources is composed of five different subunits designated α to ε in order of decreasing molecular weight with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ε1. The x-ray crystal structure of bovine heart mitochondrial F1(MF1)1 at 2.8-Å resolution (5.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) defined the three-dimensional structures of alternating α and β subunits as forming a closed hexamer having a portion of the γ subunit embedded in its central cavity. Among the nucleotide binding sites, which are located one at each of the six α/β interfaces, the three catalytic sites, located predominantly on β subunits, were found to exist in three different conformational states. This asymmetric feature is compatible with the binding change mechanism, which proposed that the catalytic sites interconvert between three different conformational states during ATP synthesis via energy-dependent affinity changes in substrate binding and product release (6.Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 7.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Several recent studies of isolated (8.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) F1 have suggested that this is achieved via rotation of the γ subunit relative to the α3β3 subassembly. The MF1crystal structure identified a number of α-β, α-γ, and β-γ contacts, all or some of which may be responsible for dictating the asymmetric properties of each of the catalytic sites during catalysis. The importance of each of these contacts, and the steps involved in changing them, remain to be determined. Partially dissociated membrane ATP synthase complexes, which can be reassembled by adding isolated α and β subunits, can provide suitable tools for identifying and characterizing the interacting protein domains responsible for the binding change process. One such system, where both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis can be followed, was obtained by LiCl treatment of chromatophores isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum(12.Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment was found to release the bulk of their β subunits (12.Philosoph S.

Biochem. 1981; 119: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) resulting in the loss of over 90% of their ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities. Both activities could be restored upon reconstituting the treated chromatophores with the released subunits. The treated chromatophores could also be reconstituted with native spinach chloroplast CF1 β, although the protein preparation was contaminated with trace amounts of CF1 α (14.Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that the presence of small amounts of the α subunit was a requirement for the reconstitution of a hybrid ATP synthase with the CF1 β subunits (15.Av"

In this report, we have characterized two protein Ser/Thr kinase substrates that are intrinsically associated with CD120a (p55) in mouse macrophages, and we have investigated the mechanism involved in their phosphorylation. pp130 and pp95 were detected by co-immunoprecipitation with CD120a (p55) from lysates of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and were phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues during in vitrokinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The level of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 was rapidly and transiently increased in response to TNFα in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled macrophages, although the level of pp130 protein associated with CD120a (p55) remained unchanged as detected by [35S]methionine labeling. In contrast, pp130 and pp95 were efficiently phosphorylated in in vitrokinase assays of CD120a (p55) immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells, and the level of phosphorylation was rapidly and transiently reduced in response to TNFα. Both pp130 and pp95 were sensitive to dephosphorylation with purified protein phosphatase 2A, and okadaic acid, a PP1/PP2A inhibitor, mimicked the ability of TNFα to stimulate the phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 in intact 32P-labeled macrophages. Collectively, these findings suggest that pp130 and pp95 are constitutively associated with CD120a (p55) and become inducibly phosphorylated in macrophages in response to TNFα. We propose that the underlying mechanism of their phosphorylation may involve the inactivation of a cytoplasmic pp130/pp95 Ser/Thr phosphatase.

Cellular responses to TNFα are mediated by two cell surface receptors, designated CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75), which initiate distinct signaling responses, initially through protein-protein interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors and a number of adaptor and other signaling proteins. Aggregation of CD120a (p55) facilitates the binding of TRADD to CD120a (p55) via the death domains of both proteins (4.Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). The binding of TRADD enables the assembly of TNF-receptor associated factor-2, RIP, and Fas-associated death domain protein (5.Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V.

However, whereas molecules such as TRADD, TNF-receptor associated factor-2, RIP, and Fas-associated death domain protein play indisputably important roles in signal transduction following ligation of CD120a (p55), other signaling proteins, including additional Ser/Thr kinases and their appropriate substrates, have been found to be present in CD120a (p55) immunoprecipitates (11.VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar) or bound by glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) (12.Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the most part, the identity and functions of these poorly defined proteins have remained elusive. The ability of Ser/Thr kinases to associate with sequences present in the cytoplasmic domains of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75), as well as the related lymphotoxin-β receptor, has been known for several years. Darnay et al. (12.Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have characterized a Ser/Thr protein kinase activity that binds to sequences located in the death domain of human CD120a (p55) using fusion proteins of GST and various truncations and deletions of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Designated p60 TRAK, the kinase exhibits a preference for CD120a (p55), histone H1, and casein, but not for CD120b (p75) or myelin basic protein. A distinct Ser/Thr kinase activity identified as casein kinase I has also been found to constitutively associate with the cytoplasmic region of CD120b (p75), and its activity promotes rescue from apoptosis (13.Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar approach employing GST fusion proteins has also been used to characterize a Ser/Thr kinase activity that interacts with sequences present within the cytoplasmic domain of the lymphotoxin-β receptor (14.Wu M.-Y. Hsu T.-L. Lin W.-W. Campbell R.D. Hsieh S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This latter kinase also appears to be specific for the lymphotoxin-β receptor and does not trans-phosphorylate CD120a (p55). A Ser kinase activity has also been detected in immunoprecipitates of human CD120a (p55) from U937 cells and was found to phosphorylate substrates of 125, 97, 85, and 60 kDa that were co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor (11.VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar). RIP and RIP2 are 74- and 61-kDa death domain-containing proteins bearing Ser/Thr kinase domains (15.Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 16.McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and are the only CD120a (p55)-associated kinases to be cloned although their molecular weights are distinct from other receptor-associated kinase activities. Thus, in addition to the previously identified proteins that interact with CD120a (p55), a number of other proteins, including Ser/Thr kinase(s), appear to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Immunoprecipitation of mouse CD120a (p55) from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages co-immunoprecipitates two proteins, pp130 and pp95, that are phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues in vitro by a receptor-associated kinase activity. The major goal of the work reported herein was to determine the mechanism of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 and their mode of interaction with CD120a (p55). As we will show, pp130 undergoes a rapid and transient TNFα-induced increase in phosphorylation. In addition, we provide evidence suggestive of an indirect interaction between pp130 and pp95 with the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55). C3H/HeJ mice were bred in the Biologic Resource Center at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center and were used throughout the study to avoid the possibility of stimulation by trace amounts of endotoxin contaminants (17.Pace J.L.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from femoral and tibial bone marrow as described previously (18.Riches D.W.H. Underwood G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24785-24792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow progenitor cells were cultured at a density of 2.4 × 105 cells/cm2 at 37 °C in a 10% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere for 5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 10% (v/v) L929 cell-conditioned medium as a source of CSF-1. Macrophage monolayers were stimulated with TNFα as specified under “Results” and then rinsed with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. The cells were then lysed on ice with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 137 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble debris, and the supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Twenty μl of each lysate were used for protein determination using the BCA method (19.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gantner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

Immunoprecipitations were conducted by mixing equal amounts of lysate protein with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 3 μg of anti-CD120a (p55), anti-CD120b (p75) antibody, or nonimmune IgG at 4 °C for 2.5 h. The beads were washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with PAN buffer (10 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm NaCl and 21 μg/ml aprotinin). After the last wash, the beads were resuspended in 35 μl of PAN buffer and subjected to anin vitro kinase assay with 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mmMnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 20 min. The kinase reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT, and were boiled for 5 min, before separating on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. The separated bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography of 32P-labeled phosphoproteins. Samples for phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, respectively. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis (20.Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar) was conducted by excising the appropriate 32P-labeled bands from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjecting them to hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 2 h at 110 °C. Following lyophilization, the samples were resuspended in 10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (2.5% (v/v) formic acid, 7.8% (v/v) acetic acid) containing phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine standards at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. One thousand cpm of each sample were loaded on cellulose thin-layer plates (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ). The first dimension electrophoresis was performed at 1.5 kV for 30 min in pH 1.9 buffer, whereas the second dimension was electrophoresed at 1.3 kV for 20 min in pH 3.5 buffer (5% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The plates were then dried, sprayed with 2.5% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone, and baked at 65 °C for 20 min. The 32P-labeled threonine, serine, and tyrosine were detected by autoradiography using high performance autoradiography film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and compared with the localization of the authentic unlabeled standards. For phosphopeptide mapping (20.Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 21.Van Der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1993: 38-40Google Scholar), excised membranes were soaked in 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone dissolved in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The membrane segments were then digested with 40 μg of TPCK-trypsin for 4 h at 37 °C. The eluted phosphoproteins were lyophilized and resuspended in 10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer, and ∼1000 cpm of each sample were applied at the origin of cellulose thin-layer plates. First dimension electrophoresis was performed at 1.5 kV for 30 min in pH 1.9 buffer, and thin layer chromatography for the second dimension was performed in phosphochromatography buffer (37.5% (v/v) n-butanol, 25% (v/v) pyridine, 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid) for 7 h. After drying the plates, 32P-phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography using high performance autoradiography film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate was performed using a modification of previously described methods (22.Winston, B. W., and Riches, D. W. H. (1995) 155, 1525–1533Google Scholar). Macrophage monolayers were incubated in phosphate-free MEM for 1 h and then labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate dissolved in phosphate-free MEM containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 10% (v/v) dialyzed L929 cell-conditioned medium for 6 h. Cells were stimulated with TNFα or medium alone as indicated under “Results” before lysing in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 20 min, and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-CD120a (p55) antibody or anti-CD120b (p75) antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed ten times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After the last wash, 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT was added, and the radiolabeled proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The separated bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography using high performance autoradiography film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vivo labeling with [35S]methionine (23.Winston B.W. Remigio L.K. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27391-27394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was achieved by rinsing macrophage monolayers with prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.04% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate followed by labeling with 1 mCi of [35S]methionine dissolved in methionine-free MEM for 4–6 h. The cells were stimulated as described under “Results” after removal of the [35S]methionine-containing media. The samples were processed for analysis as described above for in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. Fusion proteins comprising glutathioneS-transferase and segments of CD120a (p55) from residues 207–425 (the cytoplasmic domain) and 184–425 (the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domain) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and ligation into pGEX 5X-1. Polymerase chain reaction primers were synthesized to contain restriction sites forEcoRI and SalI at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The upstream and downstream primers for the construction of CD120a207–425 were of sequences 5′-GTTTAGAATTCCGATATCCCCGGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTGTCGACTTATCGCGGGAGGCGGGTC-3′, respectively. The sequence of the upstream primer for the construction of CD120a184–425 was 5′-CCACACACGAATTCCAGGACTCAGGTACTGCGGTG-3′, and the downstream primer was the same as that used for CD120a207–425. The reaction mixtures were amplified with Pfu polymerase for 25 cycles containing full-length mouse CD120a (p55) as template with a profile of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, primer annealing at 68 °C for 45 s, and extension at 75 °C for 45 s. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into EcoRI/SalI digested pGEX-5X-1. Plasmid DNA was transformed into DH-5α cells, and the sequences of each construct were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. A GST-CD120207–425 fusion protein was also constructed using the vector pGEX-2TK to introduce a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation motif to enable labeling of CD120207–425 with 32P for use in far Western blots. The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were carried out with the following modifications of a previously described method (12.Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Transformed DH-5α cells were grown toA 550 = 0.5–0.7 at 37 °C before inducing with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 3 h of induction, the cells were harvested and lysed with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 1.5% (w/v) sarkosyl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with 1:1 (v/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed five times with cold PBS and stored at 4 °C. Unstimulated or TNFα-stimulated cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described above. Equal amounts of whole cell lysate protein were incubated with 20 μl of Sepharose beads coated with GST-CD120a207–425, GST-CD120a184–425, or GST alone for 2.5 h at 4 °C.In vitro kinase reactions were then conducted as described earlier. A probe composed of an NH2-terminal cAMPdependent kinase consensus phosphorylation motif fused to CD120207–425 was prepared by phosphorylating the parent GST-PKA-CD120a207–425 fusion protein coated beads with bovine heart kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP before digesting with thrombin to release the soluble labeled probe as described in the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech GST fusion protein technical manual. Briefly, prewashed beads (1:1 slurry) were incubated in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 units of bovine heart kinase at 4 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated with 5 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmEDTA, and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. The beads were washed six times with PBS and then were subjected to elution with thrombin (1 unit/μl) overnight at room temperature. The supernatants were collected and used as the probe in far Western blots. Macrophage monolayers were lysed with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and equal amounts of lysate protein were mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT, boiled for 5 min, and separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and were subjected to five cycles of denaturation/renaturation (stepwise to reduce the concentration of guanidine-HCl from 6 to 0.937m) in HB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, containing 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2and 1 mm DTT) as described previously (25.Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.E. Landschulz W.H. McKinght S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The blots were saturated with HB buffer containing 5% (w/v) milk, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 at 4 °C overnight before adding probe (1 × 105 cpm/ml) in H buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, containing 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed five times with H buffer (26.Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielain P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and then autoradiograms were prepared. Previous work has shown that several proteins co-immunoprecipitate with CD120a (p55) and are substrates for receptor-associated protein Ser/Thr kinase(s) (11.VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar). To define kinase substrates that interact with CD120a (p55) in mouse macrophages, we immunoprecipitated the receptor from monolayers of unstimulated mouse macrophages using an antagonistic hamster monoclonal anti-mouse CD120a (p55) antibody to prevent artifactual in vitro stimulation of CD120a (p55)-dependent signaling, as has been shown to occur with other anti-TNF-receptor antibodies (27.Sheehan K.C. Pinckard J.K. Arthur C.D. Dehner L.P. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28.Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The CD120a (p55) immunoprecipitates were then subjected to an in vitrokinase assay with [γ-32P]ATP to catalyze the phosphorylation of receptor-associated substrates by receptor-associated kinase(s). As can be seen in Fig.1 A, a prominent phosphoprotein with an estimated molecular mass of ∼130 kDa (designated pp130) and a less conspicuous band of ∼95 kDa (designated pp95) were co-immunoprecipitated with CD120a (p55) in unstimulated macrophages. A third phosphoprotein of ∼55 kDa was also detected. This phosphoprotein was found to co-localize with CD120a (p55) in anti-CD120a (p55) immunoblots using goat anti-mouse CD120a (p55) antibody and thus may represent either phosphorylated CD120a (p55) or an additional receptor-associated protein with a molecular mass similar to that of CD120a (p55). Immunoprecipitation of macrophage lysates with anti-CD120b (p75) antibody or nonimmune hamster IgG did not result in the phosphorylation of pp130, pp95, or any other receptor-associated substrates (Fig. 1 A). Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analyses of excised segments of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes obtained from CD120a (p55) immunoprecipitates revealed that both pp130 and pp95 were phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues at ratios of 6.3:1 (n = 6) and 14.2:1 (n = 6) for pp130 and pp95, respectively. Neither phosphoprotein contained detectable levels of phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1 B). To investigate whether pp130 and pp95 were related phosphoproteins, we conducted high resolution two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping on excised segments of nitrocellulose membrane. As shown in Fig. 2 A, pp130 yielded 7 major tryptic peptides and ∼8–10 less distinct peptides that were only apparent upon extended autoradiographic exposures. The tryptic phosphopeptide map of pp95 (Fig. 2 B) was markedly different and exhibited only two highly phosphorylated peptides, the mobilities of which were not superimposed with any of the phosphopeptides obtained by tryptic hydrolysis of pp130. Extended exposure of the pp95 phosphopeptides revealed ∼15 less intense 32P-labeled tryptic phosphopeptides, which also exhibited a markedly different pattern compared with pp130. pp130 and pp95 thus appear to be distinct protein Ser/Thr kinase substrates that are constitutively associated with CD120a (p55) but not CD120b (p75). We next determined whether the level or pattern of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 was altered in response to ligation of TNF receptors with TNFα. Macrophage monolayers were incubated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for time intervals up to 24 h prior to lysis, immunoprecipitation with anti-CD120a (p55) antibody, and in vitro kinase reactions with [γ-32P]ATP. As can be seen in Fig.3 A, exposure to TNFα induced a bimodal change in the level of phosphorylation of both pp130 and pp95. Following stimulation for 5–10 min, a modest, although consistent, decrease in the level of phosphorylation of both pp130 and pp95 was detected in comparison with unstimulated cells. However, after 30 min of incubation with TNFα, the level of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 had returned to that of unstimulated cells and then began to increase before peaking ∼4–12 h after exposure to TNFα. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the level of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 was increased in a concentration-dependent fashion compared with unstimulated macrophages following 18 h of exposure to increasing concentrations of TNFα (0.01–100 ng/ml). Incubation with TNFα did not result in the phosphorylation of CD120b (p75)-associated proteins following exposure for 18 h (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of pp130 and pp95 at each time point revealed no gross changes in the ratio of phosphoserine to phosphothreonine, nor was phosphorylation of tyrosine residues seen at any time point following stimulation with TNFα (Fig.4). In addition, we did not observe any significant changes in the pattern of peptides phosphorylated in pp130 and pp95 following stimulation with TNFα compared with unstimulated cells (data not shown). Thus, the bimodal changes in the level of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 do not appear to be associated with gross changes in the pattern of phosphorylation of pp130 and pp95 and are suggestive of changes in the overall level of phosphorylation of acceptor sites.Figure 4Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of pp130 and pp95 in macrophages stimulated with TNFα for up to 18 h. S, serine; T, threonine; Y, tyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of TNFα receptor ligation on the level of phosphorylation in vivo, macrophage monolayers were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi for 6 h) and incubated with TNFα or medium alone for 10 min or 6 h. The cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-CD120a (p55) antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation with anti-CD120b (p75) antibody was used as a control, as previously reported studies have shown this TNF receptor to be constitutively phosphorylatedin vivo (13.Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.5 A, 32P-labeled pp130 and pp95 were detected, albeit at low levels in unstimulated macrophages. Following incubation with TNFα for 10 min, the level of phosphorylation of pp130 and, to a lesser extent, pp95 was increased in comparison with unstimulated cells but returned to the level of unstimulated macrophages after 6 h exposure to TNFα. As expected, CD120b (p75) immunoprecipitates exhibited a heavily phosphorylated band of ∼80 kDa consistent with this phosphoprotein being CD120b (p75) (13.Be"
