https://openalex.org/W2786123519,"Adaptation of crops to climate change has motivated an increasing interest in the potential value of novel traits from wild species; maize wild relatives, the teosintes, harbor traits that may be useful to maize breeding. To study the ecogeographic distribution of teosinte we constructed a robust database of 2363 teosinte occurrences from published sources for the period 1842–2016. A geographical information system integrating 216 environmental variables was created for Mexico and Central America and was used to characterize the environment of each teosinte occurrence site. The natural geographic distribution of teosinte extends from the Western Sierra Madre of the State of Chihuahua, Mexico to the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, including practically the entire western part of Mesoamerica. The Mexican annuals Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea mays ssp. mexicana show a wide distribution in Mexico, while Zea diploperennis, Zea luxurians, Zea perennis, Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis, Zea vespertilio and Zea nicaraguensis had more restricted and distinct ranges, representing less than 20% of the total occurrences. Only 11.2% of teosinte populations are found in Protected Natural Areas in Mexico and Central America. Ecogeographical analysis showed that teosinte can cope with extreme levels of precipitation and temperatures during growing season. Modelling teosinte geographic distribution demonstrated congruence between actual and potential distributions; however, some areas with no occurrences appear to be within the range of adaptation of teosintes. Field surveys should be prioritized to such regions to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations. Potential areas for teosintes Zea mays ssp. mexicana races Chalco, Nobogame, and Durango, Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis, Zea luxurians, Zea diploperennis and Zea nicaraguensis are geographically separated; however, partial overlapping occurs between Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea perennis, between Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea diploperennis, and between Zea mays ssp. mexicana race Chalco and Zea mays ssp. mexicana race Central Plateau. Assessing priority of collecting for conservation showed that permanent monitoring programs and in-situ conservation projects with participation of local farmer communities are critically needed; Zea mays ssp. mexicana (races Durango and Nobogame), Zea luxurians, Zea diploperennis, Zea perennis and Zea vespertilio should be considered as the highest priority taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2787170837,"Elastic fibers comprising fibrillin microfibrils and elastin are present in many tissues, including the skin, lungs, and arteries, where they confer elasticity and resilience. Although fibrillin microfibrils play distinct and tissue-specific functional roles, it is unclear whether their ultrastructure and composition differ between elastin-rich (skin) and elastin-poor (ciliary body and zonule) organs or after in vitro synthesis by cultured cells. Here, we used atomic force microscopy, which revealed that the bead morphology of fibrillin microfibrils isolated from the human eye differs from those isolated from the skin. Using newly developed pre-MS preparation methods and LC-MS/MS, we detected tissue-specific regions of the fibrillin-1 primary structure that were differentially susceptible to proteolytic extraction. Comparing tissue- and culture-derived microfibrils, we found that dermis- and dermal fibroblast–derived fibrillin microfibrils differ in both bead morphology and periodicity and also exhibit regional differences in fibrillin-1 proteolytic susceptibility. In contrast, collagen VI microfibrils from the same dermal or fibroblast samples were invariant in ultrastructure (periodicity) and protease susceptibility. Finally, we observed that skin- and eye-derived microfibril suspensions were enriched in elastic fiber– and basement membrane–associated proteins, respectively. LC-MS/MS also identified proteins (such as calreticulin and protein-disulfide isomerase) that are potentially fundamental to fibrillin microfibril biology, regardless of their tissue source. Fibrillin microfibrils synthesized in cell culture lacked some of these key proteins (MFAP2 and -4 and fibrillin-2). These results showcase the structural diversity of these key extracellular matrix assemblies, which may relate to their distinct roles in the tissues where they reside.

Some of these assemblies, such as the fibrillar collagens and the elastic fibers, are large, insoluble, and supramacromolecular. Some are markedly long-lived, laid down early in development, where they persist and undergo a process of maturation (1Parry D.A.D. Barnes G.R.G. Craig A.S.

Elastic fibres.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 (12082143): 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrillin microfibril, along with elastin, is a key component of the elastic fiber and adopts a bead-on-a-string appearance (9Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E.

Additionally, these microfibrils exist also as stand-alone assemblies, forming candelabra-like structures (10Cotta-Pereira G. Guerra Rodrigo F. Bittencourt-Sampaio S.

In eyes, fibrillin microfibrils play an architectural role very different from that in skin. They form the ciliary zonules, stand-alone suspensory ligaments that connect the lens capsule to the ciliary muscle (15Ashworth J.L. Kielty C.M. McLeod D. Fibrillin and the eye.Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2000; 84 (11049961): 1312-131710.1136/bjo.84.11.1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These zonules come under tensile stress as the ciliary muscle exerts a strain to deform the lens during accommodation. Although fibrillin microfibrils appear structurally and compositionally similar in mammalian tissues and cell culture systems and retain a beadlike structure (and presence of the main component, fibrillin-1) throughout different tissues (9Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. The supramolecular organization of fibrillin-rich microfibrils.J.

Only two studies have shown that fibrillin microfibril ultrastructure is tissue- and developmentally dependent. In 1997, we showed that intertissue differences in mass and periodicity (interbead distance) exist in microfibrils derived from bovine fetal aorta and skin (16Sherratt M.J. Holmes D.F. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Scanning transmission electron microscopy mass analysis of fibrillin-containing microfibrils from foetal elastic tissues.Int. J. Biochem.

We also showed that fibrillin microfibrils undergo a process of post-translational maturation as their mass increases during fetus development. Lu et al. (17Lu Y. Sherratt M.J. Wang M.C. Baldock C. Tissue specific differences in fibrillin microfibrils analysed using single particle image analysis.J. Struct.

Because fibrillin microfibrils are present in a variety of tissues, the different roles they play may be reflected in the ultrastructure they adopt. These intertissue comparisons have never been made in humans or between fibrillin microfibrils sourced from ciliary body (CB) and skin, where they play very different architectural and mechanical roles. Additionally, the fibrillin microfibril’s biomolecular composition has never been compared between tissues. Although their ultrastructure has been extensively studied using AFM (18Sherratt M.J.

As a consequence, it is necessary to develop proteomic approaches to characterize fibrillin microfibril composition. Recently, De Maria et al. (22De Maria A. Wilmarth P.A. David L.L. Bassnett S. Proteomic analysis of the bovine and human ciliary zonule proteomic analysis of the ciliary zonule.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

However, to date, only a single published proteomic study, performed by Cain et al. (23Cain S.A. Morgan A. Sherratt M.J. Ball S.G. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Proteomic analysis of fibrillin-rich microfibrils.Proteomics. 2006; 6 (16302274): 111-12210.1002/pmic.200401340Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), has attempted to characterize both the structure and composition of fibrillin microfibrils purified from human tissue. Through LC-MS/MS, Cain et al. (23Cain S.A. Morgan A. Sherratt M.J. Ball S.G. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Proteomic analysis of fibrillin-rich microfibrils.Proteomics. 2006; 6 (16302274): 111-12210.1002/pmic.200401340Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) achieved a 30% primary coverage of fibrillin-1 and identified several microfibril-associated proteins, such as microfibril-associated protein 2 (MFAP2). They demonstrated that MS-based proteomic approaches have the potential to identify the proteins involved in these supramolecular ECM assemblies. However, they observed that peptide generation from the core fibrillin-1 proteins, and their interacting proteins, was challenging due to their large size and high number of cross-links (24Marson A. Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Shuttleworth C.A. Baldock C. Kielty C.M. Homotypic fibrillin-1 interactions in microfibril assembly.J. Biol.

Since this study took place, over 10 years ago, advances have been made in mass spectrometer technology allowing greater resolving power with expanded functionalities (25Schilling B. MacLean B. Held J.M. Sahu A.K. Rardin M.J. Sorensen D.J. Peters T. Wolfe A.J. Hunter C.L. MacCoss M.J. Gibson B.W.

Coupled with improved sample preparation, we believe that these proteomic approaches can be enhanced further to allow effective intertissue comparisons of fibrillin microfibril composition and structure. In this study, we optimized two effective methods of pre-MS sample preparation: elastase digestion and SMARTTM digestion, for the enhanced generation of fibrillin peptides and their microfibril-associated proteins. This led to an improved compositional analysis via LC-MS/MS, compared with Cain et al. (23Cain S.A. Morgan A. Sherratt M.J. Ball S.G. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Proteomic analysis of fibrillin-rich microfibrils.Proteomics. 2006; 6 (16302274): 111-12210.1002/pmic.200401340Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We go on to test differences between the ultrastructure (bead morphology and interbead periodicity) using AFM and biomolecular composition (fibrillin-1 structural and enzymatic susceptibly and associated protein presence) using MS of fibrillin microfibrils isolated from human eye (CB), human skin, and cultured human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Because collagen VI microfibrils co-purify with fibrillin microfibrils in skin- and HDF-derived samples, we use them as a comparative control. We perform these analyses to test the following hypotheses: 1) fibrillin microfibril ultrastructure and composition are tissue-dependent and 2) culture-derived, newly synthesized fibrillin microfibril ultrastructure and composition are distinct from those of native, mature, tissue-sourced microfibrils. To improve the generation of peptides from core microfibril components, porcine elastase, a highly active and nonspecific enzyme (which preferentially cleaves leucine, isoleucine, alanine, serine, valine, and glycine) (26Sziegoleit A.

InTech, Rijeka, Croatia2012Google Scholar). For human CB-derived fibrillin microfibrils, this method, along with the use of a latest-generation mass spectrometer, led to an improved primary coverage (33%) and domain coverage (76%) of fibrillin-1, compared with that achieved by Cain et al. (23Cain S.A. Morgan A. Sherratt M.J. Ball S.G. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M.

A similar primary sequence and domain coverage were achieved when applied to human skin. Crucially, this improved coverage was achieved by the digestion and MS of single CB and skin samples, whereas Cain et al. (23Cain S.A. Morgan A. Sherratt M.J. Ball S.G. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M.

To improve peptide generation from proteins that co-purify with the microfibril, SMARTTM digestion was used. Collectively, the elastase and SMARTTM digestion methods led to the successful identification of 13 known microfibril-associated proteins (Fig. 1B) from human CB. These include annexin V, annexin II, and MFAP2, identified by Cain et al. (23Cain S.A. Morgan A. Sherratt M.J. Ball S.G. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M.

The fibrillin microfibril is composed predominantly of fibrillin-1 (∼8 monomers per single bead and interbead repeat) with a total mass of ∼2.5 MDa per repeat (9Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U.

The average periodicity and bead width has been approximated to 56 and 19 nm, respectively (for a detailed breakdown of microfibril dimensions, see Ref. 9Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. The supramolecular organization of fibrillin-rich microfibrils.J.

Our data showed that fibrillin microfibrils derived from human eye (CB) had a significantly higher mean central bead height than those derived from human skin. (Fig 2A, i). Central bead height frequency distributions indicate that the majority of eye-derived fibrillin microfibrils had larger beads than skin-derived (Fig. 2A, ii). Additionally, average axial height profiles showed that although eye-derived fibrillin microfibrils beads are significantly higher within a ∼10-nm radius of the center, they were significantly lower at the shoulder region, ∼20 nm from the peak (Fig. 2A, iii, orange arrow) than skin-derived. These height differences in bead morphology are further exemplified in the contour heat map (Fig. 2A, iv), where eye-derived microfibrils appear to have a more pronounced bead with a lower shoulder region than skin. Between beads, however, there was no significant difference in the mean periodicity of fibrillin microfibrils derived from eye and skin (Fig. 2B, i and ii) Many past studies exclusively used differences in periodicity to gauge ultrastructural differences in fibrillin microfibrils (19Hibbert S.A.

Our data showed that eye-derived fibrillin microfibril beads differ in morphology in comparison with skin-derived, but periodicity did not. By omitting analysis of the microfibril bead, these studies may have missed some key ultrastructural changes linked to health and disease.

Strikingly however, given the meaning of the acronym UPR (i.e. responses to unfolded proteins), comparative high throughput studies at the transcriptome and proteome level aiming to distinguish chemical- versus unfolded protein–induced ER stresses of the same magnitude and to molecularly characterize these latter, remain to be performed. Here, we compare responses of mammalian cultured cells upon perturbation of ER homeostasis on exposure to conventional ER stress–inducing chemicals or on individual expression of one folding-competent and four different folding-defective proteins. The levels of chemically or unfolded protein–induced ER stresses were eventually set to the same magnitude by adjusting drugs and unfolded protein concentrations to cause a doubling of the cellular content of BiP/HSPA5 and HERP/HERPUD1 as endogenous reporters for ER perturbations. Variations in cell transcriptome, proteome, and UPRome were determined by gene expression profiling (GEP) (25Koritzinsky M. Levitin F. van den Beucken T. Rumantir R.A. Harding N.J. Chu K.C.

We report that UPR induction on unfolded protein load in the ER requires association of the unfolded cargo with the luminal chaperone BiP/HSPA5. Moreover, and as a crucial difference with chemical stresses of the same magnitude that modify expression of a variety of genes, compartmental load with unfolded proteins specifically induces transcription and translation of a subset of chaperones engaged in a functional complex previously reported to bind unfolded polypeptide chains. To analyze cellular responses on luminal accumulation of unfolded proteins, we initially generated a panel of Flp-InTM T-RExTM-inducible HEK293 cell lines for expression of HA-tagged versions of three well characterized folding-defective polypeptides (BACE457, BACE457Δ (27Molinari M.

Transgene expression was induced on exposure of the corresponding cells to 100 ng/ml of tetracycline (Fig. 1B). Tetracycline per se was not affecting mRNA levels of ER stress reporter genes as determined by qPCR (Fig. S1A). BACE457 and BACE457Δ induction with 100 ng/ml of tetracycline (Fig. 1B, triplicates, lanes 1–6) elicited an ER stress response as revealed by the 2.45, respectively, 1.8-fold increase of BiP/HSPA5 transcripts (Fig. 1C), increase of HERP/HERPUD1 mRNA as determined by qPCR (Fig. 1D) and BiP and HERP proteins as monitored in Western blot (Fig. 1, E–G, Fig. S1B). The expression of the folding-competent α1ATM (Fig. 1B, lanes 13–15), which is rapidly secreted from the ER (29Merulla J. Soldà T. Molinari M.

Interestingly, CD3δ even if retained in the ER at higher levels compared with BACE457 and BACE457Δ (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–6 versus 7–9) did not result in significant variations of ER stress reporters expression (Fig. 1, C–F and H). Next, we compared consequences of the inducible expression of BACE457 (Fig. 1G), BACE457Δ (Fig. S1B), and CD3δ (Fig. 1H) as obtained with a stepwise increase of tetracycline from 0 to 100 ng/ml. The intracellular concentration of the transgenes was determined by comparing protein standards and ranged from a not detectable level in non-induced cells up to 1.34 fmol/cell for BACE457 (Fig. 1G) and up to 2.71 fmol/cell for CD3δ (Fig. 1H). Western blot analyses of total cell extracts separated in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the expression of BACE457 gradually elevated the intraluminal levels of BiP/HSPA5, GRP94/HSP90B1, and HERP/HERPUD1 as an indication of a dose-dependent UPR induction (Fig. 1G). The same dose-dependent UPR induction was observed on increasing expression of BACE457Δ (Fig. S1B). Remarkably, and confirming the qPCR and Western blot data quantified in Fig. 1, C–F, the expression of CD3δ did not induce UPR as shown by the unchanged levels of the endogenous UPR reporter proteins even on maximal luminal accumulation of the transgene (Fig. 1H). Lack of BiP/HSPA5, GRP94/HSP90B1, and HERP/HERPUD1 induction on intraluminal accumulation of CD3δ, which is 2-fold higher than BACE457 and BACE457Δ (Fig. 1B), was somewhat surprising because like BACE457, CD3δ is retained in the ER as an unfolded, orphan subunit of the T cell receptor complex (28Yang M.

We noticed that, in contrast to the ER stress inducers BACE457 and BACE457Δ, CD3δ is a poor BiP-binder. In fact, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a 3-fold lower association of BiP with CD3δ (Fig. 1, I, lanes 1–3 versus 4–6, and J). In an attempt to increase BiP-binding and to verify whether BiP sequestration by the unfolded protein, rather than the retention of the unfolded polypeptide in the ER is required for UPR activation, we deleted the CD3δ oligosaccharides by introducing an asparagine to glutamine mutation in the three CD3δ’s glycosylation sequons. N-Linked oligosaccharides are in fact bulky, hydrophilic moieties that interfere with BiP-binding (42Molinari M. Helenius A. Chaperone selection during glycoprotein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 288 (10764645): 331-33310.1126/science.288.5464.331Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We generated an inducible cell line expressing the non-glycosylated CD3δQQQ polypeptide (Fig. 1B, lanes 10–12) to confirm that BiP association was increased about 3-fold compared with the glycosylated form of the protein (Fig. 1, I, lane 7 versus 9, and J). Consistent with the second hypothesis that BiP binding determines UPR induction, CD3δQQQ accumulated in the ER at a 2-fold lower level than CD3δ (Fig. 1B), but its expression activated an ER stress response characterized by a 1.89-fold up-regulation of BiP/HSPA5 and HERP/HERPUD1 transcripts (Fig. 1, C and D) and an elevated level of BiP and HERP protein expressions (Fig. 1, E and F). All in all, to induce an ER stress response, ER-retained unfolded proteins must sequester a sufficient amount of BiP from the ER lumen. The bacterial product TM inhibits the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol phosphate thus preventing N-glycosylation of newly synthesized secretory proteins (43Tkacz J.S.

Drug treatment was performed on the inducible cell line expressing BACE457 grown in the absence of tetracycline (i.e. not expressing the transgene as shown in Fig. 1G, lane 1). qPCR analyses revealed a 9.76-fold up-regulation of BiP/HSPA5 mRNA (Fig. 1K, TMhigh) and Western blot analyses confirmed the abundant rise in the intraluminal level of BiP and HERP proteins (Fig. 1, L and M, TMhigh). Thus, TMhigh induction of BiP/HSPA5 and HERP/HERPUD1 expression was up to 5 times higher than the up-regulation observed on luminal accumulation of BACE457 in the same cell line (Figs. 1, K–M) or of BACE457Δ or CD3δQQQ in two independent cell lines (Fig. 1, C–F). To evaluate the specificity of gene expression induction by drug versus unfolded protein load, we titrated the working concentration of drugs to doses that induced similar levels of BiP/HSPA5 and HERP/HERPUD1 as the expression of the unfolded polypeptides (BACE457 as standard in Fig. 1, K–M). The established concentrations were 40 ng/ml of TM (TMlow, the literature reports use of doses ranging between 5 and 10 μg/ml) and 25 nm TG (TGlow, the literature reports use of doses ranging between 200 and 300 nm) (9Oslowski C.M.

Here, by using isogenic diploid and near-tetraploid (4N) single-cell-derived clones from the same parental cell lines, we aimed at exploring how polyploidization affects cellular functions and how tetraploidy generates chromosome instability. Gene expression profiling in 4N clones revealed a significant enrichment of transcripts involved in cell cycle and DNA replication. Increased levels of replication stress in 4N cells resulted in DNA damage, impaired proliferation caused by a cell cycle delay during S phase, and higher sensitivity to S phase checkpoint inhibitors. In fact, increased levels of replication stress were also observed in nontransformed, proliferative posttetraploid RPE1 cells. Additionally, replication stress promoted higher levels of intercellular genomic heterogeneity and ongoing genomic instability, which could be explained by high rates of mitotic defects, and was alleviated by the supplementation of exogenous nucleosides. Finally, our data found that 4N cancer cells displayed increased migratory and invasive capacity, both in vitro and in primary colorectal tumors, indicating that tetraploidy can promote aggressive cancer cell behavior.-Wangsa, D., Quintanilla, I., Torabi, K., Vila-Casadesús, M., Ercilla, A., Klus, G., Yuce, Z., Galofré, C., Cuatrecasas, M., Lozano, J.

Here, we developed a novel bio-organic fertilizer (BOF) by fermentation of a cow plus chicken manure (M) compost using Fen-liquor Daqu (FLD) as a fermentation starter and compared the compositions of bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil of watermelon plants after treatment with different fertilizers. Further, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying plant-promoting and disease (Fusarium wilt)-suppressing activities of each rhizosphere microbial community. The microbial communities of soil amended with cow plus chicken manure compost (S+M), soil amended with the BOF (S+BOF), and untreated control soil (S) without plants were analyzed through sequence analysis using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The results showed that a new microbial community was formed in the manure compost after fermentation by the Daqu. Application of the BOF to the soil induced remarkable changes in the rhizosphere microbial communities, with increased bacterial diversity and decreased fungal diversity. Most importantly, S+BOF showed the lowest abundance of Fusarium. Moreover, watermelon quality was higher (P < 0.05) in the S+BOF than in the S+M treatment. Thus, application of the BOF favorably altered the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community, suppressing Fusarium wilt disease and promoting plant quality."

In vivo, EGFP+ mesenchymal cells were observed in fetal and adult bones at proliferative ossification sites, while in solid organs EGFP+ cells exhibited a perivascular distribution pattern. EGFP+ cells from the bone compartment could be clonally expanded ex vivo from single cells and displayed trilineage differentiation potential. Moreover, in the central bone marrow CD73-EGFP+ specifically labeled sinusoidal endothelial cells, thought to be a critical component of the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Purification and molecular characterization of this CD73-EGFP+ population revealed an endothelial subtype that also displays a mesenchymal signature, highlighting endothelial cell heterogeneity in the marrow.

As in most karst contexts, the formation of this succession involved multiple and complex phenomena, including subsidence, bioturbation, carnivore activity and runoff as agents of potential post-depositional disturbance. During phases of stabilization, such as represented by layers 15, 21 and 22, the excavated area was inhabited and refits corroborate that post-depositional displacement is negligible. Layers 23-25 and 16-19 correspond to subdivisions that slice thick geological units primarily formed of material derived from the cave's entrance via slope dynamics. Refit links are consistent with rapid fill-up of the interstitial spaces found in the Karren-like bedrock (for layers 23-25), or left between large boulders after major roof-collapse events (for layers 16-19). Layers 26 (the ""Mousterian Cone"") and 27 are a ""bottom-of-hourglass"" deposit underlying the main sedimentary body; the refits show that this deposit consists of material derived from layers 15-25 that gravitated through fissures open in the sedimentary column above. Layer 20, at the interface between two major stratigraphic ensembles, requires additional analysis. Throughout, we found significant vertical dispersion along the contact between sedimentary fill and cave wall. Given these findings, a preliminary analysis of technological change across the studied sequence organized the lithic assemblages into five ensembles: layer 15; layers 16-19; layer 20; layers 21-22; layers 23-25.

Expression of HPV16 E6, E7 and E2 transcripts, along with cellular ARF and INK4A, were also assessed by RT-qPCR. Associations between E2 disruption, E2/E6/E7 expression, and clinical outcome were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis for loco-regional recurrence and disease-specific survival. The majority (n = 21, 68%) of HPV16 positive oropharyngeal carcinomas had an intact E2 gene, whereas the majority of HPV16 positive non-oropharyngeal carcinomas (n = 10, 59%) had a disrupted E2 gene. Three of the oropharyngeal tumors and two of the non-oropharyngeal tumors had deletions within E2. Detection of an intact E2 gene was associated with a higher DNA viral load and increased E2/E6/E7, ARF and INK4A expression in oropharyngeal tumors. Oropharyngeal carcinomas with an intact E2 had a lower risk of loco-regional recurrence (log-rank p = 0.04) and improved disease-specific survival (p = 0.03) compared to tumors with disrupted E2. In addition, high E7 expression was associated with lower risk of loco-regional recurrence (p = 0.004) as was high E6 expression (p = 0.006). In summary, an intact E2 gene is more common in HPV16 positive oropharyngeal than non-oropharyngeal carcinomas; the presence of an intact E2 gene is associated with higher HPV viral load, higher viral oncogene expression, and improved clinical outcome compared to patients with a disrupted E2 gene in oropharyngeal cancer."

Accurate estimation of the carbon stock of Moso bamboo forest can contribute to sufficient evaluation of forests in carbon sequestration worldwide. Nevertheless, the effect of latitude on the carbon stock of Moso bamboo remains unclear. In this study, a field survey with 36 plots of Moso bamboo forests along a latitude gradient was conducted to investigate carbon stock. Results showed that the diameter at breast height (DBH) of Moso bamboo culms increased from 8.37 cm to 10.12 cm that well fitted by Weibull model, whereas the bamboo culm density decreased from 4722 culm ha-1 to 3400 culm ha-1 with increasing latitude. The bamboo biomass carbon decreased from 60.58 Mg C ha-1 to 48.31 Mg C ha-1 from north to south. The total carbon stock of Moso bamboo forests, which comprises soil and biomass carbon, ranged from 87.83 Mg C ha-1 to 119.5 Mg C ha-1 and linearly increased with latitude. As a fast-growing plant, Moso bamboo could be harvested amounts of 6.0 Mg C ha-1 to 7.6 Mg C ha-1 annually, which indicates a high potential of this species for carbon sequestration. Parameters obtained in this study can be used to accurately estimate the carbon stock of Moso bamboo forest to establish models of the global carbon balance."

However, this may lead to under-diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis, as the disease may present itself with genital symptoms in the absence of ova in the urine. Currently there is no single reliable and affordable diagnostic method to diagnose the full spectrum of urogenital S. haematobium infection. In this study we explore the classic indicators in the diagnosis of urogenital S. haematobium infection, with focus on young women.In a cross-sectional study of 1237 sexually active young women in rural South Africa, we assessed four diagnostic indicators of urogenital S. haematobium infection: microscopy of urine, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL), urogenital symptoms, and sandy patches detected clinically in combination with computerised image analysis of photocolposcopic images. We estimated the accuracy of these diagnostic indicators through the following analyses: 1) cross tabulation (assumed empirical gold standard) of the tests against the combined findings of sandy patches and/or computerized image analysis and 2) a latent class model of the four indicators without assuming any gold standard.The empirical approach showed that urine microscopy had a sensitivity of 34.7% and specificity of 75.2% while the latent class analysis approach (LCA) suggested a sensitivity of 81.0% and specificity of 85.6%. The empirical approach and LCA showed that Schistosoma PCR in CVL had low sensitivity (14.1% and 52.4%, respectively) and high specificity (93.0% and 98.0, respectively). Using LCA, the presence of sandy patches showed a sensitivity of 81.6 and specificity of 42.4%. The empirical approach and LCA showed that urogenital symptoms had a high sensitivity (89.4% and 100.0%, respectively), whereas specificity was low (10.6% and 12.3%, respectively).All the diagnostic indicators used in the study had limited accuracy. Using urine microscopy or Schistosoma PCR in CVL would only confirm a fraction of the sandy patches found by colposcopic examination."

This study was aimed to clarify the clinical and genetic features of HMDs in Chinese population. Methods 119 patients with hypomyelinating disorders in Chinese population were enrolled and evaluated based on their history, clinical manifestation, laboratory examinations, series of brain MRI with follow-up, genetic etiological tests including chromosomal analysis, multiplex ligation probe amplification, Sanger sequencing, targeted enrichment-based next-generation sequencing and whole exome sequencing. Results Clinical and genetic features of hypomyelinating disorders were revealed. Nine different hypomyelinating disorders were identified in 119 patients: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (94, 79%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (10, 8%), hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (3, 3%), GM1 gangliosidosis (5, 4%), GM2 gangliosidosis (3, 3%), trichothiodystrophy (1, 1%), Pol III-related leukodystrophy (1, 1%), hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 9 (1, 1%), and chromosome 18q deletion syndrome (1, 1%). Of the sample, 94% (112/119) of the patients were genetically diagnosed, including 111 with mutations distributing across 9 genes including PLP1, GJC2, TUBB4A, GLB1, HEXA, HEXB, ERCC2, POLR3A, and RARS and 1 with mosaic chromosomal change of 46, XX,del(18)(q21.3)/46,XX,r(18)(p11.32q21.3)/45,XX,-18. Eighteen novel mutations were discovered. Mutations in POLR3A and RARS were first identified in Chinese patients with Pol III-related leukodystrophy and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, respectively. Significance This is the first report on clinical and genetic features of hypomyelinating disorders with a large sample of patients in Chinese population, identifying 18 novel mutations especially mutations in POLR3A and RARS in Chinese patients, expanding clinical and genetic spectrums of hypomyelinating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2788811666,"Arthropod community composition in agricultural landscapes is dependent on habitat characteristics, such as plant composition, landscape homogeneity and the presence of key resources, which are usually absent in monocultures. Manipulating agroecosystems through the insertion of in-field floral resources is a useful technique to reduce the deleterious effects of habitat simplification. Food web analysis can clarify how the community reacts to the presence of floral resources which favour ecosystem services such as biological control of pest species. Here, we reported quantitative and qualitative alterations in arthropod food web complexity due to the presence of floral resources from the Mexican marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) in a field scale lettuce community network. The presence of marigold flowers in the field successfully increased richness, body size, and the numerical and biomass abundance of natural enemies in the lettuce arthropod community, which affected the number of links, vulnerability, generality, omnivory rate and food chain length in the community, which are key factors for the stability of relationships between species. Our results reinforce the notion that diversification through insertion of floral resources may assist in preventing pest outbreaks in agroecosystems. This community approach to arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes can be used in the future to predict the effect of different management practices in the food web to contribute with a more sustainable management of arthropod pest species."

This movement is accompanied by shifting of mRNA–tRNA complexes within the ribosome in a process called translocation. In living cells, this process proceeds in a unidirectional manner, bringing the ribosome to the 3′ end of mRNA, and is catalyzed by the GTPase translation elongation factor 2 (EF-G in prokaryotes and eEF2 in eukaryotes). Interestingly, the possibility of spontaneous backward translocation has been shown in vitro for bacterial ribosomes, suggesting a potential reversibility of this reaction. However, this possibility has not yet been tested for eukaryotic ribosomes. Here, using a reconstituted mammalian translation system, we show that the eukaryotic elongation factor eEF2 catalyzes ribosomal reverse translocation at one mRNA triplet. We found that this process requires a cognate tRNA in the ribosomal E-site and cannot occur spontaneously without eEF2. The efficiency of this reaction depended on the concentrations of eEF2 and cognate tRNAs and increased in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues. Of note, ADP-ribosylation of eEF2 domain IV blocked reverse translocation, suggesting a crucial role of interactions of this domain with the ribosome for the catalysis of the reaction. In summary, our findings indicate that eEF2 is able to induce ribosomal translocation in forward and backward directions, highlighting the universal mechanism of tRNA–mRNA movements within the ribosome.

https://openalex.org/W2788080516,"Voluntary participation, as an additional strategy involved in repeated games, has been proved to be an efficient way to promote the evolution of cooperation theoretically and empirically. Besides, current studies show that the coevolution of teaching activity can promote cooperation. Thus, inspired by aforementioned above, we investigate the effect of coevolution of teaching activity on the evolution of cooperation for prisoner's dilemma game with voluntary participation: when the focal player successfully enforces its strategy on the opponent, his teaching ability will get an increase. Through numerical simulation, we have shown that voluntary participation could effectively promote the fraction of cooperation, which is also affected by the value of increment. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the increment value on the density of different strategies and find that there exists an optimal increment value that plays an utmost role on the evolutionary dynamics. With regard to this observation, we unveil that an optimal value of increment can lead to strongest heterogeneity in agents' teaching ability, further promoting the evolution of cooperation."

Contrary to coding genes however, which can be functionally knocked out by frame-shift mutagenesis, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) gene knockouts have remained challenging. Here we present a universal ncRNA knockout approach guided by epigenetic hallmarks, which enables robust gene silencing even in provisionally annotated gene loci. We build on previous work reporting the presence of overlapping histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites around the transcriptional start sites of most genes. We demonstrate that excision of this gene-proximal signature leads to loss of microRNA and lincRNA transcription and reveals ncRNA phenotypes. Exemplarily we demonstrate silencing of the constitutively transcribed MALAT1 lincRNA gene as well as of the inducible miR-146a and miR-155 genes in human monocytes. Our results validate a role of miR-146a and miR-155 in negative feedback control of the activity of inflammation master-regulator NFκB and suggest that cell-cycle control is a unique feature of miR-155. We suggest that our epigenetically guided CRISPR approach may improve existing ncRNA knockout strategies and contribute to the development of high-confidence ncRNA phenotyping applications."
https://openalex.org/W2785815164,"Cornus officinalis is one of the most widely used medicinal plants in China and other East Asian countries to cure diseases such as liver, kidney, cardiovascular diseases and frequent urination for thousands of years. It is a Level 3 protected species, and is one of the 42 national key protected wild species of animals and plants in China. However, the genetics and molecular biology of C. officinalis are poorly understood, which has hindered research on the molecular mechanism of its metabolism and utilization. Hence, enriching its genomic data and information is very important. In recent years, the fast-growing technology of next generation sequencing has provided an effective path to gain genomic information from nonmodel species. This study is the first to explore the leaf and fruit tissue transcriptome of C. officinalis using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. A total of 57,954,134 and 60,971,652 clean reads from leaf and fruit were acquired, respectively (GenBank number SRP115440). The pooled reads from all two libraries were assembled into 56,392 unigenes with an average length 856 bp. Among these, 41,146 unigenes matched with sequences in the NCBI nonredundant protein database. The Gene Ontology database assigned 24,336 unigenes with biological process (83.26%), cellular components (53.58%), and molecular function (83.93%). In addition, 10,808 unigenes were assigned a KOG functional classification by the KOG database. Searching against the KEGG pathway database indicated that 18,435 unigenes were mapped to 371 KEGG pathways. Moreover, the edgeR database identified 4,585 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1,392 were up-regulated and 3,193 were down-regulated in fruit tissue compared with leaf tissue. Finally, we explored 581 transcription factors with 50 transcription factor gene families. Most DEGs and transcription factors were related to terpene biosynthesis and secondary metabolic regulation. This study not only represented the first de novo transcriptomic analysis of C. officinalis but also provided fundamental information on its genes and biosynthetic pathway. These findings will help us explore the molecular metabolism mechanism of terpene biosynthesis in C. officinalis."

We aimed to evaluate public awareness and attitude regarding PM. Methods We performed a self-administered questionnaire survey to 703 adults, who participated in the survey on a voluntary basis. The primary outcome measures included public knowledge, attitude, and acceptance of PM. We conducted multinomial multivariate logistic analysis for outcome variables with three response categories and performed multivariate logistic regression analyses for dichotomous outcome variables. Results Only 28% of participants had knowledge that genetic factors can contribute to inter-individual variations in drug response and the definition of PM (199 out of 702). Higher family income was correlated with greater knowledge concerning PM (OR = 3.76, p = 0.034). A majority of respondents preferred integrated pharmacogenomic testing over drug-specific testing and agreed to inclusion of pharmacogenomic testing in the national health examination (64% and 77%, respectively), but only 51% were willing to pay for it. Discussion Our results identify the urgent need for public education as well as the potential health disparities in access to PM. This study helps to frame policies for implementing PM in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2787505488,"Despite of multitude investigations no reliable prognostic immunohistochemical biomarkers in GIST have been established so far with added value to predict the recurrence risk of high risk GIST besides mitotic count, primary location and size. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic relevance of eight cell cycle and apoptosis modulators and of TP53 mutations for prognosis in GIST with high risk of recurrence prior to adjuvant treatment with imatinib. In total, 400 patients with high risk for GIST recurrence were randomly assigned for adjuvant imatinib either for one or for three years following laparotomy. 320 primary tumor samples with available tumor tissue were immunohistochemically analyzed prior to treatment for the expression of cell cycle regulators and apoptosis modulators cyclin D1, p21, p16, CDK4, E2F1, MDM2, p53 and p-RB1. TP53 mutational analysis was possible in 245 cases. A high expression of CDK4 was observed in 32.8% of all cases and was associated with a favorable recurrence free survival (RFS), whereas high expression of MDM2 (12.2%) or p53 (35.3%) was associated with a shorter RFS. These results were independent from the primary KIT or PDGFRA mutation. In GISTs with higher mitotic counts was a significantly increased expression of cyclin D1, p53 and E2F1. The expression of p16 and E2F1 significantly correlated to a non-gastric localization. Furthermore, we observed a significant higher expression of p21 and E2F1 in KIT mutant GISTs compared to PDGFRA mutant and wt GISTs. The overall frequency of TP53 mutations was low (n = 8; 3.5%) and could not be predicted by the immunohistochemical expression of p53. In summary, mutation analysis in TP53 plays a minor role in the subgroup of high-risk GIST before adjuvant treatment with imatinib. Strong expression of MDM2 and p53 correlated with a shorter recurrence free survival, whereas a strong expression of CDK4 correlated to a better recurrence free survival."
https://openalex.org/W2793646324,"Development and fitness of any organism rely on properly controlled gene expression. This is especially true for plants, as their development is determined by both internal and external cues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are embedded in the genetic cascades that integrate and translate those cues into developmental programs. miRNAs negatively regulate their target genes mainly post-transcriptionally through two co-existing mechanisms; mRNA cleavage and translational inhibition. Despite our increasing knowledge about the genetic and biochemical processes involved in those concurrent mechanisms, little is known about their relative contributions to the overall miRNA-mediated regulation. Here we show that co-existence of cleavage and translational inhibition is dependent on growth temperature and developmental stage. We found that efficiency of an artificial miRNA-mediated (amiRNA) gene silencing declines with age during vegetative development in a temperature-dependent manner. That decline is mainly due to a reduction on the contribution from translational inhibition. Both, temperature and developmental stage were also found to affect mature amiRNA accumulation and the expression patterns of the core players involved in miRNA biogenesis and action. Therefore, that suggests that each miRNA family specifically regulates their respective targets, while temperature and growth might influence the performance of miRNA-dependent regulation in a more general way."
https://openalex.org/W2793753569,"Phenazines are bacterial secondary metabolites and play important roles in the antagonistic activity of the biological control strain P. chlororaphis 30-84 against take-all disease of wheat. The expression of the P. chlororaphis 30-84 phenazine biosynthetic operon (phzXYFABCD) is dependent on the PhzR/PhzI quorum sensing system located immediately upstream of the biosynthetic operon as well as other regulatory systems including Gac/Rsm. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence between the divergently oriented phzR and phzX promoters identified features within the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of phzX that are conserved only among 2OHPCA producing Pseudomonas. The conserved sequence features are potentially capable of producing secondary structures that negatively modulate one or both promoters. Transcriptional and translational fusion assays revealed that deletion of 90-bp of sequence at the 5'-UTR of phzX led to up to 4-fold greater expression of the reporters with the deletion compared to the controls, which indicated this sequence negatively modulates phenazine gene expression both transcriptionally and translationally. This 90-bp sequence was deleted from the P. chlororaphis 30-84 chromosome, resulting in 30-84Enh, which produces significantly more phenazine than the wild-type while retaining quorum sensing control. The transcriptional expression of phzR/phzI and amount of AHL signal produced by 30-84Enh also were significantly greater than for the wild-type, suggesting this 90-bp sequence also negatively affects expression of the quorum sensing genes. In addition, deletion of the 90-bp partially relieved RsmE-mediated translational repression, indicating a role for Gac/RsmE interaction. Compared to the wild-type, enhanced phenazine production by 30-84Enh resulted in improvement in fungal inhibition, biofilm formation, extracellular DNA release and suppression of take-all disease of wheat in soil without negative consequences on growth or rhizosphere persistence. This work provides greater insight into the regulation of phenazine biosynthesis with potential applications for improved biological control."
https://openalex.org/W2786367701,"Angiotensin II (Ang-II)-induced hypertension is associated with accelerated thrombus formation in arterioles and leukocyte recruitment in venules. The mechanisms that underlie the prothrombotic and proinflammatory responses to chronic Ang-II administration remain poorly understood. We evaluated the role of CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) signaling in Ang-II-mediated microvascular responses and assessed whether and how soluble CD40L (sCD40L) contributes to this response. Intravital video microscopy was performed to analyze leukocyte recruitment and dihydrorhodamine-123 oxidation in postcapillary venules. Thrombus formation in cremaster muscle arterioles was induced by using the light/dye endothelial cell injury model. Wild-type (WT), CD40-/-, and CD40L-/- mice received Ang-II for 14 d via osmotic minipumps. Some mice were treated with either recombinant sCD40L or the VLA5 (very late antigen 5; α5β1) antagonist, ATN-161. Our results demonstrate that CD40-/-, CD40L-/-, and WT mice that were treated with ATN-161 were protected against the thrombotic and inflammatory effects of Ang-II infusion. Infusion of sCD40L into CD40-/- or CD40L-/- mice restored the prothrombotic effect of Ang-II infusion. Mice that were treated with ATN-161 and infused with sCD40L were protected against accelerated thrombosis. Collectively, these novel findings suggest that the mechanisms that underlie Ang-II-dependent thrombotic and inflammatory responses link to the signaling of CD40L via both CD40 and VLA5.-Senchenkova, E.

However, its functions in the nervous system remain largely unclear. We explored the important role of SPNS2 in the process of retinal morphogenesis using a spns2-deficient rat model. In the absence of the functional SPNS2 transporter, we observed progressively aggravating laminar disorganization of the epithelium at the postnatal stage of retinal development. Disrupted cell polarity, delayed cell-cycle exit of retinal progenitor cells, and insufficient migration of newborn neurons were proposed in this study as potential mechanisms accounting for this structural disorder. In addition, we analyzed the expression profiles of spns2 and s1prs, and proposed that SPNS2 regulated retinal morphogenesis by establishing the S1P level in the eye and activating S1PR3 signaling. These data indicate that SPNS2 is indispensable for normal retinal morphogenesis and provide new insights on the role of S1P in the developing retina using an established in vivo model.—Fang, C., Bian, G., Ren, P., Xiang, J., Song, J., Yu, C., Zhang, Q., Liu, L., Chen, K., Liu, F., Zhang, K., Wu, C., Sun, R., Hu, D., Ju, G., Wang, J.

Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) in the diabetic Groups. After 30 days, HBO was performed every 48h in HBO groups and all animals were euthanized 60 days after diabetic induction. The femur was submitted to a biomechanical (maximum strength, energy-to-failure and stiffness) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analyses (crosslink ratio, crystallinity index, matrix-to-mineral ratio: Amide I + II/Hydroxyapatite (M:MI) and Amide III + Collagen/HA (M:MIII)).In biomechanical analysis, diabetic animals showed lower values of maximum strength, energy and stiffness than non-diabetic animals. However, structural strength and stiffness were increased in groups with HBO compared with non-HBO. ATR-FTIR analysis showed decreased collagen maturity in the ratio of crosslink peaks in diabetic compared with the other groups. The bone from the diabetic groups showed decreased crystallinity compared with non-diabetic groups. M:MI showed no statistical difference between groups. However, M:MIII showed an increased matrix mineral ratio in diabetic+HBO and control+HBO compared with control and diabetic groups. Correlations between mechanical and ATR-FTIR analyses showed significant positive correlation between collagen maturity and stiffness.Diabetes decreased collagen maturation and the mineral deposition process, thus reducing biomechanical properties. Moreover, the study showed that HBO improved crosslink maturation and increased maximum strength and stiffness in the femur of T1DM animals."
https://openalex.org/W2793900474,"Background Local timber is still one of the main sources of work and income for mountain communities. However, illegal logging is a major cause of deforestation in many countries and has significant impacts on local communities and biodiversity. Techniques for tracing timber would provide a useful tool to protect local timber industries and contribute to the fight against illegal logging. Although considerable progress has been made in food traceability, timber provenance is still a somewhat neglected research area. Stable isotope ratios in plants are known to reflect geographical variations. This study reports accurate spatial distribution of δ18O and δ2H in timber from north-eastern Italy (Trentino) in order to trace geographical origin. Methodology and principal findings We tested the accuracy of four kriging methods using an annual resolution of δ18O and δ2H measured in Picea abies. Pearson’s correlation coefficients revealed altitude to be the most appropriate covariate for the cokriging model, which has ultimately proved to be the best method due to its low estimation error. Conclusions We present regional maps of interpolated δ18O and δ2H in Picea abies wood together with the 95% confidence intervals. The strong spatial structure of the data demonstrates the potential of multivariate spatial interpolation, even in a highly heterogeneous area such as the Alps. We believe that this geospatial approach can be successfully applied on a wider scale in order to combat illegal logging."
https://openalex.org/W2949369933,"Verticillium dahliae infection of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a major cause of disease-induced wilting in soil-grown strawberries across the world. To understand what components of the pathogen are affecting disease expression, the presence of the known effector VdAve1 was screened in a sample of Verticillium dahliae isolates. Isolates from strawberry were found to contain VdAve1 and were divided into two major clades, based upon their vegetative compatibility groups (VCG); no UK strawberry isolates contained VdAve1. VC clade was strongly related to their virulence levels. VdAve1-containing isolates pathogenic on strawberry were found in both clades, in contrast to some recently published findings. On strawberry, VdAve1-containing isolates had significantly higher virulence during early infection, which diminished in significance as the infection progressed. Transformation of a virulent non-VdAve1 containing isolate, with VdAve1 was found neither to increase nor decrease virulence when inoculated on a susceptible strawberry cultivar. There are therefore virulence factors that are epistatic to VdAve1 and potentially multiple independent routes to high virulence on strawberry in V. dahliae lineages. Genome sequencing a subset of isolates across the two VCGs revealed that isolates were differentiated at the whole genome level and contained multiple changes in putative effector content, indicating that different clonal VCGs may have evolved different strategies for infecting strawberry, leading to different virulence levels in pathogenicity tests. It is therefore important to consider both clonal lineage and effector complement as the adaptive potential of each lineage will differ, even if they contain the same race determining effector."

The primary cilium, a mechanosensory organelle, is postulated to regulate this mRNA response. The aim of this study is to reveal the transcriptome changes of tubular epithelia in response to fluid flow and determine the role of primary cilia in this process. Inner-medullary collecting duct (CD) cells were subjected to either static or physiologically relevant fluid flow (∼0.6 dyn/cm2). RNA-sequencing analysis of ciliated cells subjected to fluid flow showed up-regulation of 1379 genes and down-regulation of 1294 genes compared with static control cells. Strikingly, only 54 of these genes were identified as gene candidates sensitive to primary cilia sensing of fluid flow, of which 16 were linked to ion or water transport pathways in the CD. Validation by quantitative real-time PCR revealed that only the expression of transferrin receptor, which is involved in iron transport; and tribbles pseudokinase 3, which is involved in insulin signaling, were unequivocally regulated by primary cilia sensing of fluid flow. This study shows that the involvement of primary cilia in ion transport in the collecting duct is exceptionally specific.-Mohammed, S. G., Arjona, F. J., Verschuren, E. H.

Here, we performed NGS of genes related to pancreatic cancer (comprising 2.8 kb of genomic DNA) in plasma DNA (average 4.5 ng) using molecular barcodes. The average number of sequenced molecules was 900, and the sequencing depth per molecule was 100 or more. We also developed a bioinformatic variant filter, called CV78, to remove variants that were not considered to be tumor-specific, i.e., those that are either absent or occur at low frequencies in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. In a cohort comprising 57 pancreatic cancer patients and 12 healthy individuals, sequencing initially identified variants in 31 (54%) and 5 (42%), respectively, whereas after applying the CV78 filter, 19 (33%) and zero were variant-positive. In a validation cohort consisting of 86 patients with pancreatic cancer and 20 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), 62 (72%) with pancreatic cancer patients and 10 (50%) IPMN patients were initially variant positive. After CV78 filtering, these values were reduced to 32 (37%) and 1 (5%), respectively. The variant allele frequency of filtered variants in plasma ranged from 0.25% to 76.1%.

https://openalex.org/W2792587557,"The expansion of international trade in commodities increases the risk of alien species invasions. Invaders are difficult to detect on introduction, so prevention remains the preferred strategy for managing the threat of invasions. Propagule pressure has been shown to be a good predictor of invasion risk. Most studies to date, however, link potential invasive species arrivals with indirect measures of propagule pressure such as aggregate trade volumes. This paper estimates propagule pressure using data that measure actual arrivals. Specifically, it uses inspection data that covers almost all U.S. fruit and vegetable imports from 2005–2014 to estimate a logit model of the probability of potential invasive species arrival and expected propagule frequencies for 2,240 commodity/country of origin combinations. Clear patterns in the geographic origin and commodity pathways for potential pests are identified. The average probability of arrival is low, approximately 0.03, but is two to ten times higher for some commodities, most notably herbs. We identify commodities with a high number of expected arrivals due to either a large volume of trade, high interception rates, or a combination of both. Seven of the top ten countries of origin for propagule frequency are from the Western Hemisphere and further trade liberalization within the Western Hemisphere is likely to heighten challenges to enforcement of US phytosanitary standards. Patterns in the data can help identify the commodities and countries of origin in greatest need of technical assistance and guide targeting of surveillance for the pathways of greatest phytosanitary concern."

Regarding non-cognitive skills, we report suggestive evidence for many of our measured preferences. We used two alternative measures of time preference: patience and present bias. Present bias explains exam grades better, while patience explains GPA relatively better. Both measures of time preferences have a non-linear relation to school performance. Competitiveness matters, as students, who opt for a more competitive payment scheme in our experimental task have a higher average GPA. We observe also that risk-averse students perform a little better than more risk-tolerant students. That makes sense in case of multiple choice exams, because more risk-tolerant students may want to try to pass the exam less prepared, as the possibility of passing an exam just by chance is not zero. Finally, we have also detected that cooperative preferences-the amount of money offered in a public good game-associates strongly with GPA in a non-linear way. Students who offered around half of their possible amounts had significantly higher GPAs than those, who offered none or all their money."
https://openalex.org/W2786419925,"There is a major gap in funding required for conservation, especially in low income countries. Given the significant contribution of taxpayers in industrialized countries to funding conservation overseas, and donations from membership organisation, understanding the preferences of ordinary people in a high income country for different attributes of conservation projects is valuable for future marketing of conservation. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with visitors to a UK zoo, while simultaneously conducting a revealed preference study through a real donation campaign on the same sample. Respondents showed the highest willingness to pay for projects that have local community involvement in management (95% confidence interval £9.82 to £15.83), and for improvement in threatened species populations (£2.97 - £13.87). Both of these were significantly larger than the willingness to pay for projects involving provision of alternative livelihoods, or improving the condition of conservation sites. Results of the simultaneous donation campaign showed that respondents were very willing to donate the suggested £1 or above donation (88% made a donation, n = 1798); there was no effect of which of the two campaigns they were exposed to (threatened species management or community involvement in management). The small number of people who did not make a donation had a higher stated willingness to pay within the choice experiment, which may suggest hypothetical bias. Conservationists increasingly argue that conservation should include local communities in management (for both pragmatic and moral reasons). It is heartening that potential conservation donors seem to agree."
https://openalex.org/W2788706468,"Background Nearly a quarter of a million children have acquired HIV, prompting the implementation of new protocols—Option B and B+—for treating HIV+ pregnant women. While efficacy has been demonstrated in randomized trials, there is limited real-world evidence on the impact of these changes. Using longitudinal, routinely collected data we assessed the impact of the adoption of WHO Option B in Rwanda on mother to infant transmission. Methods We used interrupted time series analysis to evaluate the impact of Option B on mother-to-child HIV transmission in Rwanda. Our primary outcome was the proportion of HIV tests in infants with positive results at six weeks of age. We included data for 20 months before and 22 months after the 2010 policy change. Results Of the 15,830 HIV tests conducted during our study period, 392 tested positive. We found a significant decrease in both the level (-2.08 positive tests per 100 tests conducted, 95% CI: -2.71 to -1.45, p < 0.001) and trend (-0.11 positive tests per 100 tests conducted per month, 95% CI: -0.16 to -0.07, p < 0.001) of test positivity. This represents an estimated 297 fewer children born without HIV in the post-policy period or a 46% reduction in HIV transmission from mother to child. Conclusions The adoption of Option B in Rwanda contributed to an immediate decrease in the rate of HIV transmission from mother to child. This suggests other countries may benefit from adopting these WHO guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2793747110,"We assessed the relative importance of dispersal limitation, environmental heterogeneity and their joint effects as determinants of the spatial patterns of 229 species in the moist tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We differentiated five types of species according to their dispersal syndrome; autochorous, anemochorous, and zoochorous species with small, medium-size and large fruits. We characterized the spatial patterns of each species and we checked whether they were best fitted by Inhomogeneous Poisson (IPP), Homogeneous Poisson cluster (HPCP) and Inhomogeneous Poisson cluster processes (IPCP) by means of the Akaike Information Criterion. We also assessed the influence of species’ dispersal mode in the average cluster size. We found that 63% of the species were best fitted by IPCP regardless of their dispersal syndrome, although anemochorous species were best described by HPCP. Our results indicate that spatial patterns of tree species in this forest cannot be explained only by dispersal limitation, but by the joint effects of dispersal limitation and environmental heterogeneity. The absence of relationships between dispersal mode and degree of clustering suggests that several processes modify the original spatial pattern generated by seed dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of fitting point process models with a different biological meaning when studying the main determinants of spatial structure in plant communities."
https://openalex.org/W2786275138,"In anaesthetic practice the risk of cerebral ischemic/hypoxic damage is thought to be attenuated by deep anaesthesia. The rationale is that deeper anaesthesia reduces cerebral oxygen demand more than light anaesthesia, thereby increasing the tolerance to ischemia or hypoxia. However, evidence to support this is scarce. We thus investigated the influence of light versus deep anaesthesia on the responses of rat brains to a period of hypoxia. In the first experiment we exposed adult male Wistar rats to deep or light propofol anaesthesia and then performed [18F]- Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans to verify the extent of cerebral metabolic suppression. In subsequent experiments, rats were subjected to light/deep propofol anaesthesia and then exposed to a period of hypoxia or ongoing normoxia (n = 9–11 per group). A further 5 rats, not exposed to anaesthesia or hypoxia, served as controls. Four days later a Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test was performed to assess mood and cognition. After another 4 days, the animals were sacrificed for later immunohistochemical analyses of neurogenesis/neuroplasticity (Doublecortin; DCX), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression and neuroinflammation (Ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1; Iba-1) in hippocampal and piriform cortex slices. The hippocampi of rats subjected to hypoxia during light anaesthesia showed lower DCX positivity, and therefore lower neurogenesis, but higher BDNF levels and microglia hyper-ramification. Exploration was reduced, but no significant effect on NOR was observed. In the piriform cortex, higher DCX positivity was observed, associated with neuroplasticity. All these effects were attenuated by deep anaesthesia. Deepening anaesthesia attenuated the brain changes associated with hypoxia. Hypoxia during light anaesthesia had a prolonged effect on the brain, but no impairment in cognitive function was observed. Although reduced hippocampal neurogenesis may be considered unfavourable, higher BDNF expression, associated with microglia hyper-ramification may suggest activation of repair mechanisms. Increased neuroplasticity observed in the piriform cortex supports this, and might reflect a prolonged state of alertness rather than damage."
https://openalex.org/W2786813546,"Although a deficiency of surfactant protein B (SFTPB) has been associated with lung injury, SFTPB expression has not yet been linked with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a potential biomarker of acute lung injury (ALI). The effects of Nampt in the pulmonary epithelial cell on both SFTPB expression and lung inflammation were investigated in a LPS-induced ALI mouse model. Pulmonary epithelial cell-specific knockdown of Nampt gene expression, achieved by the crossing of Nampt gene exon 2 floxed mice with mice expressing epithelial-specific transgene Cre or by the use of epithelial-specific expression of anti-Nampt antibody cDNA, significantly attenuated LPS-induced ALI. Knockdown of Nampt expression was accompanied by lower levels of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil infiltrates, total protein and TNF-α levels, as well as lower lung injury scores. Notably, Nampt knockdown was also associated with significantly increased BAL SFTPB levels relative to the wild-type control mice. Down-regulation of NAMPT increased the expression of SFTPB and rescued TNF-α-induced inhibition of SFTPB, whereas overexpression of NAMPT inhibited SFTPB expression in both H441 and A549 cells. Inhibition of NAMPT up-regulated SFTPB expression by enhancing histone acetylation to increase its transcription. Additional data indicated that these effects were mainly mediated by NAMPT nonenzymatic function via the JNK pathway. This study shows that pulmonary epithelial cell-specific knockdown of NAMPT expression attenuated ALI, in part, via up-regulation of SFTPB expression. Thus, epithelial cell-specific knockdown of Nampt may be a potential new and viable therapeutic modality to ALI.—Bi, G., Wu, L., Huang, P., Islam, S., Heruth, D.P., Zhang, L.

https://openalex.org/W2788598996,"Spinal plasticity is thought to contribute to sensorimotor recovery of limb function in several neurological disorders and can be experimentally induced in animals and humans using different stimulation protocols. In healthy individuals, electrical continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) of the median nerve has been shown to change spinal motoneuron excitability in the cervical spinal cord as indexed by a change in mean H-reflex amplitude in the flexor carpi radialis muscle. It is unknown whether continuous TBS of a peripheral nerve can also shift motoneuron excitability in the lower limb. In 26 healthy subjects, we examined the effects of electrical TBS given to the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa on the excitability of lumbar spinal motoneurons as measured by H-reflex amplitude of the soleus muscle evoked by tibial nerve stimulation. Continuous TBS was given at 110% of H-reflex threshold intensity and compared to non-patterned regular electrical stimulation at 15 Hz. To disclose any pain-induced effects, we also tested the effects of TBS at individual sensory threshold. Moreover, in a subgroup of subjects we evaluated paired-pulse inhibition of H-reflex. Continuous TBS at 110% of H-reflex threshold intensity induced a short-term reduction of H-reflex amplitude. The other stimulation conditions produced no after effects. Paired-pulse H-reflex inhibition was not modulated by continuous TBS or non-patterned repetitive stimulation at 15 Hz. An effect of pain on the results obtained was discarded, since non-patterned 15 Hz stimulation at 110% HT led to pain scores similar to those induced by EcTBS at 110% HT, but was not able to induce any modulation of the H reflex amplitude. Together, the results provide first time evidence that peripheral continuous TBS induces a short-lasting change in the excitability of spinal motoneurons in lower limb circuitries. Future studies need to investigate how the TBS protocol can be optimized to produce a larger and longer effect on spinal cord physiology and whether this might be a useful intervention in patients with excessive excitability of the spinal motorneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2789279506,"Background Post abortion complications are the third leading cause of maternal death after hemorrhage and hypertension in Botswana where abortion is not legalized. This study aimed at assessing the management of post abortion complications in Botswana. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at four hospitals in Botswana in 2014. Socio-demographic, patient management and outcomes data were extracted from patients’ medical records. Descriptive statistics and chi-square test were used to analyze and present the data. Result A total of 619 patients’ medical records were reviewed. The duration of hospital stay prior to uterine evacuation ranged from less than an hour to 480 hours. All the patients received either prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics. Use of parenteral antibiotics was significantly associated with severity of abortion, second trimester abortion, use of blood products and the interval between management’s decision and uterine evacuation. Uterine evacuation for retained products of conception was achieved by metallic curettage among 516 (83.4%) patients and by vacuum aspiration in 18 (2.9%). At all the study sites, Misoprostol or Oxytocin were used concurrently with surgical evacuation of the uterus. None use of analgesics or anesthetics in the four hospitals ranged between 12.4% to 28.8%. Conclusion There is evidence of delayed patient care and prolonged hospital stay. Metallic curette was the primary method used for uterine evacuation across all the facilities. Pain management and antibiotics use was not standardized. A protocol has to be developed with the aim of standardizing post abortion care."
https://openalex.org/W2786565774,"Bacillithiol is a low molecular weight thiol found in Firmicutes that is analogous to glutathione, which is absent in these bacteria. Bacillithiol transferases catalyze the transfer of bacillithiol to various substrates. The S-transferase-like (STL) superfamily contains over 30,000 putative members, including bacillithiol transferases. Proteins in this family are extremely divergent and are related by structural rather than sequence similarity, leaving it unclear if all share the same biochemical activity. Bacillus subtilis encodes eight predicted STL superfamily members, only one of which has been shown to be a bacillithiol transferase. Here we find that the seven remaining proteins show varying levels of metal dependent bacillithiol transferase activity. We have renamed the eight enzymes BstA-H. Mass spectrometry and gene expression studies revealed that all of the enzymes are produced to varying levels during growth and sporulation, with BstB and BstE being the most abundant and BstF and BstH being the least abundant. Interestingly, several bacillithiol transferases are induced in the mother cell during sporulation. A strain lacking all eight bacillithiol transferases showed normal growth in the presence of stressors that adversely affect growth of bacillithiol-deficient strains, such as paraquat and CdCl2. Thus, the STL bacillithiol transferases represent a new group of proteins that play currently unknown, but potentially significant roles in bacillithiol-dependent reactions. We conclude that these enzymes are highly divergent, perhaps to cope with an equally diverse array of endogenous or exogenous toxic metabolites and oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2792201723,"Objectives In this replication-and-extension study, we tested whether depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and allostatic load (multisystem physiological dysregulation) were related to lower baseline cognitive ability and greater subsequent cognitive decline in older adults, and whether these relationships were moderated by the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. We also tested whether allostatic load mediated the relationships between neuroticism and cognitive outcomes. Methods We used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n at Waves 1–3: 1,028 [M age = 69.5 y]; 820 [M duration since Wave 1 = 2.98 y]; 659 [M duration since Wave 1 = 6.74 y]). We fitted latent growth curve models of general cognitive ability (modeled using five cognitive tests) with groups of APOE E4 non-carriers and carriers. In separate models, depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and allostatic load predicted baseline cognitive ability and subsequent cognitive decline. In addition, models tested whether allostatic load mediated relationships between neuroticism and cognitive outcomes. Results Baseline cognitive ability had small-to-moderate negative associations with depressive symptoms (β range = -0.20 to -0.17), neuroticism (β range = -0.27 to -0.23), and allostatic load (β range = -0.11 to 0.09). Greater cognitive decline was linked to baseline allostatic load (β range = -0.98 to -0.83) and depressive symptoms (β range = -1.00 to -0.88). However, APOE E4 allele possession did not moderate the relationships of depressive symptoms, neuroticism and allostatic load with cognitive ability and cognitive decline. Additionally, the associations of neuroticism with cognitive ability and cognitive decline were not mediated through allostatic load. Conclusions Our results suggest that APOE E4 status does not moderate the relationships of depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and allostatic load with cognitive ability and cognitive decline in healthy older adults. The most notable positive finding in the current research was the strong association between allostatic load and cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2786127385,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in a RecQ-family DNA helicase (WRN). Mice lacking part of the helicase domain of the WRN ortholog exhibit several phenotypic features of WS. In this study, we generated a Wrn mutant line that, like humans, relies entirely on dietary sources of vitamin C (ascorbate) to survive, by crossing them to mice that lack the gulonolactone oxidase enzyme required for ascorbate synthesis. In the presence of 0.01% ascorbate (w/v) in drinking water, double-mutant mice exhibited a severe reduction in lifespan, small size, sterility, osteopenia, and metabolic profiles different from wild-type (WT) mice. Although increasing the dose of ascorbate to 0.4% improved dramatically the phenotypes of double-mutant mice, the metabolic and cytokine profiles were different from age-matched WT mice. Finally, double-mutant mice treated with 0.01% ascorbate revealed a permanent activation of all the 3 branches of the ER stress response pathways due to a severe chronic oxidative stress in the ER compartment. In addition, markers associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent ER-associated degradation pathway were increased. Augmenting the dose of ascorbate reversed the activation of this pathway to WT levels rendering this pathway a potential therapeutic target in WS.-Aumailley, L., Dubois, M. J., Brennan, T.

https://openalex.org/W2787920955,"Advanced prosthetic foot designs often incorporate mechanisms that adapt to terrain changes in real-time to improve mobility. Early identification of terrain (e.g., cross-slopes) is critical to appropriate adaptation. This study suggests that a simple classifier based on linear discriminant analysis can accurately predict a cross-slope encountered (0°, -15°, 15°) using measurements from the residual limb, primarily from the prosthesis itself. The classifier was trained and tested offline using motion capture and in-pylon sensor data collected during walking trials in mid-swing and early stance. Residual limb kinematics, especially measurements from the foot, shank and ankle, successfully predicted the cross-slope terrain with high accuracy (99%). Although accuracy decreased when predictions were made for test data instead of the training data, the accuracy was still relatively high for one input signal set (>89%) and moderate for three others (>71%). This suggests that classifiers can be designed and generalized to be effective for new conditions and/or subjects. While measurements of shank acceleration and angular velocity from only in-pylon sensors were insufficient to accurately predict the cross-slope terrain, the addition of foot and ankle kinematics from motion capture data allowed accurate terrain prediction. Inversion angular velocity and foot vertical velocity were particularly useful. As in-pylon sensor data and shank kinematics from motion capture appeared interchangeable, combining foot and ankle kinematics from prosthesis-mounted sensors with shank kinematics from in-pylon sensors may provide enough information to accurately predict the terrain."
https://openalex.org/W2789218582,"Human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via vapor intrusion (VI) is an emerging public health concern with notable detrimental impacts on public health. Phytoforensics, plant sampling to semi-quantitatively delineate subsurface contamination, provides a potential non-invasive screening approach to detect VI potential, and plant sampling is effective and also time- and cost-efficient. Existing VI assessment methods are time- and resource-intensive, invasive, and require access into residential and commercial buildings to drill holes through basement slabs to install sampling ports or require substantial equipment to install groundwater or soil vapor sampling outside the home. Tree-core samples collected in 2 days at the PCE Southeast Contamination Site in York, Nebraska were analyzed for tetrachloroethene (PCE) and results demonstrated positive correlations with groundwater, soil, soil-gas, sub-slab, and indoor-air samples collected over a 2-year period. Because tree-core samples were not collocated with other samples, interpolated surfaces of PCE concentrations were estimated so that comparisons could be made between pairs of data. Results indicate moderate to high correlation with average indoor-air and sub-slab PCE concentrations over long periods of time (months to years) to an interpolated tree-core PCE concentration surface, with Spearman's correlation coefficients (ρ) ranging from 0.31 to 0.53 that are comparable to the pairwise correlation between sub-slab and indoor-air PCE concentrations (ρ = 0.55, n = 89). Strong correlations between soil-gas, sub-slab, and indoor-air PCE concentrations and an interpolated tree-core PCE concentration surface indicate that trees are valid indicators of potential VI and human exposure to subsurface environment pollutants. The rapid and non-invasive nature of tree sampling are notable advantages: even with less than 60 trees in the vicinity of the source area, roughly 12 hours of tree-core sampling with minimal equipment at the PCE Southeast Contamination Site was sufficient to delineate vapor intrusion potential in the study area and offered comparable delineation to traditional sub-slab sampling performed at 140 properties over a period of approximately 2 years."
https://openalex.org/W2790288345,"Introduction A regimen with rilpivirine (RPV), abacavir (ABC) and lamivudine (3TC) is simple and may allow the sparing of tenofovir and protease inhibitors. However, data on use of this combination as a strategy of switch are limited. Aims of the study were to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of this regimen. Methods Retrospective study on HIV-1 infected patients followed at the Infectious Disease Department of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, HBsAg-negative, HLA B5701-negative, with no documented resistance to RPV, ABC and 3TC, with HIV-RNA<50 copies/mL who started RPV plus ABC/3TC from March 2013 to September 2015. The primary outcome was durability [no treatment failure (TF)]. Secondary objectives were to evaluate changes in immunological, metabolic and other safety parameters. TF was defined as the occurrence of virological failure (VF, 2 consecutive values >50 copies/mL) or discontinuation of any drug in the regimen for any reason. Patients’ follow-up accrued from the date of RPV plus ABC/3TC initiation to the date of TF (VF or discontinuation of any drug in the regimen) or to the date of last available visit. Time to TF was evaluated by use of the Kaplan-Meier curves. Mixed linear models were applied to evaluate changes in immunological, metabolic and other safety parameters. Results and discussion In this analysis, 100 patients starting RPV plus ABC/3TC were included. By 12, 24 and 36 months after switching to RPV plus ABC/3TC, the proportions of individuals without TF were 88% [95% confidence interval (CI): 79%-93%], 82% (95% CI:73%-89%) and 78% (95% CI:68%-86%), respectively. Time to TF was not significantly influenced by CD4+ nadir (≤200 vs >200 cells/μl; log-rank test: p = 0.311) or pre-ART viral load (<100000 vs ≥100000 copies/mL; log-rank test: p = 0.574) or the type of previous antiretroviral regimen (PI+2NRTIs vs NNRTI+2NRTIs vs Other; log-rank test: p = 0.942). Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years (IQR: 1.9–3.5), 26 subjects discontinued the treatment [10 due to toxicity, 7 for interactions with other drugs, 3 due to cardiovascular risk concern, 2 due to single viral blip, 1 due to VF, 1 for asthma, 1 patient’s decision, 1 due to enrolment in a study protocol]. Conclusions In this retrospective study, long-term use of RPV plus ABC/3TC regimen is effective and safe. Efficacy of this regimen was not found to be affected by low CD4+ nadir or high pre-ART viral load."
https://openalex.org/W2785765387,"Objectives 
Every day 43 children are newly diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, almost 90% of these childhood cancer patients will survive. However, 60–90% of these survivors will experience late effects, health problems that occur months or years after treatment has ended. Late effects could occur as a result of the disease, its treatment, and patient-related factors. The two main objectives of this research are to: 1) Examine the existence of all web-based resources for childhood cancer survivors with acute lymphocytic leukemia which focus on medical and psychological aspects of late effects, and 2) Create an innovative website specifically designed to fill this void.


Materials and methods 
A systematic literature review, followed by input from >20 different organizations, resulted in the creation of LEAP3 AHEAD (Late Effects Awareness for Patients, Physicians and the Public; Advancing Health and Eliminating All Disparities), a multi-dimensional website centering on late effects.


Results 
An extensive review revealed 14 pediatric cancer websites, none of which focused exclusively on late effects. LEAP3 AHEAD is the first interactive website for acute lympocytic leukemia childhood cancer survivors and families, as well as physicians, and the public to: a) increase awareness about risks, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of medical and psychological late effects, b) provide suggestions to successfully reintegrate into schools, careers, and socially, and c) present opportunities including camps, scholarships, and pet therapy programs.


Conclusion 
LEAP3 AHEAD is the first national website to provide a comprehensive, accessible, affordable, and multi-dimensional resource for pediatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, survivors and their families, as well as the public about late effects."
https://openalex.org/W2019734045,"Christoph Irmscher, whose previous writings on Emerson, Audubon, et al., have established him as a keen guide to 19th century American intellectual history, has turned his attention to Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (1802–1873). For openers, I'd say that Irmscher's book is the best biography of an American scientist that I have read: warm and acerb, learned and witty, and always in style. Irmscher captures not only the man but also the era: the age of taxonomy. Irmscher also drops a word or two to the wise: who else would evoke Saul Bellow's “Humboldt's gift” (1975) or Edward Albee's “A Delicate Balance” (1966) in the biography of a fossil limner at Harvard? Son of a pastor in Fribourg, Switzerland, Agassiz received a Ph.D. from Erlangen (1829) and M.D. from Munich (1839). A doctoral publication on ichthyology brought him to Cuvier's fossil archive in Paris, where he also became a long-term protégé of Humboldt's. Returning to Switzerland, he was made professor at Neuchatel and built a career based on glacier mapping, fossil hunting, and fish osteology. By 1846, financial, family, and professional troubles accumulated, and he was grateful to Humboldt for arranging a trans-Atlantic boondoggle in Boston. Agassiz achieved great success as a Lowell lecturer, introducing scientifically illiterate Yankees to Swiss glaciers, tropical fish, and the Great Ice Age. Agassiz never returned to Neuchatel. Irmscher recounts the remarkable story of how—with a little help from his friends—Agassiz gained a Harvard professorship. By luck, pluck, and marriage, Agassiz became the P.T. Barnum (or Dr. Oz) of American science in the middle of the 19th century. He also became the country's leading foe of Darwin. Irmscher poses the critical question: “we love—or at least should try to love—Darwin. But can we love Agassiz?” In warm, empathic accounts, we are introduced to the two exceptional women who did, in fact, love Agassiz. Poor, sad Cecilie Braun, the bride of his youth, was left behind in Europe to die of consumption. Her lovely drawings decorate the biography. Agassiz's second wife, Elizabeth Cabot Cary, later the first president of Radcliffe, brought the Swiss immigrant into the circle of Boston Brahmins; her literary and social skills smoothed many a bump in his career. Irmscher's scholarship examines the taxonomic era that Agassiz ruled, a period when experimental biology had not yet intruded on neat phenomenology. The biography is rich with insight plucked from original letters, apt illustrations, and archival memoirs: Goethe, Lamarck, Cuvier, Haeckel, and Humboldt come up repeatedly. Central to the science is a letter of Darwin's to Agassiz, in which Darwin reports experiments on the self-impregnation of barnacles. He cut the penis off one little hermaphrodite: a “minicastration” that Darwin monitored under the dissecting microscope. “You may laugh at this account,” Darwin wrote Agassiz, but—historically—a sharp line had been drawn. It was the difference between system-building a la Agassiz and the hands-on biology of Darwin. The doyens of the Saturday Club (Emerson, Lowell, Sumner, Motley, Holmes, etc.) appreciated Agassiz, as in Irmscher's words, the “Popularizer of the ice age, climber of mountain peaks, dredger of the deep seas, describer of fossil fish and jellyfish, taxonomist of turtles [who] had given America its greatest science museum…. At Harvard he assembled around him the best and brightest men of his time, thus creating, arguably, the first American graduate school.” Those are the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology and the Lawrence School of Science, and they've outlasted the taxonomy of the turtle. These days, most of Aggasiz's science has fallen by the wayside; his fossil-based classifications have not survived modern critique. Even in his day, questions of priority, plagiarism, and authorship troubled Agassiz, both in Europe and America. Irmscher renders a damning verdict on Agassiz's Oedipal rows with scientific colleagues and students: “For Agassiz, authorship did not have the connotation it has today, Whoever spent the most energy or more money publicizing an issue could claim it as his own….” I'd venture another verdict: “Agassiz's work was in the realm of publicity, not of science”—a paraphrase of F. R. Leavis on the Sitwells. But, the story gets darker. Agassiz achieved wide notoriety in three areas of biological inquiry, and he was grievously wrong in each. Based on close observation of Swiss glaciers, he claimed that one great Ice Age had extended to the equator and extinguished even the mammoths in its path. “A sudden intense winter, that was also to last for ages, fell on our globe; it spread over the very countries where these tropical animals had their homes, and so suddenly did it come on them that they were embalmed beneath masses of snow and ice, without time even for the decay which follows death” (1). Not true: glaciers of the several Ice Ages never reached Brazil, and giant mammals were creatures of the period of Ice Ages, not its victims (2). Once in America, Agassiz preached the gospel of intelligent design. He asserted that the Lord had produced each creature independently in its own geographic niche. As a leader of the anti-Darwin crusade, he was certain that “the resources of the Deity cannot be so meagre, that, in order to create a human being endowed with reason, he must change a monkey into a man” (3). Not true: see the FASEB website, “Evolution Education Resources” (4). Finally, based on close observation of black folk in Philadelphia and Charleston, he lent his “scientific” gravitas to keeping the races apart: Irmscher quotes, “It was in Philadelphia that I first found myself in prolonged contact with Negroes… they are not of the same blood as us. In seeing their black faces with their thick lips and grimacing teeth, the wool on their head, their bent knees, their elongated hands, their large curved nails, and especially the livid color of the palm of their hands, I could not take my eyes off their face in order to tell them to stay far away.” He went on to warn officials of the Sanitary Commission against miscegenation, a contamination of the white race pool with “a pint of ink.” Not true: see the second inaugural address of U.S. President Barack Hussein Obama (5). It took the Civil War to make his colleagues realize how hugely self-absorbed their Agassiz was. Agassiz had already been sufficiently “inconvenienced” by the revolutionary stirrings of 1830 in France and Switzerland and cited them as one of the reasons for his disaffection from Europe. He was therefore not about to be disturbed by such minor diversions from science as the Civil War. His student, Edward Sylvester Morse, describes the professor's reactions to Fort Sumter: April 15, Monday: Intensely exciting news this morning. All the previous news confirmed. Lincoln calls for 75,000 men. Saturday Prof [Agassiz] after lecture told us what we should do. That … we should not read the papers, etc. This morning Ordway was reading a paper and Prof said we must remember what he said on Saturday, and then went out of the room. He immediately came back and said if we did not think as he did, he should forbid every paper from coming into the building (6). In 1865, the week Lee was marching on Appomattox, Agassiz was organizing his own expedition to Brazil; its aim was to collect specimens for his taxonomy of Fishes of the New World and to marshall—yet again—evidence for an equatorial ice age. (Irmscher illustrates how important Elizabeth Agassiz was for the narrative of the trip.) The expedition turned out to be important for American science but not because of the fishes. A young William James, who had signed on as a junior Agassiz assistant, decided that field-work was not for him. Seasick, bug-ridden, and feverish during the voyage, he gave up taxonomy in the tropics and went on (via Harvard Medical School) to launch the experimental study of the mind. Irmscher appreciates that the story of “Agassiz the incorrigible racist” is a challenging one to tell. He explains clearly why Agassiz's contemporaries were untroubled by his anthropology. A good number shared Agassiz's fear of that “pint of ink”; we find examples from Lincoln, Whitman, Melville, and Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe. But, Civil War or Reconstruction, civil rights, or evolution, Agassiz remained a hero to the men who presided over The Flowering of New England. James Russell Lowell's eulogy speaks for them all: The beauty of his better self lives on In minds he touched with fire, in many an eye He trained to Truth's exact severity; He was a Teacher: why be grieved for him Whose living word still stimulates the air? In endless file shall loving scholars come The glow of his transmitted touch to share Agassiz suffered a mortal stroke in 1873, shortly after he had founded the Anderson School of Natural History on Penikese Island, a desolate little shard off Cape Cod. Its mission was to help schoolteachers gain field experience to aid in their classroom instruction. “Agassiz was a master of publicity,” writes another historian (7) “and made the first day a real show.” The show included a trip from New Bedford by steamer, a banquet, and socials for “schoolma'amy” students. Also on hand was a clutch of soon-to-be-distinguished instructors, including Alpheus Hyatt, Charles Otis Whitman, William Keith Brooks, and Cornelia Clapp. The school lasted only 1 year after Agassiz died, but its collecting trips, sea-water tables, and hands-on dissection became a model for the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole, MA, where since 1888, experimental biology has found its most congenial home. Hyatt, Clapp, Whitman, and Brooks were early leaders of the MBL: Agassiz's gift, as it were. I'd argue that the MBL remains his greatest living contribution to biology. “Study Nature, Not Books” reads the motto of Agassiz, preserved to this day on the entrance to the reading room of the library at the MBL. “Study Books, You'll Learn More” countered Eugene Bell, MIT's father of tissue engineering (1917–2007). Read Irmscher's fine book, and you will learn more about differences between turtle taxonomy and experimental biology."

However, in face- and house-selective areas, the neural responses evoked by ipsilateral stimuli in the peripheral visual field remain unclear. In this study, we displayed face and house images using a wide-view visual presentation system while performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The face-selective areas (fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA)) exhibited intense neural responses to ipsilaterally presented images, whereas the house-selective areas (parahippocampal place area (PPA) and transverse occipital sulcus (TOS)) exhibited substantially smaller and even negative neural responses to the ipsilaterally presented images. We also found that the category preferences of the contralateral and ipsilateral neural responses were similar. Interestingly, the face- and house-selective areas exhibited neural responses to ipsilateral images that were smaller than the responses to the contralateral images. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) was implemented to evaluate the difference between the contralateral and ipsilateral responses. The classification accuracies were much greater than those expected by chance. The classification accuracies in the FFA were smaller than those in the PPA and TOS. The closer eccentricities elicited greater classification accuracies in the PPA and TOS. We propose that these ipsilateral neural responses might be interpreted by interhemispheric communication through intrahemispheric connectivity of white matter connection and interhemispheric connectivity via the corpus callosum and occipital white matter connection. Furthermore, the PPA and TOS likely have weaker interhemispheric communication than the FFA and OFA, particularly in the peripheral visual field."

The Reasoned Action Approach was used to study the people's decisions to walk. We elicited people's salient beliefs and measured the theoretical constructs associated with this behavior.Results pointed at salient key behavioral, normative and control beliefs. In particular, perceived behavioral control appeared as an important determinant of walking and a small set of control beliefs were identified as potential targets of health communication campaigns, including (not) having someone to walk with, having work or responsibilities, or having no time.This theory-based study with a focus on end-users provides elements to inform the design of an intervention that would motivate people living with hypertension to walk on a regular basis in low-resource settings."
