https://openalex.org/W1977730097,"Linear sucrose-density gradient was used to detect and isolate typical ""C""-type viral particles in plasma of cats with spontaneous and experimentally induced leukemia. The density of the agent is similar to known murine leukemia virus (1.15 to 1.17 grams per cubic centimeter). In the electron microscope the virus showed typical ""C""-type particle morphology with various maturation stages. The maximum diameter of the mature viral particles in plasma was 115 millimicrons, a diameter slightly larger than budding particles observed in tissue. Leukemia was transmitted with cellular and cell-free inoculum after a 5-week period of latency."

Pondward migrants oriented similarly. Reorientation failed under complete cloud cover and after 7 days of darkness in an environmental chamber, but persisted in newts whose eyes were excised and in those displaced more than 27 kilometers in darkness. Both normal and blind animals compensated for displacement in sunshine. Preliminary evidence suggests that alternative light receptors in blinded animals may be associated with the optic tectum. No evidence of olfactory guidance was observed."

Cells with this abnormality were large, immature, and mononuclear and tended toward erythroblastic maturation."

Parametric observations indicate that an interspecific social attachment develops during the initial hours of cohabitation. The later social interaction patterns of the dogs were influenced, but not irrevocably fixed, by the early cross-specific rearing experience."

https://openalex.org/W1997214675,As judged by perfusion of isolated organs an antihemophilic factor is produced in the liver and the spleen. Perfusates (from hemophiliacs) that are deficient in the human anti-hemophilic factor stimulate production of the factor during perfusion. Apparently there is an antihemophilic-factor-stimulating substance in the plasma of hemophiliacs. The data suggest that splenic homotransplantation might alleviate the symptoms of hemophilia.

A markedly impaired reactive cell proliferation was revealed in the spleens of the vaccine-pretreated mice after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin or Freund's complete adjuvant."

https://openalex.org/W2084236952,"THE anomaloscope is used to diagnose red and green colour blindness and its four or six sub-types. In the apparatus the lower half of a circular plane is illuminated by a yellow light of wavelength 589 mµ, and in the upper half red (670 mµ) and green light (546 mµ) are mixed. It is possible, by changing the proportion of red and green illumination, to make the two halves look the same; the proportion of red and green lights required is called the Rayleigh equation, which is accepted by individuals with normal colour vision, but colour blind people react in different ways. On the anomaloscope which I used (model II, Schmidt and Haensch, Berlin) it is possible to change the wavelength of the monochromatic yellow light to make it more and more yellow green, or more and more orange, while the red and green lights are shifted in a similar manner. Rayleigh equations can be found for these wavelengths. I have built up a system of nine equations with the yellow light varying from 574 mµ to 603 mµ."

https://openalex.org/W1995489325,"A new space-voltage clamped giant (500 to 900 microns) axon preparation is described (Myxicola infundibulum). Normal value for resting and action potentials are 71 and 89 millivolts, respectively. This preparation under voltage clamp exhibits relations between current and voltage like those described for the squid axon. The early inward current component is reduced in a solution with low sodium concentration. This preparation, then, acts in all its essential features like the squid giant axon. Myxicola, however, can be made available the year around and should prove to be an extremely useful preparation for the study of excitable membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1992426226,"Study of several new types of fungitoxic derivatives of imidazole reveals that imidazoles substituted on the imine nitrogen atom are likely to be active if the substituent is electron-attracting, and if the atom connecting it to the imidazolyl moiety has tetrahedral geometry. Fungitoxicity is high with phosphinamidothionate and triarylmethyl groups as substituents. The presence of an asymmetric phosphorus atom in the substituent has no effect on fungitoxicity, but affects mammalian toxicity."

The transforming activity of the virus was more pronounced in culture medium containing 0.1 millimolar CaCl(2), a lower concentration than that usually used. The transformed hamster cells were tumorigenic in hamsters."

https://openalex.org/W2030452929,"THE trypanosomes belonging to the Trypanosoma brucei group (agents of sleeping sickness and nagana) exist in the blood of the host in three main morphological forms—long thin, intermediate and short stumpy. When these are taken up by the tsetse fly they undergo developmental changes, namely trypanosome, crithridial and metacyclic forms, the last being infective to the vertebrate host. There is controversy about which forms are infective to the fly, the long thin, the short stumpy or both."

This association has led to major achievements in science and engineering, and has strengthened both national security and the national academic research base. Those who would make sweeping changes in this successfully evolving pattern should consider the whole case, all of the consequences for the country, from the many points of view. The issues must be tested in the larger context of all support to academic research, and the entire range of national groups and goals."
