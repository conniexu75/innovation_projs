https://openalex.org/W1972565428,"Observations of 20 asteroids in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter provide information about the nature of these objects' surfaces at centimeter-to-kilometer scales. At least one asteroid (Pallas) is extremely smooth at centimeter-to-meter scales. Each asteroid appears much rougher than the Moon at some scale between several meters and many kilometers. The range of asteroid radar albedos is very broad and implies substantial variations in porosity or metal concentration (or both). The highest albedo estimate, for the asteroid Psyche, is consistent with a surface having porosities typical of lunar soil and a composition nearly entirely metallic."

Aluminum is an important constituent because of its toxicity to some fish species. The results indicate that aluminum concentrations during this period were not in equilibrium with a readily formed mineral phase, as has been assumed, and that the increase in aluminum concentration due to episodic depressions in pH lessened during the snowmelt. It is hypothesized that this temporal variation is caused by the depletion of a slowly forming, labile pool of aluminum in the soil."

I. du Pont de Nemours and industrial research generally. At the same time, Carothers's many publications helped establish the foundations of polymer science. A theoretical organic chemist, he left Harvard University to take part in Du Pont's new fundamental research program. Although founded on the academic model, it soon began to reflect its industrial setting. Some surprising experimental results, the research philosophy of a new research director, and the economic realities of the Great Depression pushed Du Pont's pure scientists toward more practical or mission-oriented goals. Nylon and neoprene emerged from this creative tension between chemists interested in science and management committed to innovation."

The recent use of established and productive archeological surface survey techniques along natural corridors of communication between favorable niches for cultural development within the Central Mexican symbiotic region resulted in the location of sites that indicate an early development of a decentralized resource exploitation, manufacturing, and exchange network. The association of the development of this system with Teotihuacán indicates the importance such nonsubsistence production and exchange had in the evolution of this first central Mexican civilization. The later expansion of Teotihuacán into more distant areas of Mesoamerica was based on this resource exploitation model. Later civilizations centered at Tula and Tenochtitlán also used such a model in their expansion."

Oceanic and estuarine circulation processes dilute and transport the particles by a natural dispersal system that also tends to be highly distributive; particle-associated pollutants apparently seek the same sinks in the Hudson River shelf valley and intracoastal weltlands, regardless of their point of introduction."

https://openalex.org/W1996437296,"The amount of smoke that may be produced by wildland or rural fires as a consequence of a large-scale nuclear exchange is estimated. The calculation is based on a compilation of rural military facilities, identified from a wide variety of unclassified sources, together with data on their geographic positions, surrounding vegetation (fuel), and weather conditions. The ignition area (corrected for fuel moisture) and the amount of fire spread are used to calculate the smoke production. The results show a substantially lower estimated smoke production (from wildland fires) than in earlier ""nuclear winter"" studies. The amount varies seasonally and at its peak is less by an order of magnitude than the estimated threshold level necessary for a major attenuation of solar radiation."

https://openalex.org/W117850629,"In response to an earlier article by L. J. Carter, T. S. Wyman (Chevron Shipp. Co.) indicated that proper operation of the segregated ballast tank (SBT) system would require heavy reliance on vessel personnel to prevent pollution. Routine washing of cargo tanks on ballast voyages after cargo has been discharged and periodic ballasting of cargo tanks especially during heavy weather would create a potential for marine pollution with SBT's. On the other hand, crude oil washing conducted in port under close supervision avoids this possibility of marine pollution. However, according to A. McKenzie (Tanker Advisory Cent. Inc.), the U.S. tanker industry requires firm government action to establish standards for tanker construction and operation that are considerably more effective than those presently in force. The U.S. should unilaterally pass legislation to, e.g., stop using water in the cargo tanks of tankers for washing and ballasting, retrofit existing tankers with SBT's and require new tankers to have double-hull segregated ballast systems. Other maritime nations will quickly adopt these actions."
